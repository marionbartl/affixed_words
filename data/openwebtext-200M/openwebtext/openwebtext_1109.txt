What is the Family ?
It ’s the most well - connected religious organization that no one talks about .
Formed in 1935 by an itinerant preacher , Norwegian immigrant Abraham Vereide , the Family has grown into “ a veritable underground of Christ ’s men all through government , ” in the words of Family member and evangelical minister Charles Colson , the convicted Watergate conspirator .
The Washington - based group counts many prominent politicians , mostly conservative Republicans , among its flock , and several members of Congress pay $ 600 a month to rent rooms in the group ’s townhouse on C Street , near the U.S. Capitol .
There are Family “ prayer cells ” in many federal agencies , including the Pentagon and the Justice Department .
The Family tries to maintain a low profile ( see below ) , but was thrust into the headlines in recent weeks when it emerged that three politicians embroiled in sex scandals — South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , Nevada Sen. John Ensign , and former Mississippi Rep. Chip Pickering — are longtime members .
Pickering , in fact , last week was accused in court papers of having trysts with his mistress in the C Street house .
Are all members politicians ?
No .
While members include Iowa Sen.
Charles Grassley , former Secretary of State James Baker , and former Attorney General Edwin Meese , many business leaders and military officers are also involved .
“ We work with power where we can , ” Doug Coe , 81 , the group ’s leader since 1969 , said in a rare interview in 2002 , “ and build power where we can ’t . ”
The Family ’s only high - profile endeavor is the National Prayer Breakfast , at which world leaders gather each year in Washington for a morning of nondenominational worship ; but the Family always stays in the background , and many participants have no idea that the group is even involved .
What does the Family believe ?
Its theology is vague , elastic , and focused on power .
The basic precepts came to Vereide in a vision in 1935 , according to the group ’s literature .
Living in Seattle , he came to believe that union organizing in the city was communist - inspired .
Jesus appeared to him in the form of the president of U.S. Steel , who told him to gather “ key men ” — prominent businessmen and political leaders — to beat back the unions in His name .
Vereide ’s recruiting efforts spread eastward , and in 1941 he arrived in Washington , where he began cultivating friendships with powerful people and setting up prayer groups .
By then , Vereide was convinced that conventional Christianity had it backwards : Instead of ministering to the down - and - out , Jesus wanted believers to tend to the “ up - and - out ” — members of America ’s elite who lacked intimacy with Jesus .
In Vereide ’s worldview , free - market capitalism is divinely ordained , and unions and regulations are a form of blasphemy .
What about personal morality ?
It ’s not the most important consideration .
“ The people involved in this association are the worst and the best , ” Coe says .
“ Some are total despots , some are totally religious . ”
The mere fact that they are powerful means they have God ’s favor , argues Coe , citing a line from St. Paul ’s Epistle to the Romans : “ The powers that be are ordained of God . ” Scholar Jeff Sharlet , author of the authoritative book The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , explains the theology this way :
As long as the powerful develop a close relationship with Jesus , “ then they will dispense blessings to those underneath them .
It ’s a sort of trickle - down fundamentalism . ”
The theology stems from Vereide ’s belief than only “ key men ” can change the world , and only with Jesus ’ guidance will they change it for the better .
The Family believes in a “ total Jesus , ” who pervades every thought and action .
Does the Family excuse adultery and other sins ?
Not exactly , but it considers the powerful to be accountable only to God and their peers , not to their constituents or the Constitution .
Coe speaks often of the biblical King David , who slept with another man ’s wife , then ordered the cuckolded husband into battle , effectively sentencing him to death .
Yet despite his personal failings , David was one of God ’s chosen , and his reign was a blessing to the Israelites .
When Gov. Sanford invoked King David to explain why he would n’t resign over his adulterous relationship with an Argentine woman , “ you could almost hear Doug ’s voice , ” says Sharlet , who considers the Family ’s disregard for conventional morality “ potentially very dangerous , ” because it “ leads you away from accountability to the public . ”
Is the Family a threat ?
Few in Washington seem too worried .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has taken part in Family activities despite her liberal politics , and has called Coe “ a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone who wants to deepen his or her relationship with God . ”
The first President Bush called Coe an “ ambassador of faith . ”
Supporters also note that Family members helped convince President Jimmy Carter , Anwar Sadat , and Menachem Begin to call for a worldwide day of prayer to usher in the Camp David Peace Accords .
And members helped broker a 2001 peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda .
Such successes , Family members say , demonstrate the group ’s good intentions .
“ There ’s nothing sinister here , no dark secrets , ” says former Rep. Tony Hall of Ohio .
“ It ’s the exact opposite of what Washington is about . ”
Secrecy by design
Family members quickly learn that the first rule of the Family is not to talk about it .
In 1966 , Vereide , who referred to his following as an “ invisible army , ” decreed that the Family should “ submerge the institutional image ” of the group — a policy maintained by Coe .
As Coe once said in a sermon , “ the Family functions invisibly like the Mafia .
The more you can make your organization invisible , the more influence it will have . ”
Family members organize themselves into small “ cells ” that are , in the group ’s own words , “ publicly invisible and privately identifiable . ”
Coe has expressed admiration for the way such leaders as Adolf Hitler , Ho Chi Minh , and Osama bin Laden organized followers into small groups that shared a “ covenant . ”
With a covenant , he says , “ two or three people can do anything . ”
Where those leaders went wrong , he says , was in not making their covenants in Jesus ’ name .

No doubt human population growth is a major contributor to global warming , given that humans use fossil fuels to power their increasingly mechanized lifestyles .
More people means more demand for oil , gas , coal and other fuels mined or drilled from below the Earth ’s surface that , when burned , spew enough carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the atmosphere to trap warm air inside like a greenhouse .
According to the United Nations Population Fund , human population grew from 1.6 billion to 6.1 billion people during the course of the 20th century .
( Think about it :
It took all of time for population to reach 1.6 billion ; then it shot to 6.1 billion over just 100 years . )
During that time emissions of CO2 , the leading greenhouse gas , grew 12 - fold .
And with worldwide population expected to surpass nine billion over the next 50 years , environmentalists and others are worried about the ability of the planet to withstand the added load of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere and wreaking havoc on ecosystems down below .
Developed countries consume the lion ’s share of fossil fuels .
The United States , for example , contains just five percent of world population , yet contributes a quarter of total CO2 output .
But while population growth is stagnant or dropping in most developed countries ( except for the U.S. , due to immigration ) , it is rising rapidly in quickly industrializing developing nations .
According to the United Nations Population Fund , fast - growing developing countries ( like China and India ) will contribute more than half of global CO2 emissions by 2050 , leading some to wonder if all of the efforts being made to curb U.S. emissions will be erased by other countries ’ adoption of our long held over - consumptive ways .
“ Population , global warming and consumption patterns are inextricably linked in their collective global environmental impact , ” reports the Global Population and Environment Program at the non-profit Sierra Club .
“ As developing countries ’ contribution to global emissions grows , population size and growth rates will become significant factors in magnifying the impacts of global warming .
” According to the Worldwatch Institute , a nonprofit environmental think tank , the overriding challenges facing our global civilization are to curtail climate change and slow population growth .
“ Success on these two fronts would make other challenges , such as reversing the deforestation of Earth , stabilizing water tables , and protecting plant and animal diversity , much more manageable , ” reports the group .
“ If we cannot stabilize climate and we cannot stabilize population , there is not an ecosystem on Earth that we can save . ” Many population experts believe the answer lies in improving the health of women and children in developing nations .
By reducing poverty and infant mortality , increasing women ’s and girls ’ access to basic human rights ( health care , education , economic opportunity ) , educating women about birth control options and ensuring access to voluntary family planning services , women will choose to limit family size .

Debt Settlement is not for everyone and should be used as a last resort .
Debt Settlement will work if you have substantial debt with creditors .
Creditors want their money and they do not care how the get it .
Our Debt Settlement program can start to give you peace of mind as we go through the process of Debt Negotiation or Debt Arbitration with a Debt Settlement Letter that works directly with the creditor .

What is Debt Settlement ?
Debt Settlement is a way to lower your monthly payments and to eliminate your Unsecured Credit Debt .
The process of Debt Settlement is geared toward your overall Debt Reduction .
Debt Settlement is also called Debt Negotiation or Debt Arbitration .
The idea behind Debt Settlement is that your creditor will agree to settle your overall balance with us at a drastically reduced amount and then consider the balance settled or paid .
The overall objective of Debt Settlement is for you to avoid Bankruptcy .
If you file for Bankruptcy then the creditor will likely lose all money that is owed to them ( a very good reason creditors agree to work with Debt Settlement companies ) .
Bankruptcy will also put you in a bad position credit wise for many years , hurting your chances in the future of owning a home , owning or leasing a car and obtaining credit cards , causing an uphill battle when it becomes time to regain trust from creditors .
After a Bankruptcy , you will not be without paying extremely high interest rates on credit cards and loans , if you get approved down the road .
Debt Settlement arrangements can help reduce the money that you owe by 25 % to 65 % .
Debt Negotiation can be complete within 6 to 60 months .

With Debt Settlement , creditors are happy to know that they are going to receive a payment within a reasonable amount of time .
By using our Debt Settlement plan , trust is developed between you and your creditor .

Do it yourself Debt Settlement ?
Like any service or industry it is better to leave the job to the professional who does this day in and day out .
Creditors have already been in contact with you and do not want to negotiate the debt that you have acquired with them .
Debt Settlement is a process that calls for industry knowledge and the ability to converse with your creditors .
If you do chose to do your own Debt Settlement , the process will likely be more costly and take many months or years longer .
Our Debt Settlement Company settles large amounts of debt with each creditor , enabling us to get a much better deal at Debt Negotiation time .
You can trust our Debt Arbitration Department to take care of your Unsecured Debt .
Should I feel embarrassed about using Debt Settlement as a last resort ?
The answer is NO !
Most creditors make you feel like you have done something wrong .
It is the creditor ’s job to do so .
The creditor ’s main objective is to collect their money PERIOD !
They do not understand that situations and circumstances arise causing you to get behind .
Hardships make paying bills difficult if not impossible .
You could have lost your job , lost a loved one , and the list can go on .
Situations happen in our lives that are beyond our control .
Creditors are actually happy that they are going to receive payment from our Debt Negotiation Department .
Debt Settlement vs. Credit Counseling
There is a major difference between Debt Settlement & Credit Counseling .
Debt Settlement helps settle your debt with creditors by reducing the amount that you will pay them back .
Debt Settlement also reduces the amount of time it will take to become debt free .
Credit Counseling Services works for the creditor .
Simply put , Credit Counseling may only reduce your payment by a small amount and keep you paying on your debt for many years longer than if you were to be enrolled in a Debt Settlement program .
Did you know that by paying minimum payments on a credit card you can be paying for over 50 years before the balance is paid ?
Call us now and one of our Debt Settlement debt analysts can calculate how long you will be paying on your credit accounts .
As always , there is no obligation .
What Type of Debt can be settled ?
The Debt Settlement process can be used to pay off Unsecured Debt .
Unsecured Debt is Credit Card Debt , Department store Credit Cards , Gas Cards , and Medical Bills in Collection , Revolving Credit Lines , Unsecured Lines of Credit , Personal Loans and some other loans that have made it into collections .
Call now to find out if your debt qualifies for elimination through one of our Debt Settlement programs .
Debt Settlement can not be used for …
Mortgages , Auto Loans , Student Loans , or any type of government loan cannot be negotiated by a Debt Settlement Company .
In most cases the creditor can repossess , or foreclose on a home or auto loan .
Private Student Loans may be an exception .
Speak to a debt settlement specialist now for details .
Will my wages be garnished by my creditors ?
If you listen to some Debt Collectors , you might be fooled into thinking that they will seize your very next paycheck unless you make a payment right then and there .
The threat of losing part of one ’s wages to a garnishment action is truly frightening to someone already struggling financially .
This is mainly an intimidation tactic used by collectors to scare people into committing to a payment schedule whether or not they have the funds available .
Actual garnishment actions are relatively rare , and do not happen without advance warning .
First , a creditor must bring a lawsuit , obtain a judgment , and then take additional steps to obtain authorization for the garnishment .
No one can take your paycheck without court approval , and you must be given notice of such court action through formal documentation .
So do n’t be fooled by one of the oldest collection tricks in the book .
Is Debt Settlement Legal ?
Debt Settlement has been around for decades .
Debt Settlement has only become more relevant since the 1980 ’s when the banks became more accessible to lend out more money and when there has been a recession or economic collapse .
Debt Settlement is looked at in a positive light .
This gives your creditors a good impression and shows that you are making strides to pay your debts .
Who we work for ?
Many people think that when they decide to hire a Debt Settlement Company that the Debt Settlement Company works with the creditors and not the consumer .
This assumption is not correct .
We work for you .
You are our customer , the creditor is not .
First Choice Debt Resolution , LLC is the Debt Settlement Company that will work directly with you to put you on the right path to become Debt Free .

Capitalism After the Crisis
Fall 2009
The economic crisis of the past year , centered as it has been in the financial sector that lies at the heart of American capitalism , is bound to leave some lasting marks .
Financial regulation , the role of large banks , and the relationships between the government and key players in the market will never be the same .
More important , however , are the ways in which public attitudes about our system might change .
The nature of the crisis , and of the government 's response , now threaten to undermine the public 's sense of the fairness , justice , and legitimacy of democratic capitalism .
By allowing the conditions that made the crisis possible ( particularly the concentration of power in a few large institutions ) , and by responding to the crisis as we have ( especially with massive government bailouts of banks and large corporations ) , the United States today risks moving in the direction of European corporatism and the crony capitalism of more statist regimes .
This , in turn , endangers America 's unique brand of capitalism , which has thus far avoided becoming associated in the public mind with entrenched corruption , and has therefore kept this country relatively free of populist anti-capitalist sentiment .
Are such changes now beginning ?
And if so , will they mark only a temporary reaction to an extreme economic downturn , or a deeper and more damaging shift in American attitudes ?
Some early indications are not encouraging .
SOAK THE RICH
A friend of mine worked as a consultant for the now - infamous ­insurance giant American International Group .
To prevent him from starting his own hedge fund , AIG offered him a non-compete agreement : a sum of money meant to compensate him for the opportunity forgone .
It is a perfectly standard and well - regarded practice — but unfortunately for my friend , his payment under this agreement was to be made at the end of 2008 .
So he spent the early months of 2009 living in terror :
His contract was classified as one of the notorious AIG retention bonuses .
At the height of the fury against those bonuses , he received several death threats .
Though he had no legal obligation to do so , he returned the money to the company , hoping that the gesture might keep his name from being published in the papers .
In case that failed to protect him , he prepared a plan to evacuate his wife and children .
It was the responsible thing to do ; after all , angry protestors had staked out the homes of several AIG executives whose names appeared in print — and only luck had prevented someone from getting hurt .
While such extreme episodes have , fortunately , been quite rare , they are symptomatic of a broad discontent .
In one recent survey , 65 % of Americans said the government should cap executive compensation by large corporations , while 60 % wanted the government to intervene to improve the way corporations are run .
And those views hardly reflect confidence in the government :
Only 5 % of Americans in the same poll said they trust the government a lot , while 30 % said they do not trust it at all .
It is just that , at the moment , Americans trust large corporations even less :
Fewer than one out of every 30 Americans say they trust them a lot , while one of every three Americans claims not to trust large corporations at all .
These attitudes are familiar to students of public opinion in much of the world .
But they are quite unusual for the United States .
Until recently , Americans stood out for their acceptance of basic market principles and even for their tolerance of some of the negative side effects markets produce , such as marked income inequality .
Capitalism has long enjoyed exceptionally strong public support in the United States because America 's form of capitalism has long been distinct from those found elsewhere in the world — particularly because of its uniquely open and free market system .
Capitalism calls not only for freedom of enterprise , but for rules and policies that allow for freedom of entry , that facilitate access to financial resources for newcomers , and that maintain a level playing field among competitors .
The United States has generally come closest to this ideal combination — which is no small feat , since economic pressures and incentives do not naturally point to such a balance of policies .
While everyone benefits from a free and competitive market , no one in particular makes huge profits from keeping the system competitive and the playing field level .
True capitalism lacks a strong lobby .
That assertion might appear strange in light of the billions of dollars firms spend lobbying Congress in America , but that is exactly the point .
Most lobbying seeks to tilt the playing field in one direction or another , not to level it .
Most lobbying is pro-business , in the sense that it promotes the interests of existing businesses , not pro-market in the sense of fostering truly free and open competition .
Open competition forces established firms to prove their competence again and again ; strong successful market players therefore often use their muscle to restrict such competition , and to strengthen their positions .
As a result , serious tensions emerge between a pro-market agenda and a pro-business one , though American capitalism has always managed this tension far better than most .
THE AMERICAN EXCEPTION
In a recent study , Rafael Di Tella and Robert MacCulloch showed that public support for capitalism in any given country is positively associated with the perception that hard work , not luck , determines success , and is negatively correlated with the perception of corruption .
These correlations go a long way toward explaining public support for ​­America 's capitalist system .
According to one recent study , only 40 % of Americans think that luck rather than hard work plays a major role in income differences .
Compare that with the 75 % of Brazilians who think that income disparities are mostly a matter of luck , or the 66 % of Danes and 54 % of Germans who do , and you begin to get a sense of why American attitudes toward the free - market system stand out .
Some scholars argue that this perception of capitalism 's legitimacy is merely the result of a successful propaganda campaign for the American Dream — a myth embedded in American culture , but not necessarily tied to reality .
And it is true that the data yield scant evidence that social mobility is higher across the board in the United States than in other developed countries .
But while this difference does not show up in the aggregate statistics , it is powerfully present at the top of the distribution — which often gets the most attention , and most shapes people 's attitudes .
Even before the internet boom created many young billionaires , in 1996 , one in four billionaires in the United States could be described as " self - made " — compared to just one out of ten in Germany .
And the wealthiest self - made American billionaires — from Bill Gates and Michael Dell to Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg — have made their fortunes in competitive businesses , with little or no government interference or help .
The same cannot be said for most other countries , where the wealthiest people tend to accumulate their fortunes in regulated businesses in which government connections are crucial to success .
Think about the oligarchs in Russia , Silvio Berlusconi in Italy , Carlos Slim in Mexico , and even the biggest tycoons in Hong Kong .
They made their fortunes in businesses that are highly dependent on governmental concessions : energy , real estate , telecommunications , mining .
Success in these businesses often depends more on having the right connections than on having initiative and enterprise .
In most of the world , the best way to make money is not to come up with brilliant ideas and work hard at implementing them , but to cultivate a government connection .
Such cronyism is bound to shape public attitudes about a country 's economic system .
When asked in a recent study to name the most important determinants of financial success , Italian managers put " knowledge of influential people " in first place ( 80 % considered it " important " or " very important " ) .
" Competence and experience " ranked fifth , behind characteristics such as " loyalty and obedience . "
These divergent paths to prosperity reveal more than a difference of perception .
American capitalism really is quite distinct from its European counterparts , for reasons that reach deep into history .
THE ROOTS OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM
In America , unlike much of the rest of the West , democracy predates industrialization .
By the time of the Second Industrial Revolution in the latter part of the 19th century , the United States had already enjoyed several decades of universal ( male ) suffrage , and several decades of widespread education .
This created a public with high expectations , unlikely to tolerate evident unfairness in economic policy .
It is no coincidence that the very concept of anti-trust law — a pro-market but sometimes anti-business idea — was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th .
It is also no coincidence that in the early part of the 20th century , fueled by an inquisitive press and a populist ( but not anti-market ) political movement , the United States experienced a rise in regulation aimed at reducing the power of big business .
Unlike in Europe — where the most vibrant opposition to the excesses of business came from socialist anti-market movements — in the United States this opposition was squarely pro-market .
When Louis Brandeis attacked the money trust , he was not fundamentally trying to interfere with markets — only trying to make them work better .
As a result , Americans have long understood that the interests of the market and the interests of business may not always be aligned .
American capitalism also developed at a time when government involvement in the economy was quite weak .
At the beginning of the 20th century , when modern American capitalism was taking shape , U.S. government spending was only 6.8 % of gross domestic product .
After World War II , when modern capitalism really took shape in Western European countries , government spending in those countries was , on average , 30 % of GDP .
Until World War I , the United States had a tiny federal government compared to national governments in other countries .
This was due in part to the fact that the U.S. faced no significant military threat to its existence , which allowed the government to spend a relatively small proportion of its budget on the military .
The federalist nature of the American regime also did its part to limit the size of the national government .
When the government is small and relatively weak , the way to make money is to start a successful private - sector business .
But the larger the size and scope of government spending , the easier it is to make money by diverting public resources .
Starting a business is difficult and involves a lot of risk — but getting a government favor or contract is easier , and a much safer bet .
And so in nations with large and powerful governments , the state tends to find itself at the heart of the economic system , even if that system is relatively capitalist .
This tends to confound politics and economics , both in practice and in public perceptions :
The larger the share of capitalists who acquire their wealth thanks to their political connections , the greater the perception that capitalism is unfair and corrupt .
Another distinguishing feature of American capitalism is that it developed relatively untouched by foreign influence .
Although European ( and especially British ) capital played a significant role in America 's 19th - and early 20th - century economic development , Europe 's economies were not more developed than America 's — and so while European capitalists could invest in or compete with American companies , they could not dominate the system .
As a result , American capitalism developed more or less organically , and still shows the marks of those origins .
The American bankruptcy code , for instance , exhibits significant pro-debtor biases , because the United States was born and developed as a nation of debtors .
The situation is very different in nations that developed capitalist economies after World War II .
These countries ( in non-Soviet - bloc continental Europe , parts of Asia , and much of Latin America ) industrialized under the giant shadow of American power .
In this development process , the local elites felt threatened by the prospect of economic colonization by American companies that were far more efficient and better capitalized .
To protect themselves , they purposely built a ­non- transparent system in which local connections were important , because this gave them an inherent advantage .
These structures have proven resilient in the decades since :
Once economic and political systems are built to reward relationships instead of efficiency , it is very difficult to reform them , since the people in power are the ones who would lose most in the change .
Finally , the United States was able to develop a pro-market agenda distinct from a pro-business agenda because it was largely spared the direct influence of Marxism .
It is possible that the type of capitalism the United States developed is the cause , as much as the effect , of the absence of strong Marxist movements in this country .
But either way , this distinction from other Western regimes was significant in the development of American attitudes toward economics .
In countries with prominent and influential Marxist parties , pro-market and pro-business forces were compelled to merge to fight the common enemy .
If one faces the prospect of nationalization ( i.e. , the control of resources by a small political elite ) , even relationship capitalism ( which involves control of those resources by a small business elite ) becomes an appealing alternative .
As a result , many of these countries could not develop a more competitive and open form of capitalism because they could not afford to divide the opposition to Marxism .
Worse , the free - market banner was completely appropriated by the pro-business forces , which were better equipped and better fed .
Paradoxically , as the appeal of Marxist ideas faded , this problem in many of these countries became worse , not better .
After decades of contiguity and capture , the pro-market forces could not separate themselves from the pro-business camp .
Having lost the ideological opposition of Marxism and lacking any opposition from pro-market ideology , pro-business forces ruled unchecked .
In no country is this more evident than in Italy , where the pro-market movement today is almost literally owned by a businessman , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who often seems to run the country in the interest of his media empire .
For all these reasons , the United States developed a system of capitalism that comes closer than any other to the ideal combination of economic freedom and open competition .
The image many Americans have of capitalism is therefore that of Horatio Alger 's rags - to - riches - via - hard - work stories , which have come to define the American Dream .
By contrast , in most of the rest of the world , Horatio Alger is unknown — and the image of social mobility is dominated by Cinderella or Evita stories : fantasies more than plausible dreams .
This understanding of opportunity has helped make capitalism popular and secure in the United States .
But because the free - market system relies on this public support , and this support depends to a certain extent on the public 's impression that the system is fair , any erosion of that impression threatens the system itself .
Such erosion occurs when government connections , or the power of entrenched incumbents in the market , seem to overtake genuine free and fair competition as the paths to wealth and success .
Both government and big business have strong incentives to push the system in this direction , and therefore both , if left unchecked , pose a threat to America 's distinctive form of capitalism .
Although the United States has the great advantage of having started from a superior model of capitalism and having developed an ideology to support it , our system is still vulnerable to these pressures — and not only in a crisis .
Even the most persuasive and resilient ideology cannot long outlive the conditions and reasoning that generated it .
American capitalism needs vocal defenders who understand the threats it faces — and who can make its case to the public .
But in the last 30 years , as the threat of global communism has waned and disappeared , capitalism 's defenders have grown fewer , while the temptations of corporatism have grown greater .
This has helped set the stage for the crisis we now face — and left us less able to discern how we might recover from it .
THE DEMISE OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM
A healthy financial system is crucial to any working market economy .
Widespread access to finance is essential to harnessing the best talents and allowing them to prosper and grow .
It is crucial for drawing new entrants into the system , and for fostering competition .
The system that allocates finance allocates power and rents ; if that system is not fair , there is little hope that the rest of the economy can be .
And the potential for unfairness or abuse in the financial system is always great .
Americans have long been sensitive to such abuse .
While we have historically avoided general anti-capitalist biases , Americans have nonetheless nurtured something of a populist anti-finance bias .
This bias has led to many political decisions throughout American history that were inefficient from an economic point of view , but helped preserve the long - term health of America 's democratic capitalism .
In the late 1830s , President Andrew Jackson opposed renewing the charter of the Second Bank of the United States — a move that contributed to the panic of 1837 — because he saw the bank as an instrument of political corruption and a threat to American liberties .
An investigation he initiated established " beyond question that this great and powerful institution had been actively engaged in attempting to influence the elections of the public officers by means of its money . "
Throughout much of American history , state bank regulations were driven by concerns about the power of New York banks over the rest of the country , and the fear that big banks drained deposits from the countryside in order to redirect them to the cities .
To address these fears , states introduced a variety of restrictions : from unit banking ( banks could have only one office ) , to limits on intrastate branching ( banks from northern Illinois could not open branches in southern Illinois ) , to limits on interstate branching ( New York banks could not open branches in other states ) .
From a purely economic point of view , all of these restrictions were crazy .
They forced a reinvestment of deposits in the same areas where they were collected , badly distorting the allocation of funds .
And by preventing banks from expanding , these regulations made banks less diversified and thus more prone to failure .
Nevertheless , these policies had a positive side effect :
They splintered the banking sector , reducing its political power and in so doing creating the preconditions for a vibrant securities market .
Even the separation between investment banking and commercial banking introduced by the New Deal 's Glass - Steagall Act was a product of this longstanding American tradition .
Unlike many other banking regulations , Glass - Steagall at least had an economic rationale : to prevent commercial banks from exploiting their depositors by dumping on them the bonds of firms to which the banks had lent money , but which could not repay the loans .
The Glass - Steagall
Act 's biggest consequence , though , was the fragmentation it caused — which helped reduce the concentration of the banking industry and , by creating divergent interests in different parts of the financial sector , helped reduce its political power .
In the last three decades , these arrangements were completely overturned , starting with the progressive deregulation of the banking sector .
The restrictions imposed by state regulations were highly inefficient to begin with , but over the years technological and financial progress made them absolutely untenable .
What good does it do to restrict branching when banks can set up ATMs throughout the country ?
How effectively can a prohibition on intrastate branching block the redistribution of deposits , when non-integrated banks can reallocate them through the interbank market ?
So starting in the late 1970s , state bank regulations were relaxed or eliminated , increasing the efficiency of the banking sector and fostering economic growth .
But the move also increased concentration .
In 1980 , there were 14,434 banks in the United States , about the same number as in 1934 .
By 1990 , this number had dropped to 12,347 ; by 2000 , to 8,315 .
In 2009 , the number stands below 7,100 .
Most important , the concentration of deposits and lending grew significantly .
In 1984 , the top five U.S. banks controlled only 9 % of the total deposits in the banking sector .
By 2001 , this percentage had increased to 21 % , and by the end of 2008 , close to 40 % .
The apex of this process was the 1999 passage of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which repealed the restrictions imposed by Glass - Steagall .
Gramm - Leach - Bliley has been wrongly accused of playing a major role in the current financial crisis ; in fact , it had little to nothing to do with it .
The major institutions that failed or were bailed out in the last two years were pure investment banks — such as Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch — that did not take advantage of the repeal of Glass - Steagall ; or they were pure commercial banks , like Wachovia and Washington Mutual .
The only exception is Citigroup , which had merged its commercial and investment operations even before the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , thanks to a special exemption .
The real effect of Gramm - Leach - Bliley was political , not directly economic .
Under the old regime , commercial banks , investment banks , and insurance companies had different agendas , and so their lobbying efforts tended to offset one another .
But after the restrictions were lifted , the interests of all the major players in the financial industry became aligned , giving the industry disproportionate power in shaping the political agenda .
The concentration of the banking industry only added to this power .
The last and most important source of the finance industry 's growing power was its profitability , at least on the books .
In the 1960s , the share of GDP produced by the finance sector amounted to a little more than 3 % .
By the mid-2000s , it was more than 8 % .
This expansion was driven by a rapid increase not only in profits , but also in wages .
In 1980 , the relative wage of a worker in the finance sector was roughly comparable to the wages of other workers with the same qualifications in other sectors .
By 2007 , the person in the finance sector was making 70 % more .
Every attempt to explain this gap using differences in abilities , or the inherent demands of the work , falls short .
People working in finance were simply making significantly more than everybody else .
This enormous profitability allowed the industry to spend disproportionate amounts of money lobbying the political system .
In the last 20 years , the financial industry has made $ 2.2 billion in political contributions , more than any other industry tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics .
And over the last ten years , the financial industry topped the lobbying - expenses list , spending $ 3.5 billion .
The explosion of wages and profits in finance also naturally attracted the best talents — with implications that extended beyond the financial sector , and deep into government .
Thirty years ago , the brightest undergraduates were going into science , technology , law , and business ; for the last 20 years , they have gone to finance .
Having devoted themselves to this sector , these talented individuals inevitably end up working to advance its interests :
A person specialized in derivative trading is likely to be terribly impressed with the importance and value of derivatives , just as a nuclear engineer is likely to think nuclear power can solve all the world 's problems .
And if most of the political elite were picked from among nuclear engineers , it would be only natural that the country would soon fill with nuclear plants .
In fact , we have an example of precisely this scenario in France , where for complicated cultural reasons an unusually large portion of the political elite is trained in engineering at the École Polytechnique — and France derives more of its energy from nuclear power than any other nation .
A similar effect is evident with finance in America .
The proportion of people with training and experience in finance working at the highest levels of every recent presidential administration is extraordinary .
Four of the last six secretaries of Treasury fit this description .
In fact , all four were directly or indirectly connected to one firm : Goldman Sachs .
This is hardly the historical norm ; of the previous six Treasury secretaries , only one had a finance background .
And finance - trained executives staff not only the Treasury but many senior White House posts and key positions in numerous other departments .
President Barack Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , once worked for an investment bank , as did his predecessor under President George W. Bush , Joshua Bolten .
There is nothing intrinsically bad about these developments .
In fact , it is only natural that a government in search of the brightest people will end up poaching from the finance world , to which the best and brightest have flocked .
The problem is that people who have spent their entire lives in finance have an understandable tendency to think that the interests of their industry and the interests of the country always coincide .
When Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson went to Congress last fall arguing that the world as we knew it would end if Congress did not approve the $ 700 billion bailout , he was serious and speaking in good faith .
And to an extent he was right :
His world — the world he lived and worked in — would have ended had there not been a bailout .
Goldman Sachs would have gone bankrupt , and the repercussions for everyone he knew would have been enormous .
But Henry Paulson 's world is not the world most Americans live in — or even the world in which our economy as a whole exists .
Whether that world would have ended without Congress 's bailout was a far more debatable proposition ; unfortunately , that debate never took place .
Compounding the problem is the fact that people in government tend to rely on their networks of trusted friends to gather information " from the outside . "
If everyone in those networks is drawn from the same milieu , the information and ideas that flow to policymakers will be severely limited .
A revealing anecdote comes from a Bush Treasury official , who noted that in the heat of the financial crisis , every time there was a phone call from Manhattan 's 212 area code , the message was the same : " Buy the toxic assets . "
Such uniformity of advice makes it difficult for even the most intelligent or well - meaning policymakers to arrive at the right decisions .
THE VICIOUS CYCLE
The finance sector 's increasing concentration and growing political muscle have undermined the traditional American understanding of the difference between free markets and big business .
This means not only that the interests of finance now dominate the economic understanding of policymakers , but also — and perhaps more important — that the public 's perception of the economic system 's legitimacy is at risk .
If the free - market system is politically fragile , its most fragile component is precisely the financial industry .
It is so fragile because it relies entirely on the sanctity of contracts and the rule of law , and that sanctity cannot be preserved without broad popular support .
When people are angry to the point of threatening the lives of bankers ; when the majority of Americans are demanding government intervention not only to regulate the financial industry but to control the way companies are run ; when voters lose confidence in the economic system because they perceive it as fundamentally corrupt — then the sanctity of private property becomes threatened as well .
And when property rights are not protected , the survival of an effective financial sector , and with it a thriving economy , is in doubt .
The government 's involvement in the financial sector in the wake of the crisis — and particularly the bailouts of large banks and other institutions — has exacerbated this problem .
Public mistrust of government has combined with mistrust of bankers , and concerns about the waste of taxpayer dollars have been joined to worries about rewarding those who caused the mess on Wall Street .
In response , politicians have tried to save themselves by turning against the finance sector with a vengeance .
That the House of Representatives approved a proposal to retroactively tax 90 % of all bonuses paid by financial institutions receiving TARP money shows how dangerous this combination of backlash and demagoguery can be .
Fortunately , that particular proposal never became law .
But the anti-finance climate that produced it greatly contributed , for instance , to the expropriation of Chrysler 's secured creditors this spring .
By singling out and publicly condemning the Chrysler creditors who demanded that their contractual rights be respected , President Obama effectively exploited public resentment to reduce the government 's costs in the Chrysler bailout .
But the cost - cutting came at the expense of current investors , and sent a signal to all potential future investors .
While Obama 's approach was convenient in the short term , it could prove devastating to the market system over time :
The protection afforded to secured creditors is crucial in making credit available to firms in financial distress and even in Chapter 11 .
The Chrysler precedent will jeopardize access to such financing in the future , particularly for the firms most in need , and so will increase the pressure for yet more government involvement .
The pattern that has taken hold in the wake of the financial crisis thus threatens to initiate a vicious cycle .
To avoid being linked in the public mind with the companies they are working to help , politicians take part in and encourage the assault on finance ; this scares off legitimate investors , no longer certain they can count on contracts and the rule of law .
And this , in turn , leaves little recourse for troubled businesses but to seek government assistance .
It is no coincidence that shortly after bashing Wall Street executives for their greed , the administration set up the most generous form of subsidy ever invented for Wall Street .
The Public - Private Investment Program , announced in March by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , provides $ 84 of government - subsidized loans and $ 7 of government equity for every $ 7 of private equity invested in the purchase of toxic assets .
The terms are so generous that the private investors essentially receive a subsidy of $ 2 for every dollar they put in .
If these terms are " justified " by the uncertainty stemming from the populist backlash , they also exacerbate the conditions that generated the backlash in the first place — confirming the sense that government and large market players are cooperating at the expense of the taxpayer and the small investor .
If the Public - Private Investment Program works , the very people who created the problem stand to grow fabulously rich with government help — which will surely do no good for the public 's impression of American capitalism .
This is just the unhealthy cycle in which capitalism is trapped in most countries around the world .
On one hand , entrepreneurs and financiers feel threatened by public hostility , and thus justified in seeking special privileges from the government .
On the other hand , ordinary citizens feel outraged by the privileges the entrepreneurs and financiers receive , inflaming that very hostility .
For anyone acquainted with the character of capitalism around the world , this moment in America feels eerily familiar .
THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM
We thus stand at a crossroads for American capitalism .
One path would channel popular rage into political support for some genuinely pro-market reforms , even if they do not serve the interests of large financial firms .
By appealing to the best of the populist tradition , we can introduce limits to the power of the financial industry — or any business , for that matter — and restore those fundamental principles that give an ethical dimension to capitalism : freedom , meritocracy , a direct link between reward and effort , and a sense of responsibility that ensures that those who reap the gains also bear the losses .
This would mean abandoning the notion that any firm is too big to fail , and putting rules in place that keep large financial firms from manipulating government connections to the detriment of markets .
It would mean adopting a pro-market , rather than pro-business , approach to the economy .
The alternative path is to soothe the popular rage with measures like limits on executive bonuses while shoring up the position of the largest financial players , making them dependent on government and making the larger economy dependent on them .
Such measures play to the crowd in the moment , but threaten the financial system and the public standing of American capitalism in the long run .
They also reinforce the very practices that caused the crisis .
This is the path to big - business capitalism : a path that blurs the distinction between pro-market and pro-business policies , and so imperils the unique faith the American people have long displayed in the legitimacy of democratic capitalism .
Unfortunately , it looks for now like the Obama administration has chosen this latter path .
It is a choice that threatens to launch us on that vicious spiral of more public resentment and more corporatist crony capitalism so common abroad — trampling in the process the economic exceptionalism that has been so crucial for American prosperity .
When the dust has cleared and the panic has abated , this may well turn out to be the most serious and damaging consequence of the financial crisis for American capitalism .
Words in the mental cupboard A US web monitoring firm has declared the millionth English word to be Web 2.0 , a term for the latest generation of web products and services .
Global Language Monitor ( GLM ) searches the internet for newly coined terms , and once a word or phrase has been used 25,000 times , it recognises it .
GLM said Web 2.0 beat out the terms Jai ho , N00b and slumdog to take top spot .
However , traditional dictionary makers are casting doubt on the claim and the methods behind it .
GLM , based in Texas , makes its money telling organisations how often they are mentioned in new media , such as the internet , but it can also track new words and expressions .
Once a word has been used 25,000 times on social networking and other sites , GLM declares it be a new word .
The terms Jai ho and slumdog originate from the hit movie Slumdog Millionaire , about India 's slum dwellers .
But N00b comes from the gaming community , the company said , explaining that it is used as a disparaging term to describe a neophyte in a particular game .
It is also the " only mainstream English word that contains within itself two numerals " , GLM said in a statement posted on its website .
Landmark doubted However lexicographers doubt GLM 's claim , says BBC arts correspondent Lawrence Pollard .

More from Today programme Dictionaries have tighter criteria about what constitutes a new word .
For example , it has to be used over a certain period of time .
Lexicographers say the exact size of the English vocabulary is impossible to quantify , but if every technical term or obscure specialist word is accepted then we are already beyond one million , according to our correspondent .
And if the inclusion of specialist slang is restricted , then there are possibly three quarters of a million words in English .
All of which is way beyond the 20 - 40,000 words a fluent speaker would use , or the few thousand you could get by with in English .
But with 1.5 billion people speaking some version of English , it is small wonder it is the fastest growing language in the world , our correspondent adds .

( The Frisky ) -- I remember being a little girl and hearing my mother use the term " soul mates . "
" What is ' soul mates ' ? " I asked .
" It 's beshert , " she said .
" Be -what ? "
" It 's meant to be , " she explained .
Beshert is a Yiddish term that expresses how soul mates are " meant to be together . "
Building on my family 's unwavering faith in this beshert thingy -- my parents met when they were 17 and my grandparents when they were 16 -- I assumed that I , too , would be welcomed into the warm , loving arms of this soul mate phenomenon .
I vowed to keep my eyes peeled for my one and only perfect , dream lover -- the man who would sweep me off my feet and love me as no one else ever had , my soul mate .
The Frisky --
Why you should always trust your gut
When I was 13 , I thought my first boyfriend Jeremy , the guitar - strumming pothead , was my soul mate .
" Run away with me and let 's get married , dude , " he pleaded during one of our marathon phone conversations .
" But I do n't have a ride to your place , " I said .
When he cheated on me later that month with a girl that lived in his neighborhood , I knew he was NOT " the one . "
The Frisky -- How NOT to settle in a relationship
When I was 15 , I was sure my soul mate was Rob , the artist with the Doc Martens and the Sonic Youth t- shirt .
At 19 , I was betting it was John , the intellectual DJ who could quote Foucault and Wu - Tang Clan all in one breath .
By 22 , I was fairly certain it was my long - term , live - in boyfriend Jeff , until I unexpectedly met and fell in love with Jason when I was 25 .
This time I was positive that Jason was " the one . "
Jason and I were laying in bed one night and he turned to me clearly panicked and asked , " You seem so sure about us , how do you know it 's meant to be ? "
" Beshert , " I said confidently .
Two weeks later , he dumped me .
OK ... screw beshert .
It was around this time that I started to get a hunch that this whole " soul mate " thing may be a bunch of bull .
Maybe all that I was " meant to be " was " alone forever . "
The thought terrified me , but even with my doubts , I chose to keep the faith that " the one " was coming .
In the next few years , at least five more possible soul mates came and went -- there was something just not quite " right " enough about all of them and I was unwilling to settle -- before it finally dawned on me .
There 's no perfect guy coming to sweep me off my feet , in fact there is not just ONE right guy for me , there are potentially many !
And more importantly , holding out for a soul mate may have actually prevented me from finding true love .
Crap !
The Frisky : Enough with the princess fairytales !
I 'm not the only one who had been buying into this soul mate thing -- so were most of my single friends , also a few of my married friends , Jillian Harris on " The Bachelorette , " and , according to a shocking study in 2001 , 94 percent of unmarried , single people between the ages of 20 and 29 also believe this malarkey !
Whoa ... so it 's like the whole single world thinks that love is flat when really it 's round ?
Writer Scott M. Stanley calls this phenomenon soul - mate - ism :
" [ The belief that you will ] find in a mate the one unique person on the planet who understands your deepest desires and fears , accepts all of who you are unconditionally and who becomes joined to you , making one complete whole in mind , body and soul .
The power of this type of relationship is so great that you will know fully and rapidly when you find ' the one . ' "
Think " Jerry Maguire " and just about every other romantic comedy or love story on the planet .
Stanley claims that suffering from soul - mate - ism may leave you constantly unhappy because of impossible expectations of being loved perfectly by this mythological person .
Um , this is sounding kind of familiar .
As an antidote to soul - mate - ism , Stanley advocates commitment .
" It is deep commitment between two partners for life that makes it possible to have a profound connection . "
Whoa ... kind of revolutionary .
The Frisky --
What 's your boyfriend or husband criteria ?
So what do I do now ?
Clearly , I should throw in the towel with the soul mate search , take the next decent dude I meet , and commit myself to him for life .
Wait , but would n't that be settling ?
It 's all so profoundly confusing I hardly know what to believe anymore .
The Frisky --
Why you should probably avoid getting back together with an ex
But no matter what anyone says , I still refuse to believe that love lacks some measure of magic .
I still think that there are no coincidences in life and that miraculous things happen all the time and that things are meant to be -- good or bad .
Fingers crossed that lasting love ( with a totally imperfect guy ) is one of them for me .
And even though I do n't like to admit it , there is a small , secret part of my heart that still skips a beat when I see a guy on the subway , or one sitting across from me at a coffee shop and I feel a spark of recognition between us and imagine the possibilities .
A foolish , little voice inside of me whispers , " beshert . "

This latest stable release include several bug fixes , including fixes for service and host check scheduling and availability reporting .
FYI , “ Nagios Core ” is the new name for the monitoring daemon / web interface that used to be known simply as “ Nagios ” .
Nothing material other than the name has changed at this point .
But Dmitry Gaev , the head of the Moscow metro , says the criticism is misplaced .
The station is a listed architectural monument and the idea , he says , was only to restore it to its original glory .
Nor , he adds , was a statue to Stalin that originally stood in the station put back .
That though is because it has been lost rather than down to any historical sensitivity .
Vets who examined Mr Bumble are not sure whether he has been de-scented An overweight skunk from Somerset , whose main diet was bacon sandwiches , has been given a new home and put on a strict diet .
The owners of Mr Bumble the skunk handed him over to the RSPCA when they realised they could not look after him .
The creature is now being cared for at the Tropiquaria animal park at Washford Cross , near Watchet .
Park owner Chris Noisier said Mr Bumble weighed one stone ( 6.8 kg ) and needed to lose 5 - 6 lb ( 2.2-2.7kg ) .
' Vegetarian option ' Mr Noisier said : " We 're now working on dieting him down to what he should be .
Clearly bacon butties are not a normal part of a skunk 's diet in the wild .
" We 're putting him on the vegetarian option at the moment .
It 's very much like a human weight watching issue .
" He is getting to meet lots of new people so there 's lots going on in his life and I suspect it 's making up for the lack of his old favourite food . "
In the wild , skunks ' natural diet would include carrion , insects , mice and a variety of greenery .
Chris Noisier said Mr Bumble was currently being fed on a vegetable high - fibre , low - energy diet consisting of greens and melon .
Scent glands
He is also taken for two 30 - minute walks each day on a lead .
Skunks are native to North America , but have become popular as house pets in the UK .
A number of skunks have been abandoned recently since a new law banned the removal of their scent glands .
Two vets have examined Mr Bumble and neither can be sure whether he has been de-scented .

The tree of prelife has two roots , 0 and 1 , and infinitely many lineages .
The perfect prelife catalyst is a string that enhances the rates of all chemical reactions in its own lineage ( as shown in red for the string 0100 ) .
Partial catalysis occurs if a string catalyses some reactions in its own lineage ( as shown in blue for the string 1000 ) .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Life 's ability to replicate itself is essential for evolution , yet even the simplest kind of replication requires a relatively complex system .
So what kind of non-replicating system might have served as the predecessor of evolution , paving the way for life as we know it ?
The answer , according to a recent study , is a kind of " prelife " -- a chemical system that can lead to information and diversity , and that is capable of selection and mutation , but does not yet have the ability to self - replicate .
In their study , Hisashi Ohtsuki of the Japan Science and Technology Agency and the Tokyo Institute of Technology , along with Martin Nowak of Harvard University , have investigated how evolution might have first begun .
As the researchers explain , the origin of life is a transition from chemistry to biology , and has been widely studied .
Here , Ohtsuki and Nowak have presented a model where a purely chemical system ( prelife ) becomes more efficient ( catalytic prelife ) and then builds the sequences needed for replication , finally resulting in life .
Their work is published in a recent issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
“ As you know , the ability of replication is critical for life , ” Ohtsuki told PhysOrg.com .
“ We can conceive several forms of life , such as prelife catalysts and replicators , as in our paper .
We are interested in which form of life is most efficient and thus is selected in prelife ( a soup of chemicals ) .
The significance of our study is that we have mathematically shown for the first time that replicators , which have the ability to remain attached with a growing sequence , have a great advantage over the other forms of life .
Replication is usually taken for granted in the study of evolution .
We think that our result gives a justification of why replicators are so dominant . ”
In the scientists ’ model , prelife is made of two types of monomers ( 0 and 1 ) that randomly link together to form a polymer chain .
By adding a 0 or a 1 , longer chains are produced from shorter ones .
The researchers created a simple tree of life based on this growth process , where either a 0 or a 1 is added to the end of the preceding chain to make a longer one .
Though starting with just a single monomer , this tree of prelife has infinitely many lineages .
As the researchers explain , some of these prelife sequences are catalysts , and can enhance certain reactions in prelife .
Specifically , they increase the rate at which monomers are added to sequences in the specific prelife reactions that created them .
The faster the rate of reactions to create a certain prelife catalyst , the more of them there will be .
As the researchers found , the sequences that are most highly selected among prelife catalysts are perfectly catalyzed prelife sequences ( those that enhance the rates of all their upstream reactions ) .
“ Prelife refers to chemical reactions in a soup of chemicals that consists of amino acids , phosphoric acids , nucleobases , and so on , ” Ohtsuki explained .
“ Simply speaking , prelife supplies ‘ materials ’ for life .
But prelife does not have an ability of replication , because it cannot catalyze any reactions .
Catalytic prelife is a big step forward for life , because it can enhance certain reactions .
A most promising candidate for life among prelife catalysts are those which can catalyze their own upstream reactions .
We believe that catalytic ability is a big step , yet not enough for the emergence of life , as we have shown in our paper : we need another step , that is , replicators . ”
Replicators - for example , a simple sequence of all 0 monomers - are among the sequences that prelife dynamics can create .
The difference between a replicator and a perfect prelife catalyst , as the researchers explain , is that a prelife catalyst attaches to a sequence to increase the rate at which an activated monomer is added , and then detaches itself .
In contrast , a replicator remains attached to the growing sequence .
“ The fundamental difference lies in that replicators can remain attached to a growing sequence so that it can ‘ go along ’ with it , ” Ohtsuki explained .
“ By doing so , replicators need to attach to a template only once to complete the replication .
On the other hand , prelife catalysts have to attach to and detach from the target sequence many times , because in each reaction the target extends in length by one .
Therefore , a longer prelife catalyst must catalyze its upstream reactions a number of times , resulting in an inefficient replication . ”
Overall , replicators have certain advantages over catalytic prelife that cause the replicators to be selected over prelife .
As the researchers explain , ongoing competition between prelife and catalytic prelife creates certain selection thresholds that limit the lengths of the sequences .
Most importantly , the researchers found that catalytic activity must increase exponentially with sequence length to keep its abundance high ; otherwise a longer sequence becomes less abundant .
In contrast , the threshold of replicator activity converges to a fixed value , suggesting that even long replicators can sustain its high abundance .
For replicators , the critical replication rate is almost independent of the rate of the replicator .
As prelife catalysts and replicators compete for the same resources ( monomers ) , this ability to grow longer is what gives replicators their edge , ultimately leading to the origin of evolution .

Andrew Thompson hopes his company can help keep people out of them .
His Silicon Valley start - up , Proteus Biomedical Inc. , is testing a miniature digestible chip that can be attached to conventional medication , sending a signal that confirms whether patients are taking their prescribed pills .
A sensing device worn on the skin uses wireless technology to relay that information to doctors , along with readings about patients ' vital signs .
Mr. Thompson predicts the company 's technology will generate a wealth of new information about patients ' evolving conditions and the impact of drugs they take .
Doctors might decide to intervene , for example , when they notice a heart patient is n't sleeping well or is taking incorrect dosages -- problems that could lead to congestive heart failure .
Proteus is n't alone .
Dozens of large and small companies are turning to wireless technology to achieve what the Obama administration is seeking through legislation : a health - care system that keeps people healthier for less .
" Wireless applications have the potential to change every one of these areas , " said Eric Topol , a cardiologist and genomics professor at Scripps Research Institute , at an industry event in San Diego last week .

Is the Dollar the New Yen ?
10:15 AM ET Fri , 25 Sept 2009
Schiff said the yen carry trade is over and the new Japanese government is even talking about the benefits of a stronger yen for the domestic economy .
“ The yen has gone a lot higher but the dollar is going to go a lot lower , which makes it ideal , ” said Schiff .
“ Not only can you borrow dollars for very cheap and earn to carry by investing in higher yielding assets , but the dollar is going to fall sharply .
So anyone who puts on the carry trade is going to make a ton of money . ”
Schiff said the Federal Reserve will soon run into the dilemma of either having to supply the carry traders with an endless amount of cheap dollars or put a halt to the carry trade and aggressively raise interest rates , which will “ bring on a much more severe recession than anything we ’ve experienced so far . ”
Meanwhile , Schiff said he owns the Australian and Canadian dollars as well as the Japanese yen .
“ I own a lot of Japanese yen — I think it ’s breaking out and the chart looks fantastic , ” he said .
“ I would n’t be looking at any pullbacks from these currencies .
There ’s a much better chance that the dollar drops through a trap door …
I ’ve been shorting the dollar for years .
I do it because I own foreign currencies , precious metals , and foreign stocks . ”
Schiff added that we ’re still early in this bull market on gold .

An online petition to dissolve the CRTC has attracted hundreds of signatures in the wake of the regulator 's ruling against independent internet providers last week .
The petition , at dissolvethecrtc.ca and on Facebook and Twitter , had more than 440 signatures as of Wednesday afternoon .
The site was started Saturday by Mike Lerner , a 23 - year - old Ottawa software company employee , who was frustrated by a decision to allow Bell Canada to institute usage - based billing on its wholesale internet customers .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission last week provisionally approved Bell 's request to require independent companies such as TekSavvy and Acanac , which rent parts of its network to supply their own services , to charge customers by how much they download .
Independent providers typically offer customers hundreds of gigabytes of usage where Bell 's most popular service allows only 50 gigabytes a month .
Smaller providers now say they have just under three months to migrate their customers on to similar usage models .
Once those plans are implemented , they say , their services will be indistinguishable from Bell's .
The CRTC , the petition says , is failing in its mandate to protect competition and look out for the interest of Canadian consumers and has for the past three years shown " undue preference in the interest of commercial entities and their preference for traditional business models over competing models that would create competition . "
" We , the undersigned , believe that the CRTC has become a burden on the Canadian public and are failing to perform their duties in the interest of the Canadian public and that of a fair and unbiased telecom policy , " it says .
Lerner told CBC
News the government needs to replace the current regulator with a body that is staffed by people who are in touch with the new technology and competition models being introduced by the internet .
" You need some people who have experience with telecom but you also need some people who understand the new types of competition .
They just do n't have any experience in that field , " he says .
Lerner 's goal is to amass 10,000 signatures , which he admits is ambitious , and present the petition to Heritage Minister James Moore , who is responsible for the CRTC .
Lerner is also planning an anti-CRTC rally on Parliament Hill
He does not hold out much hope that the regulator will come to a fair and informed decision on the issue of net neutrality , or how much control service providers should have over internet connections .
The CRTC held public hearings on the issue earlier this year and is set to make a ruling this fall .
" They 're saying retail and wholesale are the same , " Lerner said .
" They think competition is whatever Bell thinks it is . "
A spokesman for the CRTC did not return several requests for an interview with one of the agency 's commissioners .
Criticisms of the CRTC in online message boards and in comments on CBC stories have been building since it was ordered to proceed with a " light regulatory touch " in 2006 by then industry minister Maxime Bernier .
" Canada 's new government has again furthered its ambitious policy agenda for the telecommunications sector by issuing the policy direction to the CRTC , " Bernier said at the time .
" Our plan will increase competition in the marketplace , which ultimately will have a positive effect on the consumer who will benefit from greater choices and improved products and services . "
Calls for stronger regulation of various services have been coming from several quarters recently .
Last week , television broadcaster CTV called for the re-regulation of basic television prices in the wake of a new 1.5 - per-cent charge by several providers related to local programming .
Consumer groups , meanwhile , have been urging regulation of the wireless industry for years .
Some of the companies governed by the CRTC have also been fuelling consumer resentment of the regulator recently .
Bell and Rogers executives last week told CBC News that consumers should direct their anger over new television charges at the CRTC , which they said is mired in supporting old television business models .
A complaints agency , the Commissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services , was set up in 2007 to protect consumers from deregulation following a recommendation from Bernier .
Two years on , however , the agency still has not implemented a planned publicity campaign and few Canadians know of its existence .
The Christian right is making a fresh push to force religion onto the school curriculum in Texas with the state ’s education board about to consider recommendations that children be taught that there would be no United States if it had not been for God .
Members of a panel of experts appointed by the board to revise the state ’s history curriculum , who include a Christian fundamentalist preacher who says he is fighting a war for America ’s moral soul , want lessons to emphasise the part played by Christianity in the founding of the US and that religion is a civic virtue .
Opponents have decried the move as an attempt to insert religious teachings in to the classroom by stealth , similar to the Christian right ’s partially successful attempt to limit the teaching of evolution in biology lessons in Texas .
One of the panel , David Barton , founder of a Christian heritage group called WallBuilders , argues that the curriculum should reflect the fact that the US Constitution was written with God in mind including that “ there is a fixed moral law derived from God and nature ” , that “ there is a creator ” and “ government exists primarily to protect God- given rights to every individual ” …
Another of the experts is Reverend Peter Marshall , who heads his own Christian ministry and preaches that Hurricane Katrina and defeat in the Vietnam war were God ’s punishment for sexual promiscuity and tolerance of homosexuals .
Marshall recommended that children be taught about the “ motivational role ” of the Bible and Christianity in establishing the original colonies that later became the US …
Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network , which describes itself as a “ counter to the religious right ” , called the recommendations “ troubling ” .
“ I do n’t think anyone disputes that faith played a role in our history .
But it ’s a stretch to say that it played the role described by David Barton and Peter Marshall .
They ’re absurdly unqualified to be considered experts .
It ’s a very deceptive and devious way to distort the curriculum in our public schools , ” he said .
Not that being biased and unqualified means much to American politicians – Texas flavor or otherwise .
Votes count .
If your electorate is ignorant , Christian and foolish , what better situation for opportunist , Christian politicians ?
Wonder if my Native American friends realize it was God ’s will they should be slaughtered and herded into reservations ?
Or if Mexicans understand it was pre-ordained that Texans would lead an army of God to steal the Promised Land from them ?
NASA Ponders Future Of Manned Spaceflight
By Kane Farabaugh
Washington DC ( SPX ) Aug 17 , 2009
Forty years after man landed on the moon , NASA plans to retire the Space Shuttle in 2010 .
It will be five years before NASA has a vehicle ready to carry astronauts back into space , which has some concerned about the future of the space program .
Kane Farabaugh sat down with Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell to discuss what is in store for space exploration .
When astronaut Jim Lovell aimed for the moon during the Gemini and Apollo missions , he says there was a sense of excitement and adventure shared by people around the world .
He served as Neil Armstrong 's backup during the Apollo 11 lunar landings , and watched the dramatic event unfold from NASA 's mission control center in Houston Texas .
" After the flight , I had made a trip overseas to Europe , and was really pleasantly surprised that almost all the Europeans were absolutely enthusiastic about what we had accomplished , perhaps just as much so as the Americans were , " he said .
Lovell , who once held the record for most hours in space , never landed on the moon .
As commander of Apollo 13 , slated to be the third moon landing in 1970 , Lovell successfully led fellow astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert back to Earth after a catastrophic explosion crippled their spacecraft .
Now , 40 years after man landed on the moon , and 39 years after Lovell returned to Earth , NASA plans to retire the Space Shuttle in 2010 .
It is the only vehicle NASA has to carry astronauts into space , and Lovell is concerned about the future of the space program .
" There 's going to be a five year hiatus between getting some other new vehicle to go up to the space station before we could have something to go , " he added .
" Nothing is going to be there except the Russian Soyuz , a vehicle that was developed years and years ago . "
At the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama in late July , NASA held meetings with an independent review panel commissioned by President Barack Obama to evaluate the future of manned space flight .
Part of the meeting focused on the next generation spacecraft that would replace the Space Shuttle Orbiter .
NASA is developing the Constellation program , a beefed - up Apollo - like initiative .
It uses a rocket , called Ares , to put a single - use spacecraft , called the Orion , into orbit , and eventually back to the moon .
Steve Lindsay , chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA 's Johnson Space Center , says one of the main drives behind the new vehicle is to reduce the risk with spaceflight .
" We know that in the future we 're going to take a lot of risks , " he noted .
" We know in the present we 're going to take a lot of risks .
We know even with an order of magnitude of improvement , we are still going to take a lot of risks .
But , we think a risk should be commensurate with our level of experience .
We 're willing to take those risks .
We accept that as our job and we 're proud to do that as our job . "
Another option favored by the presidential panel is extending the life of the Space Shuttle through 2014 , keeping it flying missions until a new spacecraft is ready for flight .
The panel is also reviewing an extension to the proposed life of the International Space Station , currently scheduled to end its mission by 2015 .
The Obama administration is concerned about the program 's price increases .
Public support for funding the space program has waned in recent years .
Now , in the midst of a deep recession , lawmakers are looking to trim expenses and NASA is struggling to keep funding intact .
But Lovell sees an opportunity for economic recovery by increasing funding to the space program .
" One part of the stimulus could be the space program , " he said .
" First of all it's a creative program , it creates taxes individual and corporate taxes , all the money is spent here on Earth , not one cent up there in space .
It brings technology that spills over to the private sector .
That 's what happened all through Gemini and Apollo and the private sector now is affected by computer technology and electronic components that were speeded up by our being in space , and that could continue . "
Lovell sees a renewed interest in space sparked by China 's Lunar Exploration Program .
He says the only successful path to an eventual manned mission to Mars is a shared vision and cooperation among all countries interested in venturing farther into the universe .
Yeah ...
I think before you people start commenting on the idiocy of grandmothers and the tech - illiterate .....
Perhaps you should have to go through a 2 step process ...
1- Do a complete oil change .
2- Fix a clogged pipe .
Both simple to do ..
Now ... 1 in 10 of you WILL know how to do this , congratulations , you may continue commenting .
8 in 10 of you will lie and say you do .
But hey , thats the internet .
You people are jackasses .
Several years ago Brazil , which has an interesting combination of progressive policies and considerable homophobic violence , led a move to include sexuality within the purview of international human rights .
An attempt to declare that international human rights should include protection of sexual orientation and gender identity gained 66 votes in the UN , with support coming from almost all Western countries , but only three Asian states : Japan , Nepal and East Timor .
We should not be surprised that regimes such as those of Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe , Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi rail against homosexuality , which they invoke as a symbol of Westernisation , unlike , for example , shopping malls or DVDs , which they embrace .
For many political and religious leaders who dislike what they see as the unnecessary freedoms and hedonism of the West , homosexuality has become a crucial touchstone .
The world has never been as divided in attitudes towards homosexuality .
In all Western countries legal prohibitions have been removed , and in some same - sex marriage has become legal .
Openly homosexual politicians are increasingly evident , and no mainstream television series seems to be without its gay and lesbian characters .
In Iraq the justifications for killings are religious , and globally there is a tacit alliance between organised Islam and the Catholic Church to prevent what is feared as the legitimisation of homosexuality .
Ironically , Islamic countries such as Iran , which have a long tradition of homoerotic literature , now lead the world in criminalising , and in some cases executing , people for homosexual behaviour .
The Bush administration did not vote for the resolution ( Australia did ) , but the Obama Administration has changed its position .
At a speech earlier this month , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the US was now engaged in tracking violence against '' the LGBT ( lesbian , gay bisexual and transgender ) community '' , and that the US would push for a Security Council resolution on sexual and gender violence .
In her speech , Clinton named Brazil , France , Sweden and the Netherlands as partners in this work .
For all our closeness to the US it is striking that Australia is not seen as a partner , although our influence within Asia and the Pacific should make us an important partner in expanding human rights in this area .
As reports of homophobic violence mount globally both our politicians and our non-government organisations remain seemingly unconcerned .
Other than Amnesty , I am unaware of any significant non-gay group in Australia taking up the issue , and I can find no statement from either the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister equivalent to that made by Clinton in her address to the Roosevelt Institute .
Yet the scope for winning support within the region is far greater than might be imagined .
At last month 's regional AIDS Conference in Bali , Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono spoke of Government support for '' networks of gay , transgender and men who have sex with men ' ' .
The Indian High Court has now overturned the colonial laws that criminalised sodomy , and there are moves to follow suit in Papua New Guinea .
In practice , many governments in east and South - East Asia have supported groups working within homosexual communities to prevent the spread of HIV , now a major issue for homosexual men across the region .
For most people , homosexual rights seems a minor issue , a distraction from bigger concerns such as global warming and world poverty .
But rights are not divisible , and our commitment to them is most tested in the case of people who are marginalised and oppressed .
When the General Assembly rejected the Brazilian motion it did adopt a resolution that condemned killings based on sexual orientation ( although 60 countries still voted to delete that part of a larger resolution on extrajudicial executions ) .
The investigation into a brutal and frenzied attack by illegal Jewish settlers on Palestinian shepherds has been closed by the Israeli police because it was " not possible to identify the attackers " due to their masked identities .
The attack was caught on camera last year and shows four men coming from an illegal Jewish settlement to attack three local Palestinian shepherds with baseball bats .
The attack was filmed by a relative , who had been given a camera by the Israeli human rights group B�Tselem as part of its Shooting Back project .
B�Tselem had handed video cameras to Palestinians in troubled areas so that they could document abuses against them .
Four men were arrested but the Israeli police could " not find evidence that they were responsible for the crime " , and so the case was closed .
Thaman al - Nawaja , a 58 year old Palestinian woman , along with her 70 year old husband , and one of her nephews were herding their flocks on their land when the four intruders entered and started to beat them with baseball bats .
The incident took place in the south of the West Bank close to the illegal Jewish settlement of Susia .
Tamam a - Nawaj�ah , from Susiya , who was assaulted by settlers on 8 June 2008 .
Mrs Nawaja told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that she couldn�t understand how the police did not catch the men who beat her .
However , according to the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din , over 90 % of investigations into settler violence are closed without an indictment being filed .
A special focus report by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ) observed that " By contrast , when Israeli civilians are the target of Palestinian violence , the IDF actively pursues Palestinian suspects ; thousands of Palestinians are arrested and prosecuted through Israel�s military court system each year . "
In the same report , an Israeli settler described the " exact a price " strategy which has seen an increase in settler violence and attacks against Palestinians and their land : " For every act of destruction in the southern Hebron hills we will set fire to Samaria , and for a container destroyed near Har Bracha we will exact a price in the southern Hebron hills . "
According to UNOCHA this �price tag� strategy " indicates that Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians are not isolated incidents , but are in fact highly organized and tactically used to achieve political ends . "
Palestinians are particularly vulnerable to this organized violence as Israeli settlers in the West Bank are routinely armed with M16 rifles .
In contrast Palestinians living in the H2 area of Hebron - a site of frequent violent settler attacks - are forbidden even from keeping kitchen knives in their houses .

The National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan on Friday sounded a note caution that the media “ hype ” over the " recent incursions " by China could lead to “ unwarranted incident or accident ” that could create problems with the neighbour .
Although Mr. Narayanan acknowledged that incursions were taking place , he added that there was “ hardly any increase ” in these activities and situation was not “ alarming “ .
The NSA disagreed that China was trying to put pressure saying “ India of 2009 is not ( India ) of 1962 ” and said both nations are keen to maintain peace and tranquility at the border .
“ In terms of number of incursions , there has been hardly any increase .
Occasionally inroads are a little deeper than what it might have been in the past .
I do n’t think so that there is anything alarming about it .
I think we have a good understanding about the whole issue , ” Mr. Narayanan told Karan Thapar on his Devil ’s Advocate programme on CNN - IBN .
“ I really am unable to explain why there is being so much media hype on this question , ” he said .
Asked if over reaction by media could create problems , he replied in the affirmative and said , ” I have been through 1962 .
I was aware of the problem then ....
What we need to be careful of is that we do n’t have an unwarranted incident or an accident of some kind .
“ That ’s what we are trying to avoid .
But there is always concern ( that ) if this thing ( media hype ) goes on like this someone somewhere might lose his cool and something might go wrong . ”
The text of a letter from Google to the US Federal Communications Commission dated last August 21 -- the un-redacted contents of which were only made available today -- directly contradicts information given by Apple and iPhone partner AT&T , regarding the apparent rejection of a key Google mobile app from Apple 's iTunes App Store .
Google Voice is a beta project which allows several phone lines to be united under a single new number , accessible from any phone .
Earlier this year , Google submitted to Apple an app that would make the service usable on the iPhone .
The fiasco over Apple 's rejection of the Google Voice application from the App Store came to a head when the FCC began a formal inquiry into whether the relationship between AT&T and Apple is fair and encouraging to innovations in communication .
The FCC sent letters of inquiry to AT&T , Apple , and Google last July 31 .
Responding to the inquiry , AT&T stated its position that it had nothing to do with the rejection .
Apple said it had " not rejected the Google Voice application , and continues to study it , " and confirmed that AT&T was not involved in the iTunes App Store approval process .

Apple went on to suggest that Google could potentially compromise users ' private data , " In addition , the iPhone user 's entire Contacts database is transferred to Google 's servers , and we have yet to obtain any assurances from Google that this data will only be used in appropriate ways .
These factors present several new issues and questions to us that we are still pondering at this time . "
Google 's response to the FCC last month appeared to be the least straightforward of all those involved in the inquiry , and large sections of the text were redacted .
" When we submitted our letter on August 21 , we asked the FCC to redact certain portions that involved sensitive commercial conversations between two companies -- namely , a description of e-mails , telephone conversations , and in - person meetings between executives at Google and Apple , " Richard Whitt of the Washington Telecom and Media Counsel posted in Google 's public policy blog today .
But certain individuals filed Freedom of Information
Act requests to make the FCC release the information , and the full seven - page letter is now available for public consumption .
Within the letter , Google says nothing of continuing investigation , but rather that the app was rejected outright .
" ... The Google Voice application was rejected because Apple believed the application duplicated the core dialer functionality of the iPhone .
The Apple representatives indicated that the company did not want applications that could potentially replace such functionality . "
To prove this , Google listed with whom it had spoken ( Apple SVP Phil Schiller , no less ) and the various meetings Schiller had with Google 's Alan Eustace , Vice President of Engineering and Research , over the rejection of Google Voice and Google Latitude , an application which was later converted into a Web app .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Boys may soon be able to get Gardasil , the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus .
Gardasil , a vaccine against human papillomavirus , would be given to boys exactly as it is to girls .
A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted Wednesday to recommend that the vaccine be made available to boys and young men aged 9 to 26 for protection against genital warts caused by HPV .
The vaccine protects against four types of HPV , and two of those are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical and anal cancers , and HPV - associated penile and throat - and - neck cancers .
The other two cause 90 percent of genital warts cases , researchers say .
At Wednesday 's advisory committee meeting , pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. , maker of Gardasil , presented data from three clinical trials that the company claims supports broadening the distribution of the vaccine to include males .
The trials included more than 5,400 boys and men from six continents and 23 countries .
According to Anna Giuliano , an independent scientist at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa , Florida , and the trials ' principal investigator , " The data clearly demonstrates that there was a benefit to men in receiving Gardasil .
Overall , we saw a 90 percent reduction in disease -- genital warts and pre-cancerous lesions -- caused by HPV in men and an 89 percent reduction in genital warts incidence .
" Essentially , we have a really fantastic opportunity to extend the benefit of the vaccine to men , " Giuliano said .
" This is a sexually transmitted infection ; if we can reduce infection and related diseases in men , we have the potential to have a much broader public health impact by reducing the overall burden of infection and disease in the community at large . "
Giuliano said there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine .
There were some minor side effects such as pain at the injection site and low - grade fever .
The vaccine would be administered in boys and young men exactly as it's been given to girls and young women : three doses over a period of six months .
Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said the cost will be $ 130 per dose .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 20 million Americans are infected with HPV .
There are 6.2 million new infections each year .
The CDC says that at least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get an HPV infection at some time in their life .
The American Social Health Association says HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus and puts that number at 75 percent or more .
The CDC says that although HPV is very common in both sexes , most men wo n't develop symptoms or serious health problems , and there is no test to detect the virus in men .
The only approved HPV test on the market is for women , for use in cervical - cancer screening .
The advisory committee also voted that Cervarix , a new HPV vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline , appeared to be safe and effective for girls and young women 10 to 25 years of age .
Cervarix has been approved in Europe .
" This is an important step in cancer prevention for the millions of girls and young women at risk for cervical cancer , " said Barbara Howe , vice president and director of North American vaccine development for GlaxoSmithKline .
" If approved , Cervarix will provide protection against cervical cancer , a devastating disease that is responsible for thousands of deaths in U.S. women each year . "
Still , the panel recommended that Glaxo do more studies that would monitor miscarriages and other problems reported by patients .
In a final review , both applications will be considered by the FDA , which usually -- but not always -- follows the recommendations of its advisory committees .

Putting to rest the lie that internal Border Patrol checkpoints are primarily about stemming the flow of illegal border crossers ( as if you could stop illegal border crossers 40 miles North of the border to begin with ) , the video below clearly shows that the Department of Homeland Security use so - called immigration checkpoints as a pretext to search for contraband .
As in previous videos , this August 21st checkpoint encounter took place near mile marker 146 on SR86 in Southern Arizona .
SR86 is an East - West highway located over forty miles North of the border and never intersects the border at any point .
Consequently , there are no Ports of Entry located along this route .
Why then would a ' Port of Entry ' K9 team with Customs and Border Protection be operating a CBP detector dog at this internal immigration checkpoint ?
The answer is obvious .
During the encounter , the stopping Border Patrol agent greets me by name .
Further , the agent never asks my immigration status making it clear the scope of the stop had nothing to do with immigration .
Additionally , other Border Patrol agents on the South side of the checkpoint yell out my name on several occasions ( see the gray haired Border Patrol agent sitting down while waving and enjoying the festivities below ) :
While I 'm being detained at primary by a Border Patrol agent who knows who I am , a K9 team is going to work on the passenger side of my vehicle sniffing for illegal contraband .
Unlike the stopping agent however , the K9 handler is n't a Border Patrol agent .
He 's a Customs ( and Border Protection ) agent normally assigned to a port of entry where dogs are trained to search for drugs , guns , currency , explosives and humans who are either entering the country at the actual border or leaving
State government finances are a wreck .

Detectives Get Court Order to Post Facebook Page of Dead Girl Detectives in Fond du Lac , Wis. , have been unable to identify body .
Aug. 20 , 2009  --
Her body was found by deer hunters hidden in the woods in a rural part of Wisconsin .
Nearly one year later , detectives in Fond du Lac , Wis. , still have no idea who she is or how she got there .
So they 've turned to Facebook , even going as far as getting a court order forcing the social networking site to allow a page for the dead girl after previous attempts to post an information page were found to violate the site 's policy .
" Our problem is getting this out because if she 's not from our local viewing area , people who are missing somebody are n't going to see what we have , " Fond du Lac County Sheriff 's Detective Charles Sosinski told ABCNews.com .
They have posted not only a composite photo of the woman created by forensic artists , but an exact replica of the clothing she was wearing .
The police Web site shows the clothing posed on a mannequin in several positions .
She is known only as the Fond du Lac " Jane Doe . "
The police believe she may be Caucasian , but an anthropologist from the University of Wisconsin at Madison told police she could be of Hispanic , Asian or Native American descent .
She 's believed to be about 5 ' 1 " , give or take three inches , and between 15 and 21 years old .
Her weight was estimated at 110 to 135 pounds .
The anthropologist said an exam showed that she may have been knock - kneed or pigeon toed .
Police are n't disclosing how Jane Doe died , but Soskinski said it was a homicide and that the body had been in the woods since at least September 2008 .
Soskinski said the department initially had trouble with its Facebook endeavor .
After getting the composite photo in early June , detectives set up profiles for Jane Doe on both Facebook and MySpace , but the former page kept getting taken down .
Soskinski said they had exhausted all traditional methods of identification including checking missing persons reports and handing out photographs .
Police determined the manufacturers of the clothing found at the scene and the company sent copies to them for use on the mannequin , he said .
Eventually obtaining the court order July 2 from a Fond du Lac circuit court judge , they were contacted by a Facebook attorney earlier this month who helped set up a page that would n't be removed .
Jane Doe 's new Facebook page , up since Monday , has nearly 70 fans so far and includes photos and information about the case .
Barry Schnitt , Facebook 's director of policy communications , told ABCNews.com that the problem was n't with the content posted by the Sheriff 's Office , but that the fact that they wanted to create a profile , something the site reserves for identified -- and living -- individuals .
Finding Fond du Lac's Jane Doe
Their profile , he said , was automatically getting booted from the site because the department was using the phrase " Jane Doe " which triggered Facebook 's filters .
Facebook requires all users be identified by their true names as a way of ensuring accountability and avoiding anonymous disrespect that occurs so frequently on other sites .
" We point to it ... as one of the things that has differentiated Facebook , " he said .
" Our point the whole time , " Schnitt said of the Fond du Lac Jane Doe , " was ' You can do this , just not a profile . ' "
Schnitt said Facebook ended up creating the Fond du Lac Jane Doe page for the Sheriff 's Office and were happy to do so , " but we would point to some others as best practices . "
He pointed out that most police entities create pages for their departments and then disseminate news to department " fans . "
So far , Sosinski said , Jane Doe 's page has n't generated any leads , but detectives are hoping that will change as more people see it .
" Now the next part is getting people to go look at it , " he said , " share it with their friends . "

Given the existence of prior art , patent applications that lay claim to widely used methods should be shot down during their application process , but that has n't stopped even big companies from trying , or the Patent Office for granting them .
Microsoft 's seen both sides of this problem recently , as it was granted one patent for storing formatting information in XML files , and faced a damaging injunction for violating someone else 's patent on the same general thing .
In a bit of awkward timing , it was recently discovered that , two years ago , Microsoft filed a patent for clustering phylogenetics methods , which have existed for years , and are currently in use by just about anyone who does evolutionary biology .
The filing has been compared to attempting to patent multiplication tables , and has the phylogenetics community on edge .
Clustering algorithms allows researchers to take a collection of related sequences — the amino acids in proteins , the bases in DNA — and figure out the likely evolutionary relationships among them .
The sequences that have the fewest changes among them cluster together , suggesting that they were most recently derived from a common ancestor .
The patent , filed by Microsoft researcher Steve Ozer in July 2007 and recently discovered by a graduate student at the University of Texas in Austin , claims ownership of several common phylogenetic methods .
At its most basic , however , it seems to patent identifying any evolutionary relationship from sequences : " receiving a plurality of sequences across a plurality of species [ and ] mapping at least a portion of the plurality of sequences to an evolutionary tree . "
This may seem like it falls well outside the range of Microsoft 's typical interests , but the company appears to be taking an interest in bioinformatics .
In June , Microsoft bought assets of Rosetta Biosoftware from Merck .
Microsoft intended to integrate Rosetta 's software with its own Amalga Life Sciences platform , which is used for research at drug companies and universities .
Hopefully , a patent with this much prior art will not be approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office because the methods it details are so common — and , in fact , a reader noted that it has received a " nonfinal rejection " from the USPTO .
That still allows the patent to be resubmitted in a modified form , however , so the biomedical community may want to follow it carefully .
There is some precedent for patent applications that put entire fields at risk : according to Science , in the mid-1990s , a molecular biologist in Canada tried to patent the use of a particular type of mitochondrial DNA .
A senior researcher at the Natural History Museum , backed by the UK government , challenged the application , and it was withdrawn .
A similar point of patent contention has been the use of DNA for bar - coding organisms , such as plants , by using a short piece of their own DNA sequence to help identify their species quickly .
The Consortium for the Barcode of Life is a international initiative that advocates for the open standards in this field , but the same Science article indicates that the project has been threatened by patents three times , the most recent happening last month .
In any case , these events make clear that technology is n't the only field where patents with extensive prior art puts common practices at risk ; they also make it clear that gene patents are n't the only things that threaten progress in biomedicine .
Artificial life will be created ' within months ' as genome experts claim vital breakthrough
Influential : Craig Venter claims we will make artificial life this year
Scientists are only months away from creating artificial life , it was claimed yesterday .
Dr Craig Venter – one of the world ’s most famous and controversial biologists – said his U.S. researchers have overcome one of the last big hurdles to making a synthetic organism .
The first artificial lifeform is likely to be a simple man-made bacterium that proves that the technology can work .
But it will be followed by more complex bacteria that turn coal into cleaner natural gas , or algae that can soak up carbon dioxide and convert it into fuels .
They could also be used to create new vaccines and antibiotics .
The prediction came after a breakthrough by the J Craig Venter Institute in Maryland .
Researchers successfully transferred
the DNA of one type of bacteria into a yeast cell , modified it and then transferred it into another bacterial cell .
The pioneering ' gene swap ' was performed on a simple species of bacteria called Mycoplasma mycoides .
Carole Lartigue and colleagues removed the bacteria 's entire genome and inserted it into the yeast - an organism that is distant from bacteria on the tree of life .
Yeast is easier to manipulate in the lab and this process allowed the team to alter the genes - in this case , deleting one gene not necessary for bacteria to live .
High hopes : Synthetic microbes could clean up toxic waste
The cell went on to divide normally , producing a new healthy strain of the modified bacteria .
In January , the team created the entire genetic code of a new bacterium .
They now hope to transfer such artificial DNA into a host cell to create a new species , the journal Science reported .
Yesterday Dr Venter said : ‘ Assuming we do n’t make any errors , I think it should work and we should have the first synthetic species by the end of the year . ’
The team successfully transplanted the genome of one bacteria into another for the first time in 2007 .
They then created the first entirely man-made genome .
But previous attempts to introduce the synthetic genome into another organism and take control of the new bacteria all failed .
Now the team has harnessed a biological process called methylation - where special molecules are added onto the cell 's DNA - to protect them from viruses .
Writing in Science , they said their method might be used to tinker with the genetics of a range of bacteria that have been difficult to engineer .
' Many medically or industrially important microbes are difficult to manipulate genetically , ' they wrote .
' This has severely limited our understanding of pathogenesis and our ability to exploit the knowledge of microbial biology on a practical level .
Breakthrough : New DNA was protected by a process called methylation ( step 5 )
' We hope that the cycle presented here can be applied to other species , to help solve these problems . '
Ms Lartigue , who is now at the Biotechnology Industry Organisation , said there may have already identified a direct application in the development of animal vaccines .
The Mycoplasma mycoides bacterium they used causes a disease called pleuropneumonia in cattle and goats .
' There is an urgent need for vaccines , ' they wrote .
' This technology could accelerate the construction of live vaccine strains . '
Dr Venter , named as an author in the paper and who founded the institute , is working to make genetically manipulated or completely synthetic organisms .
Last month , Exxon Mobil Corp signed a $ 600 million ( £ 362 million ) deal with Dr Venter 's privately held Synthetic Genomics Inc to work on making biofuel from algae .
Venter has said he hopes to manipulate organisms to produce biofuels , clean up toxic waste and sequester carbon to slow global warming .
Researchers already regularly engineer life forms by adding or deleting genes .
A new analysis of the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex ( T. rex ) that roamed Earth 68 million years ago has confirmed traces of protein from blood and bone , tendons , or cartilage .
The findings , scheduled for publication in the Sept. 4 issue of ACS ' monthly Journal of Proteome Research , is the latest addition to an ongoing controversy over which biochemical remnants can be detected in the dino .
In the study , Marshall Bern , Brett S. Phinney and David Goldberg point out that the first analysis in 2007 of a well - preserved , fossilized T. rex bone identified traces of seven distinct protein fragments , or peptides , from collagen .
That material is one of the primary components of bone , tendons and other connective tissue .
However , later studies disputed that finding , suggesting that it was a statistical fluke or the result of contamination from another laboratory sample .
The scientists describe reanalysis of the T. rex data and also report finding evidence of substances found in collagen .
" In summary , we find nothing obviously wrong with the Tyrannosaurus rex [ analysis from 2007 ] , " the report states .
" The identified peptides seem consistent with a sample containing old , quite possibly very ancient , bird - like bone , contaminated with only fairly explicable proteins .
Hemoglobin and collagen are plausible proteins to find in fossil bone , because they are two of the most abundant proteins in bone and bone marrow . "

Arianna Huffington is accustomed to a life of wealth .
She rides her friends ' yachts and jets .
She even wanted to buy a plane for the Huffington Post , says an insider .
So why 's she talking about CEO " excess " on The View ?
Today 's appearance , which involved a discussion of corporate executive " narcissism " and excess spending ( see attached clip ) , should have been jarring for anyone familiar with Huffington 's lifestyle and spending habits .
The Brentwood , California - based internet mogul might drive a Prius and engage in environmental posturing , but that does n't keep her from hitching rides on David Geffen 's jet ; hopping on a private plane with Ari Emanuel and Larry David for the New Hampshire primaries ; or cruising around the ocean on Larry Ellison 's enormous yacht ( partly owned by Geffen ) .
Such gallivanting must feel utterly natural to Huffington , a former socialite who started HuffPo from her mansion following an eight - year marriage to wealthy oil scion Michael Huffington .
Her spending apparently strikes Huffington as something utterly different from what those evil Wall Street types did .
But Huffington 's no penny pincher in the corporate suite , either .
Her profligate ways became an issue with HuffPo's board , an insider told us .
Huffington denied that charge .
But there 's no question she throws lavish parties , including HuffPo's A - list inaugural ball at the Newseum in January .
And with HuffPo's editorial headquarters in New York , she 's constantly racking up travel expenses , including that time , notorious internally , when she sent an assistant across the country and back to fetch her passport .
Also , rather than just rent a Gotham apartment , Huffington became a frequent guest at the Mercer Hotel luxury boutique .
And her travel preferences are said to be exactingly cushy :
First class , aisle , bulkhead seat on a three - class plane only , fully refundable and non-stop .
Preferably American or United .
( Huffington , to be fair , sometimes relaxes these requirements for a convenient Southwest Airlines hop to San Francisco or Vegas .
Southwest has only one class of seating . )
But that 's apparently small time , as far as Huffington is concerned , not to mention a royal pain in the neck to her and the editors she has used as personal secretaries .
After one infusion of fresh capital , Huffington was heard internally telling staff that everyone 's lives would be greatly improved " once we get the jet . "
It would seem that was one spending spree that was never approved , and for good reason :
It 's an absurd idea .
Even assuming Huffington
Post is on track to more than double last year 's purported revenues of $ 9 million , as one anonymous insider claims , that 's not jet money .
( Huffington and her spokesman did not answer repeated inquiries on revenue . )
At the absolute low end , the cost would start at $ 3 million , before you get to operating costs which for jet aircraft are typically in the thousands of dollars per hour .
Fractional ownership jets also cost in the multiple thousands of dollars per hour to operate , in addition to an upfront fee starting at several hundred thousand dollars .
Not to mention the fuel guzzled by one of these babies each year cancels out the moderate environmental savings produced by a few fleets of Priuses .
To grasp how absurd such a purchase would be for Huffington at this stage of her corporate career , consider that News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch flew commercial after he 'd already assembled a global newspaper empire and bought the 20th Century Fox movie studio and started the Fox television network .
He only switched to a private plane , biographer Michael Wolff has written , after then - underling Barry Diller got one first .
And yet Huffington is lecturing America on corporate excess .
Luckily for her , being a hypocrite has never really kept the internet publisher from making her political points forcefully — and often quite effectively .
The only question is whether it will keep her from building a real business out of her publication .

JERUSALEM 
He occupies the driver ’s seat with an air of insouciance , a blue helmet atop his head , two proud white steeds under his command and a sly smile across his lips .
Bruno Schulz looks out at the world from his painting as if he owns it .
But like much else in his life , cut short by a Nazi bullet , this is pure fantasy .
The work and story of Schulz , a Jewish writer and painter in Poland who was forced to illustrate a children ’s playroom in a Nazi officer ’s home and then killed , have long attracted literary attention .
There was something about his humility , talent and fate that captivated writers like Cynthia Ozick , Philip Roth and David Grossman , who all made him a character in their works .
Yet until the wall drawings for children were discovered in 2001 by a documentary filmmaker , fading and peeling like ancient Roman frescoes , they were thought to have been destroyed .
Spirited out of Schulz ’s hometown in what is now Ukraine under contested circumstances by the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Israel , they have been painstakingly preserved and put on view here for the first time .

And while this haunting show , a permanent exhibition titled “ Wall Painting Under Coercion , ” will not end the lingering controversy over whether Schulz belongs more to Polish than to Jewish culture , or whether the wall drawings should have remained in Ukraine rather than go to Israel , it offers a poignant example of artistic defiance in the face of overwhelming cruelty .

How should we make economic forecasts ?
James Reade , David Hendry
A vital challenge confronting economists is how to forecast , especially during a recession because livelihoods depend on those forecasts .
This column discusses choosing amongst forecasts and outlines the concerns involved in averaging across models or using general - to - specific model searches .
A vital challenge confronting economists is how to forecast .
The task is yet more exacting but ever more pertinent during a recession because livelihoods seem to depend on forecasts – will unemployment fall soon enough to stave off foreclosures ?
Perhaps unsurprising then is a recent clash in the blogosphere over forecasting US GDP in the coming quarters .
Greg Mankiw contested the US government ’s forecasts of GDP growth , questioning the trend stationarity assumption upon which the forecasts were made .
Paul Krugman wrote an outraged response , accusing Mankiw of “ evil wonkishness ” .
Brad DeLong weighed in too , pointing out that a univariate analysis was “ useless ” ; unemployment must be included in the analysis .
The exchange emphasises not just that economic variables are important in forecasts , but that econometric issues matter .
If GDP is trend stationary , the implications are very different for forecasting than if GDP is a random walk with drift – one will correct to some equilibrium , the other wo n’t .
Economic nuances matter too – what other variables make up this equilibrium relationship ?
Historically , there has been such a steady state , but whether that is the same one to which we will soon correct is unclear , and bad forecasts may result .
Finally , much has been made of prediction markets as effective forecasting models ( Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2004 ) .
Market participants in prediction markets buy and sell contracts whose payoff is contingent on a particular event happening , such as a recession in the US by the end of 2008 .
Evidence suggests that such markets are well calibrated ; if a contract is at 90 % , then 9 times out of 10 that contract will pay out ( Smith , Paton and Vaughan - Williams 2006 ; Croxson and Reade 2008 ) .
Perhaps the way forward is to forecast using prediction markets ?
Judging forecasts
With econometric models of forecasting , we tend to only consider one realisation of reality and judge model and strategy .
This is somewhat akin to judging InTrade , one of the most popular prediction markets , based on one market , for example the “ Dow to close higher than previous close ” market , plotted above for June 9 2009 .
Even at 3:45 pm the market was priced at 88 , implying a 88 % chance of the Dow ending higher .
As can be inferred , the Dow ended lower .
But based on the 3:24 pm price for 1000 days , this may have been one of the 120 contracts to efficiently fail to pay out .
The technique followed for forecasting matters , and we should not judge it based on one realisation .
Figure 1 . An InTrade realisation
Prediction markets , particularly on frequent similar events such as soccer matches , provide an excellent natural “ simulation ” study to determine forecast accuracy .
By considering thousands of sports matches , we can ascertain the accuracy of prediction markets .
With the economy , and with econometric methods for forecasting , we generally do not have such ability .
Monte Carlo simulation affords us something akin to this .
We generate thousands of artificial datasets , run our models and assess the outcomes .
If a technique performs well in simulation , then we might consider using it to forecast the next period , just as we might consider using the InTrade price for an economic recovery in 2009Q1 as an accurate forecast given its track record .
Of course , trusting prediction markets to forecast well in the future relies on the assumption that the event they are predicting is stationary ; that soccer matches do not suddenly change in their nature overnight – the goals are n’t widened or the rules drastically altered .
In that non-stationary situation , it would be impossible to know whether InTrade would continue to forecast well .
Prediction markets can be viewed as a form of forecast pooling or model averaging , a common forecast technique ( Bates and Granger 1969 , Hoeting et al 1999 and Stock and Watson 2004 ) .
That is , forecasts from different models are combined to produce a single forecast .
In prediction markets , each market participant makes a forecast based on his or her own forecasting model , and the market price is some function of each of these individual forecasts .
Averaging forecasts
Averaging forecasts is motivated by the perceived difficulty of choosing a single model .
It is often not clear in advance which model will forecast best , thus we take the insurance of averaging over a number of models .
We forecast worse than the best model ( the premium ) , but we forecast better than the worst model ( the pay out ) by smoothing forecast errors .
However , is this a sensible strategy ?
Do we do better by averaging ?
The alternative to averaging forecasts is to select one particular forecast , but framed in the context of 2 K possible models for K variables in a dataset , choosing the “ right ” model seems an impossible task when K is at all large .
But judging success of selecting a model by whether one selects the “ true ” model is not a useful metric .
There will be many models quite similar to the “ true ” model that will also perform well , and selecting any one of these models is a more realistic target than just choosing the “ true ” model .
Furthermore , that metric would rule out using standard statistical tests on the “ true ” model : one t- test in a four - variable true model with true t-ratios of 4 for each variable would reject 10 % of the time ( Hendry and Krolzig 2005 ) .
General - to - specific modelling vs. forecast averaging
Hendry ( 1995 ) emphasised a general - to - specific strategy of starting with the most general empirical model possible .
This general model would incorporate variables from all economic theory and previous econometric work .
It should also be well specified , satisfying the assumptions placed on the statistical model .
From there , a search would begin for the simplest model that still satisfied the statistical assumptions .
Hoover and Perez ( 1999 ) and Hendry and Krolzig ( 1999 , 2002 , 2005 ) automated this procedure into a program , allowing multiple path searches .
Monte Carlo simulation of such search algorithms allows something akin to the calibration testing described above , giving a way to assess how well the algorithm performs .
The metric of success to judge between strategies might be forecast success – how often will a forecast turn out accurately ?
Furthermore , other strategies for forecasting such as averaging can be compared in this context .
This is precisely what we have done in recent research , presented at the Royal Economic Society Conference in April .
We find that the differences between a forecast from an averaged set of models performs about as well , and sometimes worse , than a forecast from a model selected by the available general - to - specific model selection package , Autometrics .
1
The figure below plots the mean squared forecast error for a number of forecasting strategies for different levels of significance of variables .
No clear winner emerges .
The simulation uses datasets in which the variables are essentially uncorrelated with each other , and free from misspecification .
Five of the ten variables in the general model are significant , and their significance rises along the horizontal axis .
Forecasting methods that involve significance - based selection between the 10 variables suffer when the true significance level is around 2 .
This “ hump ” is caused by type - II errors – relevant variables are incorrectly omitted causing larger forecasts .
This is true for model selection with Autometrics with a 5 % or 10 % significance level , and is also true for Bayesian Model Averaging ( BMA ) , when model weights are not scaled to sum to unity for a particular regressor ( unconditional ) .
Both penalise bad models or insignificant variables .
On the other hand , these methods perform better when variables are potentially very significant , or not at all significant .
Methods that do not omit these borderline variables , do not exhibit the hump .
Conditional BMA , where weights are scaled to sum to unity for each variable , and Autometrics with a 50 % significance level ( essentially accepting all variables ) do not have a hump but instead produce higher forecast errors throughout .
Our simulations are on simple , small datasets , yet undoubtedly have implications for wider work .
The performance of averaging depends on selection ;
How do you select the set of models you average over ?
Averaging does not escape the difficulties of selection – bad forecasts must be omitted from those averaged over .
Non-stationarity has been mentioned – our simulations in that context appear to reverse many of the orderings of forecasting methods found in the stationary case above .
Clements and Hendry ( 2004 ) provide some reasons why this might be the case .
Fortunately , the econometric theory of model selection has advanced , as have computer packages implementing it automatically .
Doornik ( 2009 ) compares Autometrics to other well - used selection packages , such as stepwise regression , and find Autometrics performs much more effectively .
Conclusion
One must take forecasting technique seriously , and issues surrounding model selection cannot be ignored .
Good forecasts rely on good models , regardless of how the final forecast is composed .
A prediction market populated by toddlers will not forecast the next UK election winner simply because it is a prediction market .

There seems to be no end to companies saying they offer real time search these days .
And no end to people quoting how Google itself says it wants to improve in the area .
But what does real time search really mean ?
This article offers some definitions and focuses on players in the space .
Real Time By Any Other Name Would Smell As Tweet
For me , “ real time search ” means looking through material that literally is published in real time .
In other words , material where there ’s practically no delay between composition and publishing .
You take a picture and seconds later , it ’s posted to the world to see .
You think of something , immediately tap it out on Twitter , and your tweet is shared almost as soon as you thought of it .
What ’s NOT real time publishing ?
Blogging , for the most part .
A post has to be written , which typically will be at least a few paragraphs long .
It may involve some research , taking more time .
It may involve a ton of research , taking even more time .
The mere act of creating and publishing the post will likely take more than a minute , if not several .
Publishing in minutes is n’t the same as publishing in real time ?
Nope .
Not when the time to publish a tweet is seconds .
You see something , hear something , want to say something , feel an earthquake happening –- you bang it into a simple box and bam , you ’ve microblogged .
Microblog , by the way , is my generic word of choice for the moment to represent what we do on Twitter when we post , or when we do a “ status update ” on Facebook , or a post on FriendFeed .
It ’s not a perfect word , but “ status search ” or “ update search ” sound stupid ; “ activity stream search ” sounds like something out of Ghostbusters .
Microblogging fits better than those ; I ’m open to alternatives .
What about news content ?
With few exceptions , news content is n’t instantly posted online , and there ’s still that same “ minutes ” to publish aspect as with blogs .
How about the fact that Google can return “ fresh ” content sometimes within minutes of that material first being published .
Yes , Google does this .
But the material itself was n’t published in real time , nor does it make Google into a real time search engine .
That blog post or web page or news article took time to compose between the original thought and the actual publishing event .
It did n’t go out in real time .
How about mining social media sites like Delicious or Digg ?
Some social sharing activity fits into the real time publishing model .
But social bookmarking or social news sharing is n’t necessarily real time to me ( How Search - Like Are Social Media Sites ?
provides a deeper look at different types of social media sites ) .
That ’s especially true when you consider that most of what ’s shared through news sites like Digg itself already was n’t published in real time .
When I see such services included in a “ real time ” search engine , it usually indicates to me that they ’re trying to be more than a Twitter search service as best they can .
Twitter , of course , is the real time publishing leader — the leading microblogging service .
So much material is published by so many people so quickly through Twitter that real time search is largely synonymous with searching tweets .
Yes , there are alternative real time publishing platforms .
You can Twitpic photos within seconds .
But a mass audience does n’t really know about your picture until you tweet the Twitpic URL , I ’d say .
Sure you can share thoughts through Facebook status updates .
But those updates are n’t readily available to the entire world .
In the real time publishing solar system , Twitter is the Sun around which everything else currently revolves .
And that leads to the Twitter problem , for those trying to offer real time search .
The Twitter Firehose
People tweet a lot .
So much so that there ’s no way for even the champion of crawling content quickly , Google , to catch it all .
To index every tweet – as it happens , and if Google could even find them all – would probably bring Twitter ’s web site to a halt under the external load .
Instead , anyone who wants to fully index the Twittersphere in real time needs access to what ’s known as the Twitter Firehose feed , effectively a direct blast of all the tweets as they happen , piped directly to a partner .
Twitter said last year that only four companies were getting the firehose data .
One partner they purchased , Summize — which is now Twitter Search .
FriendFeed was only getting it for a subset of Twitterers who also use FriendFeed .
It ’s unclear if Zappos really got the entire thing or still gets it .
Twittervision might still get it , but I suspect they ’re now using the Twitter API .
It ’s unclear who , if anyone , is still getting it .
The Twitter API allows partners to conduct searches at Twitter automatically , to bring back data to someone based on those they ’re following or tap into Twitter data in other ways .
However , the API limits how much data can be requested and does not give access to everything Twitter has stored .
The major search engines like Google , Bing and Yahoo want the firehose data .
Twitter ’s been talking to them , but no agreements have been reached .
This seems less to do with any technical issues and far more to do with financial ones .
If Twitter gives Google its firehose , it loses a unique feature , that of Twitter Search as the only service with the ability to search all tweets ( when Twitter Search actually works right , more on that in a bit ) .
Access to the Twitter firehose wo n’t come at a cheap price .
Searching Tweets Versus Tweeted Links
So one challenge for any real time search player is how to get Twitter ’s data .
Another is what type of search to offer using that data .
Do you let people search through what ’s being said — to find tweets — such as what ’s going on in Iran ?
Or do you try to mine links that are being tweeted , such as to hot news articles about Iran that are being shared through microblogging ?
These are two entirely different things yet “ real time search ” is applied to both of them , creating confusion .
To me , “ real time search ” should be reserved for searching what ’s being tweeted , what people are talking about , what they ’re microblogging .
“ Real Time Chat ” or “ Real Time Talk , ” if you need a different name for it .
Maybe “ microblog search . ”
Just as news search covers what ’s being published from news sources , real time search for me covers what ’s being said in real time , not links that are being passed around .
As for the links , services that mine these can be useful .
But link - based search does n’t necessarily correspond to fresh content .
For example , some microblogged links will be tops in some “ real time ” search engines based on tweets over a long period of time .
Even when the links are for new material , being passed around in real time does n’t equate to being real time content .
“ Hot Search ” or “ Popularity Search ” might be better names for these services .
But since the “ real time ” theme is hot right now , I do n’t expect the names to clarify .
Confusion will continue .
Major Microblogging Players = Major Real Time Search Players
With some definitions out of the way , it ’s time to dive into services to use for real time search .
By that , I mean the services that let you search through real time microblogged content .
After that , I ’ll talk about those that let you see what ’s hot based on real time publishing .
Twitter Search
No one has better access to what ’s been tweeted than Twitter .
And since Twitter is the king of real time publishers , Twitter Search is also the king of real time search .
Visit the site , enter what you ’re looking for , and you ’ll see everything being published as it goes out ( except from the relatively few who “ protect ” their updates and do n’t release them to the public ) .
Unfortunately , Twitter Search has been plagued with problems recently .
Trying to locate something you tweeted in the past ?
Use the advanced search page , and despite the many options offered , you might not find what you ’re looking for .
You ’ve not lost your mind .
Twitter Search has simply lost your tweet .
I want to write a song about it .
“ To all the tweets I ’ve lost before … ”
The missing tweets are one reason why Twitter should offer all users the ability to export their tweets , in the way blog posts can be exported from one blogging provider to another .
It reassures users that their microblogged content will remain accessible even if Twitter fails .
And good news — after I tweeted wanting this yesterday , Twitter cofounder Ev Williams tweeted back that it ’s in the works :
@dannysullivan
I agree we should do this .
It ’s on the list — as is extending the search window .
Twitter Search also faces problems with spam .
When the primary ranking mechanism in a search engine is publish time , it ’s pretty easy to spam the results .
These past articles from me explain this in more depth
Those using Firefox should also check out our Clean Tweets : New Add - On Zaps Twitter Spam article , which covers how the Clean Tweets add - on for Firefox can help .
What will come from Twitter Search ?
Will spam filtering improve ?
Will we see some type of authority metric mixed into ranking results ?
All we know that things tend to move slowly with Twitter — and also so far , Twitter Search still seems to have the most complete access to Twitter ’s data .
FriendFeed
When Twitter goes down , where do you go to as an alternative for getting that important thought out of your head and into the world in real time ?
For me , it ’s FriendFeed .
There might be relatively few like me , but I still think FriendFeed will grow an important microblogging service .
Originally , FriendFeed was more a place where you could pull together all your social activities into one single feed .
You could ( and still can ) link your blog , your Flickr account , your YouTube account , submissions to Digg , things bookmarked on Delicious and more to your FriendFeed account .
Do this , and you have a megafeed of everything you ’ve done .
That makes it easy for your friends ( or others ) to track what you do .
FriendFeed is n’t limited to flowing in stuff from elsewhere .
Just like Twitter , you can post thoughts that anyone can see through the FriendFeed service .
Just enter something into the posting box similar to how you ’d tweet :
Do that , and what you ’ve written goes out , Twitter - style .
The arrows in the screenshot above point at the box and also how you can “ CC ” what you ’ve posted to go out also to your Twitter account , if you ’ve linked it to FriendFeed .
What you tweet on Twitter can also flow into FriendFeed — which I highly recommend .
More on this in a bit .
FriendFeed allows anyone to search against anything being recorded by the service .
Just go to the home page , enter what you ’re interested in , and you ’ll see results come back :
Some of this will be “ real time talk ” or microblog posts — information that ’s been published via Twitter or Facebook , as the screenshot shows .
Some will be information that ’s not real time talk , such as the first item listed , a news article that ’s been shared via Google Reader .
Occasionally , real time talk coming off FriendFeed updates will also appear .
The downside is that FriendFeed is n’t complete .
It wo n’t have all that Twitter or Facebook has .
It only has material from those who make use of the services and explicitly link them to FriendFeed .
Another downside is that there appears to be no easy way to see only what ’s being microblogged on FriendFeed .
For example , if I do these searches :
Then I get back only material being microblogged on Twitter or Facebook , by those who are also FriendFeed users .
But I ca n’t combine them , to see posts from both places at once .
And the “ service : friendfeed ” command does n’t bring back just FriendFeed microblogged posts .
It also brings back items that are bookmarked and a few other things .
So if you ’re after just real time talk , FriendFeed ’s results are a bit polluted with other material .
On the upside , it ’s a wonderful backup to Twitter , for those who are using it to pull in their feeds .
Consider this search on Twitter :
Kind of a bummer .
Apparently , I ’ve never said anything about “ southwest ” on Twitter .
Except , I have :
As you can see , FriendFeed finds them , even when Twitter itself does n’t .
Facebook
Facebook is the closest challenger to Twitter in the real time publishing space , I ’d say .
The service has long had the ability for people to share with friends what they ’re up to .
Similar to Twitter , you ’ve got a box that lets you enter anything :
These “ status updates ” can also be linked to photos , videos or links to material on the web , though they do n’t have to be .
So why is n’t Facebook a leader in the real time search space , like Twitter ?
Because the service does n’t offer real time search — at least not yet .
For one thing , you cannot go to Facebook as you can with Twitter or FriendFeed and search without being logged in .
Then , even if you are logged in , most people do not have the ability to search against status updates .
You can search for people , Facebook Pages , Facebook Groups , Facebook Applications — even the web — but not for what people are microblogging on Facebook .
Facebook is currently testing a new search service with a small group of people that changes this .
For example , here ’s a search for “ 4th of july ” using the new service :
The arrows highlight that I ’ve searched for status updates ( microblog posts ) done from everyone on Facebook .
Not just people I ’ve friended .
Everyone .
Woah !
What about all that privacy stuff !
Relax ( a bit ) .
In another recent change , you can now choose to share your status updates with everyone ( the world ) , or just your friends , friends and their friends , or block them from particular people ( through customize ) :
When someone searches “ everyone , ” the only see posts that have also been shared with everyone .
For some observers , this has all been part of Facebook trying to be more Twitter - like .
Personally , to really succeed against Twitter , I think Facebook needs to simplify the updating process even more ( my To Beat Twitter In Status Update Wars , How About Facebook Lite ? gets into this more ) .
Still , there ’s no denying that plenty of people are microblogging via Facebook .
It ’s clear the service will keep opening things up .
If Facebook users themselves shift more toward sharing with the world , it ’s a major microblogging source to be mined .
NOTE : SINCE THIS WAS WRITTEN , BOTH GOOGLE AND BING HAVE ROLLED OUT REAL TIME SEARCH SERVICES .
SEE FURTHER BELOW .
Meta Real Time Search Engines & Third Party Twitter Search
For those unfamiliar , a “ meta search engine ” is a search engine that allows you to issue a single search and pull back information from more than one search service .
Want results from Google , Yahoo and Bing all at once ?
A meta search engine like Dogpile does this for you .
With microblogging , the situation is somewhat similar .
Twitter is both a microblogging service and a way to search against its own real time posts .
Facebook is a microblogging service with its own developing search engine .
But neither searches outside their own borders .
FriendFeed can pull in from both Twitter and Facebook , plus adds its own microblogging content , and so it would seem to be a meta search service for microblogging .
However , FriendFeed does n’t pull in all content .
It only pulls in content being shared from these places by its own members .
True meta real time search would reach across borders , allowing you to see what people are microblogging on a variety of services .
But we ’re not quite there yet .
With the players I ’ve looked at , no one seems to be tapping into the Facebook “ everyone ” microblog feed .
No one seems to be tapping into FriendFeed ’s stream , either .
Twitter is present , often along with some minor microblogging services .
For the most part , that makes the services below less meta real time search and more third party Twitter search services .
They hold promise for the future , and they offer some interesting features even now .
Collecta
Collecta lets you search against blog posts , articles , comments on blog posts , but those are n’t microblogging , to me .
What is microblogging are the posts it will search against from Twitter , Jaiku and Identica , at the moment .
Twitter ’s the big fish in that pond .
Collecta is one to watch especially if it begins to pull in FriendFeed and Facebook data .
The screenshot above shows how searches can be filtered to just microblogging ( first arrow on the left ) and then you can click on any listing to read in more depth ( second arrow ) :
Flickr results can also be tracked , and that ’s semi-microblogging .
Some people do send their pictures straight to Flickr immediately after shooting them .
You can also read more about Collecta in our article , Collecta And CrowdEye Join The “ Real Time ” Search Club .
Scoopler
Scoopler is both a meta search site for microblogging as well as a service that highlights content being shared through microblogging .
In terms of posts , it only carries microblogged text content from Twitter .
Flickr photo search is included , but Twitpic is absent .
Digg and Delicious are included , but I would n’t consider either of them to be sources of real time data .
Status Search
Brand new , Status Search depends on logging into your Twitter and Facebook accounts ( this is done in a way that Status Search itself does n’t actually see your password , to my understanding ) .
Once you ’ve connected , you can then search updates from your friends and followers in both places at once .
This does n’t provide you an “ everyone ” view , but it ’s also kind of neat to focus on what ’s being said by those you know or are connected with .
Twazzup
The focus here is featuring latest posts from Twitter .
Twazzup also pulls in related pictures from Twitpic , which I like , plus shows most popular links on a topic .
You can also see top contributors ( by default , those being most retweeted on a topic ) .
Twingly Microblog Search
A pure meta microblog search out since January , Twingly Microblog Search in posts from Twitter , Jaiku and Identica and Bleeper .
Others are offered , though I could n’t see how to enable these easily .
Twitter is the big fish , of course .
Mining Links
The services below primarily focus on tapping into links being shared through microblogging service , especially in an attempt to show you what ’s being shared in real time .
CrowdEye
You can do a search of microblogging talk with CrowdEye , using the “ next ” button to see the latest information .
It all comes from Twitter .
The service seems primarily oriented toward helping you find the most popular articles that are being passed around on a particular topic through Twitter .
Read more about CrowdEye in our article , Collecta And CrowdEye Join The “ Real Time ” Search Club .
OneRiot :
One of the veterans of the “ real time search ” space , formerly known as Me.dium , OneRiot does n’t cover real time microblogging at all .
Instead , it ’s designed to show you the most popular shared links based on data it monitors from Twitter , Digg and other unnamed social sharing services ( these are a secret , I ’m told ) .
If you want to know what ’s currently hot in terms of sharing , definitely a place to check out .
If you ’re trying to figure out who should get credit for first sharing an item , OneRiot tries to identify that , too .
For more , see our OneRiot Offers Twitter Search … With a Twist post .
Also take a look at The Inner Workings of a Realtime Search Engine from OneRiot , which discusses how it tried to measure the “ pulse ” of content from a variety of sources , to surface the hottest items at a particular moment .
In related news , OneRiot has just opened its own API for developers , allowing others to tap its results .
Topsy
Like OneRiot , Topsy is designed to help you find the most popular links that are being shared through microblogging .
Currently , it depends entirely on Twitter data .
One thing I particularly like about Topsy is how useful it seems for finding good content that ’s not necessarily new .
For example , a search for url shorteners brings back solid articles that are several weeks old .
While they ’re not being passed around much at the current moment , the “ All Time ” view is helpful .
You can also narrow to popularity on a month , week or day basis .
“ Top Authors ” are also listed for a particular search topic ( how and what exactly this means is n’t explained on the site .
I may update later ) .
Tweetmeme
Tweetmeme allows you to search for or browse the most popular links being passed around on Twitter .
Twittorati
Just out from veteran blog search service Technorati , Twittorati leverages Technorati ’s ratings of top bloggers and blogs to provide top tweeted links based on authority .
And The Major Search Engines ?
While none of the major search engines yet has Twitter ’s firehose of data , they can still be useful for real time search in other ways .
NOTE : Since this was written , Bing rolled out a Twitter search engine in October .
Up Close With Bing ’s Twitter Search Engine describes this in more detail .
Google rolled out a real time search engine that combines Twitter data with other sources in December .
See Google Launches Real Time Search for more information .
Google can give you a back up for Twitter if Twitter search fails .
Do a search like this :
The site : twitter.com lets you search for anything just on the Twitter site ( mostly updates people are making ) for the words you specify ( google os , in this example ) .
You can then use the new “ Show Option ” feature to select “ Recent Results ” and then “ Sorted By Date ” to get the freshest posts at the top .
Easy , huh ?
Well , it ’s an alternative .
Even sorted by freshest , the results will be old compared to Twitter search :
In the example above , the “ freshest ” post was 14 minutes old , while on Twitter Search , the freshest was 10 seconds old .
You can try similar commands with Yahoo and Bing , but I have n’t found them to work near as well .
However , Bing did recently add results that appear when you search for some people by name followed by the word twitter , tweet or using their twitter name :
Bing Adds Twitter Smart Answers explains more about this .
It ’s not the best integration in the world , but it ’s a start — and the first integration by any major search engine .
Better integration would be to show Twitter or other real time search results right within regular searches .
You can get that , but you need Firefox and some add - ons :
An even further improvement would be a dedicated microblog search service from any of the majors .
Some of that will depend on firehose agreements they strike with major providers such as Twitter and Facebook .
In the case of Google , we ’ve also seen hints that a microblog service specifically to tap into Twitter is in the works .
For more about this , see :
Other Services
There are other places to do microblogging beyond Twitter , FriendFeed and Facebook .
MySpace offers its “ Status and Mood ” box .
LinkedIn has its “ Network Update ” box .
Dedicated services like Plurk and Identi.ca are still out there .
But these are the Plutos of the microblogging solar system , I ’d say ( in terms of social networking , MySpace and LinkedIn are , of course , major planets ) .
Relatively few people seem to use these alternatives to microblog compared to the major players above .
At MySpace and LinkedIn , there ’s also no way that I can see to do a search restricted to microblogging .
As for third party microblog search engines , I know there are some I have n’t covered in the lists above .
I looked at plenty , and the ones above stood out to me personally in some way .
Got your own favorite ?
Operate a service not mentioned ?
Well , you can comment below .
Here are some I also visited briefly :
almost .at : No searching .
Instead , pick from predefined topics and see microblogged content , images and links scroll .

This pulls up pages within the site itself , supposedly protecting you from being tracked .
Not sure how that goes if those pages still carry tracking codes ( Twitter pages that loaded still had Google Analytics code that should register your visit , for example ) .

Conclusion
Much of real time search remains a waiting game .
We wait to see how Twitter will improve its own service .
We wait to see how Facebook opens up status updates .
We wait to see if FriendFeed will be able to pull in the full firehose of data from both places , which would strengthen it even more .
We wait to see if any of the other services will get further data , or which one of them tapping into link data may emerge with the largest audience .
Most of all , we wait on the major search engines , to see how they ’ll integrate real time search — or not .
And if they do n’t get there ?
Right now , I find real time search pretty compelling .
It ’s a new area which seems to have lots of prospects for advertising ( when people check to see if Time Warner has gone down , Comcast having an ad to entice them away is pretty well targeted ) .
It ’s an area that can provide fast answers that news or blog search can’t match ( along with disadvantages that speed can also spread false rumors .
Proposition 8 was n’t overturned .
Jeff Goldblum is n’t dead ) .
The link data and activity is also enticing .
Google ’s Marissa Mayer is out this week talking again in a Guardian article about the potential that can be mined from real time data :
We think the real - time search is incredibly important and the real - time data that ’s coming online can be super - useful in terms of us finding out something like , you know , is this conference today any good ?
Is it warmer in San Francisco than it is in Silicon Valley ?
You can actually look at tweets and see those sorts of patterns , so there ’s a lot of useful information about real time and your actions that we think ultimately will reinvent search .
Still , some of the hype needs to be dialed down .
Go back to 2004 , and there was plenty of talk that the major search engines were somehow missing out on a major opportunity by not offering blog search .
Go back further , and when Google acquired Blogger , you had people speculating the purchase was necessary in order to better find information on the web .
Blogger did n’t help Google with blog search .
It certainly did n’t help improve search overall .
And while Google is the only major search engine today to offer blog search , no one suggests that this is why it has a lead over Yahoo and Bing .
Google Blog Search is n’t even Google ’s top sites .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I ’m glad Google offers it and continues to improve it .
But blog search did n’t turn into some secret weapon .
Real time search probably wo n’t , either .
But it does deserve attention , and it ’s an exciting space to watch develop .
Postscript : I forgot to mention that many of the players I ’ve mentioned will be taking part at the Real - Time Stream And 4th Annual CrunchUp At August Capital event tomorrow backed by TechCrunch .
Good information should be coming out of the event , and I ’ll be there for it .
Spanish prosecutors have decided to press forward with a criminal investigation targeting former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and five top associates over their role in the torture of five Spanish citizens held at Guantánamo , several reliable sources close to the investigation have told The Daily Beast .
Their decision is expected to be announced on Tuesday before the Spanish central criminal court , the Audencia Nacional , in Madrid .
But the decision is likely to raise concerns with the human - rights community on other points :
They will seek to have the case referred to a different judge .
Both Washington and Madrid appear determined not to allow the pending criminal investigation to get in the way of improved relations .
The six defendants — in addition to Gonzales , Federal Appeals Court Judge and former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , University of California law professor and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , former Defense Department general counsel and current Chevron lawyer William J. Haynes II , Vice President Cheney ’s former chief of staff David Addington , and former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith — are accused of having given the green light to the torture and mistreatment of prisoners held in U.S. detention in “ the war on terror . ”
The case arises in the context of a pending proceeding before the court involving terrorism charges against five Spaniards formerly held at Guantánamo .
A group of human - rights lawyers originally filed a criminal complaint asking the court to look at the possibility of charges against the six American lawyers .
Baltasar Garzón Real , the investigating judge , accepted the complaint and referred it to Spanish prosecutors for a view as to whether they would accept the case and press it forward .
“ The evidence provided was more than sufficient to justify a more comprehensive investigation , ” one of the lawyers associated with the prosecution stated .
But prosecutors will also ask that Judge Garzón , an internationally known figure due to his management of the case against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and other high - profile cases , step aside .
The case originally came to Garzón because he presided over efforts to bring terrorism charges against the five Spaniards previously held at Guantánamo .
Spanish prosecutors consider it “ awkward ” for the same judge to have both the case against former U.S. officials based on the possible torture of the five Spaniards at Guantánamo and the case against those very same Spaniards .
A source close to the prosecution also noted that there was concern about the reaction to the case in some parts of the U.S. media , where it had been viewed , incorrectly , as a sort of personal frolic of Judge Garzón .
Instead , the prosecutors will ask Garzón to transfer the case to Judge Ismail Moreno , who is currently handling an investigation into kidnapping charges surrounding the CIA ’s use of facilities as a safe harbor in connection with the seizure of Khalid el - Masri , a German greengrocer who was seized and held at various CIA blacksites for about half a year as a result of mistaken identity .
The decision on the transfer will be up to Judge Garzón in the first instance , and he is expected to make a quick ruling .
If he denies the request , it may be appealed .
Judge Garzón ’s name grabs headlines in Spain today less because of his involvement in the Gonzales torture case than because of his supervision of the Gürtel affair , in which leading figures of the conservative Partido Popular in Madrid and Valencia are now under investigation or indictment on suspicions of corruptly awarding public - works contracts .
Garzón is also the nation ’s leading counterterrorism judge , responsible for hundreds of investigations targeting Basque terrorist groups , as well as a major recent effort to identify and root out al Qaeda affiliates operating in the Spanish enclaves of North Africa .
Announcement of the prosecutor ’s decision was delayed until after the Easter holiday in order not to interfere with a series of meetings between President Barack Obama and Spanish Prime Minister José Zapatero .
However , contrary to a claim contained in an editorial on April 8 in the Wall Street Journal , the Obama State Department has been in steady contact with the Spanish government about the case .
Shortly after the case was filed on March 17 , chief prosecutor Javier Zaragoza was invited to the U.S. embassy in Madrid to brief members of the embassy staff about the matter .
A person in attendance at the meeting described the process as “ correct and formal . ”
The Spanish prosecutors briefed the American diplomats on the status of the case , how it arose , the nature of the allegations raised against the former U.S. government officials .
The Americans “ were basically there just to collect information , ” the source stated .
The Spanish prosecutors advised the Americans that they would suspend their investigation if at any point the United States were to undertake an investigation of its own into these matters .
They pressed to know whether any such investigation was pending .
These inquiries met with no answer from the U.S. side .
Spanish officials are highly conscious of the political context of the case and have measured the Obama administration ’s low - key reaction attentively .
Although Spain is a NATO ally that initially supported “ the war on terror ” under Bush with a commitment of troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan , relations with the Bush administration deteriorated after Zapatero became prime minister and acted quickly to withdraw the Spanish contingent in Iraq .
In the 2008 presidential campaign , Republican John McCain referred to Spain as a hostile state in comments that mystified Spaniards ( it appears that McCain may have confused Spain with Venezuela and Zapatero with Hugo Chávez ) .
Recently , the United States and Spain also wrangled over Spain ’s decision to withdraw its troop commitment in Kosovo as well .
Both Zapatero and Obama , however , have given a high priority to improving relations between the two long - standing allies .
Spanish newspapers hailed the fact that Obama referred to Zapatero three times as “ my good friend ” during the recent European summit meetings , a sharp contrast with meetings at which former President Bush gave Zapatero a cold shoulder .
Both Washington and Madrid appear determined not to allow the pending criminal investigation to get in the way of improved relations , which both desire , particularly in regard to coordinated economic policy to confront the current financial crisis and a reshaped NATO mandate for action in Afghanistan .
With the case now proceeding , that will be more of a challenge .
The reaction on American editorial pages is divided — some questioning sharply why the Obama administration is not conducting an investigation , which is implicitly the question raised by the Spanish prosecutors .
Publications loyal to the Bush team argue that the Spanish investigation is an “ intrusion ” into American affairs , even when those affairs involve the torture of five Spaniards on Cuba .
The Bush Six labored at length to create a legal black hole in which they could implement their policies safe from the scrutiny of American courts and the American media .
Perhaps they achieved much of their objective , but the law of unintended consequences has kicked in .
If U.S. courts and prosecutors will not address the matter because of a lack of jurisdiction , foreign courts appear only too happy to step in .

Muslims have lived in South Africa for hundreds of years - but Islamic marriages remain unrecognised in law , making divorce potentially disastrous for women .
As the BBC's Mohammed Allie reports from Cape Town , that situation could be about to change .
For 300 years one of the major issues for Muslims has been that their marriages are n't recognised and their children are illegitimate
Rashied Omar
Imam Nashita Davids was married for more than 12 years , but like many South African women she is now divorced .
Unlike most other women , however , this means she has been left in poverty .
" Financially we are messed up , I only actually want what is rightfully mine , what I 've worked for , what I 've sweated for , " she says .
" Not just for me , but for my kids , that 's all that I want . "
She says she lived in a home to which she and her husband both contributed - but following her divorce she was left with nothing and was forced to move back to her parents ' house .
South African couples who marry legally do so in community of property , which allows both parties an equal share of material possessions in the event of a divorce .
But women married under Muslim rites have endless problems .
' Psychological victory '
For the past 15 years South Africa 's Muslims have been discussing the implementation of a so - called Muslim Personal Law - which would recognise Islamic marriages .
Woman can be left penniless after a break - up
But the legislation has been delayed by a lack of consensus among Muslims .
Cape Town religious leader Rashied Omar believes the implementation of Muslim Personal Law , particularly the recognition of Muslim marriages , is long overdue .
" For 300 years one of the major issues for Muslims has been that their marriages are n't recognised and their children are illegitimate , " he says .
" In terms of a psychological victory for them - I think they will feel part of the whole democratic process . "
However , some clerics say South Africa 's secular constitution cannot be allowed to supersede Islamic law .
Mohammad de Vries , of the Islamic Unity Convention , opposes the implementation of the bill in its current form .
" For the past 350 year or more we have successfully been regulating our Muslim marriages , " he says .
" We do n't need to go into such a bill and afterwards find out what the consequences of this bill are going to be . "
' Checks and balances '
The bill deals with inheritance , maintenance and divorce - but the issue of marriage is the most crucial since the other matters inevitably originate from marriage .
Mr de Vries , and some other Muslims , fear Sharia law could be compromised by the secular constitution .
Nashita Davids says she wants only what she worked for They , however , are in the minority in opposing the bill .
Muslim lawyer Igsaan Higgins dismisses their concerns .
" The judge that will sit on a matter like this will be a Muslim judge , " he says .
" You will have members of the Ulema [ Muslim council ] who will be assessors .
" There will be proper checks and balances making sure that the Sharia does not get contaminated . "
Mr Higgins says the Muslim Personal Law will in fact protect the community 's interests .
" There is need for change and the only way to change it is to codify the principles of Muslim law in order to give a voice to those vulnerable members of society prejudiced against by the inherited colonial system , " he says .
The South African government is ready to implement the bill - but they are waiting for the green light from the Muslim community who , after 15 years of discussion , are still battling to reach consensus .

Although President Karzai appeared to back down , activists say the revised law still contains repressive measures and contradicts Afghanistan 's constitution and international treaties it has signed .
Islamic law experts and human rights activists say although the language of the original law has been changed , many of the provisions that alarmed women 's rights groups remain , including : '' Tamkeen is the readiness of the wife to submit to her husband 's reasonable sexual enjoyment , and her prohibition from going out of the house , except in extreme circumstances , without her husband 's permission .
If any of the above provisions are not followed by the wife , she is considered disobedient . ''
The law has been backed by the hardline Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mohseni , who is thought to have influence over the voting intentions of some Shiites , who make up about 20 per cent of the population .
Mr Karzai has assiduously courted such minority leaders in the run-up to Thursday 's election , which is likely to be close , according to a poll released yesterday .
Human Rights
Watch , which has obtained a copy of the final law , called on all candidates to pledge to repeal the law , which it says contradicts Afghanistan 's own constitution .
'' These kinds of barbaric laws were supposed to have been relegated to the past with the overthrow of the Taliban , '' a spokesman said .
A July opinion poll by US democracy group the International Republican Institute showed that although Mr Karzai was up 13 points to 44 per cent since the last survey in May , his closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , had soared from 7 per cent to 26 per cent .
If those numbers prove accurate , it would mean the contest would have to go to a second round run-off vote .
back Microsoft vs Google ; Squaring off as Justice watches Fred Vogelstein writes in Wired that Google is drawing increasing attention from anti-trusters link here .
He notes that it has gotten too big to ignore and perhaps to tolerate but continues to provide excellent software and services , presenting the government with a dilemma .
Break it up or regulate .
Definitely worth reading .
I do not think we can reach a reasonable conclusion on a single all - or - nothing position .
In many respects both Microsoft and Google are natural monopolies , given the advantages to consumers of having a dominant standard and of being first to market .
In operating systems , Windows is what most people used first when they started computing .
Most of us are familiar with it and it works quite well .
Apple 's operating system is not really relevant , an expensive niche product without the large number of add - ons , many free .
Google has now offered an alternative in the form of cloud computing and the Chrome OS .
This follows up on its relationship with Mozilla and the Firefox browser and opens an alternative to computer makers , a market for cheap simple computers like the netbook whose sales have been surprisingly good .
( HP announced today that its Compaq division will soon offer a basic full size laptop for $ 298 . )
Chrome will prosper or not depending on the software that becomes available .
By giving the software away , Google really puts pressure on Microsoft .
Whether Microsoft can come up with an equally good , fast , down - sized modification of Windows and free software will determine its position in this market .
Even if it does , the home computer market will become a duopoly but the advantages of being the standard OS are very high .
I tend to go with Google .
The second big competitive area is search .
Google 's has come to dominate , its quality having stayed consistently ahead of the competition .
Microsoft is trying , as well as a number of other search services .
Microsoft has worked out a 10 - year partnership with Yahoo on search , but for the time being , Google effectively has a monopoly based on quality , tempered by the fact that innovative competition continues to put pressure on Google .
Book scanning is unique in that Google is all by itself for now , although others would like to enter the business .
The proposed settlement with copyright holders is problematic .
It looks as if others will have difficulty entering , if they have to negotiate licensing arrangements with the copyright holders or buy into a deal similar to what Google has worked out .
In other words , the Google deal will be a monopoly with no visible alternative , unless the court forces a major change in terms .
A business we do n't normally think of as separate is the server farms that Google has developed .
They make possible much of what Google does -- indeed , it becomes the cloud in cloud computing .
Its technology appears to be leading - edge .
When it owns the infrastructure , it is tough to compete with .
Vogelstein begins his article , alluding to the speech of Christine Varney several years ago in which she says that " For me , Microsoft is so last century ....
They are not the problem .
I think we are going to continually see a problem , potentially , with Google . "
Varney has now been appointed head of the Justice Department 's antitrust division , making her the government 's most powerful anti-monopoly prosecutor and in a position to do something about Google .
Google will need to watch its behavior to avoid retribution .
Watchful waiting may not be a bad solution in a market with two large and highly competitive players , as well as a lot of small ones .
It still seems to be producing a rapid stream of innovation .

And do not forget the miles upon miles of dark fiber they own !
Google 's mission is to make the world 's information accessible .
The next logical step for Google is to provide that access .
We are already seeing it attempt to do so at a smaller scale in Mountain View .
Couple that with its efforts in ensuring open access in the " white space . "

I am not convinced that operating systems are a natural monopoly .
The Windows monopoly exists because of deal making that shut out competitors such as BeOS .
Prior to this there was no dominant operating system .
Having switched several ( non- geek ) users from Windows to Linux , there is not a lot to learn for most of them - maybe how to install software , because Linux is very different ( usually simpler , but different ) .
Apple now has far too large a market share to be regarded as irrelevant , and their hardware is not expensive on a like for like comparison ( although it is true their product line is missing bottom end products ) .
Chrome OS cannot possible create a duopoly because it is open source .
It will be completely interoperable with Linux , because you can install it on top of Linux ( it is in fact Linux with a bundle of Google software and customisations ) .

Hi , Do n't like to nit-pick , but market dominance as a result of serving the customer well without relying on natural monopoly or network effects is not monopoly .
The performance of Bing on its recent release illustrates how fragile Google 's grip is , and given the switching costs , if anything better comes along , the market will follow .
The ease with which you can type your search into another engine is minuscule compared to how long it would take you to learn a new operating system ...
Hamish .

That depends what you use the search engine for and what you use the operating system for .

Oh my , Google is no more a monopoly than myspace is , the internet is fickle and they could loose dominance inside of several years .
I was floored when she said MS was no longer a problem !!
The hell its not ,
It is however a big campaign contributor ever since they were declared to be a monopoly and then made to apologize and promise not to do it again by the candidate they bought .

Fifteen UK soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 10 days Foreign Secretary David Miliband has insisted fighting in Afghanistan is key to ensuring UK security , after eight soldiers were killed in 24 hours .
Some 184 service personnel have died there since 2001 , more than the 179 killed during the war in Iraq .
But Mr Miliband dismissed calls for UK forces to withdraw , saying they were stopping Afghanistan becoming " a launch pad for attacks " by terrorists .
" This is about the future of Britain , " he added .
Fifteen soldiers have died in 10 days in southern Afghanistan as UK troops continue Operation Panchai Palang , or Panther 's Claw .
See a graph of UK troop deaths in Afghanistan
This major assault against the Taliban in Helmand aims to improve security ahead of next month 's Afghan elections .
Lt Col Nick Richardson , in Afghanistan , told the BBC it had resulted in more casualties because troops had been " taking the battle to the enemy " .
" It 's the only way to secure a future for Afghanistan and ultimately eliminate the risk posed to the international community that the Taliban and insurgents there bring , " he said .
BBC defence and security correspondent Rob Watson
When British troops were first deployed to southern Afghanistan three years ago the then defence secretary expressed the hope that they would complete their mission without a shot being fired .
It has instead been the most high intensity fighting British troops have faced since the Korean War in the 1950s .
To critics , the ferocity of the fighting is proof of how ill thought out the whole mission has been all along .
Defenders of the operation , however , say it was always bound to be difficult and that the casualties while regrettable have been suffered in a worthwhile and winnable cause .
Certainly the deployment to Afghanistan of around 10 % of Britain 's army has proved a real strain on manpower , equipment and finances .
For now at least though , Britain remains firmly committed to staying the course .
" We ask people to remember 9/11 and 7/7 and ask themselves whether they thought trying to prevent this from happening would be a worthwhile cause . "
The Stop the War coalition has announced an emergency protest in London on Monday , calling for British troops to be withdrawn from Afghanistan in light of the heavy losses .
A group spokesman said : " The troop surge which was meant to pacify Helmand province has become a nightmare for the British army .
" This unwinnable war must stop now . "
However , Mr Miliband said troops were there to " ensure that Afghanistan can not again become an incubator for terrorism and a launching pad for attacks on us " .
" This is about the future of Britain because we know that the borderlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan have been used to launch terrible attacks , not just on the US but on Britain as well , " he added .
Britain 's mission in Afghanistan would not be over until the country was secure , he said .
Mr Miliband refuted claims by Conservative leader David Cameron that those fighting on the front line were not properly equipped - particularly with helicopters .
Equipment pledge
The foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had spent £ 10bn on equipment for force protection - including 1,200 new vehicles - in the last five years .
Former defence secretary John Hutton told the BBC it could be time to " tilt the balance " away from funding high - tech equipment for conflict between nations , towards resources for counter insurgency operations .
And Chancellor Alistair Darling said the government would always ensure that front - line troops were well - resourced .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " You can't send troops into the front line and not be prepared to see it through in terms of the equipment , the resources that they need , " he added .
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said many on the front line talked about helicopters being in short supply .
But she added : " Some say they have better personal kit than they 've had before .
" They do complain about the sheer weight of it .
It was 45 C there two weeks ago ... it 's physically absolutely exhausting . "
On Friday in Helmand , five soldiers from the 2nd Battalion The Rifles were killed in two separate blasts near Sangin , while a member of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment died near Nad Ali .
A day earlier , a soldier from 4th Battalion The Rifles was killed in a blast near Nad Ali while another from Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , attached to 1st Battalion Welsh Guards , was killed fighting insurgent forces near Lashkar Gah .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The British soldiers must suspend all activities in Afghanistan and come home Kenneth , London Col Richard Kemp , who commanded troops in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2004 , said : " You develop immense bonds of comradeship between all ranks , and therefore if one of your number is killed or even seriously wounded ... it hits you hard . "
But he added that the Taliban were suffering casualties " in the region of a hundred enemy dead for every one of our dead " , which were not being reported .
Jane Ford , whose son Pte Ben Ford , of Chesterfield , Derbyshire , died in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2007 , backed the UK 's mission .
" We 've got to say to these lads : ' You 're doing a good job ' , " she said .
" We are sorry they 're losing their lives , it 's awful .
But if we pull out now , that bully [ the Taliban ] has won . "
BRITISH CASUALTIES IN AFGHANISTAN MARCH 2006 - JULY 2009 1 : Highest monthly toll with 19 dead including 12 killed when a RAF Nimrod crashes in Afghanistan .
2 : British death toll reaches 100 .
Among the 13 fatalities in June is the first British female soldier .

The Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) has revealed its latest flight simulator runs on Suse Linux - based clusters of Opteron servers and uses an open source graphics platform .
The Defence Science and Technology Organisation 's ( DSTO ) Air Operations Simulation Centre in Melbourne creates virtual words that allow pilots to experience real - world combat situations without leaving the ground .
Greg Combet , Minister for Defence Personnel , Materiel and Science , said the new facility introduces a " far more realistic and immersive experience for pilots and operators " .
" By recreating real - life situations in a virtual environment , this facility allows air combat operations to be rehearsed and evaluated at a significantly reduced cost and without putting ADF personnel in harm 's way , " Combet said in a statement .
According to a Defence spokesman , the simulator boots in about 30 seconds and uses a cluster of 4 - core Opteron 2218 servers , with nVidia Quadro FX 5600G graphics cards .
The avionics and aerodynamics simulations run on a number of 8 - core Opteron systems .
All the nodes run Suse Linux .
Unlike traditional Linux clusters , which focus on throughput , these systems are tuned for real - time performance - using features of the kernel such as memory locking , real - time scheduling and low - delay communication .
The visuals software was written in OpenGL using commercial and open - source scene graph engines and making " heavy use of OpenGL Shader Language programs " for creating effects such as clouds , smoke and vegetation .
The spokesman said the simulator recreates realistic and accurate aerodynamics and avionics models .
The simulation engine is also configurable , which allows the evaluation of " novel systems and concepts " , he said .

A few years ago on these pages , I harshly criticized an article urging New Yorkers to " eat local , " and went so far as to dub the young lady 's column , " The worst economics article ever . "
I am here to report that her record has been smashed .
Floyd Norris 's recent New York Times article on the greenback is hands down the worst economics article I have ever read .
Not only is it jam - packed full of false history , but it uses the falsehoods to justify monstrous crimes , both in the past and present .
The reader with a strong stomach will have to click the above link to appreciate the full enormity of Norris 's accomplishment , but for those with limited attention spans I 'll detail some of its biggest problems below .
Bernanke Saved the Credit Markets ?
The article opens up with claims about the health of the world economy that are misleading at best :
Six months after the financial world seemed to be coming to an end , the world 's economies appear to be recovering .
Banks that seemed to be on the brink of failure less than a year ago are now able to pay back investments made by the Treasury .
It is too early to declare victory , but the world looks much safer than it did only a few months ago .
Credit markets are recovering , to the point that the junk bond market will have its best year ever if it manages not to lose any money over the rest of 2009 .
The stock market has just finished its best six months since 1938 .
If victory is to be had , it will owe a lot to the willingness of American policy makers to set aside cherished policies and simply create money .
And that is one reason it is appropriate to pause and celebrate an unheralded bicentennial :
The father of the greenback , Elbridge Gerry Spaulding , who was born 200 years ago , in 1809 .
( emphasis added )
Now hold on just a second .
I want to challenge this claim that things are now recovering .
Concerning banks paying back their TARP money , I have dealt with that issue here .
Regarding the stock market , Norris is right : it 's way up ( so far ) in 2009 .
But I do n't remember Henry Paulson , Timothy Geithner , Ben Bernanke , or Presidents Bush and Obama ever justifying their rescue programs by saying , " We need to do this to resuscitate the stock market . "
I grant you , they may ( and probably did ) say that the stock market would be helped by their programs , but pumping up stock prices was never the justification given to the American public .
As I recall , the justifications were all about J - O - B - S. Specifically , Paulson told Congress that he needed the $ 700 billion TARP package to save the banks , not because anybody cares about Wall Street fat cats , but because plenty of businesses needed short - term financing to meet their payrolls .
( A lot of us wondered at the time what types of businesses paid their employees with borrowed money , but solving that kind of mystery is why the Treasury secretary makes the big bucks . )
And of course , the Obama administration warned everyone that without pushing through the $ 787 billion " stimulus " package , aggregate demand would collapse even more and the unemployment rate would skyrocket .
So let 's check up on these two things .
Below is a chart ( reproduced from Greg Mankiw's blog ) showing what the administration forecasts were for the unemployment rate , with and without the stimulus package :
So just to be clear , Obama 's economic team warned America that without their stimulus plan , unemployment might flirt with 9 percent , whereas with the Keynesian shot in the arm , unemployment would n't break 8 percent .
After getting the stimulus , the actual unemployment rate is now nearly 10 percent .
It 's true , this awkward set of facts does n't prove that the stimulus was a bad idea .
It is theoretically possible that Obama really did inherit an economy in worse shape than his team realized back in January , and that without the stimulus , the actual unemployment rate now would be , say , 14 percent .
But since plenty of free - market economists were warning that deficit spending just transfers productive resources into the bloated government sector , doing nothing to really help the economy , the above chart should be embarrassing indeed for the Keynesians .
Yes , it 's not the whole story , but it certainly is evidence that the free marketeers were right .
Now what about this issue of the credit markets ?
Norris is n't original in his description ; the conventional wisdom now is that the credit markets were on the verge of collapse , but that the unprecedented Treasury and Fed countermeasures ( concentrated in September and October 2008 ) turned the situation around .
According to this story , it was n't just the overleveraged Wall Street firms that were in trouble ; the amount of credit available to regular , mid-sized businesses — who had n't dabbled in mortgage - backed securities or credit default swaps — was shriveling up .
Paulson and Bernanke swooped in to save the day .
Suppose for a moment , just for fun , that this story about the credit markets is just as backwards as the story about the stimulus package .
What would that mean , if the story is 100 % wrong ?
Well , I guess it would mean that the total amount of business loans was actually rising and in fact at an all - time high , up to the point when Paulson and Bernanke decided to throw caution to the winds .
And then after their heroic intervention , the total amount of business loans fell like a stone .
Can we agree that something like this would mean the story Norris has repeated is exactly backwards ?
Well feast your eyes on this :
Now let 's be fair .
Someone could plausibly argue that the business loans dried up when they did , in response to the collapse of Lehman and so forth .
In this view , the drop that we see in the chart above would have been far greater were it not for the Fed 's rescue efforts and TARP .
( There are other indicators people point to , such as the spreads between different types of debt . )
But notice the similarity with the unemployment situation .
Here too , the raw facts and Occam 's razor suggest that the interventions have hurt the ability of average businesses ( not just the huge beneficiaries of the bailouts ) to obtain financing .
The chart above does n't prove that the TARP and Fed rescues were bad , but by no means should Norris be talking as if the recovery of the credit markets is a self - evident fact .
Fiat Money a Tool for War
Now that we 've cleared that up , let 's return to Norris 's breathtaking article .
Spaulding was that rarest of creatures , a man who succeeded in both business and politics ; a congressman who saw a problem coming and had a solution ready .
It was he who , at the end of 1861 , figured out that the American government simply needed to print money to pay for the Civil War .
It was economic heresy then , but without it this country might not have survived .
Such an idea was then dismissed by some as " fiat money , " money that is money not because it is backed by gold or silver , but because some government says it is money .
That such currencies can fail to work is obvious , as those who lived in Weimar Germany or present - day Zimbabwe have found out .
But notwithstanding those examples , the last 20 years deserve to be remembered as the age of fiat money .
For much of that time , central bankers were revered as heroes for engineering long booms and short , shallow recessions .
( emphasis added )
Wow , this guy Norris is easy to please !
If you throw out the examples where fiat money literally destroyed two economies ( and , arguably , allowed Hitler to seize power in Germany ) then it 's got a pretty good track record .
And to show when it really " worked , " Norris points to the Civil War ( or " War Between the States " for those readers who insist that words matter ) .
Yes , it was economic heresy , but how else could the Union and Confederacy have managed to kill more than 600,000 Americans ?
( The Confederacy famously resorted to the printing press as well . )
It is strange that so few of those who are passionately opposed to war also come out strongly against fiat money .
People ranging from Floyd Norris to Milton Friedman acknowledge that one of the primary " virtues " of fiat money is that it allows the government to spend more on war than citizens would tolerate in taxes or deficits .
Forget arms control agreements — we need spending control !
Fiat Money Didn't Lead to Price Inflation ?
This is an economics article , not a tract on military matters .
If you have never heard someone challenge the notion that the Civil War was a boon for human liberty , let me introduce you to Thomas DiLorenzo and his articles on Abraham Lincoln .
Now we have to return to Norris 's bogus economic history .
Spaulding , wrote [ Cornelius Vanderbilt biographer T.J. ]
Stiles , " performed a true miracle : he conjured money out of nothing , and so contributed more toward the Union victory ( and the future of New York 's financial sector ) than any single battlefield victory . "
How did he do that ?
A congressman from Buffalo , and a banker before and after he was a politician , he was chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee when the government was in danger of running out of money to pay for the Civil War .
He wrote a law that allowed the government to print money and declare it had to be accepted as legal tender .
Until then , the only circulating paper money was notes issued by banks .
Those notes were supposed to be convertible into gold , although the banks had been forced to suspend such conversions at the end of 1861 .
There was no central bank .
To opponents , Spaulding 's plan was simply immoral .
" It will infinitely damage the national credit , " warned Representative Justin S. Morrill of Vermont , adding that it was " a breach of the public faith " that would lead to rampant inflation . …
In the end , Spaulding was proved right .
" It was at once a loan to the government without interest and a national currency , which was so much needed for disbursement in small sums during the pressing exigencies of the war , " he wrote years later in his book , " History of the Legal Tender Paper Money . " …
Contrary to the expectations of Representative Morrill , paper money did not set off sharp inflation over time , and when the paper money eventually was made convertible into gold , there were no lines of people wanting to trade in paper for bullion .
( emphasis added )
It 's a bit odd for a journalist to declare that a politician was " proved right " and then proceed to quote from that same politician 's description of his own plan .
If Norris were writing about the Vietnam War , would his first source be Henry Kissinger 's memoirs ?
In reference to the claim that the new paper money did n't set off sharp inflation , I invite the reader to Google " inflation civil war . "
Of course prices rose when the two sides began printing money to pay for the war — disastrously ( and famously ) in the Confederate states , but also in the Union .
At this fairly official site , we find the following information ( adapted from Table 4 ) :
Granted , when it comes to runaway price inflation , the Confederate states win the prize .
But in the two years following the introduction of Spaulding 's " true miracle , " Union prices rose at an average compound rate of about 25 percent annually .
Stepping back and looking at the broad sweep of US history , we see that when the dollar was anchored to gold , its purchasing power was on average constant for large stretches .
I 'm not sure what the results would have needed to be , in order for Norris to admit that Representative Morrill had been right in his warnings .
Conclusion
You can't believe everything you read , especially when it's from the New York Times .
Printing green pieces of paper does n't make an economy richer .
If done without restraint , it leads to runaway price inflation .
As an added downside , it also allows governments to slaughter millions of people .
( The world wars could not have been waged if the belligerents had stuck to the gold standard . )
Those who adore the all - powerful state should obviously be enchanted with fiat money .
Decent people should loathe it .
One thing I ’ve noticed about beer writers - myself included - is that we tend towards the fringe .
At a certain point , you ’ve drank enough and learned enough about beer that it ’s hard to keep one ’s self interested in the middle - of - the - road , macro - brewed , easily - purchased - at - your - local - Applebee ’s kind of beer .
This article is a challenge to breaking that mold .
And what better way to do it than with a big ole 40 oz .
bottle of “ Champagne ” .
The History
Miller has a moderately interesting and - by virtue of being such a large company - fairly well - documented history .
Miller Brewing Co. was founded in 1855 in Wisconsin by German immigrant Frederick Miller , and High Life was born in 1903 ( making it the oldest still - available Miller product ) .
The brewery made it through The Dark Ages and Macro-ization began in 1966 when the company was bought by W.R. Grace & Co. ( yes , that W.R. Grace ) and 3 years later bought again by Phillip Morris …
… and so on .
Currently , Miller is owned by SABMiller , the second - largest brewer in the world ( behind InBev ) .
Oh , and SABMiller has a partnership with the Molson Coors Brewing Co. called MillerCoors .
Take that , plus Anheuser - Busch ( technically InBev ) and you have almost every beer in the US under the umbrella of two companies .
But I digress .
They also have one of my favorite ad campaigns in recent history .
Does n’t hurt .
The Style
High Life is an American - style Pale Lager , which is basically a lighter , less - flavorful take on a traditional Czech Pilsner .
Characteristics include a straw - yellow coloring and a crisp malty flavor with little or no hops .
Most macrobrews include adjuncts such as rice or corn to clarify , lighten , and increase alcohol content without significantly altering the flavor .
High Life is no exception to this rule .
At 4.7 % ABV , High Life is right down the middle of the road for American macros .
Finally , a quick bit of trivia : “ The Champagne of Beers ” slogan originates from the fact that the beer was 1 ) highly carbonated and 2 ) sold in clear glass bottles .
Nothing at all to do with the supposed quality of the beer .
You can all stop making ironic comments now .
The Tasting
Served in - bottle , the way God intended , so there is n’t much to comment on the pour or the head .
The bottle does make a satisfying hiss as I twist off the screw - top cap , though .
Through the clear bottle , the beer is hay - colored and fizzy as tonic water .
Not much smell through the tiny bottle top .
What I am able to sense is a mixture of bread and funk .
More nostalgia than identifiable odor… all I can think of is the floor of a frat house basement .
The taste is grainy and bready , with a huge adjunct presence .
It ’s less ricey than Bud Light and it ’s brethren , but there ’s a definite corn flavor that only gets worse as the beer warms up .
Sweet malts , spoiled apple and grass .
There ’s the tiniest bit of hops at the very back - barely noticeable until after the beer ’s been swallowed - which lingers on the tongue for just a second .
Aftertaste is nonexistant .
Mouthfeel is light , cold & bubbly .
Incredibly drinkable .
One could easily demolish a six - pack without even noticing .
… at first .
If this was a 12oz .
bottle , things would be bright and cheery .
But , being a 40 ouncer , the beer is warm and the carbonation is completely gone by the time I hit the last 8 ounces .
The character of the brew completely changes without the shield of temperature and bubbles .
It tastes like apple juice , with a slice of bread , all stuck in a blender and left to sit on the counter for a week .
I ’m not sure how , but I managed to choke down the last few sips and put this one to bed .
The Verdict
Full disclosure - High Life is my ‘ binge ’ beer of choice .
Throughout college , and in the rare post - college drinking game , whenever I had to consume mass quantities without losing my cool , High Life was my trusty sidekick .
That said , it ’s a decent American Macro Lager .
Nothing worth writing home about ( save for this article ) , but an enjoyable experience nontheless .
Just make sure it ’s served fresh , bubbly , and ice - cold , preferably in a can .

Designing a portable application to run on many different mobile devices is a challenge .
Screen sizes and pixel densities are different making it difficult to create the One Great Layout .
In addition , mobile devices can change screen orientation , from portrait to landscape and back again .
This is one area where using a markup - based UI language like XUL , with it ’s support for CSS , comes in handy .
Currently , Fennec is being designed and tested to run on Nokia ’s N810 & N900 devices , HTC ’s Touch Pro and Samsung ’s Omnia & Omnia II .
Yes , Fennec can run on other Windows Mobile devices , but we do n’t really test on every possible device … yet .
Joel and the QA crew are working on that , but I digress .
Even with the target devices , we have several screen sizes , pixel densities and orientation requirements to support .
Layout support in XUL and media query support in CSS really do the heavy lifting for us .
The Fennec UI is the same on all these devices , but we have some layout constraints and CSS rules that allow us to morph the UI as the screen changes .
Here are some of the ways we do it :
Use physical dimensions whenever possible .
Padding and margins are set using millimeters , not pixels .
This minimizes the need for special rules for every different screen size and pixel density .
Also , the UI is designed for touch , and the current design size for a touchable UI element is ~ 7.5 mm .
Your finger does n’t change sizes to match the screen 🙂
Use CSS media queries to switch between screen sizes and pixel densities .
Large sized images can be used on large screens / densities , while smaller images can be used on smaller screens / densities .
The result should be an image that is roughly the same physical size on either device .
Use CSS media queries and XUL box rules to flow the UI when the device is rotated .
A toolbar that works well vertically in landscape orientation , probably needs to flow horizontally in portrait orientation .
It ’s all about maximizing the usable space .

Here is some example CSS we use for toggling between large and small screens / densities .
As you can see , we use 400 px as a cutoff :
/* high - res screens */ @media all and ( min- device - width : 401 px ) { toolbarbutton { min-width : 64px ! important ; /* primary button size ( match image pixels ) */ min-height : 64px ! important ; /* primary button size ( match image pixels ) */ } } /* low - res screens */ @media all and ( max - device - width : 400 px ) { toolbarbutton { min-width : 36px ! important ; /* primary button size ( match image pixels ) */ min-height : 36 px ! important ; /* primary button size ( match image pixels ) */ } }
Orientation
The same kind of example , but this time for changing the direction of some UI elements when rotating the screen :
@media ( orientation : landscape ) { # panel - controls { - moz - box - orient : vertical ; - moz - box - ordinal - group : 1 ; /* move to left of screen */ - moz - box - pack : end ; /* force children to align to bottom of screen */ } } @media ( orientation : portrait ) { # panel - controls { - moz - box - orient : horizontal ; - moz - box - ordinal - group : 1000 ; /* move to the bottom of the screen */ - moz - box - pack : start ; /* force children to align to left of screen */ } }
We also use the XUL box wrapping tip , I discussed previously , to allow elements to flow into multiple rows if there is not enough space to hold them in a single row .
If you ’re developing add - ons for Fennec , please keep these situations in mind .
Use the Fennec code as an example of how you can create a great user experience , regardless of screen size or orientation .
A South Australian police officer who allegedly restrained a teenage boy and performed an exorcism during a church youth camp in April has appeared in court .
Roger Sketchley , 28 , is charged with false imprisonment and aggravated assault over what allegedly occurred at a Lutheran camp at Tanunda in the Barossa Valley .
Kym Thomas Bisset , 24 , Stuart David Reimann , 22 , and 45 - year - old Michael John Schultz are facing similar charges over their alleged involvement in the exorcism .
They faced Adelaide Magistrates Court along with Sketchley .
He has been stood down from duty and is to appear in court again next week .
A church spokesman has previously told the media the alleged incident is not condoned by the church and should not have happened .
Just when you thought it was safe to get out your soldering irons , Immigration and Customs Enforcement wants you to know that its agents are still out there , on the lookout for for even more mod chip - wielding nogoodniks and their non- DMCA compliant consoles .
According to the AP , a 27 - year - old CSU student named Matthew Crippen was recently arrested for " modifying Xbox , PlayStation and Wii consoles in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act " and released Monday on $ 5,000 bond .
The dime was dropped on this perp by the Entertainment Software Association , and the raid conducted by Customs agents sometime in May .
He will be arraigned on August 10th , and if convicted , he faces up to 10 years in prison .
Let this be a lesson to you : while the ICE may have its hands full with human slavery , drug trafficking , transnational gangs , and stolen artifacts , there is always time to make an example out of a man that knows his way around the inside of a Playstation .
The Pirate Bay saga took another twist Tuesday as one of the appellate judges set to hear the appeal of the co-founders ' criminal copyright convictions was removed over concerns of bias .
The Swedish judge in question , Fredrik Niemela , owns an unstated number of stock options in the music streaming service , Spotify , which has content deals with members of the Recording Industry Association of America .
Oddly , the content industry asked the Svea Court of Appeal to remove Niemela from the three - judge panel ahead of next month 's hearing .
The industry said it wanted to ensure a fair hearing for the co-founders of the 5 - year - old site who were convicted and sentenced to a year in jail for facilitating copyright infringement .
The industry , however , fought calls for a mistrial amid allegations of judicial misconduct at the trial level .
The latest development comes as the fate of the co-founders remain in a liberty - limbo of sorts following their April convictions for running the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker .
They remain free pending appeal .
The case was brought by the Swedish government and content industry in what best could be described as a joint criminal and civil proceeding .
Pirate Bay founders Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström are the guilty parties .
The site 's future is also locked in the netherworld – as its proposed $ 8 million sale to Global Gaming Factory of Sweden remains stalled amid allegations that the announced purchase was a ruse to increase GGF 's penny stock price .
We 've suggested all along that the deal made no sense , that GGF had slim to no odds of converting millions of file sharers into legitimate , paying customers .
What 's more , adding drama to the ever - mutating Pirate Bay saga , a Stockholm lower court has ordered Sweden 's leading ISP to shutter The Pirate Bay , which lead to The Pirate Bay altering is DNS hosting service and going back online after a brief interruption .
In a statement Tuesday , meanwhile , the court of appeal said the disqualified judge is a " product developer " at Spotify .
All said , the court concluded that the financial interests of the judge and Spotify " constitute grounds for questioning his impartiality . "
Still , the appeals court was untroubled by the lower - court judge who rendered the April convictions .
He also had ties to various pro-copyright groups .
But the court said Swedish trial court judges had a fundamental right to associate with whatever groups that fit their fancy .
However , there 's more .
When the appellate court was reviewing whether the lower court judge was biased , the appeals court removed one of its judges for bias because of her membership in pro-copyright groups .
We did n't make this up .

As all the Right - Wing Christian Conservative Blow - Hard ( RWCCBH ) homophobes down there in the States continue to blather on about how gay marriage is going to destroy traditional marriage , I just keep scratching my head , struggling with all my might to understand just what the $ &# % they 're talking about .
The fact is here in Canada same - sex marriage has been legal nationwide since 2005 and not one traditional marriage that I know of has ever been threatened or damaged in any way whatsoever .
That 's four years and millions of marriages without even one - not one - being threatened in the slightest .
And you better believe that if one ever was it'd be all over the news : " Yes , yes , that 's right , Your Honor , we were happily married for 20 long years , but then this gay marriage bill passed and we saw gays getting hitched and it made our marriage seem so meaningless and empty .
Obviously we had no other option but divorce . "
Personally , I know many people who have gotten divorced in this country , both before and after the legalization of same - sex marriage , and not one of them has ever cited the threat of gay marriage as even a mitigating factor in their relationship 's demise .
I know my own marriage is still going strong , despite this seemingly imminent threat .
I 'm not really sure how other people getting married - whether they be straight , gay , bi or even interspecies - is supposed to threaten my marriage , but I 'm guessing that , when it comes to the RWCCBH homophobes , it probably has something to do with a secret desire to be free of their present marital situations ( a la Larry Craig and Ted Haggard ) .
Now I 'm not saying that all Right - Wing Christian Conservative Blow - Hard homophobes are secretly gay , I 'm just saying that I find it quite interesting that they are all so totally and utterly obsessed with preventing gay marriage from becoming a legal option and that they so passionately insist that the availability of gay marriage is going to somehow threaten their own current marriages .
And , by the way , I 've got no problem with any , or all , of the RWCCBH homophobes being gay , if that 's what they indeed are .
Though I most certainly do have a problem with their hypocrisy .
Further Temptation
I sometimes wonder if the availability of interspecies marriage would tempt the RWCCBH homophobes as much as gay marriage seems to .
Would the possibility of marrying , say , a sheep , cow or zebra cause as much distraction and temptation as same - sex marriage does ?
Would it threaten their current marriages in just the same way ?
How about if it were legal to marry one of your siblings , would such a possibility also cause them to consider fleeing their current spouse ?
I wonder .
Perhaps they should stop worrying about other people 's love lives and life commitments and instead focus on their own for a while .
Because , obviously , it does n't matter if other people are marrying trees , cars , bananas , blow - up dolls or even Siberian huskies , the fact is nothing threatens a person 's marriage but the reality of their own relationship with their spouse ( though , sometimes , a really hot co-worker full of lust and desire can be a bit of a threat too , I guess ) .
Procreation vs. Love
As these RWCCBH homophobes clamor for reasons to deny gays the same rights they themselves enjoy they ridiculously point to procreation and state that marriage is primarily intended to make babies .
Yeah , that 's right , not surprisingly , the main reason for getting married , according to these lovers of all things pre-Enlightenment , is not in fact love , but , rather , to simply produce offspring .
Not wanting to get into the obvious psychological deficiencies and personality disorders that have so clearly inflicted anyone in the modern world who marries for procreation over love , let me just say that I can't really imagine these RWCCBH homophobes denying infertile individuals the right to marry .
Nor can I imagine them disqualifying postmenopausal women from marriage either .
So why the concern with baby - making abilities when it comes to gays ?
I mean , besides the obvious homophobia , hatred and small - mindedness , of course .
Fear and Loathing ... and Bible Study
What 's with these people anyway ?
I mean , they 're scared of everything .
If it 's not God condemning them to hell for masturbating , it 's " socialized " medicine turning their beloved homeland into North Korea , and / or it 's " liberal educated elites " pushing evil , dangerous stuff down their children 's throats .
Stuff like science .
Come on guys , you can't be terrified of everything , can you ?
Me ?
The only thing that really scares me is them .
That is , the only thing that really terrifies me is the possibility of these Right - Wing Christian Conservative Blow - Hard homophobes one day actually taking over America .
It may seem unlikely now , but seeing that their numbers continue to grow almost as fast as their minds continue to close , it is , sadly , a distinct possibility .
And , if it ever were to happen , forget about same - sex marriage .
How about life without science , government services or masturbation ?
And in its place nothing but a shitload of Bible study ?
Yeah , I 'm talking about a take over by the American Taliban .
In which case I suspect that we here in Canada would feel a lot like the Dutch and Belgians in the late - 1930s .
That is , not exactly very safe or secure .

What do n't Europeans do all night ?
Surf the Internet , apparently ,
Arbor Networks has compiled traffic data from 65 ISPs in Europe and North America , all of which showed an intriguing difference in Internet usage patterns .
When time zone differences are accounted for , North American Internet traffic peaks at 11 pm and drops off consistently all night ; European traffic peaks at 7 pm and plummets soon after .
Intriguing questions lie hidden within that one data point .
Perhaps , as some of Arbor 's customers speculated , " Europeans use the Internet less at night , have better social interactions , eat better food , and generally live better lives . "
The data certainly suggests that Europeans tend not to use the Internet for evening reading / entertainment / guild raids , while Americans are increasingly using it to watch video and play games in the evenings .
Arbor 's follow - up investigation of the data showed that P2P , which might be thought somehow responsible for the surge , actually has nothing to do with it — it remains level all day , only surging upwards after midnight .
( The shape of the P2P usage curve is " highly suggestive of either persistent congestion or , more likely , evidence of widespread provider manipulation of P2P traffic rates . "
In other words , throttling is alive and well in North America . )
Credit : Arbor Networks
The 11 pm North American peak fits nicely with the peaks for World of Warcraft , streaming online video , and Steam , though .
Video peaks at midnight EDT , and although it 's hard to say for sure what 's being watched , Arbor has an idea .
" Predictably , traffic grows dramatically to consumer sites like Google ’s YouTube and large CDN / video providers .
Also not surprisingly , we see a large jump in traffic to colo / hosting companies with adult content such as a 40 % jump to ISPrime ( AS23393 ) between 10 pm and 1 am EDT . "
So North Americans spend their evenings playing online games , watching porn , watching online movies and TV shows , and browsing the Web .
But it 's not clear from the data that Europeans are all out having leisurely dinners with plenty of friends ; the US - wide availability of services like Netflix On - Demand , Amazon On - Demand , and Hulu might mean that North Americans and Europeans both watch ungodly amounts of video content , with one group staring at laptop screens and the other at TV sets .
Still , it 's incredible just how quickly the Internet has changed the way North Americans spend their free time , and just how addicting all that on - demand Internet content can be .
Twenty years , ago , for instance , who would have published a 35,000 + word review of Snow Leopard and then displayed it to readers free of charge ?
These are strange and wonderful times in which we live .

Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions affect nearly 43 million Americans , or about one of every six people , making it one of the most prevalent diseases in the United States .
Arthritis comprises a variety of diseases and conditions , including osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , fibromyalgia , lupus , childhood arthritis , gout , bursitis , Lyme arthritis , and carpal tunnel syndrome .
These diseases and conditions can drastically reduce a person 's quality of life .
Arthritis is not just an " old person 's disease " : nearly three of every five people with arthritis are younger than 65 years .
Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States , limiting everyday activities for more than 7 million Americans .
In many cases , arthritis deprives individuals of their independence and disrupts the lives of family members and other caregivers .
In addition , disabilities from arthritis create enormous costs for individuals , their families , and the nation .
Each year , arthritis results in 44 million outpatient visits and almost three - quarters of a million hospitalizations .
Estimated medical care costs for people with arthritis are $ 15 billion annually , and total costs ( medical care and lost productivity ) are estimated at almost $ 65 billion annually .
The impact of arthritis is expected to increase dramatically as " baby boomers " age .
By 2020 , an estimated 60 million Americans , or almost 20 % of the population , will be affected by arthritis , and nearly 12 million will experience activity limitations .

Like a ghost ship , a rogue software program that glided onto the Internet last November has confounded the efforts of top security experts to eradicate the program and trace its origins and purpose , exposing serious weaknesses in the world ’s digital infrastructure .
The program , known as Conficker , uses flaws in Windows software to co-opt machines and link them into a virtual computer that can be commanded remotely by its authors .
With more than five million of these zombies now under its control  government , business and home computers in more than 200 countries  this shadowy computer has power that dwarfs that of the world ’s largest data centers .
Alarmed by the program ’s quick spread after its debut in November , computer security experts from industry , academia and government joined forces in a highly unusual collaboration .
They decoded the program and developed antivirus software that erased it from millions of the computers .
But Conficker ’s persistence and sophistication has squelched the belief of many experts that such global computer infections are a thing of the past .
“ It ’s using the best current practices and state of the art to communicate and to protect itself , ” Rodney Joffe , director of the Conficker Working Group , said of the malicious program .
“ We have not found the trick to take control back from the malware in any way . ”
It was the blooper heard round the world .
In an editorial denouncing Democratic health reform plans , Investor ’s Business Daily tried to frighten its readers by declaring that in Britain , where the government runs health care , the handicapped physicist Stephen Hawking “ would n’t have a chance , ” because the National Health Service would consider his life “ essentially worthless . ”
Professor Hawking , who was born in Britain , has lived there all his life , and has been well cared for by the National Health Service , was not amused .
Besides being vile and stupid , however , the editorial was beside the point .
Investor ’s Business Daily would like you to believe that Obamacare would turn America into Britain  or , rather , a dystopian fantasy version of Britain .
The screamers on talk radio and Fox News would have you believe that the plan is to turn America into the Soviet Union .
But the truth is that the plans on the table would , roughly speaking , turn America into Switzerland  which may be occupied by lederhosen - wearing holey - cheese eaters , but was n’t a socialist hellhole the last time I looked .
Let ’s talk about health care around the advanced world .
Every wealthy country other than the United States guarantees essential care to all its citizens .
There are , however , wide variations in the specifics , with three main approaches taken .

Netbooks , Microsoft , a Turning Point
“ If we win one more such victory … we shall be utterly ruined . ”
Pyrrhus of Epirus , quoted by Plutarch in Life of Pyrrhus .
About 18 months ago a silver ( actually white ) bullet known as the eeePC running Linux appeared .
They were literally sold out immediately ( example story ) – despite the fact that they were pre-loaded with Linux , and well before the onset of austerity from the financial crisis .
Within 2 or 3 months a version of the eeePC running Windows XP was announced , first shipping in early ( perhaps Jan ? ? ) 2008 .
At about the six - eight month mark ( give or take ) people were happy to report the form factor being sold at 70 - 30 % in favour of Linux ( google it or see Brendan Leblanc ’s claim of “ under 10 % ” in the first half of 2008 ) .
Since that time something has happened .
The specifications for this class of portable device have been steadily increasing , closing the gap between them and standard laptops ( so much so , that there may not be a “ netbook ” market anymore ) .
With that the price of these machines has also increased .
Linux versions of the eeePC are either not available at all , or are only available on the lowest specification models .
Microsoft now claims to have dominated the netbook market with Windows installations ( see the Leblanc post referenced above ) .
[ One comment notes that Linux based netbooks are available in China .
I would guess that they are available more generally in SE Asia ( more price sensitivity ) than in the West . ]
Windows / Netbooks = Game Over ?
Microsoft ’s reaction to the success of the eeePC seems , on reflection , to have been well and professionally executed .
Indeed , now that the specifications have been upscaled , Microsoft has announced an intention to increase the licensing fees for this form factor .
That leaves open to question however , how the eeePC was able to be released sans Windows in the first place .
It is difficult to believe that Microsoft had no knowledge of it .
If they did have knowledge , they certainly could have struck a deal over it ( as the fact that they subsequently struck such a deal demonstrates ) .
They presumably chose not to strike such a deal .
Only ASUS and Microsoft really know what happened , but it does not seem wildly outside the evidence available to speculate that ASUS was initially rebuffed by Microsoft and then has had Microsoft approach them cap in hand .
If so , the eeePC has imposed a heavy price on Microsoft .
It was not a monetary price , although Microsoft has been reporting substantially reduced revenues ( indeed , apparently its first ever quarterly revenue decline ) and attributing those reductions to the netbook form factor ( random example stories - one , two and three ) .
Rather , that price was its credibility .
The eeePC experience has indicated :
( a ) that Linux based products can be a commercial success in their own right ; and , as a corollary ,
( b ) that Linux allows manufacturers to dictate terms to Microsoft ;
– and that is the crux of it .
In 2007 - 08 ASUS appears to have achieved what no other computer manufacturer has managed to do in perhaps over 20 years – it dictated the terms of supply of Microsoft ’s products , both in terms of price and availability ( XP ’s sales availability was either ended or imminently to end ) .
Given the position of Microsoft this , of itself , is a remarkable achievement .
However ASUS ’ achievement was even more far reaching .
Not only do they appear to have dictated terms , but the terms were , in effect , that XP be sold both as a commodity and as a complement to the eeePC .
Commoditising your complements is the holy grail of business .
It allows you to extract the most value / price premium from the sale of your products .
Far from showing strength , the wide availability of Windows on netbooks is a sign of weakness .
Looking forward
The eeePC was the proof of concept for a Linux based future .
There is something incredibly powerful about achieving an apparently unachievable goal .
Until something has been shown to be achievable , only the very brave or committed will even attempt it .
However , once something has been shown to be possible , many people suddenly become willing to attempt it , and with more people attempting it , each new comer learns faster from the experiences of others .
Consider the history of scaling Everest , with some 30 years from the first attempt in 1922 to Hillary and Tenzing ’s first successful ascent in 1953 , the time since has been peppered with many additional ascents , including ascents under different conditions such as an ascent without supplementary oxygen , which was once thought too difficult .
It should therefore not be much of a surprise that many companies are now making strategic investments in Linux ( reload the link if you do n’t get there on the first attempt ) .
Some companies ( such as Dell , Acer and HP ) are expressly supporting Linux as a desktop operating system .
Rumours of My Death …
Nothing here should be taken as indicating backruptcy any time soon (- or ever ! ) , or that there is imminent danger of Microsoft ceasing its participation in the IT sector .
It ’s involvement is broad and deep and will not fade for a long time .
General Electric , for example , continues to live on after having diversified into many different areas over the past 100 years ( Wikipedia claims that half of its revenue now comes from financial services ) .
Rather , it seems that the days of Microsoft - as - we - knew - it , the corporation which could dictate , at least to some non-trivial extent , many aspects of the IT industry through its leverage over OEMs are over .
Microsoft cannot afford for an OEM to stare them down on the next eeePC – another Linux based success on the scale of the eeePC would remove any doubt from the minds of the industry .
If this assessment is correct , we would expect to see other industry participants investing in open source , and in Linux in particular , as both a hedge and as negotiating leverage .
Indeed , assuming that ASUS has extracted concessions from Microsoft , other OEMs will be disadvantaged if they do not follow a similar strategy ( see this story on Acer ’s proposed support of Linux for example ) .
Loading Linux now appears to be a path to strength .
Google is pursuing it .
In addition , we would expect to see Microsoft to continue to back track on its licensing requirements .
We have seen the start of this in its removal of the three concurrent applications limitation on the starter edition of Windows 7 , and also in its repeatedly pushing back the end of availability to manufacturing of XP ( it is now 30 June 2010 for the netbook form factor – however despite Microsoft ’s end of sales date ASUS has apparently secured an agreement to load XP on its eeeTop ) .
2008 seemed to be a particularly fruitful year for backpedalling ( including limits on CPU speed , RAM , hard drive size , use of hybrid storage and screen size – apparently screen size for a netbook is now 14.1 ″ , – hardly a substantive limitation on the netbook form factor ) .
[ One comment indicates that the screen size for windows 7 is 10.2 ″ – it will be interesting to see how this plays out , although 12 ″ netbooks do n’t seem to have done that well ]
The Final Analysis
The eeePC experience was the case study for the viability of a Linux based future .
If ASUS has used the Linux eeePC to extract negotiating concessions from Microsoft , then it has , in the process , also undermined Microsoft ’s credibility , opening the way for other vendors to play into this gap .
Further , if ASUS has secured concessions then other vendors who do not pursue an aggressive Linux strategy will put themselves at a disadvantage .
There is therefore an internal logic to the market which will drive support for Linux installations going forward .
Notes :
I ’ve not been able to pinpoint the initial launch date for the eeePC , although it seems to be 16 October 2007 .
I recall , but cannot find a reference to , thieves taking the Linux notebooks , but leaving the Windows based ones behind when they robbed a store .
I think it was in the UK and I think it was around March 08 . [->
See comment from Al , re Elonex netbooks ]
Many secondary documents had to be referred to because primary documents were updated , losing the time relevant information .
The Windows versions of the eeePC were curiously configured in such a way that there was no direct comparison between Linux and Windows versions .
This was also true of some Acer models .
Dell now seems to offer direct comparison ( eg lattitude 2100 ) .
Post script
The eeeTop appears to not be available with Linux – however it is shipping with OpenOffice installed .
I guess other vendors do n’t offer an OpenOffice option on their installs – a quick look at the Dell 2100 indicates that Microsoft Office is available as a customisation on the Windows version , but no office suite is available on the Linux version .
Office suites may be next …
Farhad Manjoo over at Slate has written the best summation to date on Amazon 's 1984 scandal , in which digital versions of the Orwell classic were surreptitiously removed from users '
Kindles without their permission .
Amazon has apologized and promised never to delete books in this fashion in the future .
But Manjoo points out that the real lesson here is that the power to delete digital books remotely exists in the first place :
The worst thing about this story is n't Amazon 's conduct ; it 's the company 's technical capabilities .
Now we know that Amazon can delete anything it wants from your electronic reader .
That 's an awesome power , and Amazon 's justification in this instance is beside the point .
As our media libraries get converted to 1's and 0's , we are at risk of losing what we take for granted today : full ownership of our book and music and movie collections .
Given the frequent desire of various authorities to ban books — whether for expressing dangerous ideas or simply for alleged copyright infringement — this is probably not that last time we have seen this awesome power used , with ominous implications for the future of ideas :
Amazon deleted books that were already available in print , but in our paperless future — when all books exist as files on servers — courts would have the power to make works vanish completely .
Zittrain writes : " Imagine a world in which all copies of once - censored books like Candide , The Call of the Wild , and Ulysses had been permanently destroyed at the time of the censoring and could not be studied or enjoyed after subsequent decision - makers lifted the ban . "
The whole piece is worth a read .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - “ Climate engineering ” projects , such as spraying seawater into the sky to dim sunlight , would be a more effective brake on global warming than increasing taxes on energy , a group of economists said on Friday .
Led by Bjorn Lomborg , a Danish statistician and author of “ The Skeptical Environmentalist , ” a book which questioned orthodox environmental views , the group ranked “ cloud whitening ” as a top option in combating climate change .
“ Climate engineering could provide a cheap , rapid and effective response to global warming , ” the economists said .
Lomborg ’s panel ranked research into “ marine cloud whitening technology ” -- having boats spray seawater droplets into the sky to create clouds -- as the best of 21 ideas reviewed .
They ranked more research into clean energy such as solar and wind power second , ahead of research into spewing tiny dust - like particles high into the atmosphere to block sunlight and research into burying greenhouse gases .
Among the least promising solutions , the group said that : “ carbon taxes would be an expensive , ineffective way to reduce the suffering from global warming . ”
Many governments favor schemes that would place a price on carbon emissions , which would mean higher energy taxes .
“ We should look at climate engineering as a fix for the first 50 to 100 years , ” Lomborg told Reuters of the findings , meant as alternative advice to governments working on a new U.N. climate treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
“ Research into green energy is what is going to fix the climate in the long term , ” he added .
LARGELY SPECULATIVE ?
Earlier this week , Britain ’s main science academy , the Royal Society , recommended more research into climate engineering as an insurance policy but said it was not an alternative to cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases .
And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the scientific group that advises the United Nations , concluded in a 2007 report that technologies such as blocking sunlight “ remain largely speculative and unproven , and with the risks of unknown side - effects . ”
“ We found that climate engineering has great promise , ” Thomas Schelling , a Nobel Prize winning U.S. economist who was in Lomborg ’s group , said in a statement .
“ Even if one approaches it from a skeptical viewpoint , it is important to invest in research to identify the limitations and risks . ”
Others economists in the group were Norwegian Finn Kydland and American Vernon Smith , both Nobel economics laureates , as well as Nancy Stokey from the University of Chicago and Jagdish Bhagwati from Columbia University .
No matter how bored or tired you are , do n’t yawn in Judge Daniel Rozak ’s courtroom , said Matt Bartosik in NBC Chicago .
That ’s the hard lesson Clifton Williams , 33 , learned after one such “ involuntary faux pas ” led the Will County , Ill. , circuit judge to send him to jail for six months .
Williams was only in court to see his cousin Jason Mayfield plead guilty to felony drug charges .
And Mayfield , the felon ?
He got probation and walked free .
Six months in jail “ seems way to harsh , ” said Eric Zorn in the Chicago Tribune , but the loud yawn was clearly “ some sort of inchoate statement of disrespect ” for Judge Rozak .
And Williams ’ “ patently false ” excuse — that it was an involuntary yawn — is like the lame attempts at “ subtle insolence ” a child makes when he or she says , “ I just shut the door , I did n’t slam it . ”
Parents , “ are you with me on this ” ?
Williams ’ dad is n't , said Blair Brettschneider in USA Today .
He said he was “ flabbergasted ” by Judge Rozak ’s jailing of his son .
And surely his sentiment is shared by dozens of cellphone users — ringing cellphones are another contempt - of - court target for Rozak , who is responsible for a full third of the 30 - judge circuit ’s contempt charges since 1999 .
Well , “ residents of Joliet can rest easily now , ” knowing Rozak is on the case , said Kim LaCapria in The Inquisitr .
Thanks to their “ sentence - happy ” judge , Williams wo n’t be starting that new job he had lined up , which means he wo n’t be “ contributing to society or anything harmful like that . ”
Take that , “ shameless yawners . ”
In the long and seemingly futile quest to build a better roach trap , researchers have finally identified the come - hither chemical of the female German cockroach and produced a synthetic version that makes males come running in less than nine seconds .
The search for the sex pheromone has been a top priority for cockroach scientists , but it has been an arduous process because the compound is emitted in very small quantities and is so fragile that it easily degrades during laboratory analysis .
The new synthetic version appears to work at least as well as the original , giving scientists hope that they may shift the balance of power in the age - old contest between humans and cockroaches -- creatures widely believed to be capable of surviving nuclear war .
“ Chemists have been trying to get this pheromone for decades , ” said Wendell Roelofs , a professor of insect biochemistry at Cornell University and one of the study ’s authors .

The compound that lures males to their potential mates is so powerful that cockroaches near death from starvation will forgo peanut butter for a chance to copulate , said Coby Schal , a professor of entomology at North Carolina State University and coauthor of the study , published today in the journal Science .
“ Invariably , the male will choose the sex pheromone over the food , even though he may die on the way , ” Schal said .
German cockroaches -- half - inch long light brown bugs with dark brown stripes -- are the most prevalent roach species in the world .
Widely reviled , they are responsible for spreading food poisoning , dysentery , cholera and other disease and for triggering asthma in children .

U.S. consumers spend more than $ 1 billion each year to rid their homes of roaches and other pests , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
They barely make a dent in the cockroach population .
Fossil records indicate that cockroaches have inhabited Earth for at least 200 million years .
They are low - maintenance creatures and can survive in a wide range of environments .
They can eat almost anything , including linens , cardboard , leather and bookbindings .
Almost any building will become infested after a certain amount of time .

“ Whether it ’s a restaurant or a warehouse or a farm , cockroaches will somehow find it , ” Schal said .
“ Once they do , it ’s very difficult to get rid of them . ”
With a single female roach capable of producing an average of 350,000 offspring in a single breeding season , pest - control experts know they have lifetime employment .
The best they can do to control the pests is to use food as bait to lure them into traps or to catch them on a glue board if they happened to wander onto it .

The pheromone approach promises to be far more effective , said Greg Baumann , technical director for the National Pest Management Assn. , a trade group based in Fairfax , Va .
“ We would be able to draw them right in , like the runway lights at night at the airport , ” he said .
Pest control experts are eager to get their hands on the synthetic pheromone , according to Steve Burt , who runs the professional pest management business in the U.S. for Bayer Environmental Science , maker of the Maxforce line of roach - fighting products .
He said the compound could lure male roaches into a trap baited with poisoned food , some of which they would take back to their colonies .
Whole nests could be destroyed as cockroaches ate one another ’s feces and even their dead bodies .

“ You want the bait to kill them , but you do n’t want the bait to kill them too fast , ” Burt said .
“ You want them to go back to their harborages and die there .
Then you get a domino effect . ”
Researchers have previously isolated pheromones for lesser roach species , but the version for German cockroaches has resisted easy analysis since its existence was confirmed in 1993 .
First , scientists at North Carolina State methodically dissected female German cockroaches to find the gland that produces the pheromone .
“ It ’s like looking for a needle in a haystack , ” Schal said .

They then extracted the gland from about 15,000 virgin females and sent them to the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station run by Cornell University .
There , scientists used a gas chromatograph to figure out which chemical in the pheromone compound appealed to male cockroaches .
The gas chromatograph isolated the chemicals one by one .
Each was assessed by a disembodied cockroach antenna connected by wire to a detecting device .
When receptors on the antenna recognized the key pheromone ingredient , they fired off electrical signals that the contraption was able to register .

The mystery ingredient was delivered to the State University of New York in Syracuse , where mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging revealed its chemical structure .
A synthetic version of the new compound , named blattelaquinone , was made .
To test their creation , the scientists put male German cockroaches at the base of a 22 - inch plexiglass tube with two branches on the other end .
When the synthetic pheromone was introduced into one of the branches , more than 60 % of the cockroaches began to track it down .
Of those , nearly all ended up at the pheromone target .

A 100 - nanogram dose drew roaches to the sample in an average of 8.9 seconds , the researchers said .
When the sample was reduced to 10 nanograms , the roaches still found it in an average of 16.4 seconds .
The researchers are n’t sure why the fake pheromone did n’t affect about 40 % of the males .
As expected , it had no effect on female or juvenile roaches .

While it is possible that God made miraculous provisions for the daily care of these animals , it is not necessary — or required by Scripture — to appeal to miracles .
According to Scripture , Noah ’s
Ark was a safe haven for representatives of all the kinds of air - breathing land animals that God created .
While it is possible that God made miraculous provisions for the daily care of these animals , it is not necessary — or required by Scripture — to appeal to miracles .
Exploring natural solutions for day - to - day operations does not discount God ’s role : the biblical account hints at plenty of miracles as written , such as God bringing the animals to the Ark ( Genesis 6:20 ; 7:9 , 15 ) .
It turns out that a study of existing , low - tech animal care methods answers trivial objections to the Ark .
In fact , many solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems are rather straightforward .
How Did Noah Fit All the Animals on the Ark ?
According to the Bible , the Ark had three decks ( floors ) .
It is not difficult to show that there was plenty of room for 16,000 animals ( the maximum number of animals on the Ark , if the most liberal approach to counting animals is applied ) , assuming they required approximately the same floor space as animals in typical farm enclosures and laboratories .
The vast majority of the creatures ( birds , reptiles , and mammals ) were small ( the largest only a few hundred pounds of body weight ) .
What ’s more , many could have been housed in groups , which would have further reduced the required space .
It is still necessary to take account of the floor spaces required by large animals , such as elephants and rhinos .
But even these , collectively , do not require a large area because it is most likely that these animals were young , but not newborns .
Even the largest dinosaurs were relatively small when only a few years old .
What Did the Dinosaurs Eat ?
Dinosaurs could have eaten basically the same foods as the other animals .
The large sauropods could have eaten compressed hay , other dried plant material , seeds and grains , and the like .
Carnivorous dinosaurs — if any were meat - eaters before the Flood — could have eaten dried meat , reconstituted dried meat , or slaughtered animals .
Giant tortoises would have been ideal to use as food in this regard .
They were large and needed little food to be maintained themselves .
There are also exotic sources of meat , such as fish that wrap themselves in dry cocoons .
It is not necessary — or required by Scripture — to appeal to miracles for the provision and daily care of the animals on the Ark .
Many solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems are rather straightforward .
How Were the Animals Cared For ?
We must distinguish between the long - term care required for animals kept in zoos and the temporary , emergency care required on the Ark .
The animals ’ comfort and healthy appearance were not essential for emergency survival during one stressful year , where survival was the primary goal .
Studies of nonmechanized animal care indicate that eight people could have fed and watered 16,000 creatures .
The key is to avoid unnecessary walking around .
As the old adage says , “ Do n’t work harder , work smarter . ”
Therefore , Noah probably stored the food and water near each animal .
Even better , drinking water could have been piped into troughs , just as the Chinese have used bamboo pipes for this purpose for thousands of years .
The use of some sort of self - feeders , as is commonly done for birds , would have been relatively easy and probably essential .
Animals that required special care or diets were uncommon and should not have needed an inordinate amount of time from the handlers .
Even animals with the most specialized diets in nature could have been switched to readily sustainable substitute diets .
Of course , this assumes that animals with specialized diets today were likewise specialized at the time of the Flood .
How Did the Animals Breathe ?
Based on my two decades of research , I do not believe that anything more was needed than a basic , non-mechanical ventilation system .
The density of animals on the Ark , compared to the volume of enclosed space , was much less than we find in some modern , mass animal housing used to keep stock raised for food ( such as chicken farms ) , which requires no special mechanical ventilation .
It is reasonable to believe that one relatively small window would have adequately ventilated the Ark .
Of course if there were a window along the top center section , which the Bible allows , all occupants would be even more comfortable .
It is also interesting to note that the convective movement of air , driven by temperature differences between the warm - blooded animals and the cold interior surfaces , would have been significant enough to drive the flow of air .
Plus , wind blowing into the window would have enhanced the ventilation further .
However , if supplementary ventilation was necessary , it could have been provided by wave motion , fire thermal , or even a small number of animals harnessed to slow - moving rotary fans .
What Did Noah and His Family Do with the Animal Waste ?
As much as 12 U.S. tons ( 11 m. tons ) of animal waste may have been produced daily .
The key to keeping the enclosures clean was to avoid the need for Noah and his family to do the work .
The right systems could also prevent the need to change animal bedding .
Noah could have accomplished this in several ways .
One possibility would be to allow the waste to accumulate below the animals , much as we see in modern pet shops .
In this regard , there could have been slatted floors , and animals could have trampled their waste into the pits below .
Small animals , such as birds , could have multiple levels in their enclosures , and waste could have simply accumulated at the bottom of each .
The danger of toxic or explosive manure gases , such as methane , would be alleviated by the constant movement of the Ark , which would have allowed manure gases to be constantly released .
Secondly , methane , which is half the density of air , would quickly find its way out of a small opening such as a window .
There is no reason to believe that the levels of these gases within the Ark would have approached hazardous levels .
Alternatively , sloped floors would have allowed the waste to flow into large central gutters .
Noah ’s family could have then dumped this overboard without an excessive expenditure of manpower .
The problem of manure odor may , at first thought , seem insurmountable .
But we must remember that , throughout most of human history , humans lived together with their farm animals .
Barns , separate from human living quarters , are a relatively recent development .
While the voyage of the Ark may not have been comfortable or easy , it was certainly doable , even under such unprecedented circumstances .
The upcoming PlayStation Portable port of the original Shin Megami Tensei : Persona is due to be released on September 22 , not long before Sony launches its UMD drive - free PSP Go .
To take advantage of the timing , Atlus has announced that the game will be released simultaneously as both a retail game and a downloadable release on the PlayStation Network .
Both versions of the game will run gamers $ 39.99 .
However , Persona fans may want to consider picking up the UMD version of the game , which comes packed with a two - disc CD soundtrack at no additional charge .
Those who decide to go the download route can expect the game to clock in at around 800 MB , though Atlus says that number may get smaller via compression .
Atlus is a company known for its great retail pack - ins — it seems like nearly all of their releases come with at least a soundtrack CD — so it 's good to see the company not abandon that tradition , while at the same time embracing digital distribution .
It 's unfortunate , though , that both versions of the game will cost gamers the same amount , in spite of the obvious benefits of the retail version .
Ben 's thoughts
So you can pay $ 40 to download a digital version of the game , or pay the same amount for a case , a hard copy , as well as a free soundtrack ?
Atlus always creates wonderful retail packaging .
I can't imagine anyone is going to go for the digital version here .
Here 's a crazy stat for you .
The total amount of US backstops and bailouts has reached a staggering $ 23.7 trillion !
How do we know ?
Because TARP watchdog Neil Barofsky is going to say so in his fresh report , and that report was leaked to many top media outlets , like WaPo and Dow Jones .
If it 's available to the public , we certainly can't find it on the SIGTARP website .
The last report that 's up is from April , 21 .
Presumably , one of Neil Barofsky 's main goals is to promote transparency within TARP .
He could start by increasing transparency in his own office , instead of playing footsie with the same old media pals .
After scientists created an “ acoustic black hole ” using Bose - Einstein condensates , our good friends over at Underwire pounded out a list of atrocious albums to throw into the sonic sucker .
As photographers — who rely on light — we 're usually terrified of black holes .
But we enjoyed Underwire ’s black - hole list so much that we and everybody at Wired.com decided to get in on the action .
Gadget Lab tossed annoying gear , Autopia banished bad cars , and Wired Science ousted hideous scientific clichés .
Now it ’s our turn .
Here are our top photography pet peeves that we would like to throw into the abyss .
Trite Flickr Comments
I think you all know what we 're talking about .
You attempt to say something thoughtful about your friend 's photographs , but all that comes out is : Nice capture .
Dude .
Wow .
Awesome .
Way to go .
The list goes on and on , but some of the more annoying choices include multiple exclamation points , profanity and the overused misspelling of kuhl and sheot .
Say something constructive that starts a discussion , or do n't say anything at all .
__High - Dynamic - Range ( HDR ) Photos __
We get it .
We liked the first one we saw , too .
Maybe even the 10th .
But it 's an overused gimmick that prevents people from making good photos that stand on their own .
HDR needs to go the way of the animated gif and blinking HTML text .
Shutter Lag
There 's nothing like the feel of the shutter closing instantly when you take a photo with a DSLR .
You get the shot that you want and commune with the mechanics of the camera .
While the sensors of point - and - shoots keep increasing the quality of the photos , their actual shooting experience remains poopy .
You press the button , and then a few hundred milliseconds later it snaps the picture .
This delay is getting smaller with every new generation of camera , but we wo n't be happy until it 's gone completely .
It 's the difference between playing Wii baseball and actually hitting a ball with a bat .
Watermarks
__
__
Unless you 're sneaking behind Apple 's closed doors to photograph their next supersecret prototype and you 're desperate for the credit , watermarks are just tacky .
If you 're concerned about people stealing your photos , do n't post them on the internet .
The photography game today rewards openness and exposure .
The watermark is either the sign of a newbie who does n't know any better or insecure photographers who simultaneously thinks their photos are better than they are and that everyone is out to steal them .
Yes , it sucks when someone steals your photo when they should have paid you for it .
Send them an invoice .
Do n't ruin your photos for everyone else who wants to enjoy them .
For photo editors looking for potential photographers , the watermark is usually just a sign of someone who will be difficult to work with .
Either because they 've been burned in the past and they 're paranoid , or they just have an inflated idea of the market value of their work .
Wide - Angle Vertical
Seriously .
Nobody and almost nothing looks good photographed with a wide - angle lens turned vertically .
If you think your picture looks “ cool ” because you have turned your camera vertically and warped everything … you are wrong .
Stop it .
__The Megapixel Discussion __
“ How many megapixels does that camera have ? ”
We do n’t know , and we really do n’t care .
The real question is : Can you make a picture with it ?
We hope so .
And we care .
We care about pictures .
Oversharing
Like we said above .
We love photographs .
We do n’t even mind looking at a picture of your baby , dog , sister , summer vacation , mom , new shoes or latest haircut .
We like it when you share your photographs with us on Flickr , Twitter or Facebook .
But come on , nobody wants to look at 45 photographs of your hangnail .
Get an editor .
Less is more .

Your flash wo n’t reach the stage .
It will just light up the dude ’s head who is standing in front of you – no matter how many times you look at the photo you just took , scratch your head and then raise up the camera to take another one .
For people who know better , this becomes all they can see while their favorite band is shredding on stage .
Turn off the flash and try to keep your hand steady .
That 's all you can do .

Yes , it is nice to have a picture of yourself and Aunt Suzy standing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge , but ask someone to shoot it for you .
We are tired , oh so tired , of checking out your nostril hair .
Cameras ?
We wanted to throw a whole bunch of cameras down the black hole : cameras we have that drive us nuts , cameras we have tested that fall short of expectations , cameras with long shutter lag , cameras that were too heavy or too light , cameras that were too expensive .
We were gonna throw all kinds of cameras down the hole .
But , in the end we decided the thing we most wanted to throw down the hole were photographers who were more interested in cameras than photographs .
You know who you are , now get in the black hole , and do n’t come back .
It ’s all about the picture .

The Head Line - Revealing Your Intellectual Mechanism
After the Life line , the next important line on the palm is the Head line or the line of head .
This line begins at the aide of the palm beneath the index finger and extends to the opposite side of the palm .
In most palms , the head line can be seen ending somewhere below the ring finger .
You may also note the head line and life line being fused at their starting point .
Unlike what most people believe , the head line does not indicate the level of intelligence .
It simply signifies how a person thinks .
The line symbolizes the person 's mind and how it works , his learning techniques , communication abilities , intellectual level and interest in pursuing knowledge .
The line is also an indicator of how a person reacts to information - an impulsive response or an analytical approach .
In some cases , the head line may also point to the wealth possessed by a person .
Variations And Interpretations Of The Head Line
Now let us see how to decipher various types of head lines .
A short head line symbolizes a person with a clear and simple thought process .
The thought process of this person rarely wanders from the point .
A long head line represents a person with very meticulous and systematic thought process .
If the head line is so long that it extends to the other side of the palm , it indicates high intellectuality and a selfish attitude .
A straight head line stands for good common sense , clear thought process and an avid interest in material things .
These people do not care much for activities that involve creativity or risk .
A curved or sloping head line denotes creativity , romance , imagination , idealism and an experimental attitude to new ideas .
If the head line is straight in the beginning and then slopes slightly , it indicates a mind that has attained a balanced state between imagination and practicality .
A head line that begins just under the index finger indicates a brilliant mind .
The humble native honeybee has been dying out in recent years due to disease , but it may have found an unlikely ally in a creature which shares a reputation for busyness : the urban dweller .
Apiarist courses in many places are over - subscribed and membership of beekeeping associations has shot up with the increased awareness of the plight of the productive pollinator .
Those without gardens are increasingly using rooftops for their hives .
Now Johannes Paul 's company Omlet is helping to transform the traditionally rural art of beekeeping for the city dweller .
Under a leaden sky in the allotment at St James 's Park in London yesterday , Paul and his three co-founders unveiled the futuristic Beehaus , a plastic horizontal hive which at first glance resembles a giant coolbox on legs .
" We 're aiming for the hobby beekeeper , those who want to live their self - sufficiency dreams a little , " said Paul .
With promises of 50 jars of homemade honey a year they hope to tempt the busy townie who dreams of the good life .
And with the support of Natural England , the agency responsible for safeguarding England 's natural environment , its green credentials seem intact .
Certainly , there is a market .
" There has been a definite shift in the demographics of people coming into beekeeping , " said Tim Lovett , chairman of the British Beekeepers ' Association , which has seen membership increase by 3,000 to 14,500 in the last 18 months .
" Many of our new members are in urban settings , the worried wealthy , so to speak .
They are environmentally aware people , who would like to do a lot more than they are able because of their busy lives .
" They are the concerned working families , the professionals under pressure from their kids who are getting the story at school .
And now they are getting the message .
Beekeeping is not incompatible with busy family and working life . "
But with urban beekeeping comes responsibility .
There are fears would - be beekeepers , seduced by the apparent simplicity of the new hive , could order on a whim with no thought for the practicalities .
This could lead to the spread of diseases , the death of their bees or huge swarms in their neighbours ' gardens .
" These are legitimate concerns , " said Dr Tom Tew , chief scientist for Natural England , " and the first thing we would stress is that anyone thinking of keeping bees should speak to their local beekeeper association .
" But , " he said of the Beehaus , " we support anything that helps promote the honeybee . "
Last year more than 30 % of honeybees died from disease , mainly varroa mite .
This year the percentage looks still to be in the high teens or lower 20s , which is not sustainable .
It is estimated the honeybee , through pollination and honey , contributes £ 150 m annually to the economy .
Omlet , whose plastic chicken coop , Eglu , sparked a wave of urban chicken keeping , said it would offer Beehaus parties and local beekeeping courses .
It will supply everything – including full bee suit – in the £ 495 price .
Bees cost extra , however , at £ 80 to £ 150 a colony .
" Obviously , they have had great success with the Eglu , " said Lovett .
" But going down to the local broiler house , rescuing some redundant chickens and putting them at the end of your garden , is not terribly difficult .
You feed them , water them , take the eggs out now and again , and if they do escape the local urban fox will get them .
But with bees , you need to know what you are doing .
" It 's very difficult to get on a course .
Ours are full to the gunnels , " he said .
" And they are going to have difficulty in supplying bees .
Maintaining supplies is a real problem .
" However , we do welcome this new hive .
It will be a way in to beekeeping for a group of people .
But there will be limitations .
We have n't discovered the holy grail .
But it is a modest , useful step .
" What people must remember is that one hive quickly become two , two become four and four become eight . "
Urban bee etiquette
• Do consult neighbours
• Do place hive near a hedge or fence to ensure bees fly upwards and away from neighbours .
Better still , put it on a roof
• Do n't place hive so entrance is facing neighbour 's swimming pool
• Do choose docile bees
Urban rooftop hives
• Fortnum & Mason plan to sell honey from their rooftop hives in Piccadilly , London , from next month
• Royal Lancaster Hotel , near Hyde Park , will serve theirs to guests
• Natural England will have the first Beehaus on the roof of its office in Victoria , London

Yawn … marijuana cures cancer and stuff
Another day , another revelation that marijuana is … yawn … good for you .
Little things like
A study showing that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a “ significantly reduced risk ” of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
or
This study showing that marijuana has dramatically different effects on lung function than tobacco does , with findings on lung capacity and airway resistance for marijuana users similar to those who did not smoke tobacco .
or
Another study showing once again that chemicals in cannabis can halt the proliferation of cancer [ and now it ’s many types of cancer ] .
This is really getting old .
But you all knew this , right ?
I ’m sure they taught this in the schools , and that the Surgeon General has gone on the TeeVee to tell everyone to vaporize a moderate amount of pot on a regular basis as a preventative for cancer , right ?
And I ’m sure that the website for U.S. Health and Human Services has information about the valuable properties of this plant for people ’s health , right ?
After all , that ’s their job .
And I ’m sure the media has regular health columns explaining the best way to use marijuana to take advantage of its healthful properties , just as they have had articles on drinking red wine in moderation for heart benefits , or using aspirin to prevent heart attacks .
You know what would be really funny ?
If they took something with such proven benefits as marijuana and told people they could n’t use it , even though it could mean that some people might die .
Can you imagine how pissed off people would get ?
There ’d be riots at town hall meetings and stuff .
Boy , that could get pretty nasty .
Mr. Medvedev also offered his thanks .
“ We are not indifferent to the fate of South Ossetia and Abkhazia ; we were the first country to come to the rescue of these young regions , ” he said , in remarks on Russian television .
“ We are glad that worldwide support for them is growing . ”
Moscow ’s decision to recognize the two regions and deploy hundreds of Russian troops in both after its brief war with Georgia last August drew widespread international condemnation .
It also raised tensions with some other countries in the former Soviet sphere , who worried that the precedent could encourage separatist movements within their own borders .
The issue has also ensured that tensions remain high between Russia and Georgia .
Lately , the two have clashed over shipping rights to Abkhazia via the Black Sea .
The Georgian coast guard has impounded five ships from different countries this year for delivering supplies to Abkhazia in violation of Georgian law .
Georgia brushed aside Mr. Chávez ’s announcement on Thursday as insignificant .
“ It does not change the situation concerning these regions at all , ” said Alexander Nalbandov , Georgia ’s deputy foreign minister .
“ Ninety - nine percent of the international community recognizes the territorial integrity of Georgia . ”
Mr. Chávez arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and , in usual form , delivered a speech at a local university railing against the United States .
The Kremlin has typically tried to distance itself from Mr. Chávez ’s often flamboyant jingoism , but Russia has become one of Venezuela ’s key international partners .
Hormone replacement therapy , already linked to increased risk of breast cancer , heart disease and stroke , nearly doubles a woman ’s risk of dying from lung cancer , researchers reported Saturday in a finding that may be the final blow for a therapy that is already in rapidly declining use .
The findings “ seriously question whether hormone - replacement therapy has any role in medicine today , ” Dr. Apar Kishor Ganti of the University of Nebraska Medical Center wrote in an editorial accompanying the online publication of the report in the medical journal Lancet .
The link to lung cancer “ is yet another reason to not use hormone replacement therapy if it can be avoided , ” said Dr. Mark Faries of the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica , who was not involved in the research .
“ It raises the bar for deciding to do HRT . ”
The findings come from the Women ’s Health Initiative , a large study originally begun in 1991 to demonstrate , in part , that administering estrogen and progestin could relieve debilitating symptoms of menopause and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke .
The hormone replacement part of the study , which enrolled more than 16,000 women , was halted prematurely after about 5 1 / 2 years when it was observed that the risks far outweighed any potential benefits .

Not only did the therapy not protect against heart disease and stroke , but it also yielded questionable improvements in quality of life and produced a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of heart disease , stroke and breast cancer .
Several subsequent reports have shown that breast cancer rose by at least 15 % during the 1990s when HRT was blooming , then dropped sharply when many women abandoned the treatment after a 2002 report .
Treatment with estrogen has a deleterious effect on breast cancer patients because the hormone binds to estrogen receptors on tumor tissue , accelerating its growth .
Recent studies have shown that lung tissue also has estrogen receptors and that the accelerated growth is even more dramatic in lung tumor cells , according to Dr. Richard J. Pietras , who directs the Stiles program on oncology at UCLA ’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center .
“ We ’ve been suspecting for a long time that this is an area we need to investigate , ” Pietras said .
The incidence of lung cancer in women has been growing , and more women die from it than from breast , ovarian and colon cancers combined .
About 99,000 women are diagnosed with lung cancer each year , and 71,000 die from it .
The first results from the Women ’s Health Initiative suggested that the hormones might affect lung cancer .
To further explore a link , Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor - UCLA Medical Center and his colleagues studied the women in the initiative for an additional 2 1/2 years .

They found that 109 women who received hormone treatments had been diagnosed with lung cancer , compared with 85 in the group that received a placebo -- a modest 23 % increase in incidence .
The difference was more dramatic when they considered deaths .
In the group receiving hormone therapy , 73 died , compared with 40 in the placebo group , a 71 % increase .
The increase in lung cancer deaths accounted for half of the overall increase in deaths in the hormone therapy group , Chlebowski said .
The effect was most pronounced for so - called non-small - cell lung cancer , the most common form in women .
There were 62 deaths from this type of tumor in women receiving hormones , compared with 31 deaths in the placebo group .
The findings “ have special significance ” for women who are now or have been heavy smokers , Chlebowski said .
Smokers who took hormone therapy had a 1 % chance of dying from lung cancer in five years .
Women who had smoked in the past had about half that risk .
“ About half the post - menopausal women in the United States would fall into either category , ” he said .
Advertisement
The findings suggest that the hormones do not cause lung cancer , but that they accelerate the growth of existing tumors , making them more aggressive and more likely to metastasize , Chlebowski said .
Lung cancer is “ a very potent , brutal disease , ” said Dr. Glen Justice , director of the MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley .
“ The real take - home message here is that you have got to have a very good reason for going on hormones because we now know that there are so many negative effects . ”

Google ’s Eric Schmidt “ resigned ” from Apple ’s board because Chrome and Android were encroaching on Apple ’s core business , or so Steve Jobs says .
But what if the opposite were true ?
What if Apple is encroaching on Google ’s core business ?
Later this month , Apple is expected to break ground on a massive new data center in Maiden , North Carolina .
In terms of size , Apple ’s data center is as big as they come .
“ Apple is planning about 500,000 square feet of data center space in a single building , ” says Rich Miller , editor of Data Center Knowledge .
“ That would place it among the largest data centers in the world …
This would qualify as a big-ass data center . ”
Question is , what will Apple use it for ?
Apple ’s plans are secret , of course , and some have speculated it ’s to support Apple ’s growing MobileMe business and online iTunes stores .
But Miller says the size of the data center hints at something else .
Companies building centers this big are getting into cloud computing .
Running apps in the cloud requires massive infrastructure : Google - size infrastructure .
“ The companies that are building the biggest data centers tend to also have the biggest cloud ambitions , ” says Miller .
The full interview with Miller after the jump :
Data Center Knowledge , an online trade magazine devoted to the data center industry .
CoM : First , any idea why Apple is building this new data center ?
Miller : Apple has said very little about the North Carolina facility , beyond the fact that it will serve as the company ’s East coast data hub .
Apple also has a West coast data center facility in Newark , Calif .
Local officials
I ’ve spoken with say they believe the space is primarily to support Mobile Me and digital content for the iTunes store .
The most interesting question is whether Apple needs a much larger facility to support growth in its existing services , or is scaling up capacity for future offerings .
CoM : Could Apple be building it for cloud computing apps — cloud versions of its iLife apps for example ?
Miller :
One of the leading theories about the size of the NC project is that Apple is planning future cloud computing services that will require lots of data center storage .
Cloud computing is a hot trend , and I ’d be surprised if Apple is n’t thinking hard – and thinking differently – about cloud computing .
Many cloud enthusiasts say that cloud computing will eliminate the need for data centers .
In reality , the only thing will change is the owner of the building .
All the applications and data that are moving into the cloud will live on servers in brick - and - mortar data centers .
The companies that are building the biggest data centers tend to also have the biggest cloud ambitions .
CoM : How big is Apple ’s new North Carolina data center — big , small , medium ?
Miller :
The early site plans indicate Apple is planning about 500,000 square feet of data center space in a single building .
That would place it among the largest data centers in the world .
For comparison purposes , Apple ’s existing data center in Newark , Calif . is a little more than 100,000 square feet .
Most new stand - alone enterprise data centers are in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 square feet .
So this would qualify as a big -ass data center .
CoM :
What ’s it comparable to ?
Do you know of any specific examples ?
Miller :
In the past several years we ’ve seen a handful of new facilities that are redefining the scope of modern data centers .
These include Microsoft ’s new facility in Chicago , the SuperNAP in Las Vegas and the Phoenix ONE colocation center in Phoenix .
All of these facilities house at least 400,000 square feet of space .
These data centers are designed to support an enormous volume of data , and reflect the acceleration of the transition to a digital economy .
All those digital assets – email , images , video and now virtual machines – drive demand for more and larger data centers .
CoM : Why did Apple chose NC ?
Are there particularly big pipes in NC ?
A big powerplant nearby ?
Miller :
The choice of rural North Carolina suggests that the bottom line for Apple is cost , rather than connectivity .
The site in Maiden , NC is not far from a large data center by Google , which usually chases cheap power and tax incentives .
Power from Duke Energy is about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour , compared to 7 to 12 cents in California .
The company also maximized its incentives by pitting Virginia and North Carolina against one another in trying to wring the best tax incentives out of both states ( a popular strategy in data center site location ) .
Some large companies use distributed data centers to manage their latency and content delivery costs .
That may be part of Apple ’s thinking , since they ’re a major customer for CDNs ( I believe they use both Akamai and Limelight Networks ) .
Facebook cited latency to Europe as a key factor in its decision to add data centers in Virginia .
Before that , MySpace added a data center in Los Angeles to reduce its reliance on CDNs .
But in both cases , those companies sought out Internet hubs where they could connect with dozens of other networks to manage their Internet traffic .
You do n’t get that in rural North Carolina , so Apple seems more focused on cost and scale than on connectivity – which again would suggest a cloud focus .
The movie - going public , which purports to know everything about everything , is sometimes left with egg on its face when the verdict of history comes down .
After all , the public initially turned up its nose at Citizen Kane , The Wizard of Oz and It 's a Wonderful Life , and was slow to respond to many early efforts by Jack Nicholson , Tommy Lee Jones , Marilyn Monroe and Robert DeNiro .
More recent examples of this inability to spot a lurking masterpiece include The Big Lebowski , a so - so performer at the box office that became a huge cult hit in the DVD aftermarket , and Austin Powers , which got a mediocre reception during its theatrical release , then took off when it came out in video .
Also zipping straight by the general public before attaining richly deserved cult status is Office Space , a favourite among teens who have never had a job but suspect that the film is essentially a catalogue of all the horrors that await them in the workplace once they leave school .
Which it is .
Nor should we overlook Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , a loopy , erratic film that did nothing at the box office when it came out in 1998 , but eventually garnered such cult appeal that it was re-released on DVD in a special 2003 collector 's edition by the Criterion Collection .
This puts it in the company of films by Godard , Renoir , Fellini and Bergman .
Being included in the Criterion Collection is like receiving the imprimatur of the Vatican .
It means that your film is not only wonderful ; it is sacred .
Nor was this a selection of the Criterion Collection for Stoners .
It was the actual Criterion Collection .
This brings us to our central thesis : that the customer , in fact , is not always right .
It is usually right – who would n't be with so many Vin Diesel movies going around ?
– but not always .
It is a great mistake to believe that the public is so savvy that films inevitably rise or fall on their own merits .
Sometimes , films fail because they are poorly marketed , or inadequately distributed , or because the public is otherwise occupied by war or cultural malaise or inclement weather .
Quite often , high - quality films fall on their faces simply because they enter the marketplace at the worst possible moment for works with their message .
This was certainly the case with The Wizard of Oz , which opened the year the Nazis invaded Poland .
The fanciful lark did not become the object of universal veneration it is today until much later when its regular screenings on American television throughout the 1960s won the hearts and minds of young people who had not been traumatised by the Great Depression and the second world war .
Similarly , the public responded coolly to Frank Capra 's ferociously heartwarming It 's a Wonderful Life , released at the end of 1946 .
A life - affirming , populist , quasi - spiritual film about the financial havoc wrought on a small town fiduciary institution by a good - natured but incompetent bank manager was not what America was looking for in the years immediately following the Great Depression and the worst war in history .
The public was not yet ready to lighten up on the banking industry .
The public 's spotty record being what it is , is it not fair to wonder whether the same thing might be happening even as we speak ?
Is n't it possible that Terminator Salvation or The Ugly Truth or The Haunting in Connecticut or Cheri , all of which have under - performed at the box office this year , might one day build larger audiences and be viewed as classics ?
Or , at least , cult classics worthy of being included in the Criterion Collection ?
Is this not at least within the realm of possibility ?
The answer : yes .
The Hurt Locker , currently in theatres in the US , has not found the audience it deserves .
Neither has 500 Days of Summer .
And last winter 's
The Wrestler deserved a much bigger audience than it got ; it was a film more talked about and honoured than seen .
But these are obvious , somewhat arty choices .
What about more mainstream films ?
One film that has been roughed up a bit by the fickle public is Judd Apatow 's Funny People .
Apatow , as director or producer or writer , is responsible for such lighthearted fare as The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , Talledega Nights , Anchorman , Pineapple Express , Superbad and Knocked Up .
He is one of the most admired and influential people in Hollywood , mostly because he keeps making the same kind of movie .
But in Funny People , he has gone out on a limb by directing a 146 - minute film about a star of innumerable inane comedy films who finds out that he is dying and then hires a very unfunny amateur comic ( Seth Rogen ) to be his factotum and pal .
The comic , played with shocking effectiveness by Adam Sandler , who has previously kept these gifts well hidden , is not a very nice person .
Indeed , the film is obsessed with driving home how that class of people best described as the professionally amusing tend to be incredibly cruel and insensitive , and that when they die , the world does n't take long to adjust to their absence .
This is a daring premise for a motion picture , which the American media has now officially declared an underperformer , if not an out - and - out disappointment .
Hmm .
Moviegoers and critics alike are forever blasting Hollywood for playing it safe and refusing to do anything unconventional , yet here is an unconventional film , a film that uses the most famous young comedy stars in America to attack precisely the types of films and sneering attitudes that made all of them – including Apatow himself – famous .
Yes , it is too long , but Funny People is nonetheless the most interesting big - budget film to come out of Hollywood this year , and it certainly deserves a wider audience .
It will probably have to wait until it comes out in DVD to find that audience , when the public comes to its senses .
As for the public , if it keeps turning out in droves on opening weekend for films such as GI Joe and Watchmen , it does n't deserve to have any good films .
Obviously , one can go too far with this line of reasoning .
There is a natural temptation among producers and directors of duds to console themselves with the following socratic line of reasoning :
A. The Wizard of Oz was a flop .
B. The Pink Panther 2 is a flop .
C. Some day , The Pink Panther 2 will be as beloved as The Wizard of Oz .
Alas , reality does n't work that way .
History tends to be very hard on motion pictures that suck beyond belief , which is certainly the case with The Pink Panther 2 .
History catches up with bad films , and repossesses their kudos , but it also catches up with good films and tries to atone for their earlier mistreatment .
This is why Funny People will probably live on .
Conversely , I see little hope for an aftermarket revival of Terminator Salvation , et al , because , with the exception of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , all of the films I have cited as box - office duds that were later deemed classics can honestly be described as good , and in certain cases , excellent films .
They are simply films that initially missed their audience .
And even Fear and Loathing , which I do not understand because I do not have access to the drugs needed to follow it , at least qualifies as a film that appeals to special tastes , much like Triumph of the Will , The 120 Days of Sodom and all films about morally conflicted public - school boys .
This is not the case with The Ugly Truth , The Haunting in Connecticut , The Pink Panther 2 or Terminator Salvation .
These films did not find the audiences they hoped for because these films were lucky to find any audiences at all .
The Haunting in Connecticut is a generic horror film that looks like it was made by someone who last saw a scary movie in 1973 and has never heard of The Ring , much less Saw VI .
The Pink Panther 2 is the film that comes directly after The Pink Panther 1 .
Terminator Salvation is big , ugly and stupid , while The Ugly Truth is small , ugly and stupid .
It is impossible to imagine that any of these films will have a major afterlife .
Not on this planet .
One could argue , however , that the mediocre box - office performance of a film such as Confessions of a Shopaholic stems primarily from the unfortunate timing of its release and not from the fact that it is , as some have contended , derivative , cloying , sexist and moronic .
A peppy , life - affirming tale about a dimwit journalist battling an obsession with purchasing clothes and accessories she does not need , Confessions was not the breakout hit its packagers had hoped for , and actually , quite mysteriously , performed better in foreign markets than in the US .
Assuming that it did not underperform because the American public suddenly stopped liking cloying , sexist , moronic movies about adorable dimwits , the logical conclusion is that its failure to win a wider audience stems from entirely different factors .
Off the top of my head , I can think of two .
One , it was released at the very trough of the current recession , when the merry exploits of an acquisitive chucklehead was the last thing the public wanted to see .
After all , it was an entire society 's maxing out on their credit cards during the Bush years that had brought the world to the precipice of a second Great Depression .
Second , more perversely , by encouraging shopaholics to chop up their credit cards and stop buying things they clearly did not need in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s , Confessions of a Shopaholic was actually helping to prolong the recession – because the reawakening of the spendthrift consumer is the only way the moribund American economy will be revived , and we need all the shopaholics we can get .
Thus , in a strange way , Confessions of a Shopaholic is a victim of its own insensitivity to what experts call " the headwinds of the zeitgeist " .
Telling Americans to stop buying things they cannot afford and do not need in the middle of a recession is like shouting " Fire " in a crowded theatre .
It is malicious and it is immoral .
The public will forgive a newly released film for being moronic .
It will not forgive it for being oblivious .
But it might when it comes out on DVD .
The Associated Press
The Baltimore Ravens had their flaws exposed in a loss to Kansas City that had a familiar feel .
'' It looked like the same thing from the Tennessee game , to be honest , '' Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson said Monday night after the 34 - 20 defeat .
The 2019 NFL MVP was referring to last January 's playoff game against the Titans - Baltimore 's only loss in the span of a year before the Chiefs came to town .
Snitches .
Rats .
Turncoats .
Squealers .
There ’s no shortage of names for people who start their criminal justice career on one side of the law , and then , through a series of self - preserving acts , find themselves working on the opposite side as confidential informants .
Police informants get evidence , they help make cases , and they put themselves in danger to do it .
Cops and prosecutors call them indispensable .
Not every person who gives information to the police is a criminal .
Many are just concerned citizens who report suspected crimes in their neighborhoods .
And many people who testify in court are simply witnesses to a crime .
But many people who turn informant for the law have motives that are a far cry from justice or community activism ; they are , themselves , criminals working off potential charges or even getting paid to inform on other law - breakers .
People who oppose the use of criminal informants argue that offering money in exchange for information may actually lead informants to seek out and encourage crimes that would not otherwise happen .
And even police acknowledge that reducing criminal charges for informants , who are willing to participate in or set up other illegal events for law enforcement , can seem to trivialize the initial crime .
For many professionals in law enforcement it comes down to weighing greater and lesser evils against each other .
Weighing , say , the value of trading the prosecution of a small - time drug dealer against the prosecution of a medium - sized drug dealer , and maybe eventually an entire drug ring .
The identities of these informants are almost always kept secret long after the cases are over .
This is both to protect their health and keep them useful .
The practice of using criminals as confidential informants is widespread , but at the end of the day is the public really safer , trading one criminal for another ?
This is the story of a man who made a short career as a confidential paid informant for the SLO County Sheriff ’s Department .
Despite the short length of his service , he became a key figure in one of the most notorious recent cases originating in this county , the federal prosecution of medical marijuana dispenser Charles Lynch .
His name is Daniel Victor Lee , and over the course of seven months he worked on ten cases , being paid a total of $ 8,185 for his participation , according to correspondence from the district attorney ’s office .
Despite following tips that led to three different states , New Times was unable to find him to seek his side of the story .
For that matter , court records show a defense attorney who sought to depose him for a case could n’t locate him either .
Nonetheless , court documents collected from several cases tell Lee ’s story .
The first case Lee worked on for the sheriff led to a search warrant on a house where less than an ounce of marijuana was recovered .
The defendant in that case was put on probation .
Lee ’s final case was to set up the delivery of 20 pounds of marijuana .
One of the defendants in that case killed himself .
Four days after Lee ’s last job with the sheriff , SLO County court records show he was arrested for impersonating a police officer .
When the courts tried to bring him back to the county as a witness in another case , he was kicked off a commercial airline flight .
Who is this guy ?
click to enlarge PHOTO FROM COURT DOCUMENTS
HAND OFF : Court documents contain photographs that show confidential informant Daniel Victor Lee carrying a bag of marijuana back to a car , where undercover agent “ Rick ” was waiting .
Lee is someone whom Sgt. Rick Neufeld of the SLO County Sheriff ’s Department ’s Narcotics Task Force would call a mercenary : an informant who works numerous cases , setting up drug deals and getting paid for his work .
Court documents include a picture of Lee smiling wide , red hair and light eyes , about 30 years old .
He worked on at least two prominent cases locally — both of those involving drug deals arranged by the sheriff ’s department as part of their investigation of Charles Lynch , the owner of Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers .
He appeared in police reports and the Lynch indictment as a “ confidential source . ”
Those documents provide detailed accounts of his missions , including dates , names of several individuals who would be charged with crimes , and the amounts of contraband involved , but not his name .
When his name was released with a list showing the cases he worked for the sheriff , several details and dates matched up .
Lee was that ubiquitous confidential informant .
Records do n’t say exactly where he got his start as an informant .
But Lee ’s own criminal history goes back years before he snitched in SLO .
Orange County court records show he was arrested several times in 2002 .
Though he faced three felony charges that year for possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to sell stemming from two separate incidents , he wound up walking , pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge for possessing a switchblade knife .
All of the felony drug charges were dismissed .
Records are n’t clear about how Lee got in touch with SLO sheriff ’s deputies either , but federal documents from Lynch ’s indictment said he was “ a person who approached the sheriff ’s department and offered his assistance . ”
The indictment also said Lee has a criminal history with narcotics - related offenses and the police - impersonation incident .
Neufeld would not comment on the specifics of Lee ’s informant career , though records show he oversaw Lee ’s work .
Lee worked from April 2006 until November that year on drug cases that ranged from very minor to very big .
He was taken to Los Angeles County twice as an informant and sent on several trips to buy marijuana from the Morro Bay dispensary .
Records do not reveal how much he was compensated for those missions .
SLO County court documents show that Lee eventually left the area .
He stayed in contact with SLO officials and remained cooperative , despite several threats made against him by defendants in cases he helped make .
Lee ’s very first case involved a “ controlled ” buy of five grams of marijuana , worth about $ 50 .
Based on that transaction , sheriff ’s deputies obtained a warrant to search a home .
They found about 20 grams of pot as a result of the search , an amount so measly that if a sale had not been involved , possessing that quantity would not carry any jail time , only a $ 100 fine .
Normally a person charged with possessing less than an ounce would not even be arrested .
But the sale made the man ’s crime a misdemeanor or possibly a felony with the potential for incarceration .
He was arrested , pleaded guilty to a possession charge , and was put on probation .
Lee was paid $ 200 .
Lee ’s next three cases went like this :
He would arrange the delivery of between 230 grams ( about 8 ounces ) and 450 grams ( close to one pound ) of marijuana .
Deputies would do a traffic stop while the car was en route to a meeting place .
The busts sent four people to county jail , and Lee was paid a total of $ 1,100 .
This is where Lee was proving to be a reliable informant .
Neufeld said informants have to establish themselves , have to show that information they give is real and will lead to arrests .
Most important , he said , the information must be corroborated with evidence .
Lee proved himself and soon began working on bigger cases , including the investigation of medical marijuana provider Charles Lynch .
In June that year , sheriff ’s deputies drove Lee to Los Angeles County , where he was given $ 200 to pay for a questionable medical marijuana recommendation , provided by a physician who was later indicted on federal marijuana charges .
Court documents show that Lee said he smoked pot with the doctor during that visit and introduced the doctor to an undercover sheriff ’s deputy .
Lee bought the recommendation , which he later used to purchase marijuana from Charles Lynch ’s dispensary several times .
Lee and the deputies returned to San Luis Obispo County where he was paid $ 725 for the trip , according to court documents .
It was during the sheriff ’s investigation of the dispensary that Lee met one of Lynch ’s employees , Abrahm Baxter .
The two arranged to consummate a sale of marijuana outside of the dispensary .
Lee set up the deal in the Big 5 parking lot in San Luis Obispo .
Lee , with an undercover agent in the passenger seat of his car , bought 362 grams of marijuana from Baxter for $ 3,200 .
Baxter made the front page of New Times when the district attorney bungled this case , offering him a plea meant for someone else , then taking it back after the mistake was discovered .
Baxter was sentenced to 120 days in jail .
Lee was paid $ 300 .
The rest of Lee ’s cases were similar ; he would arrange a sale and deputies would arrest drug dealers while they transported the contraband .
One case involved 120 grams of cocaine .
Lee was paid $ 1,500 for that one .
The last case was the most ambitious , in which Lee set up the sale of 20 pounds of marijuana .
Police seized 25 pounds of marijuana and four pounds of hashish from four men .
One of them , Elbert Shoemate , committed suicide , according to county records .
Lee was paid $ 3,660 .
Ironically , Lee was called to testify as a witness on behalf of Abrahm Baxter , one of the people he set up .
It was in this case that the details of Lee ’s informing became known ; they became accessible to the public probably because of a mere oversight .
A series of correspondence from the SLO County district attorney ’s office outlined all the cases he worked on with the sheriff , including dates , some defendants ’ names , and the outcomes of those cases .
Lee was described as having always provided reliable information and having been cooperative .
Still , Deputy District Attorney Jerret Gran , who speaks for the prosecutor ’s department , in an interview wanted to make clear that Lee was the sheriff ’s informant and was not engaged by the district attorney .
Court documents show that the DA opposed a defense motion to summon Lee as a witness .
In Baxter ’s case there were several points on which the defense disputed details presented by the prosecution .
For example , police reports say that Baxter sold the marijuana directly to the undercover officer .
Photographs of the transaction , however , reveal at least part of the exchange happened between Baxter and Lee .
It was an illegal transaction nonetheless , but an important detail because both Baxter and Lee were medical marijuana patients .
Lee was called to be a witness for Baxter .
He could potentially have cleared up those and other conflicting details , but he never appeared at the courtroom to tell his side .
According to correspondence from the DA , Lee boarded a plane — paid for by the county — that would take him to San Luis Obispo for an in - camera hearing but was kicked off for allegedly stealing from another passenger ’s purse .
No charges were filed .
Chris Bleicher runs the website whosarat.com , which allows people to post photos and information about informants .
He ’s a critic about the ways in which informants are used .
He said paying for information creates a conflict of interest for the informant .
“ It creates incentive for these people to go out and commit crimes , ” Bleicher said in an interview .
“ You offer money to an informant to bring back information on criminals , and these people are going to go out and create scenarios to bring back information .
It ’s like job security for them .
” Bleicher said that ’s exactly what happened to a friend of his .
“ The informant created a drug deal that never would have happened otherwise , ” he said .
Bleicher did n’t start the website , which he said has become equivalent to a full - time job ; his friend did .
The site ’s creator , Sean Bucci , has been in jail for two years for selling marijuana to a mercenary informant .
Bucci claimed the men barely knew each other and had n’t seen each other for a decade when the informant approached him about making the sale .
During his trial , Bucci set up the website and outed the informant .
Two years ago , Bucci was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in jail .
He ’s appealing the severity of that sentence on the basis that it was punishment for starting the site .
There are now more than 5,000 profiles of alleged undercover agents and formerly confidential informants on the site .
The one who Bucci said brought him down is featured as the permanent “ Rat of the Week .
” Neither the cops nor the district attorney like working with informants .
Neufeld said as a person charged with upholding the laws , he struggles with the bargain of forgiving the crimes of one criminal to catch ( and presumably punish ) another .
“ One of the hardest things a new detective has to learn , ” Neufeld said , “ is how to handle informants .
It ’s not pleasant , no one enjoys it , but it ’s part of the way we do business .
If you did n’t have informants , then a lot of major case would go unsolved .
” When it comes to the criminals and the mercenaries , he said , “ Generally , these people are druggies .
“ Everybody that comes through here as an informant has to be approved by me , and I do n’t approve everyone . ”
He added , “ Sometimes I see someone , and I say , ‘ No way .
’” So what makes a good informant ?
Neufeld said there is no archetypal squealer , merely someone who can infiltrate a criminal organization and is willing to do so .
Druggies , it seems , make good mercenaries because they need money .
Felons guilty of such violent crimes as rape or murder are generally excluded from working off their crimes , leaving druggies as the population most available to be turned by law enforcement .
When a person decides to work for the DA or law enforcement , they ca n’t legally get a guarantee the information they provide will result in a reduced sentence .
Still , Neufeld said he ’s not surprised what an informant will do or who they will snitch on .
“ If someone has prison hanging over their head , ” Neufeld said , “ if they know something , and they know they ’re facing prison , that ’s pretty good incentive to be an informant . ” Mercenaries do it just for the money .
Gran said the district attorney works differently than the sheriff .
His office does not pay people for information , though they may pay for travel expenses , or the cost of relocating a witness .
As prosecutors , they are concerned more with compelling people to testify and organizing available information , than building cases from the ground up , the way cops do .
Gran said he sometimes cuts deals to get one gang member to testify against another member , for example , but would n’t pay someone to testify .
Unlike Neufeld , Gran said he is still shocked by some people ’s willingness to turn witness , when one family member testifies against another member of a family , for example .
The scenario leading up to the squeal is typically something like this : “ Usually the person already has a case , ” Gran said , “ or they ’re on probation and they get picked up for some offense .
Then they ’ll go to whoever arrested them and say ‘ OK , I ’m dirty , but I can give you four people dealing drugs .
’” Once a person is on the hook , they might work off their crime helping the cops or receive a reduced sentence for assisting the district attorney , Gran said .
In either scenario , the person has to perform before they can be rewarded .
“ I wish all my witnesses were Boy Scouts and went to church and were upstanding citizens , ” Gran said , “ but they ’re not .
The important thing is to corroborate what they say with evidence .
” Bleicher said an informant is only as valuable as their connections to illegal activity .
Informants , he said wind up telling on their friends and acquaintances when they get in trouble .
“ How do you get information about a drug crime ? ” Bleicher asked .
“ By being part of a drug crime .
” There is no reason to think that Lee is unique or extraordinary as an informant , except that his work became public .
Gran said it was probably an oversight that left Lee ’s record in the public domain .
There was a motion by the district attorney to seal several documents , but for some reason , it was never followed up with an order to seal , or a motion to deny sealing ; it was just left hanging in public space .
Now Lee ’s records are squealing on him .

Also see " Being Stephen Hawking , " the profile of Stephen Hawking by former
Nature editor John Maddox .
Two decades after rocketing to scientific stardom with his book A Brief History of Time , Stephen Hawking still knows how to make an entrance .
On a mild March evening in Pasadena , California , 4,500 people fill the convention center to hear him give a talk called “ Why We Should Go Into Space . ”
Shortly after 8 p.m. the lights dim , a few thousand conversations stop , and the soaring trumpet fanfare from Richard Strauss ’s Also Sprach Zarathustra ( better known as the theme from 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) fills the room .
Hawking is in the house .
The crowd turns to watch the frail physicist being wheeled at a good clip down the center aisle .
He is wearing a charcoal gray suit and an open - neck white shirt ; his head slumps toward his right shoulder ; his hands are folded neatly in his lap .
The music segues to The Blue Danube Waltz as he rolls up a ramp to the stage .
Hawking sits silently for a few moments , alone at center stage , before a member of his Cambridge , England , posse appears .
Sam Blackburn , a graduate student who manages the beeping , bulky communications complex that is Hawking ’s wheelchair , runs over and makes a few adjustments to his boss ’s Lenovo ThinkPad X61 laptop .
The iconic synthesized voice kicks in .
“ Can you hear me ? ” Hawking asks .
The crowd cheers .
That cheer follows
Hawking wherever he goes , in part because he should n’t even be here .
In 1963 , while a graduate student at the University of Cambridge , he was told he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or Lou Gehrig ’s disease , a diagnosis that usually proves fatal within five years .
Yet he pressed on , becoming one of the world ’s leading physicists and a best - selling author .
He has plumbed the depths of black holes and sought to explain the beginning of time .
He has been a guest on Star Trek : The Next Generation and has met the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders .
He has been married twice , has three children ( “ The disease only affects voluntary muscle , ” he reportedly once commented ) , and is now a grandfather .
Judith Croasdell , Hawking ’s ruthlessly devoted personal assistant , says his schedule is fully booked through 2012 .
Oh , yes — and he ’s also working on a new theory about the origin of the universe .
Hawking ’s latest work has received mixed reviews .
Some of his colleagues compare it unfavorably with the achievements that made his reputation .
At the beginning of his career , in the late 1960s , Hawking proved that the universe must have started from a singularity , a point of infinite density .
A few years later he found that black holes gradually shrink , fade , and die — a paradigm - shifting insight with thorny theoretical consequences that physicists are still pondering .
His subsequent ideas have stirred controversy and skepticism , however , and Hawking ’s influence on cosmology and physics is clearly not what it once was .
In the popular realm , too , his star has dimmed .
As the Pasadena event testifies , Hawking can still pack a room , but he has lost much of his iconic status .
None of his books since Brief History have come close to its runaway success .
The master of black holes is himself becoming steadily less visible .
Late last year reports circulated that Hawking would be retiring from Cambridge in 2009 and that he might even leave England to join the Perimeter Institute , an innovative research center just outside Toronto .
Hawking , Croasdell assured me , will neither be retiring nor abandoning Cambridge , but this year will bring a significant transition .
On September 30 he will relinquish his prestigious post as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge , a position once occupied by Isaac Newton , which Hawking has held since 1979 .
He turned 67 on January 8 , the maximum age for holding the Lucasian chair , and so will continue at the university with a new title , Emeritus Lucasian Professor .
No one should have believed the rumors .
Retiring is no more of an option for Hawking than ceasing to think would be .
What he is reaching for now is closer to the opposite : a defense and extension of the kind of sweeping cosmological ideas that first shot him to fame .
In other words , a capstone to his career — or , to be blunt , a comeback .
It is challenging for any academic in his sixties to reclaim the aura of youthful genius , and especially so for a man whom the popular media routinely likened to Albert Einstein .
And then there is Hawking ’s most formidable antagonist : his own withered body .
“ I imagine it has become very difficult for him to work , and that ’s been the major cause of his being out of the game , so to speak , ” says Leonard Susskind , a theoretical physicist at Stanford University .
“ In the last number of years , he has been so incapacitated that it has been very difficult for him to keep up with what is happening in the field . ”
Nevertheless ,
Hawking continues his almost ludicrously grand program .
“ My goal is simple , ” he famously explained .
“ It is a complete understanding of the universe , why it is as it is , and why it exists at all . ”
Into the Abyss As an undergraduate at Oxford University , Stephen William Hawking was a wise guy , a provocateur .
He was popular , a lively coxswain for the crew team .
Physics came easy .
He slept through lectures , seldom studied , and criticized his professors .
That all changed when he started graduate school at Cambridge in 1962 and subsequently learned that he had only a few years to live .
The symptoms first appeared while Hawking was still at Oxford .
He could not row a scull as easily as he once had ; he took a few bad , clumsy falls .
A college doctor told him not to drink so much beer .
By 1963 his condition had gotten bad enough that his mother brought him to a hospital in London , where he received the devastating diagnosis : motor neuron disease , as ALS is called in the United Kingdom .
The prognosis was grim and final : rapid wasting of nerves and muscles , near - total paralysis , and death from respiratory failure in three to five years .
Not surprisingly , Hawking grew depressed , seeking solace in the music of Wagner ( contrary to some media reports , however , he says he did not go on a drinking binge ) .
And yet he did not disengage from life .
Later in 1963 he met Jane Wilde , a student of medieval poetry at the University of London .
They fell in love and resolved to make the most of what they both assumed would be a tragically short relationship .
In 1965 they married , and Hawking returned to physics with newfound energy .
Also that year , Hawking had an encounter that led to his first major contribution to his field .
The occasion was a talk at Kings College in London given by Roger Penrose , an eminent mathematician then at Birkbeck College .
Penrose had just proved something remarkable and , for physicists , disturbing : Black holes , the light - trapping chasms in space - time that form in the aftermath of the collapse of massive stars , must all contain singularities — points where space , time , and the very laws of physics fall apart .
Before Penrose ’s work , many physicists had regarded singularities as mere curiosities , permitted by Einstein ’s theory of general relativity but unlikely to exist .
The standard assumption was that a singularity could form only if a perfectly spherical star collapsed with perfect symmetry , the kind of ideal conditions that never occur in the real world .
Penrose proved otherwise .
He found that any star massive enough to form a black hole upon its death must create a singularity .
This realization meant that the laws of physics could not be used to describe everything in the universe ; the singularity was a cosmic abyss .
At a subsequent lecture , Hawking grilled Penrose on his ideas .
“ He asked some awkward questions , ” Penrose says .
“ He was very much on the ball .
I had probably been a bit vague in one of my statements , and he was sharpening it up a bit .
I was a little alarmed that he noticed something that I had glossed over , and that he was able to spot it so quickly . ”
Hawking had just renewed his search for a subject for his Ph.D. thesis , a project he had abandoned after receiving the ALS diagnosis .
His condition had stabilized somewhat , and his future no longer looked completely bleak .
Now he had his subject :
He wanted to apply Penrose ’s approach to the cosmos at large .
Physicists have known since 1929 that the universe is expanding .
Hawking reasoned that if the history of the universe could be run backward , so that the universe was shrinking instead of expanding , it would behave ( mathematically at least ) like a collapsing star , the same sort of phenomenon Penrose had analyzed .
Hawking ’s work was timely .
In 1965 , physicists working at Bell Labs in New Jersey discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation , the first direct evidence that the universe began with the Big Bang .
But was the Big Bang a singularity , or was it a concentrated , hot ball of energy — awesome and mind - bending , but still describable by the laws of physics ?
Hawking found the answer .
If Einstein ’s laws of general relativity were applied to our expanding universe , then at some time in the past all matter and energy must have been concentrated at a point of infinite density .
The entire cosmos had once been a singularity , beyond physical explanation .
“ After Roger Penrose proved that there are singularities inside black holes , Stephen applied the same idea to the universe , ” says Don Page , a University of Alberta physicist who was one of Hawking ’s postdocs and has remained a lifelong friend .
“ He showed that there is an edge to space - time , that you ca n’t extrapolate back indefinitely . ”
A singularity at the cosmic zero hour was bad news for physicists .
It meant their theories could not explain how the universe began .
It left too much mystery , resisted rational explanation .
And that rankled Hawking .
Vanishing Act
By the early 1970s Hawking ’s speech had become unintelligible to all but his closest friends .
He could no longer walk , even with a cane .
Yet no one who knew him dared call him weak .
“ He is one of the most determined people I ’ve ever met , ” Penrose says .
“ I remember staying with Stephen and his then wife , Jane .
They had this house on Little St. Mary ’s Lane , ” a quiet lane in Cambridge directly across from a medieval church .
“ I was spending the night there .
My room was on the top floor , and Stephen ’s room was up one floor from the street .
When it came time for him to go to bed , he absolutely insisted on doing everything himself .
He crawled up the stairs , which took him about a quarter of an hour , and put himself to bed .
He just refused to let anyone help him in any way .
I think this absolute determination to keep his muscles working might well have stopped them from atrophying to the degree they might otherwise have done . ”
Hawking turned the same formidable will to his work .
Since he could no longer use the simple , essential tools of his trade — slide rules , pencils , chalk — he adapted .
“ He learned to think in ways that other people do n’t , ” says Kip Thorne , a theoretical physicist at Caltech who has known Hawking for 44 years .
“ Because he could n’t write equations and stare at them and do long calculations by hand , he developed a geometrical approach to thinking about things where he could manipulate shapes in his head in order to get insights that other people could n’t get .
I think it is very likely true that he has done greater work as a result of this handicap than he would have done other­wise , and I think he believes that as well . ”
Since it began to take long minutes to utter a sentence , Hawking became a master of concision .
“ He had to make his statements as terse as possible , ” says Bernard Carr , a cosmologist at Queen Mary , University of London , who in 1974 became Hawking ’s first live - in grad student .
“ A 15 - minute conversation with Stephen was like speaking with someone else for several hours . ”
Carr ’s years as a grad student coincided with Hawking ’s greatest work .
Hawking was developing a strange new theory about black holes , a theory that would foment arguments among theoretical physicists that have yet to be resolved .
Black holes are usually described using Einstein ’s equations of general relativity , which dictate how gravity molds the shape of space - time .
Hawking wanted to see whether quantum mechanics , which governs the behavior of atoms and fundamental particles , could provide any insight about the nature of black holes .
“ Stephen ’s work was tremendously important , ” Carr says .
“ It combined relativity , thermodynamics , and quantum mechanics , and that had never been done before . ”
The results of his efforts were completely unexpected , even to Hawking , and the work is now generally acknowledged as his greatest achievement .
In 1974 Hawking published an essay with a koan of a title : “ Black Holes Are n’t Black . ”
He argued that physicists had been wrong about one of their central assumptions about black holes : namely , that nothing can escape their grasp .
He proved that black holes actually emit a stream of what is now called Hawking radiation .
According to Hawking , this radiation does not originate inside the black hole ; it comes from outside , just beyond the region where escape would be impossible .
The radiation consists of particles that spontaneously materialize in empty space , a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs everywhere , all the time .
These “ virtual particles ” arise in pairs that normally cancel each other out almost immediately , releasing their energy back into the vacuum that spawned them .
Near a black hole , though , the pairs can get split up .
One particle can fall into the black hole while the other feeds on the gravitational energy of the hole and flies away to safety .
The transformation of gravitational energy into particles ( think
E = mc^2
) gradually causes the black hole to shrink .
Eventually , at an inconceivably distant time in the future , the black hole will vanish entirely .
What is left behind is a problem that physicists still have not fully solved .
Cosmic Wager Even as Hawking continued to cope with the possibility that he himself would soon fade to black , he realized that black hole evaporation posed a crisis for science .
It seemed to violate basic notions about the nature of time and of cause and effect .
Physicists , like the rest of us , assume that the present evolves from the past , the future from the present .
Moreover , the laws of physics hold that it should always be possible to follow processes backward in time — as physicists do , for example , when they reconstruct particle collisions by studying the debris created in accelerators .
In principle , physicists should be able to do the same thing with a shrinking black hole : piece together its past by looking at the Hawking radiation .
But Hawking claimed that was not possible .
Unlike the subatomic crack - ups in particle accelerators , where the colliding particles fragment directly into their components , nothing that falls into a black hole — gas , stars , people — has a direct connection to the Hawking radiation it emits in the present .
Whatever falls into a black hole stays there ; the Hawking radiation dribbles away from outside the hole and contains no hint of what is inside .
The entire history of the black hole is forever hidden from the rest of the universe .
Physicists call this the information loss problem .
“ God not only plays dice , ” Hawking wrote , paraphrasing one of Einstein ’s objections to quantum mechanics , “ but also sometimes throws them where they can not be seen . ”
There seemed to be only two possible explanations for the mystery .
Either Hawking was wrong about black holes ’ destroying all traces of their past , or something was wrong with quantum mechanics , whose equations require that information never be lost .
For years
Hawking thought that quantum mechanics — the foundation of modern physics — would have to change .
“ It seems to me that the indication that the information is lost is very powerful , ” Penrose says .
“ And that is what Stephen originally thought .
But more recently he changed his mind , at a meeting in Dublin where he publicly retracted and agreed to lose a bet about this .
In my view he was completely wrong to retract .
He should have stuck to his guns . ”
Penrose is referring to a wager that Hawking and Thorne made in 1997 with John Preskill , a theoretical physicist at Caltech .
Hawking and Thorne bet that black holes truly did destroy information , severing the links between past and present .
Quantum mechanics , therefore , was probably wrong at some level .
Preskill took the opposite view , betting that quantum theory would someday be vindicated .
They put the bet in writing , specifying that the winner would receive “ an encyclopedia of the winner ’s choice , from which information can be recovered at will . ”
In July 2004 at a physics meeting in Dublin , Hawking conceded the bet and gave Preskill an encyclopedia of baseball statistics .
Hawking had made new calculations showing that black hole radiation could contain subtly encoded information about the past .
His new result made use of a pillar of quantum theory called the uncertainty principle , according to which the detailed properties of an object — its position or velocity , for example — can never be completely pinned down .
Hawking argued that when quantum uncertainty is taken into account , the dreaded edge of a black hole , called the event horizon , becomes fuzzy .
Consequently , there is no sharply defined , inescapable boundary surrounding black holes .
“ A true event horizon never forms , ” Hawking said at the Dublin meeting .
The wiggle room provided by the uncertainty principle is just large enough to allow information to escape in black hole radiation .
Or so he claimed .
Many physicists remain unconvinced that Hawking has solved the problem ( and Thorne , unlike Hawking , refuses to concede the bet ) .
Even now , the status of the information loss problem and the ultimate validity of quantum theory remain ... uncertain .
In fact , uncertainty looms over Hawking ’s entire legacy .
Unlike Einstein ’s theories , which have been confirmed many times by experiment , Hawking ’s ideas about singularities and black hole evaporation will probably never be observed .
There is a small chance — Hawking himself puts the probability at less than 1 percent — that the Large Hadron Collider , the enormous new particle accelerator near Geneva , might detect miniature black holes .
If Hawking is right ( and for the sake of those who fear the LHC might spawn a planet - devouring mini black hole , he ’d better be ) , those black holes would evaporate almost as soon as they appeared .
Such a discovery would validate one of Hawking ’s signature insights and could easily provide the tangible evidence needed to snag a Nobel Prize .
Prometheus Unbound Refuting his own previous accomplishments — or attempting to , anyway — has become something of a habit with Hawking .
His latest work circles back to his earliest .
It is , in truth , more of a theory of a theory , a mathematically rigorous guess about what a complete theory of the universe might look like .
One thing that final theory absolutely cannot allow is a singularity at the Big Bang .
To achieve his goal of understanding why the universe is as it is , the singularity — whose existence at the beginning of time Hawking had once proposed — would have to go .
Like all his work , this most recent effort is bold and imaginative .
But also like nearly all his work , it falls on the very edge of testability .
It seems unlikely to be the magic intellectual bullet that will allow him to regain the Einsteinian stature that he once held .
Hawking ’s latest quasi - theory has had a long genesis and is in fact a direct attempt at resolving the old conundrum of that Big Bang singularity .
The singularity was a creature of general relativity : Squeeze enough matter and energy into one spot and Einstein ’s equations of general relativity predict that the density will become infinite .
With general relativity an initial singularity was inevitable .
For years
Hawking has argued that a better theory — one that physicists have been seeking ever since Einstein ’s heyday — would one day inevitably combine quantum mechanics with general relativity .
If that synthesis is accomplished , it is likely that the uncertainty principle would make it impossible for singularities to form .
A singularity , by definition , is an infinitesimally small point .
But quantum theory forbids such exactitude .
Nothing can be located at a precise point in space or time , preventing the formation of a blip of infinite energy and density .
Quantum uncertainty would thus blur the singularity into something tamable ; it offers the possibility that the beginning of the universe could still fall within the domain of physics and rationality .
In that case , there would be no singularity , no place or time where the laws of physics did not hold .
Hawking ’s original theory of cosmic origin , which he called the “ no - boundary proposal , ” clarified how to dispense with that initial singularity .
More shocking , it posited a universe that would explain its own existence .
In the early 1980s he began to flesh out this idea .
In collaboration with James Hartle , a theoretical physicist at the University of California at Santa Barbara , he developed a quantum mechanical framework for the entire universe .
One of the uncanny principles of quan­tum theory is that the constituents of physical reality — protons , electrons , and all other fundamental particles — are not solid , pointlike objects .
They behave instead like both waves and particles .
In the quantum realm there are no fixed positions ; atoms and other particles are blurry , shimmying things , each capable of being in many places at any given time .
The creators of quantum mechanics developed a powerful mathematical tool — the wave function — to predict how a fluctuating particle / wave moves through space and time .
Hawking and Hartle borrowed the basic math of quantum theory and sprinted with it .
The Hartle - Hawking wave function , as their creation is called , describes how the universe evolves — or , more accurately , all of the possible ways it could evolve .
Just as the quantum wave function for a single particle gives every possible path the particle could follow between two points , the Hartle - Hawking function represents all the physically possible histories our universe might have .
The universe we see is just one possible outcome among many .
It was an intriguing idea , but for years it remained just that .
Hawking ’s most recent work explores the implications of the notion that the universe is a giant quantum phenomenon .
The problem with conventional attempts to understand the cosmos , he now believes , is that researchers have failed to appreciate the full , bizarre implications of quantum physics .
These efforts to create a unique theory that would explain all the properties of the universe are therefore doomed to fail .
Hawking refers to such attempts as “ bottom - up ” theories because they assume the universe had a unique beginning and that its subsequent history was the only possible one .
Hawking is now pushing a different strat­egy , which he calls top - down cosmology .
It is not the case , he says , that the past uniquely determines the present .
Because the universe has many possible histories and just as many possible beginnings , the present state of the universe selects the past .
“ This means that the histories of the Universe depend on what is being measured , ” Hawking wrote in a recent paper , “ contrary to the usual idea that the Universe has an objective , observer - independent history . ”
This idea could cut through some long - standing scientific mysteries .
One debate now roiling the physics community concerns string theory , currently the leading candidate for a so - called theory of everything .
String theory holds that all the particles and forces in the universe can be explained as arising from the vibrations of vanishingly small strands of energy .
But it has one huge problem :
Its fundamental equations have a near - infinite number of solutions , each corresponding to a unique universe .
Hawking ’s idea provides a natural context for string theory .
All those universes might simply represent different possible histories of our universe .
This notion is as daring and exotic as anything Hawking has ever proposed .
Even better , it just might be testable .
If Hawking is right , the alternative quantum histories of the universe ( the ones we have not observed ) may have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background , the faint radiation left from the hot glow of the Big Bang .
Physicists believe that the slight temperature variations in the microwave background were caused by quantum fluctuations in the early universe .
Hawking suspects that if other quantum histories really do exist , they may have made their own measurable contribution to the background radiation .
Over the next few years , the European Space Agency ’s new Planck spacecraft may be able to detect the sort of microwave patterns that Hawking is predicting .
Slow Fade While Hawking ’s colleagues universally acknowledge the significance of his work on black holes and his early work on singularities , his more recent work has not had the same impact .
“ Without any question , Stephen ’s work on black hole evaporation was hugely important , because it linked relativity theory , quantum theory , and thermodynamics , ” says physicist George Ellis of the University of Cape Town , in South Africa , who worked with Hawking at Cambridge when both were starting their careers .
“ His first period ” — Hawking ’s proof of a singularity at the Big Bang — “ was very solid , classical relativity .
His second - period stuff on black hole radiation seemed very speculative at first and was disbelieved for quite a while , but then so many other people proved it by different methods that we all agree now that it is correct .
That was really a unique breakthrough .
The third period — his work on the wave function of the universe — is much more speculative .
It is much less solidly grounded in experiment and much less agreed on . ”
Leonard Susskind says Hawking — like all fundamental theorists today — is struggling with impossibly difficult questions .
“ It ’s the main muddle of physics and cosmology : How is quantum mechanics to be correctly used to study the universe as a whole ? ” Susskind says .
“ That , I think , is one of the biggest , most profound , most conceptually confusing questions that we face .
Am I interested in Stephen ’s ideas ?
Of course .
Do I think they ’re the solution ?
No .
Do I think they ’re part of the solution ?
Perhaps .
I think Stephen would say the same thing , frankly . ”
The media often portray Hawking as the Einstein of our time ( in his Star Trek appearance , Hawking was matched up with Einstein — and with Isaac Newton , too , for good measure ) .
Hawking himself dismisses such comparisons .
His accomplishments have not been as wide - ranging , and his most important work may never be confirmed by experiment .
So where does he rank in the pantheon ?
Judged only by his contributions to physics , he cannot match the giants of the last century : not just Einstein but also Bohr , Heisenberg , and Feynman .
I ask Stanford cosmologist Andrei Linde what the state of physics would be like today without Hawking ’s contributions .
“ That ’s a tough one , ” he replies .
“ Nature abhors empty spaces .
Stephen made big jumps to new theories .
Maybe somebody else would have come and done something comparable .
It probably would not have happened for quite a while — for how long , I do n’t know .
But this combination of enormous creativity and honesty and fighting with external circumstances , this is something that does n’t happen often , and it influences all of us .
You start thinking , measuring yourself with people like that ; it creates an atmosphere of high science .
So while the discoveries may have happened , his combination of qualities is something unique . ”
Hawking ’s flurry of public appearances and his renewed attack on the fundamentals of cosmology suggest that he is not terribly interested in being remembered just for his inspirational biography .
His paradox , then , is that much of the public ’s fascination with his science seems to rest squarely on the nonscientific aspects of who he is .
Were it not for the tragedy and drama of his life , would so many of us have become interested in black holes , the beginning of the universe , the nature of time ?
In his latest incarnation , Hawking is hoping both to rekindle that fame and to transcend it .
He clearly relishes encouraging public understanding of science , but simply rewriting the text and ideas of A Brief History of Time ( as he has been doing for much of the past 20 years ) is not enough .
He wants more big jumps , more deep insights ; he wants to make serious headway in deciphering the secret code of physics .
These are perhaps the greatest demands that a man could make of himself .
Such achievements do not come quickly or easily , and time — brief enough for any of us — is something that Hawking does not have a lot of .
But right now , right here in the Pasadena Convention Center , Hawking is exactly where he likes to be : onstage , the still center of attention , about to explain our place in the universe .
- Watch part of the Mobius interview to the left , another part here , and more here >>>
Mobius thinks that global leaders meeting for the G20 summit in Pittsburgh next week should focus almost solely on the derivatives trade .
Debates over how much bankers are paid in bonuses should be bumped down the agenda , he said .
The derivatives market is ten times the total GDP of the world , or $ 600 trillion , Mobius pointed out .
And the market has been responsible for numerous bankruptcies in recent years as companies do n’t know what they have on their books and do n’t read the fine print , he said .
“ The scary thing for me as an investor is what a company has in their books .
One of the first questions we ask a company is : ‘ What derivatives do you have ? ’
Because so many companies have gotten into deep trouble because of that .
Why ?
Because there ’s no transparency , there ’s no liquidity , ” Mobius said .
As central bankers around the world keep interest rates low , it is obvious that there will be another rise in various asset classes , Mobius said .
Commodities and stocks will be the two main areas to draw money in , according to Mobius .
“ It ’s already happening , ” he added .
Mobius thinks that different banking activities should be kept separate in order to protect investors and consumers .
“ You have banks that are doing everything under the sun , selling and buying derivatives , doing consumer banking , doing corporate banking , ” he said .
“ They ’re not banks anymore , they ’re gamblers . ”
Mobius also said that the G20 leaders should also focus on keeping protectionism at bay when they meet next week .

September 30 , 2009  --
Even in his old age , Mikhail Kalashnikov still worries about the invention that defined his life .
At a conference on the 60th anniversary of the weapon that he invented in 1947 -- the Avtomatni Kalashnikova ( Automatic of Kalashnikov ) or AK - 47 -- the elderly weapons designer , who is still chief designer for the state controlled company that makes the guns , lamented that , " there are counterfeits all around the world now which are plainly not of the same quality as the Russian example . "
The legendary Kalashnikov is a Russian export success story .
The guns are used by 60 armies worldwide , account for up to 80 percent of all assault rifles and are known as the weapon of choice for terrorist groups and rebel movements .
But the Izhmash Arms factory in the central Russian city of Izhevsk , where Kalashnikovs are manufactured , has long been concerned about forgeries .
According to Izhmash Arms ' parent company , the Rosoboronexport State Corporation -- which has a monopoly on supplying Russian arms to the international market -- there are about eight countries in which dozens of businesses are making their own versions of the Kalashnikov .
And they are doing this without passing on any licensing fees to the Russians .
And now it appears that the financial difficulties facing the weapons manufacturer have reached crisis point : its very existence is threatened .
A businessman in Izhevsk has filed a motion to declare Izhmash Arms bankrupt because of outstanding debts of around 8 million rubles ( around € 180,000 or $ 265,000 ) .
The case has caused a sensation in Russia because for a long time the Russian armaments industry has been one of the only industries considered competitive on an international basis .
And Izhmash , which was founded in 1807 by Russia 's royals , is one of the largest firearms manufacturers in Russia .
Kalashnikov Problems of its Own Making
However , arms exports have fallen dramatically over the past year , falling from around $ 10.8 billion ( €7.4 billion ) worth of weaponry in 2007 to a mere $ 3.5 billion ( €2.4 billion ) in 2008 .
According to Ruslan Pukhov , director of the Moscow - based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies , every second Russian arms maker is now in danger of bankruptcy .
In fact work at one of Izhmash 's factories stopped recently due to lack of state orders for their product .
" The companies have not had big orders for a long time , " the newspaper Gazeta quoted various industry experts .
" Izhmash Arms is no exception . "
A lot of the factories have asked for state aid during the financial crisis , but mostly their requests have been fruitless .
As it is , the problems the Kalashnikov manufacturer faces are partially of its own making .
During the Soviet era , licenses for the Kalashnikov were generously granted -- and this had less to do with a desire to make money from the licenses than political motivations .
It was all about the use of the automatic rifle as a means of " freeing the people . "
After the end of the Warsaw Pact though , all the licenses to make the Russian - invented weapon had supposedly come to an end , according to Rosoboronexport .
However , those earlier business partners simply continued to make the automatic weapons -- and at the same time , their production ate into the Russian exports .
Russia asked the United Nations for help in the fight against the forgeries .
However the UN was not all that willing to help -- after all their peacekeeping forces operate in regions like the Congo , one of the main markets for these kinds of weapons .
It is still unclear how much economic danger Izhmash Arms is really in .
After the bankruptcy charges , the firm itself declared that its order books were full .
Furthermore , it said that the company that was demanding the money , Gremikha , and which had filed the bankruptcy order had " no relationship " with the factory at all .
The relatively unknown Gremikha company said it had filed the order because of a " chain of debts . "
But this has cast doubt on the whole proceeding .
Ultra-Nationalist With Dubious Reputation Behind Bankruptcy
Additionally the proprietor of Gremikha also happens to be a local political figure with a dubious reputation .
According to the central Russian election commission , the business belongs to Andrei Markin , the regional head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia ( LDPR ) .
The LDPR is led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky and is generally considered to be ultranationalist in nature .
Markin has been regional head of the LDPR since 2007 .
At the time that he took up the post , opponents within his own party said that he was active in criminal circles under the name " Markel . "
The businessman - politician denied this .
However , the LDPR does seem to like to award administrative and other contracts to business people with dodgy reputations and criminal histories .
In 2007 Andrei Lugovoy was the LDPR 's candidate for the State Duma , Russia 's lower house of parliament .
Lugovoy is wanted by the British police and Scotland Yard , in connection with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko .
Litvinenko was a former officer of the Russian secret service - turned - dissident who was living in London when , in 2006 , he was lethally poisoned with a radioactive substance , polonium - 210 .
When contacted by SPIEGEL Online , Markin 's office would only say that , in the case against Izhmash Arms , they were being led " by legal guidelines . "
According to the Svoje Delo newspaper , Markin had said he did n't want the situation to get as far as bankruptcy and that he was just hoping the Kalashnikov manufacturer would be able to settles its debts as soon as possible .

We have crossed the boundary that lies between Republic and Empire .
If you ask when , the answer is that you cannot make a single stroke between day and night .
The precise moment does not matter .
There was no painted sign to say , " You now are entering Imperium . "
Yet it was a very old road and the voice of history was saying : " Whether you know it or not , the act of crossing may be irreversible . "
And now , not far ahead , is a sign that reads : " No U Turns . "
If you say there were no frightening omens , that is true .
The political foundations did not quake ; the graves of the Fathers did not fly open ; the Constitution did not tear itself up .
If you say people did not will it , that also is true .
But if you say therefore it has not happened , then you have been so long bemused by words that your mind will not believe what the eye can see , even as in the jungle the terrified primitive , on meeting the lion , importunes magic by saying to himself , " He is not there . "
That a republic may vanish is an elementary schoolbook fact .
The Roman Republic passed into the Roman Empire , and yet never could a Roman citizen have said , " That was yesterday . "
Nor is the historian , with all the advantages of perspective , able to place that momentous event at any exact point on the dial of time .
The Republic had a long unhappy twilight .
It is agreed that the Empire began with Augustus Caesar .
Several before him had played emperor and were destroyed .
The first who might have been called emperor in fact was Julius Caesar , who pretended not to want the crown and once publicly declined it .
Whether he feared more the displeasure of the Roman populace or the daggers of the republicans is unknown .
In his dreams he may have been seeing a bloodstained toga .
His murder soon afterward was a desperate act of the dying republican tradition , and perfectly futile .
His heir was Octavian , and it was a very bloody business , yet neither did Octavian call himself emperor .
On the contrary , he was most careful to observe the old legal forms .
He restored the Senate .
Later he made believe to restore the Republic , and caused coins to be struck in commemoration of that event .
Having acquired by universal consent , as he afterward wrote , " complete dominion over everything , both by land and sea , " he made a long and artful speech to the Senate , and ended it by saying : " And now I give back the Republic into your keeping .
The laws , the troops , the treasury , the provinces , are all restored to you .
May you guard them worthily . "
The response of the Senate was to crown him with oak leaves , plant laurel trees at his gate and name him Augustus .
After that he reigned for more than forty years and when he died the bones of the Republic were buried with him .
" The personality of a monarch , " says Stobart ,
had been thrust almost surreptitiously into the frame of a republican constitution … .
The establishment of the Empire was such a delicate and equivocal act that it has been open to various interpretations ever since .
Probably in the clever mind of Augustus it was intended to be equivocal from the first .
What Augustus Caesar did was to demonstrate a proposition found in Aristotle 's " Politics , " one that he must have known by heart , namely this :
People do not easily change , but love their own ancient customs ; and it is by small degrees only that one thing takes the place of another ; so that the ancient laws will remain , while the power will be in the hands of those who have brought about a revolution in the state .
Revolution within the form .
There is no comfort in history for those who put their faith in forms ; who think there is safeguard in words inscribed on parchment , preserved in a glass case , reproduced in facsimile and hauled to and fro on a Freedom Train .
Let it be current history .
How much does the younger half of this generation reflect upon the fact that in its own time a complete revolution has taken place in the relations between government and people ?
It may be doubted that one college student in a thousand could even state it clearly .
The first article of our inherited tradition , implicit in American thought from the beginning until a few years ago , was this : Government is the responsibility of a self - governing people .
That doctrine has been swept away ; only the elders remember it .
Now , in the name of democracy , it is accepted as a political fact that people are the responsibility of government .
The forms of republican government survive ; the character of the state has changed .
Formerly the people supported government and set limits to it and minded their own lives .
Now they pay for unlimited government , whether they want it or not , and the government minds their lives — looking to how they are fed and clothed and housed ; how they provide for their old age ; how the national income , which is the product of their own labor , shall be divided among them ; how they shall buy and sell ; how long and how hard and under what conditions they shall work , and how equity shall be maintained between the buyers of food who dwell in the cities and the producers of food who live on the soil .
For the last named purpose it resorts to a system of subsidies , penalties and compulsions , and assumes with medieval wisdom to fix the just price .
This is the Welfare State .
It rose suddenly within the form .
It is legal because the Supreme Court says it is .
The Supreme Court once said no and then changed its mind and said yes , because meanwhile the President who was the architect of the Welfare State had appointed to the Supreme Court bench men who believed in it .
The founders who wrote the Constitution could no more have imagined a Welfare State rising by sanction of its words than they could have imagined a monarchy ; and yet the Constitution did not have to be changed .
It had only to be reinterpreted in one clause — the clause that reads : " The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , imposts and excises to pay its debts and provide for common defense and welfare of the United States . "
" We are under a Constitution , " said Chief Justice Hughes , " but the Constitution is what the judges say it is . "
The president names the members of the Supreme Court , with the advice and consent of the Senate .
It follows that if the president and a majority of the Senate happen to want a Welfare State , or any other innovation , and if , happily for their design , death and old age create several vacancies on the bench so that they may pack the Court with like - minded men , the Constitution becomes , indeed , a rubberoid instrument .
The extent to which the original precepts and intentions of constitutional , representative , limited government , in the republican form , have been eroded away by argument and dialectic is a separate subject , long and ominous , and belongs to a treatise on political science .
The one fact now to be emphasized is that when the process of erosion has gone on until there is no saying what the supreme law of the land is at a given time , then the Constitution begins to be flouted by Executive will , with something like impunity .
The instances may not be crucial at first and all the more dangerous for that reason .
As one is condoned , another follows , and they become progressive .
To outsmart the Constitution and to circumvent its restraints became a popular exercise of the art of government in the Roosevelt regime .
In defense of his attempt to pack the Supreme Court with social - minded judges after several of his New Deal laws had been declared unconstitutional , President Roosevelt wrote : " The reactionary members of the Court had apparently determined to remain on the bench for as long as life continued - for the sole purpose of blocking any program of reform . "
Among the millions who at the time applauded that statement of contempt there were very few , if there was indeed one , who would not have been frightened by a revelation of the logical sequel .
They believed , as everyone else did , that there was one thing a President could never do .
There was one sentence of the Constitution that could not fall , so long as the Republic lived .
The Constitution says : " The Congress shall have power to declare war . "
That , therefore , was the one thing no president could do .
By his own will he could not declare war .
Only Congress could declare war , and Congress could be trusted never to do it but by will of the people — or so they believed .
No man could make it for them .
Even if you think that President Roosevelt got the country into World War II , that was not the same thing .
For a declaration of war he went to Congress — after the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor .
He may have wanted it , he may have planned it ; and yet the Constitution forbade him to declare war and he dared not do it .
Nine years later a much weaker president did .
President Truman , alone and without either the consent or knowledge of Congress , had declared war on the Korean aggressor , 7000 miles away , Congress condoned his usurpation of its exclusive constitutional power .
More than that , his political supporters in Congress argued that in the modern case that sentence in the Constitution conferring upon Congress the sole power to declare war was obsolete .
Mark you , the words had not been erased ; they still existed in form .
Only they had become obsolete .
And why obsolete ?
Because now war may begin suddenly , with bombs falling out of the sky , and we might perish while waiting for Congress to declare war .
The reasoning is puerile .
The Korean war , which made the precedent , did not begin that way ; secondly , Congress was in session at the time , so that the delay could not have been more than a few hours , provided Congress had been willing to declare war ; and , thirdly , the president as commander - in - chief of the armed forces of the Republic may in a legal manner act defensively before a declaration of war has been made .
It is bound to be made if the nation has been attacked .
Mr. Truman 's supporters argued that in the Korean instance his act was defensive and therefore within his powers as commander - in - chief .
In that case , to make it constitutional , he was legally obliged to ask Congress for a declaration of war afterward .
This he never did .
For a week Congress relied upon the papers for news of the country 's entry into war ; then the president called a few of its leaders to the White House and told them what he had done .
A year later Congress was still debating whether or not the country was at war , in a legal , constitutional sense .
A few months later Mr. Truman sent American troops to Europe to join an international army , and did it not only without a law , without even consulting Congress , but challenged the power of Congress to stop him .
Congress made all of the necessary sounds of anger and then poulticed its dignity with a resolution saying the president 's action was all right for that one time , since anyhow it had been taken , but that hereafter Congress would expect to be consulted .
At that time the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate asked the State Department to set forth in writing what might be called the position of executive government .
The State Department obligingly responded with a document entitled , " Powers of the President to Send Troops Outside of the United States — Prepared for the use of the joint committee made up of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on the Armed Forces of the Senate , February 28 , 1951 . "
This document , in the year circa 2950 , will be a precious find for any historian who may be trying then to trace the departing footprints of the vanished American Republic .
For the information of the United States Senate it said ( Congressional Record , March 20 , 1951 , p. 2745 ) :
" As this discussion of the respective powers of the President and Congress has made clear , constitutional doctrine has been largely moulded by practical necessities .
Use of the Congressional power to declare war , for example , has fallen into abeyance because wars are no longer declared in advance . "
Caesar might have said it to the Roman Senate .
If constitutional doctrine is moulded by necessity , what is a written Constitution for ?
Thus an argument that seemed at first to rest upon puerile reasoning turned out to be deep and cunning .
The immediate use of it was to defend the unconstitutional Korean precedent , namely , the resort to war as an act of the president 's own will .
Yet it was not invented for that purpose alone .
It stands as a forecast of executive intentions , a manifestation of the executive mind , mortal challenge to the parliamentary principle .
The simple question is :
Whose hand shall control the instrument of war ?
It is late to ask .
It may be too late , for when the hand of the Republic begins to relax another hand is already putting itself forth .
Anger and taunting in the public forum .
Accusations of fascism .
Gun-toting men waiting for their congressional representatives in the parking lot .
Rumors of proposed government death panels -- rumors that opponents of reform did virtually nothing to quell .
The discussion , if it can be dignified with that word , over the state of the nation 's health care system is scuttling along the slimy sea floor of American politics .
Which is why it 's an ideal time for some actual information .
What is it costing us to look after our nation 's sick ?
Who pays -- literally and figuratively -- for the threadbare patchwork of American health insurance coverage , a system that drop - kicks 700,000 people each year into bankruptcy because they could n't pay their medical bills ?
That , because they could n't see a doctor , puts another 20,000 in the grave ?
Are we really faced with a choice between things as they are and that conservative bogeyman , " socialized medicine " ?
For such apt questions , T.R. Reid 's book could n't hit the shelves at a better time .
" The Healing of America : A Global Quest for Better , Cheaper and Fairer Health Care " ( Penguin Press ) is a look at how wealthy democracies like ours -- France , Japan , Germany and the U.K. -- provide health care , and the choices they faced as they constructed systems that are each unique but that all do a better job of keeping their citizens healthy , and for less money .
What do those countries have that we do n't ?
Each has decided that it has a basic duty to look after the health of its citizens .
Reid 's book would be just an exercise in comparative policy studies but for having busted his shoulder while in the U.S. Navy .
A military surgeon had bolted the joint back together , but that was way back in 1972 .
" By the first decade of the 21st century , " writes Reid , " I could no longer swing a golf club .
I could barely reach up to replace a lightbulb overhead or get the wine glasses from the top shelf . "
And so , " hoping for surcease from sorrow , " Reid takes his shoulder on the road .
The result is a readable , informative , clearheaded look at health care elsewhere in the industrialized world , accompanied by the persistent questioning :
Why not us ?
When did you begin this book ?
I 'd like to say that in the spring of 2006 I knew that in the fall of 2009 our country would be obsessed with health care , but I really can't say we planned it that way -- we really lucked out .
The timing worked out fine .
I actually delivered the book a year late , and my editor was mad at me for being so late , but now I tell her I planned it like this .
[ laughter ]
Eighty - five percent of Americans tell pollsters that health care is a basic human right , yet so far in this national debate , that does n't seem to be very well reflected .
Yeah , every time we take on this issue the basic moral question gets lost in a discussion of winners and losers , hospital company profits and insurance company earnings .
That 's always happened in our country .
Every single country I visited made the basic moral commitment that every single person in our rich country who needs access to health care should have access to it .
The richest country in the world has not made that guarantee .
I came off my ' round - the - world tour pretty optimistic : I think if we do make that commitment we can provide it for all , because all these other countries have .
Why have n't we made that commitment , why are we so down in the weeds ?
I do n't know .
I really struggle with that .
With my book , I had three main tasks : to explain how other countries cover everybody at reasonable costs , and I think I got that ; the other was to explain why other countries cover everybody , and I think I got that .
That raises the question , why has n't the world 's richest country made this commitment ?
I think my final assessment is that most people do n't know .
Most people do n't know that 20,000 Americans die every year because they can't see a doctor .
They do n't know that an appallingly large number of people [ around 700,000 ] lose everything they have because they get sick or get hit by a car .
If they did , they would n't stand for it ; they do n't want to live in that kind of society .
Do you know how many people in Britain go bankrupt because of medical bills ?
Zero. France ?
Zero. Canada ? Zero. Japan ?
Zero .
No other country lets that happen .
You write that the French system expresses this fundamental French notion of solidarit

The truth regarding Nick Diaz ’ unwillingness to take a “ random ” drug test has finally come out .
According to GracieFighter.com , the website run by his long - time trainer Cesar Gracie , Diaz decided against taking the test to salvage a future re-match against Joe Riggs .
If Diaz would have submitted a urine sample last Friday as required , “ [ he ] would have tested positive for Cannabis , ” GracieFighter reported .
“ A positive test would not only have barred him from participating on August 15th , but would have also made him ineligible to fight for over a year in California , thus making his rematch fight with Joe Riggs a remote possibility .
After weighing all options , it was decided that his best option would be to forego this fight , ” the website explained .
Diaz reportedly would have been ready to submit a clean urine sample a day before the fight , as customary for pre-fight samples , but the California State Athletic Commission had unexpectedly asked Diaz to come in eight days in advance in order to get licensed .
Diaz and Co. decided as a unit that not taking the impromptu drug test and waiting out a re-match with Riggs , the opponent he was originally supposed to face for the open welterweight title at “ Strikeforce : Carano vs. Cyborg ” this Saturday , would be their best move under the circumstances .
Riggs took a close unanimous decision over Diaz at UFC 57 back in 2006 .
It was the second of three consecutive unanimous decision Octagon losses that Diaz suffered before getting punted from the UFC .

From JavaOne 2009 : Breaking Through JVM Memory Limits
A Conversation with Azul's Gil Tene
by Frank Sommers
June 1 , 2009
In this interview with Artima , Gil Tene , CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems , explains why Java applications typically use only a few gigabytes of memory , out of possibly tens of gigabytes available on commodity servers .
While the declining price of memory allowed server makers to significantly increase the available RAM on commodity servers , a typical Java application uses about as much memory today as it did at the beginning of the decade , says Gil Tene , co-founder and CTO of Azul Systems , in this interview with Artima :
When you look back since the start of this decade , you can observe that the memory sizes of individual instances of applications have n't really grown that much .
In the year 2000 , it was already common to see applications with a gigabyte , or slightly more , of memory .
Applications with that size memory footprint were already practical .
It was normal , for example , to deploy a WebLogic server with a gigabyte of heap on a commodity server with 2 - 3GB of physical memory .
Today , we still see applications using 1GB , or slightly more , of RAM .
With this much time having passed , you would expect there to be a lot more memory used by now .
But that has n't happened :
The practical size for a single [ application ] instance has n't changed since about 2000 .
To see why that 's an anomaly , you have to look at it from a historical perspective .
Moore 's Law gives us an additional 2X of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months .
That has worked out very well for the past 40 years or so :
You buy roughly twice the memory for the same price every 18 months .
Over a decade , twice every 18 months works out to be just a little over 100x every decade .
If you look back at the amount of memory used by applications over the past thirty years , you 'll see that they tended to take advantage of that trend .
It was normal in the early 80s , for instance , to have applications with about 100KB of memory running on servers that had half a megabyte of physical memory .
If you had a problem of that size , then you 'd fit that nicely into memory , and would n't bother to build a distributed system or some other complex solution .
In the early 90s , it was normal to solve 10 MB problems on servers that had 32 or 64MB of memory — an HP or Sun server .
You could get your boss to buy one of those servers for the department and solve the problem on a single server .
Move another decade forward , to the early 2000s , and a gigabyte heap on an entry - level server would be very normal .
In other words , you could solve a gigabyte [ size ] problem on a single server instance by then .
If you look at those three decades , you can see a jump of about 100x each decade .
That turns out to mirror Moore 's Law in terms of memory capacity .
In other words , applications kept up with the growing capacity of memory in terms of how much memory a single application consumed .
The software we 're working on today , ten years later , assumes about the same amount of memory for each application instance , or just slightly more , than it did at the beginning of the decade .
Not many applications are written with the assumption that there will be 100 GB or more RAM available to the application .
So there is a flattening of the curve there .
There is now a decade of stagnation .
This had led to people trying to solve things in funny ways :
For instance , building distributed systems just to handle a few tens of gigabytes - size problem .
That has led to more and more complex systems .
Luckily , in the Java world , tools have developed that make it easier to solve problems that can be managed by a single instance .
But is it really necessary to go that route , where Moore 's Law would suggest we can solve problems of the 100 GB size in a single memory address space ?
Of course , clustering , lateral scaling , and so on , are used not only to extend the memory space of a single application , but also to provide failover , redundancy , and so .
Still , in many cases , they led to complex systems .
That 's especially the case when a commodity server in 1 - 2 years will have over 200GB of available physical RAM .
Yet , [ the fact ] that individual application instances still use only a fraction of that memory , shows that something 's amiss in this picture .
Environments like Java or .NET are prevalent in part because they manage the environment in which an application runs .
Those managed environments make development simpler which , in turn , allows programmers to create complex applications that , in principle , use a lot of memory .
However , the way VMs have been implemented is a strong factor in holding us back from breaking past a handful of gigabytes .
Specifically , there are two behaviors of virtual machines that play a role here .
One is garbage collection of large amounts of memory .
The other issue is being able to keep up with large rates of allocation .
These , in fact , go hand in hand .
The metric for the first one is how many gigabytes of memory you can have without running into problems with the GC .
The other metric is how many megabytes you can allocate in a given time period .
Naturally , if you want to use lots of memory , you have to be able to allocate a lot of memory quickly , and with a high throughput .
When either of those metrics fails to support the use of large amounts of memory , then you are forced to start thinking about using only a fraction of the memory available .
So [ the amount of memory a Java application can take advantage of ] is really a factor of the VM .
And that 's where we stand now .
We know that most VMs tend to work well with one or two gigabytes , and when you go above that , they do n't immediately break , but you end up with a lot of tuning , and at some point you just run out of tuning options .
Given these issues , we [ at Azul ] spent the last 6 years focusing on the scalability of the individual JVM .
At that time , the problem was not obvious to a lot of people , because we were still early in the curve of lots of physical memory becoming available on servers .
Since then , this has become a mainstream issue and , consequently , our solution has received a lot of interest .
Our JVMs are designed to allow Moore 's Law to continue for individual JVMs .
With our JVMs , you can easily use hundreds of gigabytes of RAM , and allocate that RAM at the rate of tens of gigabytes per second , within a single JVM .
Our VM presents itself to developers like any regular JVM would .
We ship our JVM for Linux , Solaris , HP - UX , AIX , and Windows .
You just install this JVM on any of those environments .
When you execute our VMs , though , rather than the VM being launched on the stack on which it was invoked , it goes out on the network and finds the Azul device that 's built to bypass the limitations I just talked about .
That device is really what powers the JVM .
That there is a separate device [ to run the Java application ] is transparent to the application , however :
You do n't have to make any changes to your application to take advantage of Azul 's VM .
While we 're very proud of this device , it 's really invisible .
It 's something that simply enhances your environment , and helps you overcome the memory limitations that have plagued Java applications for many years now .
If Neanderthals ever shared a Thanksgiving feast with Homo sapiens , the two species may have had trouble settling on a menu .
Chemical signatures locked into bone suggest the Neanderthals got the bulk of their protein from large game , such as mammoths , bison and reindeer .
The anatomically modern humans that were living alongside them had more diverse tastes .
As well as big game , they also had a liking for smaller mammals , fish and seafood .
“ It seems modern humans had a much broader diet , in terms of using fish or aquatic birds , which Neanderthals did n’t seem to do , ” says Michael Richards , a biological anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany and the University of British Columbia in Canada .
Prehistoric menu
Such dietary differences could have played a role in the extinction of Neanderthals roughly 24,000 years ago .
Advertisement
“ I personally think [ Neanderthals ] were out - competed by modern humans , ” says Richards .
“ Modern humans moved in with different , more advanced technology and the ability to consume a wider variety of foods , and just replaced them . ”
He and colleague Erik Trinkaus at Washington University in St Louis , Missouri , compiled chemical measurements taken from bone collagen protein belonging to 13 Neanderthals and 13 modern humans , all recovered in Europe .
They also added data collected from a 40,000 - year - old human recovered in Romania ’s Oase cave .
Because our bones are constantly destroyed and rebuilt while we are alive , the atoms that make up collagen hold a record of what we ’ve eaten .
“ When you take a sample of a bone you ’re getting all those breakfasts , lunches and dinners for 20 years , ” Richards says .
Telltale atoms
Measurements of the abundance of heavy isotopes of carbon and nitrogen hold the key .
Marine environments contain a higher proportion of heavy carbon atoms ( carbon - 13 ) than land ecosystems , so lots of carbon - 13 in the recovered collagen points to a seafood diet .
Meanwhile , heavy nitrogen ( nitrogen - 15 ) tends to build up as the atom moves up the food chain , from plants to herbivores to carnivores .
High levels of heavy nitrogen can also come from a diet with lots of freshwater fish .
Aquatic food webs tend to contain more steps than terrestrial ecosystems , so large fish often have higher levels of heavy nitrogen than land predators .
By comparing the relative levels of these isotopes with those of animals found nearby , researchers can sketch the broad outlines of an ancient diet , if not every last calorie .
Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggest that Neanderthals living between 37,000 and 120,000 years ago in what are now France , Germany , Belgium and Croatia got the bulk of their protein from large land herbivores , Richards and Trinkaus conclude .
Levels of heavy nitrogen in Neanderthal bones invariably exceed levels in surrounding herbivores , and tend to match levels in that period ’s carnivores , such as hyenas .
Some modern humans living between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago opted for more varied diets .
High levels of carbon - 13 in two samples from Italy and France are evidence for a diet that probably included some marine fish or seafood .
Even other modern humans from a similar period that lived further inland seem to have enjoyed a more diverse menu .
Unusually high levels of nitrogen - 15 in their bones point to freshwater fish as an important source of food , Richards says .
Variety pays off
Such flexibility may explain why modern humans thrived in ancient Europe while Neanderthals perished , says Hervé Bocherens , a biological anthropologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany .
“ If modern humans were hunting big game , like Neanderthals , they would compete with them and deplete the resources . ”
When big game were scarce , modern humans could have survived and even flourished by eating fish and smaller animals .
Neanderthal populations , by contrast , probably shrank and eventually disappeared in areas from which their more limited meal options disappeared .
However , Bocherens cautions against drawing too many conclusions from 13 Neanderthal skeletons , all unearthed in northern Europe .
Collagen does n’t survive well in warmer climates , so researchers know less about the diet of Neanderthals in southern Europe and the Middle East , he says .
“ There is evidence from a number of southern European sites in Portugal , Gibraltar , Spain and Italy that Neanderthals did exploit marine resources at times and , I would say , probably to a significant extent , ” says Chris Stringer , a palaeoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London .
His team recently found cut marks on seal and dolphin bones in a Neanderthal cave in Gibraltar .
Palatable veg
Isotopes recovered from bone also ignore important sources of food that do n’t contain much protein .
“ I ’m sure they ’re having vegetables , ” says Richards .
“ But they ’re not eating enough that it ’s being measured . ”
A new study of ancient DNA offers preliminary support for that conclusion .
Neanderthals possessed a gene mutation that would have meant they could n’t taste bitter chemicals found in many plants .
There has been speculation that this mutation , which occurs in a taste receptor gene called TAS2R38 , is beneficial to humans because it makes vitamin - packed vegetables more palatable .
It probably arose in the common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals more than a million years ago .
The gene encodes a receptor that detects a chemical called phenylthiocarbamide , which is closely related to compounds produced by broccoli , cabbage and Brussels sprouts .
If vegetables were n’t part of the Neanderthal diet , the species would probably have lost the non-tasting mutation , says Carles Lalueza - Fox , a geneticist at the Institute of Biological Evolution in Barcelona , Spain , whose team sequenced TAS2R38 in 39,000 - year - old DNA from a Neanderthal femur recovered in the El Sidrón cave in north - west Spain .
This Neanderthal ’s DNA tested positive for tasting and non-tasting versions of TAS2R38 , suggesting he or she boasted copies of both alleles of the gene – and with it the ability to taste bitter foods .
The presence of the non-tasting allele in this individual suggests it may have been beneficial to some Neanderthals .
“ It does n’t mean they were eating Brussels sprouts or cabbage but it could be similar vegetables , ” Lalueza - Fox says .

Haskell is a great language for building embedded domain specific languages .
Using algebraic data types and higher order functions , it ’s very easy to work with and reason about an embedded language .
This week at the ICFP , several people commented on how Haskell allowed them to build custom control structures and express ideas more clearly .
However , while powerful , these embedded languages usually are n’t as expressive as their host language Haskell .
The concrete syntax usually is n’t as succinct as the Haskell equivalent of a certain expression .
This article explores the very early stages of an idea by Sebastiaan Visser and myself to more deeply embedding DSLs in Haskell .
It has been written up rather quickly , so if ( when ? ) you find errors , please do let me know .
Also , when I say “ early stages ” , I really mean just that , there are lots of open questions and unknowns left .
To start off , here ’s a little teaser :
* Main > --
A simple function that operates on a generalized boolean * Main > let f x = not x && false || true * Main > --
Coerce the function to work on normal Prelude Bools * Main > let g = f :: Prelude .
Bool -> Prelude .
Bool * Main > --
Call the function * Main > g false True * Main > --
Coerce the exact same function to work on JavaScript booleans * Main let h = f :: Js JsBool -> Js JsBool * Main > --
Call the function again * Main > h false ( ( ( false ? false : true ) ?
false : ( false ? false : true ) ) ?
( ( false ? false : true ) ?
false : ( false ? false : true ) ) : true )
The JavaScript string above is the JavaScript equivalent of the f function applied to false .
If we evaluate that string , we get a JavaScript boolean true !

Background
At its most basic level , a DSL is usually expressed as an ADT .
Take for example this simple definition of a mathematical expression language :
> data ArithExpr > = Lit Integer > | Add ArithExpr ArithExpr > | Mul ArithExpr ArithExpr > | Sub ArithExpr ArithExpr > deriving ( Show , Eq )
With this evaluator :
> evalArith :: ArithExpr ->
Integer > evalArith ( Lit x ) = x > evalArith ( Add x y ) = evalArith x + evalArith y > evalArith ( Mul x y ) = evalArith x * evalArith y > evalArith ( Sub x y ) = evalArith x - evalArith y
This is a very simple language supporting literal values ( Lit ) , addition ( Add ) , multiplication ( Mul ) and subtraction ( Sub ) .
Given this language , we can now write a mathematical expressions like “ 6 + 12 * 3 ” as such :
> a1 :: ArithExpr > a 1 = Add ( Lit 6 ) ( Mul ( Lit 12 ) ( Lit 3 ) )
This is a bit verbose for something that can be expressed in Haskell with a lot less characters .
But luckily , we can fix that in this case , by using the Num type class :
> instance Num ArithExpr where > x + y = Add x y > x * y = Mul x y > x - y = Sub x y > abs x = error " Not implemented " > signum x = error " Not implemented " > fromInteger x = Lit x
Now that we have made ArithExpr an instance of the Num type class , we can use Haskell syntax to write down ArithExpr expressions :
> a2 :: ArithExpr > a 2 = 6 + 12 * 3
Of course , while this looks like a Haskell epression , it still generates an ArithExpr expression tree :
ghci > a2 Add ( Lit 6 ) ( Mul ( Lit 12 ) ( Lit 3 ) )
Getting functions for free
Now that our ArithExpr is an instance of Num we can use functions like + , but we can do even more .
We can also reuse all existing functions that are defined in terms of the + operator and other functions in the Num type class .
For example the sum function :
sum :: ( Num a ) => [ a ] -> a sum [ ] = fromInteger 0 sum ( x:xs ) = x + sum xs
Since this function is defined entirely using functions from the Num type class , it also works on our ArithExpr !
> a3 :: ArithExpr > a 3 = sum [ 3 , 4 * 3 , 2 - 7 ]
When we inspect this in GHCi we get the following :
ghci > a3 Add ( Add ( Add ( Lit 0 ) ( Lit 3 ) ) ( Mul ( Lit 4 ) ( Lit 3 ) ) ) ( Sub ( Lit 2 ) ( Lit 7 ) ) ghci > evalArith a3 10
Obviously we did n’t just add lists to our simple expression language .
The lists here are Haskell lists , containing ArithExpr values .
Haskell can be used as a meta programming language for the ArithExpr language .
Scaling up : using more Haskell syntax
A few months ago Sebastiaan send a message to the Haskell Cafe mailing list titled “ Bool as type class to serve EDSLs ” where he asked about using the Eq type class for DSLs .
In the same way that we make ArithExpr an instance of Num .
Lets take this ADT :
> data Expr a where >
Num :: ArithExpr -> Expr Integer > LitFalse :: Expr Bool > LitTrue :: Expr Bool > Equal :: Expr Integer -> Expr Integer -> Expr Bool >
If :: Expr Bool -> Expr a -> Expr a ->
Expr a
The Eq and Show instances for this GADT are provided at the end of this article .
The evaluator is defined as such :
> eval :: Expr a -> a > eval ( Num ae ) = evalArith ae > eval ( LitFalse ) = False > eval ( LitTrue ) = True > eval ( Equal e1 e2 ) = eval e1 == eval e2 > eval ( If p e 1 e2 ) = if eval p then eval e1 else eval e2
We can now write down an expression like this :
> a4 :: Expr Integer > a 4 = If ( Equal ( ( 2 + 3 ) ) ( 5 ) ) > ( Num 1 ) > ( Num 0 )
And here ’s where the Eq type class comes in , we ’d like to use the ( == ) operator instead of the Equal constructor .
Unfortunately , this is not possible since the type of ( == ) is this :
( == ) :: Eq a => a -> a ->
Bool
This shows us that ( == ) is polymorphic in both its arguments , but not in its return type .
We could make our Expr data type an instance of Eq , but wo n’t be not able to use Equal as an implementation of ( == ) .
Equal is of type Expr Integer -> Expr Integer ->
Expr Bool , it returns a Expr Bool instead of Bool .
What we would like to have is a more polymorphic ( == ) of the following type :
( == ) :: ( Eq a , BooleanLike b ) => a -> a -> b
We have replaced the type Bool with a polymorphic b that is an instance of the BooleanLike type clas .
This way ( == ) is polymorphic in both its arguments ( a long as they implement Eq ) and its result type ( as long as its “ BooleanLike “ ) .
In other words : we replace the concrete data type Bool with a polymorphic type b in a type class .
Can we take this further ?
Going large : no more data types !
With that idea in mind ( replace data types with type classes ) , Sebastiaan and I have been working on systematically rewriting the Haskell Prelude to a more general version .
We have dubbed this alternative Prelude the AwesomePrelude , and it ’s currently available on github .
Lets have a look at how the Awesome Prelude works .
First the normal Prelude Bool data type :
data Bool = False | True
This is rewritten in the AwesomePrelude to the following type class ( called Bool in the AwesomePrelude ) :
> class Boolean f r | f -> r where > bool :: r -> r -> f -> r > false :: f > true :: f
This type class consists of these parts :
The false and true members .
These represent the original two constructors , but they now are more polymorphic , since they are of type f , the first argument to the type class .
and members .
These represent the original two constructors , but they now are more polymorphic , since they are of type , the first argument to the type class .
The bool function .
Because we no longer have real constructors ( we use true and false ) , we ca n’t do pattern matching anymore .
With bool we can “ fold ” over a Bool value .
The bool function destructs a f value and it returns either the first ( false ) argument or the second ( true ) argument .
function .
Because we no longer have real constructors ( we use and ) , we ca n’t do pattern matching anymore .
With we can “ fold ” over a value .
The function destructs a value and it returns either the first ( false ) argument or the second ( true ) argument .
The f type argument .
This is the concrete type we use to represent a boolean .
In the case of our Expr data type , this is ( Expr Bool ) , see below .
type argument .
This is the concrete type we use to represent a boolean .
In the case of our data type , this is , see below .
The r type argument and f -> r functional dependency .
This is the somewhat strange part of the type class .
We ’ll discuss this after we ’ve looked at the Expr instance .
Giving the type class defined above , we make our Expr data type an instance of the type class like so :
> instance Boolean ( Expr Bool ) ( Expr Integer ) where > bool f t p =
If p f t > false = LitFalse > true = LitTrue
This instance demonstrates the need for the r type argument in the Boolean type class .
The r variable is the type to which a boolean is “ destructed ” , when it is “ pattern matched ” ( that is , it is used ) .
We need a way to ensure that the result of using a boolean in a DSL does n’t fall outside that DSL .
In the case of our Expr data type , the result of If can only be a Expr Integer .
Other languages might be a bit more liberal , but they usually do at restrictions .
For example , we provide a JavaScript instance of the AwesomePrelude called JsPrelude .
In this JsPrelude , we have this : instance Boolean ( Js Bool ) ( Js a ) .
That means that using a Js Bool will always result in a Js a .
To show how this pattern generalizes , lets look at the Maybe type class .
class Maybe f a r | f -> a , f -> r where maybe :: r -> ( a -> r ) -> f a -> r nothing :: f a just :: a -> f a
This type class again has two “ constructors ” , nothing and just .
Also there is a “ destructor ” function called maybe , which happens to be the same thing as the maybe function in the normal Haskell Prelude .
The real difference between the Maybe type class and the Bool type class is the extra type variable a .
This is introduced because the normal Maybe data type has a type variable a .
Indeed , the number of type variables in the “ type classification ” of a data type is equal to its original number of arguments plus two for the f and the r
Conclusion ?
Free functions and future work !
We are currently working on the AwesomePrelude on github .
The AwesomePrelude module exposes type classes for each data type in the normal Prelude .
Note that by “ each ” , I really mean “ the five that we felt like writing ” .
The AwesomePrelude module also exports common functions like ( && ) , sum and uncurry , that are entirely defined in terms of the “ constructors ” and “ destructors ” in the module .
We have written a JsPrelude that provides instances for the type classes defined in the AwesomePrelude .
While this module is far from complete ( we ’re doing some weird type hackery , that is n’t really working ) , it can already do some cool things , like the example at the top of this article .
… define a function on “ type class values ” in the exact same way as on normal “ data type values ” … there is no difference between using the generalized functions and the original functions .
The Main module shows some examples of uses of the generalized Prelude .
The nice point about this examples is this though :
We can define a function on “ type class values ” in the exact same way as we would on normal “ data type values ” .
Except for constructors and pattern matching , there is no difference between using the generalized functions and the original functions .
To sum up :
Our understanding of this concept is still currently rather limited , but I have the feeling we can do a lot with this , particularly in the field of embedded domain specific languages .
After seeing a couple of interesting talks this week at the ICFP and the Haskell Symposium , I think I need to start reading lots of papers ( any pointers would be appreciated ) .
More on this to follow !

Let 's say you have millions of pictures of faces tagged with names .
Given a new photo , how do you find the name of person that the photo most resembles ?
In the cases I mentioned , each record has hundreds or thousands of elements : the pixels in a photo , or patterns in a sound snippet , or web usage data .
These records can be regarded as points in high dimensional space .
When you look at a points in space , they tend to form clusters , and you can infer a lot by looking at ones nearby .

Since discovering the software , I have implemented it in two different locations , and both have benefited from it .
One implementation was for a parent of a teenage girl who kept downloading “ games ” and creating virus and malware outbreaks .
It turned out this was caused by sites disguised as the sites she usually visited … phishing sites .
If my opinion changes , you ’ll be the first to know , but for now , two thumbs up for OpenDNS !

Europe 's biodiversity is still under serious pressure and faces grave risks .
Although we will miss the target of halting the biodiversity loss in Europe by 2010 , some progress is being made .
As [ EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas ] said recently in Athens , the post -2010 target should be ambitious , measurable and clear .
It should maintain the emphasis given to the intrinsic value of biodiversity while also recognising the value of healthy and resilient ecosystems and the services they provide .
The EEA 's report " Progress towards the European 2010 biodiversity target " , finds that European biodiversity is still under serious pressure and that the policy response is not yet adequate to halt the general decline .
Biodiversity faces grave risks at the level of genes , species and ecosystems .
On 13 July , the European Commission released a ' Composite report ' to the European Council and Parliament on the implementation of the Habitats Directive .
Responding to the two reports ' findings , EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said :
" Europe 's biodiversity is still under serious pressure and faces grave risks .
Although we will miss the target of halting the biodiversity loss in Europe by 2010 , some progress is being made .
As [ EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas ] said recently in Athens , the post -2010 target should be ambitious , measurable and clear .
It should maintain the emphasis given to the intrinsic value of biodiversity while also recognising the value of healthy and resilient ecosystems and the services they provide " .
The next major assessment based on the indicators will be done in 2010 .
Key findings from the EEA report
Substantial progress has been made in protecting habitats .
Some 17 % of EU land area is now included in the Natura 2000 network and 16 % protected under national schemes across 39 countries .
Around 40 - 85 % of habitats and 40 - 70 % of species of European interest have an unfavourable conservation status .
Grasslands and wetlands across Europe are particularly at risk .
Legislation on atmospheric emissions , freshwater quality and waste water treatment has reduced the pressure on biodiversity .
Specific measures have also relieved agriculture - related pressures , although further efforts are required .
Water quality has generally improved in fresh waters .
Overexploitation of marine fisheries remains a threat to marine ecosystems , with some 45 % of assessed European stocks falling outside safe biological limits .
Invasive alien species remain a threat , increasingly so in marine systems .
Urban sprawl and abandonment of agricultural land put pressure on natural and semi-natural areas .
Forest fragmentation is another key threat and has increased since 1990 .
SEBI 2010 in brief
The SEBI 2010 process aims to ensure consistency between biodiversity indicator sets at the national and international levels , while trying to give a coherent and relevant assessment of the state of biodiversity in Europe .
The SEBI 2010 set currently comprises 26 indicators .
SEBI 2010 relies on the contribution of more than 120 experts from across Europe , as well as input from intergovernmental organisations and NGOs .
Its institutional partners are the European Environment Agency ( and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity ) , the European Centre for Nature Conservation , the United Nations Environment Programme 's World Conservation Monitoring Centre , the European Commission , the Joint Secretariat of the Pan- European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy ( PEBLDS ) , and the Czech Republic ( as lead country for the Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity 's Action Plan on Monitoring and Indicators ) .
The SEBI 2010 process covers 53 countries across Europe .

As Constitutional lawyer Glenn Greenwald writes :
The Detainee Photographic Records Protection
Act of 2009 … literally has no purpose other than to allow the government to suppress any “ photograph taken between September 11 , 2001 and January 22 , 2009 relating to the treatment of individuals engaged , captured , or detained after September 11 , 2001 , by the Armed Forces of the United States in operations outside of the United States . ”
As long as the Defense Secretary certifies — with no review possible — that disclosure would “ endanger ” American citizens or our troops , then the photographs can be suppressed even if FOIA requires disclosure .
The certification lasts 3 years and can be renewed indefinitely .
The Senate passed the bill as an amendment last week .
Just imagine if any other country did this .
Imagine if a foreign government were accused of systematically torturing and otherwise brutally abusing detainees in its custody for years , and there was ample photographic evidence proving the extent and brutality of the abuse .
Further imagine that the country ’s judiciary — applying decades - old transparency laws — ruled that the government was legally required to make that evidence public .
But in response , that country ’s President demanded that those transparency laws be retroactively changed for no reason other than to explicitly empower him to keep the photographic evidence suppressed , and a compliant Congress then immediately passed a new law empowering the President to suppress that evidence .
What kind of a country passes a law that has no purpose other than to empower its leader to suppress evidence of the torture it inflicted on people ?
Read the language of the bill ; it does n’t even hide the fact that its only objective is to empower the President to conceal evidence of war crimes .

Everyday , the Search Engines average 300 MILLION searches .
In a recent Forrester Research report 81 % of consumers on the Internet find products and services by using the Search Engines .
Search Engine Optimization allows you to achieve top search engine placement and a tap into a new source of qualified visitors who are actively searching for products and services on the Internet .
Unfortunately , only 7 % of all websites are visible by the search engines according to a recent StatMarket.com study .
The reason for this phenomenon is because most web sites are not properly optimized and promoted to achieve high
search engine rankings .
The Top 3 Components Of Optimizing Your Web Site for Top Search Engine Rankings :
To achieve the best overall , long - term search engine positioning , three components must be present on your web site :
1. Content component ( Your web page text . )
2. Link component ( How you link your pages together . )
3. Link Popularity component ( The in - bound links to your site . )
1 ) The Content Component
The most important part of the content component ( of a search engine algorithm ) is keyword selection and where you place keywords on your web pages .
In order for your target audience to find your site on the search engines , your web
pages must contain keyword phrases that match the phrases your target audience is typing into search queries .
Finding these keywords that your target audience uses to find your product is accomplished by conducting keyword research .
2 ) The Link Component – Internal Linking
The strategy of placing keyword - rich text on your web pages is useless if the search engine spiders have no way of finding that text .
The way your web pages are linked to each other has huge impact on your site ’s search engine positioning .
Be sure to link your pages together with your keywords within your links .
3 ) The Link Popularity Component – Acquiring In - Bound Links
The “ Link Popularity ” or Google “ Page Rank ” ( PR ) component of a search engine algorithm analyzes how many web sites link to your website .
95 % of the battle of getting high rankings at the search engine is acquiring quality and relevant links pointing to your web site .
Ever since Google entered the search engine market , all the major Search Engines have started using links
as the primary way they rank web sites .
This is known as your web site ’s “ Link Popularity ” or in Google ’s case it ’s called “ PageRank ” or “ PR . ”
For example , the heart of Google ’s algorithm is PageRank , a system for ranking web pages developed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford University .
Here is what Google says about their “ PageRank ” web site ranking algorithm at their web site http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html
“ PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page ’s value .
In essence , Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote , by page A , for page B . But , Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes , or links a page receives ; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote .
Votes cast by pages that are themselves “ important ” weigh more heavily and help to make other pages “ important . ”
As Google explains , Links and PageRank are critical to ranking high in the search engines .
In fact , inbound links and the text within those inbound links account for 95 % of effective search engine optimization .
Relevant Links :
But , attaining optimal link popularity is not as easy as simply obtaining as many links as possible to your website .
The quality and relevancy of the sites linking to your site holds more “ weight ” than the quantity of sites linking to
your site .
Since Yahoo is the most frequently visited site on the web , a link from Yahoo to your website carries far more “ weight ” than a link from a smaller , less visited site .
Here ’s what Google Developer Matt Cutts has to say about links …
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“ Thematic incoming links from authority sites
carry more weight than on - page optimization . ”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Top 4 Strategies for Acquiring Links to Your Web Site :
Below are the four critical steps for achieving high rankings by acquiring text links to your web site …
1 ) Get a higher Google PageRank score than your competition For any given keyword , there is a minimum PageRank required to rank at Google .
In order to see what this minimum PageRank number is , search Google for your keyword and look at the PageRank of your competition ’s web sites that are ranked in the top 10 of the Search Engine Results Page ( SERP ) .
An easy way to view the PageRank scores of your competition is to use Google Toolbar http://toolbar.google.com or the SEOChat PageRank Search tool .Ã‚Â
http://www.seochat.com/seo-tools/pagerank-search/
2 ) Get more relevant links than your competition
All links are not created equal .
The best links are “ relevant ” links from web pages related to your keyword .
3 ) Get more links on more different web sites than your competition Getting links on a variety of different web sites on different networks is crucial for high rankings .
4 ) Use the keywords you want to high rankings in the search engines as the anchor text of your in - bound links .
“ Anchor text ” is the visible text within a hyperlink .
Text links and anchor text are the two most important criteria for how Google and other top Search Engines rank web sites .
Here is an example of a link containing the keyword phrase “ ERP Software ” within the anchor text …
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
F*R*E*E [ ERP Software ] white paper shows how
to increase profitability and reduce inventory .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Relevant Links and PageRank are critical to achieving high search engine rankings .
Want proof ?
Do a search at Google for the highly competitive keyword “ computers ” and you ’ll find Apple and Dell computers rank numbers 1 and 2 in the
Search Engine Results Page ( SERP ) .
Now , click through to the Apple and Dell web pages and look for the word “ computers ” in their web page text .
What did you find ?
Neither www.apple.com or www.dell.com have the word “ computers ” in their text , yet they ’re ranking # 1 and # 2 at Google .
Relevant Links and PageRank Win !
The sites with the most relevant links and highest Google PageRank win every time and rank the highest at the top search engines .
There are many methods you can use to acquire text links including buying links from a broker , Internet directories , reciprocal linking , Internet publicity , and others .
Singer Amy Winehouse was divorced by her estranged husband today on the grounds of her adultery .
Blake Fielder - Civil , who said the star confessed to him in April last year , was granted a " quickie " divorce from the 25 - year - old star at a brief hearing in London .
Fielder - Civil , 27 , who described himself as a music video producer , stated in divorce papers before the court he found it " intolerable " to live with Winehouse .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Neither party was present for the proceedings - lasting a matter of seconds - before District Judge Michael Segal at the High Court 's family division .
The couple were married in May 2007 in Miami , Florida .
Winehouse admitted the adultery with an unknown person in divorce papers made public today .
Fielder - Civil was granted an undefended decree nisi from the singer .
In a question and answer style document , he was asked : " State briefly your reasons for saying that the respondent has committed the adultery alleged " .
He answered : " The respondent confessed the adultery to me in April 2008 . "
He said that since April 2008 he and Winehouse had not lived in the same household .
Fielder - Civil , whose address was given as Barnby Lane , Claypole , Newark , was also asked : " Do you find it intolerable to live with the respondent ? "
He answered : " Yes . "
The name of the person with whom the singer is alleged to have committed adultery was stated as " not known " .
In a separate document Winehouse was asked : " Do you admit the adultery alleged in the petition ? "
The star answered : " Yes . "
She also stated that she did not object to paying the cost of the proceedings .
Winehouse said she received the divorce petition in April this year while in St Lucia .
The investigation covered 28 European countries
More than half of websites selling electronic goods and tested in an EU investigation were breaking European laws aimed at protecting consumers .
The analysis of 369 websites selling mobiles , DVD players and games consoles in 28 European countries found that 203 of them held misleading information .
The biggest failure surrounded the right to return a product bought on the internet within seven days .
Any websites which continue to break the law face fines .
" We know from the level of complaints coming into European Consumer Centres that this is a real problem area for consumers , " said EU consumer commissioner Meglena Kuneva .
" We discovered that more than half of the retailers selling online electronic goods are letting consumers down . "
Sweep Authorities , such as trading standards departments , carried out the investigation in May .
They were checking to see if the websites followed rules on providing clear information about the trader , the product , the price , and customers ' rights .
There is a lot of work to be done in the months ahead to clean up this sector , Europe 's consumers deserve better
Meglena Kuneva , EU consumer commissioner Some 369 websites - across 26 EU member states ( all members except Slovakia ) as well as Norway and Iceland - were checked as they sold electronic goods including digital cameras , mobile phones , personal music players , DVD players , computer equipment and games consoles .
Two hundred of the sites were chosen because they were the biggest in the EU and another 100 were checked because they had been the subject of previous consumer complaints .
Of the 203 cases facing further investigation : Two - thirds ( 66 % ) failed to adequately explain that consumers had seven days to return a product bought over distance for a full refund and without giving a reason .
Others failed to explain the right to have a faulty product repaired or replaced for at least two years after sale
Details about extra delivery charges were missing or difficult to find on the website in 45 % of cases
A third ( 33 % ) did not fully outline the trader 's name , address or email details so they could not be contacted if there was a problem .
All of these traders will now be contacted by the authorities and asked to clarify the position or correct the problems identified in the investigation .
Meglena Kuneva is the EU consumer commissioner
Any website that fails to make corrections could face warning letters and then enforcement action .
If this was ignored the operators could be prosecuted and face fines .
" This is a Europe - wide problem which needs a European solution .
There is a lot of work to be done in the months ahead to clean up this sector , Europe 's consumers deserve better , " said Ms Kuneva .
Every website checked in Cyprus and Hungary during the sweep was found to require further investigation .
Six of 14 websites checked in the UK revealed irregularities .
Only Iceland , Norway and Latvia have published a list of the websites that will face further investigation .
About one in four consumers across the EU who has ever bought anything on the internet bought an electronic product , according to the European Commission .
The market is valued at an estimated 6.8 bn euros ( £ 5.9bn ) .
Some 34 % of complaints about online shopping in 2007 featured the sale of electronic equipment .
David Smith , director of operations at UK online retailers ' trade body IMRG , said : " It is disappointing that some companies are failing to apply basic standards . "
He said that IMRG oversaw a code of conduct that stipulated that traders should be aware of , and adhere to , the rules .
However , he added that the picture was blurred by the fact that different rules tended to apply across different European countries .

Bethlehem � Ma�an / Agencies �
The Israel Prison Service has decided to cancel family visits for Palestinian political prisoners at two jails on Tuesday after protesters threatened to stop the families .
In doing so , Israel is violating the Geneva conventions .
According to the Website of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth , Israeli supporters of captured soldier Gilad Shalit planned to hold demonstrations at two prisons where so - called " security prisoners " are held .
The protesters , calling themselves an " Army of Shalit 's Friends " planned the protests , calling for Israel to impose harsher sanctions on Palestinian prisoners in order to convince Hamas to release Shalit , who has been held by Palestinian fighters in Gaza since 2006 .
The protests were to coincide with Shalit�s 23rd birthday .
The Prison Service announced that family visits will be cancelled on Tuesday at Hadarim Prison in the town of Tel Mond and Shikma Prison in the city of Ashkelon , according to Yedioth .
However , visits will be carried out as per usual at Megiddo Prison , where the Shalit campaign will also be protesting .
Israel holds 11,000 Palestinians in its jails .
Since June 2007 , Israel has denied the right to family visits to more than 900 detainees from Gaza .

THE FACTS
As cold season approaches , many Americans stock up on their vitamin C and echinacea .
But heeding the age - old advice about catching up on sleep might be more important .
Studies have demonstrated that poor sleep and susceptibility to colds go hand in hand , and scientists think it could be a reflection of the role sleep plays in maintaining the body ’s defenses .

In a recent study for The Archives of Internal Medicine , scientists followed 153 men and women for two weeks , keeping track of their quality and duration of sleep .
Then , during a five - day period , they quarantined the subjects and exposed them to cold viruses .
Those who slept an average of fewer than seven hours a night , it turned out , were three times as likely to get sick as those who averaged at least eight hours .
Even by the confessional standards of the “ Dr. Phil ” television show , it was a whopper of an admission .
The nicely dressed couple said they had roamed several states as shoplifters , stealing mostly toys , selling them on the Internet and making as much as $ 1 million over seven years .
“ I ’m no lawyer or a cop , ” said talk - show host Phil McGraw , his Texas drawl mixed with incredulity , “ but is n’t that a federal crime ? ”
The wife paused a second and then said , “ Yeah , it is . ”

Last week , a federal grand jury in San Diego agreed , handing down an indictment against Matthew Allen Eaton , 34 , and his wife , Laura , 26 .
And , just as Dr. Phil predicted , the transcript and video of last November ’s show are central to the prosecution ’s case .
The indictment , for moving stolen goods across state lines , says the Eatons sold more than $ 100,000 using EBay and PayPal over a 12 - month period -- a crime that prosecutors call “ e- fencing . ”
More than 500 boxes of toys and other things were carted off when investigators from the San Diego Regional Fraud Task Force raided the couple ’s home in suburban San Marcos .
The Eatons had approached the “ Dr. Phil ” show with the offer to tell their story .
They answered all his questions politely and with only slight hesitation .
They even provided a home video of an out - of - state road trip -- the indictment suggests it was to Arizona and Texas -- in which they smoothly ripped off several stores with their three young children in tow and mailed the goods back home .

The toddlers , they said on the video , are good decoys .
“ Sometimes we just kind of go in together as a nice little family to make it seem like we ’re normal people , and we do n’t look like the kind of people that steal , ” Matthew Eaton said .
“ We have our kids with us , and they usually always buy it . ”
Laura Eaton provided a typical inventory of the loot .
Sometimes they would stuff goodies into their pockets ; other times they would boldly walk out of stores .
“ We steal diapers , wipes , shoes , socks , clothes , food , ” she said on the video .
“ This scanner , desk , the lamp , swords , filing cabinet , TV , this computer , trash can , cabinets , movies , paper shredder . ”

Dr. Phil is not the only person who was surprised at what the Eatons told him and a television audience of about 5 million .
“ In 20 years of fraud cases , I ’ve never seen anything like this : a taped confession before a national audience , ” said Secret Service agent Greg Meyer , who worked on the case .
Paul Pfingst , a former two - term San Diego County district attorney and now a high - profile defense attorney , said , “ In the hall of fame of dumb crooks , these people will have a prominent position . ”
The arraignment judge , U.S. Magistrate Ruben Brooks , ordered the couple to undergo mental health counseling as a condition of bail .

By the time the couple chatted with Dr. Phil , they knew that the San Diego County Sheriff ’s Department was already investigating them for shoplifting a toy from a Target store in Vista , a possible misdemeanor .
The show propelled the investigation and brought in the feds .
So why did they go on television ?
Matthew Eaton told Dr. Phil that he and his wife felt gripped by a shoplifting compulsion and that only by blowing their own cover did they think they could stop .
“ Putting it out in the open and knowing that everybody ’s seen us now , ” he said , “ it ’ll help us to not want to go to the stores because we ’re going to feel like they ’re going to recognize us now .
And I think it ’s something to help us stop . ”
The couple say they are kleptomaniacs , which Dr. Phil , who has a doctorate in clinical psychology , suggested is baloney because he said kleptomaniacs steal for thrill , not profit .

On camera , the couple were matter - of - fact ; not remorseful but not boastful , although they admitted the spree was “ a little fun . ”
Matthew Eaton said he had thought about stepping up to a more serious crime .
“ I ’ve thought of going into a bank and just getting one teller ’s money and getting in and getting out , ” he said .
“ But there ’s no way I could really do something like that .
It ’s just too dangerous . ”
Laura Eaton said the couple had dreams of using the profits to start a legitimate toy business .
Now they are indigent and could face five years in prison .
Their children -- ages 4 , 2 and 1 -- were placed with relatives after the couple were arrested .
Matthew Eaton ’s employment record is checkered .
He has worked as a security guard and a supervisor at a gas station .
An auto - detailing business he founded flopped , leading him to file for personal bankruptcy in 2000 to try to shed personal debts and a bill from the Internal Revenue Service .

The Eatons moved to Las Vegas in 2007 , but within months had moved back to San Diego County .
Some minimal attempts were made to shield their identities on “ Dr. Phil . ”
They were referred to only by their last names .
No references were made to San Diego or its suburbs .
When the fraud task force cranked up its investigation in recent months , an attorney representing the couple complained that a “ Dr. Phil ” producer had tricked the couple by promising psychological help and , if they were indicted , bail money and a legal defense fund -- assertions the show denies .
Only one toy is mentioned in the indictment , a Lego Star Wars Millennium Falcon , allegedly stolen from the Target store in Vista , a crime that initially brought the Eatons to the attention of sheriff ’s detectives .
Advertisement
In court , lawyers for Matthew and Laura Eaton said the couple had long suffered from depression .
As the investigation closed in , each found legitimate employment : Matthew as an auto detailer ; Laura as a home - care helper for the disabled , their attorneys told the magistrate at arraignment .
Nothing in the indictment or other court documents suggests that the government will try to get Dr. Phil to testify .
On Monday , the couple pleaded not guilty .
The magistrate set bail for Matthew Eaton at $ 35,000 ; for Laura Eaton at $ 25,000 .
She was bailed out quickly , with the help of family members .
On Friday , her husband remained in the federal lockup in downtown San Diego .
Each has a lawyer appointed by the court and paid with public funds .
Neither lawyer would comment after a brief court session Thursday .
Advertisement
On the show , Dr. Phil had warned the Eatons to quit their life of crime .
“ You better stop this , and you better stop it right now , ” he said , “ because they ’re going to burn you down . . .
I ’m not just picking on you ; I ’m trying to help . ”
It appears his advice was in vain .
Four months later , the indictment alleges , the Eatons were still stealing .

The new doc­u­men­tary What ’s the Mat­ter With Kansas ?
is a fun­ny , smart and impor­tant look at the inter­sec­tion of reli­gion and pol­i­tics in Amer­i­ca today .
Loose­ly based on the 2004 book by Thomas Frank , it tells the sto­ries of sev­er­al con­ser­v­a­tive Kansans who care deeply about hot - but­ton cul­tur­al issues like abor­tion and gay mar­riage .
Accord­ing to Frank ’s polem­i­cal the­sis , Repub­li­cans suc­ceed­ed in get­ting poor whites to vote against their own eco­nom­ic self - inter­est by focus­ing on these issues .
How­ev­er , film­mak­ers Lau­ra Cohen and Joe Win­ston devote lit­tle of the film ’s 90 min­utes to Frank and his argu­ment , focus­ing instead on the lives and motives of their sub­jects .
The doc­u­men­tary begins by fol­low­ing a Demo­c­ra­t­ic can­vass­er who vis­its the home of a Repub­li­can who explains that he could nev­er sup­port the Democ­rats because they ’re ​ “ pro-abor­tion , pro-homo­sex­u­al , pro-gun con­trol . ”
Then it shifts to a mar­ket where the Kansas Democ­rats booth can’t attract a crowd , while the ​ “ Choose Life ” booth is busy sign­ing up recruits and sell­ing plas­tic babies for 25 cents .
Frank ’s book and this movie are both vul­ner­a­ble to accu­sa­tions of con­de­scend­ing elit­ism , Frank for his the­sis and the movie for its focus on the eccen­tric Kansas per­son­al­i­ties .
To be sure , the film some­times pro­vokes laugh­ter at its sub­jects ’ expense , such as on the Bar­den family ’s trip to the always - ridicu­lous Cre­ation Muse­um in Peters­burg , Ky. Still , the depth of the con­nec­tion that devel­ops between the sub­jects and film­mak­ers – and , even­tu­al­ly , the audi­ence – stops this from being mere mockery .
In the hands of some­one deter­mined to ridicule con­ser­v­a­tives , Angel Dillard ’s CD release par­ty , fea­tur­ing per­for­mances of such tracks as ​ “ When Satan Comes A‑Callin ’ ” , would make an easy tar­get .
But that scene comes late in the film , after we ’ve learned to under­stand her as a per­son rather than as a stereo­type .
As Joe Win­ston not­ed in the Q&A that fol­lowed a Chica­go screen­ing , ​ “ This movie ’s all about not gen­er­al­iz­ing about people . ”
The movie briefly traces the his­to­ry of the con­ser­v­a­tive move­ment in Kansas , which blos­somed in 1991 dur­ing the anti-abor­tion ​ “ Sum­mer of Mer­cy ” block­ades in Wichi­ta .
Mark Giet­zen recalls how he recruit­ed peo­ple there to run for precinct com­mit­tee­man , and an over­whelm­ing num­ber won .
By 1994 , pop­u­lar Demo­c­ra­t­ic Rep. Dan Glick­man lost .
He was beat­en , he says , by ​“ peo­ple who had nev­er been involved in pol­i­tics . ”
Glick­man reports that he did best in the high - income , Repub­li­can parts of his district .
It was n’t all about abor­tion .
Glick­man was also hurt by his pro-NAF­TA stance .
Dale Swen­son , a union work­er , recalls , ​ “ I thought , ​‘Well , there ’s noth­ing left for me to vote for in the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty . ’ ” This point is the oth­er part of Frank ’s argu­ment : Repub­li­cans may be fool­ing work­ing - and mid­dle - class vot­ers with the cul­ture wars , but Democ­rats are equal­ly respon­si­ble for their loss­es by refus­ing to stand up for eco­nom­ic val­ues .
Oth­ers in the doc­u­men­tary have a sim­i­lar view , such as Kansas Farm­ers Union pres­i­dent Donn Teske , who resigned from the Repub­li­can Par­ty but notes , ​ “ I ’m a pop­ulist with­out a party . ”
What ’s the Mat­ter With Kansas ?
does n’t ful­ly answer the ques­tion in its title .
But it pro­vides a fun­ny , in - depth analy­sis of the inter­sec­tions between reli­gion , eco­nom­ics and pol­i­tics .
It ’s a movie that needs to be seen in both red and blue states , by lib­er­als and con­ser­v­a­tives alike .
The newspaper said the list , based on a survey carried out in June and July , showed scientists and teachers ranked " way below , and that government functionaries , too , scored hardly better " .

Montreal ’s bikesharing system , known as “ bixi , ” is coming to Boston and London .
Photo by amesis .
London and Boston made big announcements this week , both naming Montreal ’s Public Bike System – known as Bixi ( short for “ bicycle taxi ” ) – as their preferred bike - share provider .
Could Bixi ’s foray onto the world scene be a game changer for public - use bicycles ?
Beginning in spring 2010 , Londoners and Bostonians can sign up for a personal key card ( $ 78 / year CND in Montreal ) providing 24 - hour access to thousands of convenient bicycles for short - term use .
Members can hop on bikes at hundreds of stations throughout the city center , and ride them one - way to other stations , with up to 30 minutes for free .
The concept , already taking Europe by storm , is clean , affordable , and super convenient .
London plans an impressive 6,000 bicycles at 400 stations .
Boston envisions 2,500 bikes at 290 secure racks , before expanding to 5,000 bicycles at 475 locations as the system reaches Cambridge , Brookline , Arlington , and Somerville .
This week ’s news signals a major shift for the bike - sharing industry .
To date , advertising giants like ClearChannel and JC Decaux have operated the largest systems , mostly in Europe .
Public Bike System is the first mobility company , focused on bicycles , to compete and win a major city contract .
Make that two .
Why is this important ?
Public Bike System plans to manage the system locally and responsively , with the goal of making neighborhoods healthier and more sustainable .
Its business is bikes .
I wrote in July about Washington , D.C. ’s contrasting experience with the bikes - for - advertising model , in which ClearChannel seems reluctant to expand its 100 - cycle SmartBike pilot unless D.C. donates more public ad space to subsidize the program :
ClearChannel ’s business is advertising , so its mission compels it to focus on billboards , not bikes .
Moreover , because the city owns all the bike - share revenue , while ClearChannel owns all the cost , better service and more business mean LESS profit for the operator .
Bixi promises to fix this conundrum too .
The Boston engagement commits Public Bike System to providing its own capital and implementing a system that covers all its costs .
If successful , Bixi may become the first large , self - sustaining bike - share system in the world .
Financial self - sufficiency could pave the cycle track for hundreds of new cities to bike along .
Public Bicycle System is not the only new mobility company winning new bike - share business .
Veloway ( by Veolia ) operates a small system in London and soon will serve two cities in France plus a university .
And B - Cycle ( by Humana and Trek ) plans to roll out small systems in Denver , Miami Beach , and Honolulu .
Meanwhile , ClearChannel continues to win new business too — with news this week of planned system in Mexico City .
Bixi ’s job will not be easy .
It will have to balance service quality , societal benefits , and financial pressure , in a new service model with many unknowns .
Will Bixi demonstrate a better service and superior business model , in practice ?
Or will it prove , as many competitors say , that bike sharing must receive large public subsidy to be truly green , convenient , and affordable ?
The answer sure will be exciting .
Apptis Inc. , a military information technology provider , repaid $ 1.3 million of a $ 5.4 million Pentagon contract after investigators said the company provided inadequate computer security and a subcontractors system was hacked from an Internet address in China .
Privately held Apptis , based in Chantilly , returned the money in February “ for services that were never performed ” during a three - year military health - service contract awarded in November 2004 , according to the Pentagon inspector generals semi-annual report .
Apptis agreed to the repayment after the Defense Criminal Investigative Service concluded the company and a subcontractor failed to provide “ proper network security and information assurance services , ” according to the report , released in June .
The subcontractors system under Apptis management was intruded upon “ with total access to the root network ” from an Internet address in China , the report said .
The report didnt say when the intrusion occurred .
The Pentagon started its investigation in August 2007 .
Under the contract , Apptis provided software maintenance , updates and testing for a Military Health System program that standardizes reporting of health costs and includes unclassified though sensitive personnel data , according to a government description of the program .
The case illustrates “ an ongoing problem in protection of Defense Department information that is not under the complete control of the department , ” said special agent Paul Sternal , head of the criminal services cyber crimes unit , in an interview .
“ Violations such as these will be getting more attention because of the increased emphasis on cyber security , ” Mr. Sternal said .
The agency is conducting similar investigations of other companies , he said .
Pauline Healy , an Apptis spokeswoman , said in an e-mail , “ The amount we paid was to settle any and all issues surrounding performance requirements to the mutual satisfaction of both parties . ”
Mr. Healy said the “ apparent intrusion ” occurred with a subcontractors system .
Mr. Sternal wrote in a 2007 article for the government - published Journal of Public Integrity that there is no law or rule requiring defense contractors to report the loss of “ sensitive but unclassified defense data through cyber theft . ”
“ This lack of reporting requirements presents a national security vulnerability , ” he wrote .
President Obama is seeking to improve security in government computer systems .
He said in May he will appoint a White House adviser to oversee the security of all government and business computer networks in response to widespread breaches and theft of information .
The Pentagon by September will publish proposed revisions to its acquisition rules that will require improved protection of Pentagon information in its contracts , spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin said in an e-mail .

NOT long after the assassination of John Kennedy in 1963 , the Senate contemplated a bill to tighten federal control over the sale of guns through the post .
Three gun-lovers drove 2,500 miles from Arizona to Washington , DC , to protest .
One argued that the bill was part of “ a further attempt by a subversive power to make us part of one world socialistic government ” and that it could “ create chaos ” and help “ our enemies ” to seize power .
Not much has changed since Richard Hofstadter described this incident in a hugely influential book , “ The Paranoid Style in American Politics ” .
Gun-lovers still argue that the slightest curb on their right to bear arms will make America vulnerable to tyranny .
And in other areas , too , the paranoid style is alive and frothing .
Some of Barack Obama 's detractors content themselves with arguing that he is a bad president .
Others go further .
“ Birthers ” insist that he was not born in the United States and is therefore constitutionally barred from being president .
Yet Mr Obama 's birth certificate says he was born in Hawaii , and there is not a shred of evidence to the contrary .
There is even an announcement of his birth in the archive of the Honolulu Advertiser , a local newspaper .
Yet the internet crackles with theories as to how all this was faked so that , 48 years later , Mr Obama could impose a socialist state on America .
And a YouGov poll for The Economist found that 26 % of Republicans think Mr Obama is probably foreign - born .
Other conspiracy theories about Mr Obama are even loopier .
For example , some Americans think he is the Antichrist .
The evidence for this , apparently , is that in the Bible Jesus is quoted as predicting that Satan will come down like lightning from heaven , and the words for “ lightning ” and “ heaven ” in Hebrew sound a bit like “ Barack Obama ” .
Plus , his presidential limo is nicknamed “ The Beast ” .
For those who think this is too far - fetched , there is the theory that Mr Obama is a closet Nazi .
He thinks abortion should be legal .
Historically , some abortion advocates have also been eugenicists .
Therefore he must be one of them .
Also , he wants to discourage smoking .
So did Hitler !
Hofstadter , writing at the time of Barry Goldwater 's insurgency , argued that political paranoia — a mix of anger , heated exaggeration , suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy — was most evident on the extreme right .
And there are plenty of examples of right - wingers peddling nutty tales .
Isolationists in the 1940s accused Franklin Roosevelt of deliberately letting the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbour to provide an excuse for war .
Talk - radio crackpots in the 1990s accused the Clintons of having Vince Foster , a depressive friend of theirs who killed himself , murdered .
But the left is hardly immune to such fantasies .
Some people , including Mr Obama 's own former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , believe that AIDS was cooked up by the government to kill blacks .
A staggering 18 % of Americans think that the government of George Bush probably knew in advance about the attacks of September 11th 2001 but allowed them to proceed anyway .
Some even contend that Mr Bush orchestrated the attacks himself , to create an excuse for invading Iraq .
To believe this , you have to believe that the Bushies were both wicked enough to murder thousands of Americans and brilliant enough to execute such a mind - bogglingly sophisticated plot without a single leak — in a culture where Richard Nixon could not even hush up a burglary .
Belief in conspiracy theories can be comforting .
If everything that goes wrong is the fault of a secret cabal , that relieves you of the tedious necessity of trying to understand how a complex world really works .
And you can feel smug that you are smart enough to “ see through ” the official version of events .
But widespread paranoia has drawbacks .
For a start , it makes calm , rational debate rather tricky .
How can you discuss the trade - offs of health - care reform , for example , with someone who thinks the government is plotting to kill grandma ?
It does not help , either , that politicians on both sides are willing to fan the flames .
Sarah Palin calls Mr Obama 's health - care proposals “ evil ” .
Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , calls the protesters who loudly oppose them “ evil - mongers ” .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives , calls them “ un-American ” .
It 's serious
In his book “ Voodoo Histories : The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History ” , David Aaronovitch argues that conspiratorial fantasy can have dangerous real - world consequences .
Hitler read and believed The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a bogus account of a global Jewish conspiracy .
So did the founders of Hamas .
Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people with a bomb in Oklahoma in 1995 because he thought the federal government was hatching various dastardly plots .
Some people watch the ferment at town - hall meetings in America today and worry that another Oklahoma - style atrocity is brewing .
A few protesters are waving placards wishing for Mr Obama 's death .
Others are ostentatiously wearing firearms outside his rallies .
A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Centre describes an uptick in the number of “ Patriot ” militia groups since Mr Obama 's election and frets that some could turn violent .
One should not exaggerate such threats .
The Secret Service does not let gun-wielding protesters too near the president .
And the vast majority of people who visit crazy websites will never hurt anyone .
But there is no cause for complacency , either .
Politicians should tone down the rhetoric .
Protesters should read some history before making Hitler comparisons .
Talk - show hosts should stop pretending that paranoid nitwits are asking reasonable questions .
If people are continually told that their government is plotting against them , a few may decide to fight back .
And as Lee Harvey Oswald showed , even one man with a violent sense of grievance can do a lot of harm .

A newly released paper from NASA shows something astronomers have long postulated , but never observed .
Astronomers witnessed odd behavior around a young star .
Something , perhaps another star or a planet , appears to be pushing a clump of planet - forming material around .
The observations , made with NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , offer a rare look into the early stages of planet formation .
Planets form out of swirling disks of gas and dust .
Spitzer observed infrared light coming from one such disk around a young star , called LRLL 31 , over a period of five months .
To the astronomers ' surprise , the light varied in unexpected ways , and in as little time as one week .
Planets take millions of years to form , so it 's rare to see anything change on time scales we humans can perceive .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
One possible explanation is that a close companion to the star -- either a star or a developing planet -- could be shoving planet - forming material together , causing its thickness to vary as it spins around the star .
" We do n't know if planets have formed , or will form , but we are gaining a better understanding of the properties and dynamics of the fine dust that could either become , or indirectly shape , a planet , " said James Muzerolle of the Space Telescope Science Institute , Baltimore , Md. Muzerolle is first author of a paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
" This is a unique , real - time glimpse into the lengthy process of building planets . "
One theory of planet formation suggests that planets start out as dusty grains swirling around a star in a disk .
They slowly bulk up in size , collecting more and more mass like sticky snow .
As the planets get bigger and bigger , they carve out gaps in the dust , until a so - called transitional disk takes shape with a large doughnut - like hole at its center .
Over time , this disk fades and a new type of disk emerges , made up of debris from collisions between planets , asteroids and comets .
Ultimately , a more settled , mature solar system like our own forms .
Before Spitzer was launched in 2003 , only a few transitional disks with gaps or holes were known .
With Spitzer 's improved infrared vision , dozens have now been found .
The space telescope sensed the warm glow of the disks and indirectly mapped out their structures .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Science operations are conducted at the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , also in Pasadena .
Caltech manages JPL for NASA .

And here is the rest of it .
Here is the beginning of my post .
Mr Fitzpatrick 's constituency is home to a large Muslim community A government minister has defended his decision to walk out of a Muslim wedding in east London because he was told he must sit apart from his wife .
Jim Fitzpatrick , food , farming and environment minister , left a ceremony at London Muslim Centre , Whitechapel .
The MP for Poplar and Canning Town told the BBC the segregation showed a degree of intolerance in the East End .
But a spokesman for the centre said the segregation was at the request of the couple getting married .
Mr Fitzpatrick , whose constituency is home to a large Muslim community , blamed the tough stance on the Islamic Forum of Europe ( IFE ) - an organisation that calls for Sharia law - which is based in the same building .
The vast number of my Muslim constituents who 've contacted me have expressed sympathy
Jim Fitzpatrick MP
He told the BBC's Today : " This is a very exceptional occasion , it 's a new occurrence .
" It perhaps demonstrates that there is a degree of intolerance - certainly exclusion rather than inclusion , which we are trying to build in the East End .
" Certainly the vast number of my Muslim constituents who 've contacted me have expressed sympathy that I was placed in this predicament . "
Mr Fitzpatrick is the local MP and a family friend of bride Mahbuba Kamali and groom Bodrul Islam .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The couple said they decided on a segregated wedding out of respect for some of their elderly relatives .
Mrs Kamali said : " It was a private party so if we want to make these requests we are not imposing it and saying we want it to go nationwide and for everyone to be segregated .
" If we wanted to we could have had a fancy dress party and ask all our guests to come this way , and I 'm sure he would not refuse . "
Mr Islam said he was " upset and embarrassed " by the incident .
" I do n't think anyone deserves to have their wedding hijacked for political purposes , or any other purposes , " he said .
Mohammad Shakir , a spokesman for the centre , said : " Segregated weddings have always been popular in the Muslim community - the London Muslim Centre has facilitated them for over five years .
" It is part of the attraction for Muslim families so they can celebrate their happy day in a religious atmosphere .
" We have always allowed non-Muslim guests to be seated together without segregation , but this is entirely at the discretion of the families who hire the halls . "

Rutgers University Professors Mor Naaman and Jeffrey Boase set out to analyze the content and characteristics of social media activity .
They dubbed communications systems like Facebook and Twitter , " social awareness streams , " and then took to examining user behavior .
After dissecting over 3,000 tweets from more than 350 Twitter users ' status updates the professors concluded that 80 % of users are " meformers , " or " Me Now " status updaters .
Meformers are " people who use the platform to post updates on their everyday activities , social lives , feelings , thoughts , and emotions . "
The rest ( 20 % ) are informers who use the channels to share informational updates like links news articles .
The research and methodology was carefully documented ( see below ) , and in their analysis the professors distinguished 9 different types of tweets .
Categories include information sharing , self promotion , opinions and complaints , statements and random thoughts , me now , question to followers , presence maintenance , self - referential anecdotes , and anecdotes about others .
In the coding part of the process , researchers were able to attribute tweets to multiple categories .
They also ensured that tweets were independently analyzed by two different parties to eliminate errors .
Based on the categories and complex cluster analysis , the professors were able to lump Twitterers into one of two categories : meformers or informers .
The former makes up 80 % of the user base , while the latter a meager 20 % .
Interesting enough , though , the study also showed that the informers have significantly more friends and followers than their meformer counterparts .
The median informer has 131 friends and 112 followers , while the median meformer has just 61 friends and 43 followers .
Although not portraying the average Twitterer in a glamorous the light , the research seems to line up with other surveys , studies , and reports on the micro medium .
It 's even more unflattering then the San Diego State research that showed young people believe social media is for narcissists .
It does n't go so far as to say we tweet pointless babble , but it did find that 41 % of all messages fall in the " Me now " category , which does correspond with the earlier study that claimed 40 % of all tweets are pointless babble .
You can read the entire report below , but here are a few additional interesting findings from the Twitter research :
- Informers have a higher proportion of mentions of other users in their messages ( that is they @reply to more Twitterers ) - 25 % of messages come from mobile phones - 51 % of mobile - posted messages are " me now " messages , compared to the 37 % of " me now " messages posted from non-mobile applications

AT&T's contract with the Communications Workers of America Local 1298 expired in April , and the union 's not happy about management 's approach during negotiations .
So , hundreds of union members went to work wearing t- shirts saying " prisoner of AT&T " .
" They gave us the option to take 'em off or go home , suspended for a day , " said Mike Duffy , an installation repair technician in Danbury .
" I did n't have another shirt , so we went home . "
Duffy 's union leaders figure more than two hundred workers were suspended , out of a thousand union workers who wore the shirts .
They threaten to file a grievance with the National Labor Relations Board over arbitrary suspensions .
" I was amazed , " said Bill Henderson , the local president .
" How can they say that one job should be sent home and the other job should n't ? "
What he 's really worried about is AT&T sending jobs away , out of Connecticut .
Over the last two years it 's moved twelve hundred union jobs to the Midwest , he says .
In a statement , AT&T spokesman Walt Sharp said " We do not believe dress disparaging the company is appropriate for someone representing the company . "
If workers wore the shirts to jobs in call centers where they do n't face customers there would be no problem , he said .

The Pot - in - pot Cooler was designed by Mohammed Bah Abba , who won the Rolex Prize and who has been promoting this process throughout Nigeria .
Based on ancient techniques , the concept takes advantage of evaporative cooling .
Two terra -cotta pots are used , one inside the other , allowing for an approximate 3 cm ( 1.2 in ) to 4 cm ( 1.6 in ) gap between the smaller and larger pot .
The gap is filled with sand and then saturated with water .
( Some of the water will seep into the clay pots as well . )
Fruits and vegetables are placed inside the small pot and the cooler is covered with a wet towel .
As the water slowly evaporates from the cooler , heat is taken from the clay pots , keeping the temperature of the food cool inside .
Water needs to be added to the sand , depending on the air temperature outside .
Left in the shade , the Pot - in - Pot cooler will keep foods fresh for some time .
" Pot - in - pot " cooler basics [ edit | edit source ]
The basic " pot - in - pot " cooler has two large unglazed pottery pots , which could be commissioned to be made without bottom holes ( as in the pots below , produced by Panama Pottery in Sacramento , California ) .
One pot fits inside the other , with a layer of sand in between the pots .
Alternately , normal pots could have been used , with their holes sealed with wax or waterproof tape .
In this photo , a watering pot is used to wet the sand layer ( a daily process to be completed in the morning ) .
Inside the inner pot , there is a watermelon , a cabbage , a bag of carrots , and two apples .
In the photo above , there is a folded towel on top of the pots and produce , and towels are moistened ( twice per day ) to provide additional evaporation through the cloth top .
Folsom , California , USA ( the location of these photos ) is typically hot in the summer , but this is an exceptionally hot day at 43 °C ( 109 °F ) in the shade .
It is an excellent opportunity to test this cooler .
The temperature inside the pot seen below is 23 °C ( 73 °F ) , making it 15 °C ( 59 °F ) cooler inside the pot than outside .
These fruits and vegetables have been in the device for a week and they are perfectly fresh .
The daytime outside temperature has varied during the week from a high of 43 - 32 °C ( 109 - 90 °F ) and the temperature inside the pot has varied from 24 - 17 °C ( 75 - 63 °F ) .
To learn more about this device , go to http://rolexawards.com/en/the-laureates/mohammedbahabba-the-project.jsp
Sharon Cousins discovered that it is important to weight the inner pot when initially moistening the sand , or it will try to float and the sand will slip down and pile up underneath .
This is a very effective way of keeping produce fresh , in many cases keeping vegetables fresh for longer than in the refrigerator .
Sharon bought large plant pots on sale and used pieces of plastic jug glued on with Shoe Goo to seal the drain holes .
She later discovered , much to her sorrow , that a northern winter can destroy a pot - in - pot cooler unless it is stored somewhere where it can dry out for the winter ( water in the somewhat porous unglazed clay freezes and can crack the pots ) .
They can also be enormously heavy and hard to move .
In colder climates where it freezes , or if the device needs to be moved for other reasons , try to obtain or make a sturdy base with rolling caster wheels ( often sold for heavy plant pots ) to help with moving the cooler .
Or , assemble it on a sturdy , unused wagon , perhaps one that a child outgrew .
But make sure that the base is strong and that it rolls , because the weight of the clay , sand , water , and vegetables really adds up .

Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska announced Friday that she would step down by the end of the month and not seek a second term as governor , fueling speculation that she is trying to position herself as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
Her decision follows a week of extraordinarily bad publicity , from within her own state over ethics inquiries and across the national landscape as top aides on her vice - presidential campaign and supporters have been engaged in a highly public feud that has spilled out in vociferous tones online on blogs and on television .
Bloggers in Alaska , critics of the governor as well as former Palin supporters , suggest also that pending releases of e-mails among the Palins were about to expose her to further questions about her finances and governance issues .
In fact , Governor Palin signaled in her nearly breathless news conference that more trouble may lie ahead , as she cited battles that could cost her millions of dollars , a pile - up adding on to her burdens .
Ms. Palin , who was Senator John McCain ’s vice presidential running mate last year and solidified the support of the party ’s conservative base , explained her decision at a news conference at her home in Wasilla , Alaska , accompanied by her husband , Todd , and other family members .
“ We know we can effect positive change outside of government , ” she said in making the announcement .
Full text of the speech .
Known as Sarah Barracuda when she played basketball in high school , Ms. Palin used point guard analogy in explaining her decision , saying she knows “ exactly when to pass the ball so the team can win . ”
Video
She said that she planned to hand over the reins of the state government to Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell , who would be sworn in at the governor ’s picnic in Fairbanks later this month .
“ This decision came after much consideration , ” Ms. Palin told reporters gathered at her home , and added , “ I really do n’t want to disappoint anyone with this announcement . ”
There had been wide speculation that she would seek to be the Republican Party ’s presidential candidate in 2012 .
Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota , who is also considered to be a leading Republican candidate for president in 2012 , announced last month that he would not seek re-election .
By leaving office early , Ms. Palin , a 45 - year - old mother of five , will be able to travel around the country more freely and not be constrained by the duties and responsibilities of being a governor .
However controversial , the Alaska governor still draws big crowds among conservative voters and national Republicans , responding to the news , suggested that she would be a great weapon in this year ’s elections in various states .
Michael Steele , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , acknowledged her pull in a statement issued tonight : “ I plan on talking to Governor Palin very soon .
She is an important and galvanizing voice in the Republican Party .
I believe she will be very helpful to the Party this year as we wage critical campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey . ”
Reached by CNN at her farm in the Shenandoah valley , Mary Matalin , a top Republican consultant , called Ms. Palin ’s move “ brilliant ” although she said she was initially taken aback by the news .
But she seconded the notion that the governor ’s decision was smart in the sense that it will free her up , as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has been , to travel the country to make inroads with potential voters .
The resignation would remove Ms. Palin , for example , from criticisms like those she received earlier this year when she was forced to cancel appearances in the “ lower 48 ” to pursue her national ambitions at a time of disastrous flooding in Alaska .
Ms. Matalin joked that despite her own initial inside - the - Beltway reaction of surprise , shoppers at her local WalMart in the Shenandoah would be whooping “ hoo - rahs ” because of Ms. Palin ’s continued popularity among conservative voters .
Democrats were quick to seize on Ms. Palin ’s controversial role in state and national politics .
Brad Woodhouse , communications director of the Democratic National Committee , issued these remarks :
Either Sarah Palin is leaving the people of Alaska high and dry to pursue her long shot national political ambitions or she simply can’t handle the job now that her popularity has dimmed and oil revenues are down .
Either way – her decision to abandon her post and the people of Alaska who elected her continues a pattern of bizarre behavior that more than anything else may explain the decision she made today .
At her news conference , Ms. Palin took no questions .
But she also alluded to what may be lingering doubts as to the date of her announcement , given a series of very public , unflattering portraits of her in the national and state media .
“ Some are going to question the timing of this , and let me say this decision has been in the works for quite a while , ” she said .
But the timing is quite extraordinary .
At home , she has faced new criticism that ethics inquiries surrounding her — including Troopergate involving her former brother - in - law — had cost upward of $ 300,000 in state money , according to The Anchorage Daily News .
And just this week , a new Vanity Fair magazine article exposing exceptional animus toward her by top aides to Senator McCain , her running mate , has revived questions about her political acumen and her political future .
The article indeed sparked quite a eyebrow - raising public airing of problems with her as a national candidate ; it has unleashed what had been a simmering , longterm angst among aides who tried to stage - manage her vice - presidential run .
The article , by Todd Purdum , keeps on giving , as it were , as these internal feuds have now gone viral online among top McCain aides like Steve Schmidt , who during her initial debut , was one of her staunchest defenders at the convention and beyond .
Now he and William Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard and one of Ms. Palin ’s earliest fans , are engaged in an online / offline war that has become epic in its vitriolic exchanges .
Before the recent campaign fallout , Ms. Palin had returned to the national stage in June with a series of appearances in upstate and downstate New York , as well as deciding to attend the Republicans ’ big annual fund - raiser after initially declining to be its keynote speaker .
Her appearances , to big popular crowds , ultimately were overtaken by a wild , highly publicized feud with CBS ’ David Letterman , after he made on - air jokes about her daughter being “ knocked up ” by ballplayer Alex Rodriguez .
The joke was a reference to her daughter Bristol ’s out - of - wedlock pregnancy that overwhelmed even her debut at the Republican National Convention when it was disclosed in tandem .
Objections by Ms. Palin , her supporters and many dispassionate viewers prompted Mr. Letterman to issue repeat on - air apologies , especially since the daughter in attendance at a New York ballgame with Ms. Palin was her younger daughter , Willow , who is 14 .
And her difficulties in the state of Alaska have continued .
Indeed this past week , the state ’s health director Barbara Wooley , resigned , citing differences with the governor over social policies .
Rivals for the governor ’s job also are stepping up .
State Sen. Hollis S. French , who filed a letter of intent on Wednesday to run for governor , said , “ The idea that ’ the going got tough so i decided to quit ’ is inexcusable .
That is not an Alaskan value .
We celebrate the mushers who drive on through the storm despite the hardship .
Absent some physical or mental infirmity , this is unacceptable .
You keep going . ”
Reactions from others in Alaska , including fellow Republicans : Former Senate President Lyda Green , a Republican who has clashed with Ms. Palin referred to the energy issues Ms. Palin so often promotes .
“ Alaska is better off .
Her legacy will be how she put the oil industry into a tail spin in Alaska , ” Ms. Green said , referring to the higher taxes that oil companies have seen under the Palin administration .
Ms. Green added , “ She has not been invested as governor .
There is no vision , no plans , no improvement .
It was just go out , tax and punish . ”
Still , the governor ’s planned resignation has immediately given rise to those with aspirations to be her successor .
“ It caught everybody by surprise , ” said former Republican House Majority Leader Ralph Samuels , who is contemplating a run for governor in 2010 .
“ I ’ve had a million calls today from friends , all political junkies and everyone is asking the same questions .
Is it national ambition , or does she want time to write the book , or is she just tired of it ?
Do n’t have a clue . ”
Meanwhile , Nick Ayers , the executive director of the Republican Governors Association , expressed confidence tonight that the G.O.P. would continue to hold on to the Alaska seat .
“ While we regret the news announced by Governor Palin today , Alaska will continue to have a Republican governor through 2010 and we are confident the state will elect a Republican in next year ’s election . ”
But Mr. Ayers also told Fox News that Governor Palin ’s decision reflected her weariness with critics : “ I do n’t think this is buckling to pressure , ” he said .
“ I think this is her coming to the realization that the legislature in Alaska and that some bloggers and activists in Alaska are going to do everything they can to stymie her progress .
This is a governor who did n’t run for the office because she wanted a title .
She wanted to make significant change in the state .
She realized that that was no longer going to be able to happen , because things had become so partisan there . ”
Ms. Palin arrived on the political scene in Alaska in 2006 , a self - described “ hockey mom ” and small - town mayor who ousted the incumbent governor to become the youngest person and first woman to hold the post .
Two years later , Senator McCain drafted her as his running mate .
During the fall campaign , she was by far the most polarizing figure on the trail , drawing huge , devoted Republican crowds , but deeply negative reactions from Democrats and many independents .
Her career in a timeline .
In addition to Ms. Palin and Mr. Pawlenty , several other Republicans are being viewed as potential candidates , including some who have seriously damaged their chances through self - inflicted wounds .
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Lousiana , 38 , considered a rising star in the party , was sharply ridiculed in February after delivering a flat Republican response to a speech by President Obama to a joint session of Congress .
And two others with presidential aspirations — Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Senator John Ensign of Nevada — both admitted that they had been involved in extramarital affairs .

Concerned citizens along with representatives from the Vaccine Research Project , Safe Minds , and We Are Change Colorado gathered at the Rita Bass Trauma Center and EMS Education Institute in Denver on Saturday to discuss the CDCÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ‘ Full Throttle ’ plan to move forward with the H1N1 mass vaccine program this fall .
The meeting focused heavily on the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine .
( Article continues below )
Be aware that an ID card and electronic monitoring of the vaccination program were mentioned ( further in the article ) .
Please read the public statement below from Safe Minds .
Safe Minds public statement 08/08/09
MEETING PURPOSE
It must be acknowledged that the CDC attempted to engage the public through the Keystone Center , a third party mediator , they failed to impress the public .
Ã‚Â
It was made abundantly clear on several occasions that the discussion was for discussion purposes only and bared no weight on the government ’s decision to move forward with a mass - vaccination program .
According to the Discussion Guide handed out at the Public Engagement Project on the 2009 Novel H1N1 Influenza Vaccination Program Introduction under the section labeled Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœPublic DilemmaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ it states ,
CDC H1N1 Discussion guide
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ These uncertainties and complexities pose a different dilemma because of the complexities and amounts of resources required to plan for mass vaccination well in advance of the pandemic —
Should the US take a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœfull throttleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ or a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœgo - easyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ approach to mass vaccination , or an approach somewhere in between ?
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Propositions for selecting an option for not continuing a mass vaccination plan were unavailable making the whole thing a farce as minds were already made up .
The real reason for the meeting was revealed in a small paragraph with University of Nebraska letterhead attached in the information packet .
The purpose of the research noted ,
“ A survey may be given to you to get information about your opinions and knowledge about this topic ( H1N1 Influenza ) .
Research associated with the project will explore whether and how the views of participants change as a result of thinking about and discussing an issue . ”
CDC – University of Nebraska Letter
PARTICIPANTS
Stated earlier on the University of Nebraska letterhead the participants of this meeting included ( as noted on the letterhead ) ,
1 . You are a member of a community taking part in this project as a participant
2 . You are an expert on such topics as public health , influenza ethics and public engagement and agreed to participate as an expert or observer .
3 . Your work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or other federal , state or local governmental agencies involved in making decisions or analyzing public health policies
10 similar meetings are being held across America .
The meeting in Denver had characteristics of an Edward - Bernays - style-public - relations - opinion - forming - campaign.Ã‚Â
It is likely that the arguments and language used by the public at this meeting will be used in a future media blitz during fall to counter any arguments in debating government policy decisions .
Ã‚Â Pre and Post - meeting questions were documented via a questionnaire to determine if our opinion concerning the ‘ Knowledge about the Pandemic Flu ’ has changed .
CDC – H1N1 Pre survey
CDC – H1N1 Post survey
The agenda details , how the larger group , is broken down into small groups .
In all likelihood this tactic is meant to minimize influential and knowledgeable speakers concerning the topic of vaccines and adverse reactions .
As a side note , many of the public health officials came to observe the small group discussions and were visibly perturbed with the questions being asked concerning the safety and efficacy of vaccines .
Prior to the meeting discussion beginning , a short movie produced by Beth Bell , MD at the CDC , was to elaborate on the ‘ facts ’ of the H1N1 influenza .
The movie experienced technical difficulties early on and the large meeting quickly transitioned into a short impromptu presentation given by Naval Captain Ray Strikas working with the CDC .
CDC – H1N1 flu presentation
DISCUSSION FOCUS
The question apparently to be answered in this public engagement meeting was , “ What type of implementation planning strategy should the U.S. adopt for vaccinating Americans against the novel H1N1 influenza virus ? ”
CDC H1N1 Discussion guide
Assumptions of the discussion laid forth by the CDC / Keystone Center were :
Severity :
The severity of illness and groups at higher risk for infection or complications will be similar to what has already been observed in the US in the spring of 2009 , i.e. , Pregnant women , children , young adults and individuals with underlying conditions
Safety :
The safety profile of novel H1N1 vaccines will be similar to that of seasonal influenza vaccines for common , less serious reactions and the estimated risk for more serious reactions ( e.g. Guillain - Barre syndrome ) is between 1 - 10 per million persons vaccinated .
H1N1 Vaccine Supply : Supplies of licenses vaccine will become available in October 2009 but enough vaccines for all will not be available until February 2010 .
Cost : Vaccine will be purchased by the federal government and made available to all states on a per capita basis
Vaccine Recommendations : Vaccine will be recommended for 5 subgroups of the population but not for everyone at first .
2 doses will be needed for protection .
Seasonal Vaccine : Novel H1N1 vaccine and seasonal vaccine availability will overlap and both will be recommended for many populations ( sic ) groups .
Despite feigning interest in public participation , it appears that by all indications plans are slated for preparing a wide scale vaccination campaign in the upcoming months .
Regardless of attempts to control the debate , some of the key topics addressed by the aforementioned concerned citizens and activist groups were :
1 . The H1N1 vaccine has not been tested for safety or effectiveness
2. H1N1 is transmissible via a newly vaccinated person through viral shedding
3 . Side effects from the vaccine are virtually unknown
4. Untested adjuvants ( MF59 , AS03 ) will be used , along with ingredients such as thimerisol , on pregnant women and infants
Channel 4 of Denver reported after the meeting held on Saturday , “ We ’re hearing people who are very concerned about the safety of vaccines and so this vaccine is being produced relatively quickly , ” said Mike Hughes , Vice President of the Keystone Center .
“ So we hear a lot of people who are concerned that it might not be safe ; that there might be side effects from the vaccine . ”
The Associated Press released an article on August 7th , 2009 , stating , “ Sanofi Pasteur ’s trials began Thursday , testing both the vaccine ’s safety and how many doses would be needed to protect people from swine flu , the company said in a statement .
Most experts think two doses will be necessary . ”
The ‘ two dose theory ’ was confirmed in the meeting and slide deck .
Look for yourself at the H1N1 clinical safety trials still occurring as of August 11 , 2009 .
With much public concern on safety , it appears that the safety posture of the CDC and the United States government concerning vaccines will be reactive in nature .
Ã‚Â
When questioned , CDC and health officials seemed unconcerned that no safety data is available for the H1N1 vaccine and stated that Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) and Vaccine Safety Datalink ( VSD ) Project are the tools of choice .
Ã‚Â
While this may sound appealing , it does the American Public no justice as it measures adverse reactions only after the fact , with no emphasis on long - term disabilities such as chronic arthritis or diseases as cancer .
Interestingly on the CDC’sÃ‚Â website addressing the question of vaccine safety monitoring it states ,
“ If the clinical trials show the vaccine works safely , the manufacturer asks the FDA for a license .
The FDA reviews the clinical trial results and the proposed label for the vaccine .
The FDA also inspects the plant where the vaccine will be made and reviews the process for making the vaccine .
When the FDA is satisfied it is safe , the vaccine is licensed for public use .
The licensing process can take 10 years or longer . ”
Due to the fast - tracked process that the FDA has adopted concerning the H1N1 vaccine , scientists would be hard pressed to detect foreign contaminants such as animal DNA in the vaccines that could cause such things as cancer .
By example , scientists discovered the Oral Polio vaccine contaminatedÃ‚Â with the Simeon 40 ( SV40 ) virus which causes cancer .
Cerebellitis ( inflammation of the cerebellum ) is documented in medical literature following an influenza vaccine .
The cerebellum has a broader role in a number of key cognitive functions , including attention and the processing of language , music , and other sensory temporal stimuli .
Interestingly Autism , Aspergers , and PDD - NOS can have similar characteristics .
Of course symptoms can wax and wane during ones life , or they can remain dormant and reappear later on in life .
Dr. Andrew Moulden also describes how he believes that ALL vaccines cause impaired blood flow and vaccine damage .
This is evidenced in his article VACCINATIONS ARE CAUSING IMPAIRED BLOOD FLOW ( Ischemia ) , CHRONIC ILLNESS , DISEASE AND DEATH FOR US ALLÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦along with photographic evidence .
The Swine Flu of 1976 and the many cases of Gullain - Barre were also severely downplayed at the meeting .
Watch the 60 Minutes interview here .
Moreover , no reassurance was given from CDC or health officials who were in attendance at the meeting that a debacle that occurred with Baxter recently in the news would n’t be repeated .
As a matter of fact , they all claimed ignorant to the fact .
It has been noted in the past that the CDC has experimented mixing avian flu virus with human flu virus developed in a similar style lab as Baxter ’s .
Coincidentally , one of the countries that would have been potentially affected from the Baxter mix - up has decided not to purchase the H1N1 vaccine from Baxter .
Theresa Wrangham , President of Safe Minds , inquired about the recent meeting held by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) to discuss the safety of the adjuvants ( MF59 / AS03 ) used in the production of the swine flu vaccines .
Additional discussions on adjuvants by the Pandemic Influenza Working Group can be found here and here .
The U.S. has already purchased 1.8 billion dollars worth of adjuvants and yet , curiously , are not currently approved for human use in the United States .
It was a well placed question by Mrs. Wrangham as past experience has shown traditionally adverse reactions to vaccines are often under reported .
Meryl Nass reported on her website ,
“ At the 12/2008 FDA - NIH meeting on how to study novel adjuvants , Novartis scientist ( Novartis owns the MF59 adjuvant ) Dr. Novicki made the following statement :
“ Carcinogenicity–we have done no testing for the carcinogenicity of MF59 adjuvant or any of our preventive vaccines .
We have n’t done it and we do n’t plan to . ” ( see Page 391 ) ”
Continuing , Meryl Nass wrote ,
“ And if that was n’t reckless enough , DHHS Secretary Sebelius has since given Novartis a liability waiver through the PREP
Act for injuries their swine flu vaccines and adjuvants may cause , as long as Novartis lacks prior knowledge of the products ’ dangers . ”
“ How will we know who has been vaccinated and who has not , ” Ã‚Â was also asked by a member of We Are Change .
Apparently in development is an ID card that could be used to electronically track proof of influenza inoculations , however , details about the program were not elaborated on nor confirmed .
Electronic monitoring should be specifically brought to the attention of health officialsÃ‚Â in future meetings held around the nation until there is a satisfactory answer and details made publicly available !
NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES or VOICES
Vaccines were listed as the only “ viable ” option by the FDA and recommended by the CDC at the public meeting .
Ã‚Â
Any mention of collodial silver , anti-viral herbs and oils , homeopathy , chiropracty , vitamin therapies were simply ignored by ‘ health ’ officials .
The FDA has also authorized two products addressing influenza thus far , one of which is Tamiflu .
Tamiflu has been found harmful to administer to children and is not recommended by most health conscious parents .
It is no surprise then that in the long list of Washington insiders profiteering on the backs of BigPharma is Donald Rumsfeld .
Donald is one of the more well - known recent personalities and is ex-Secretary of Defense .
Donald Rumsfeld owns stock in the company that produces Tamiflu .
Donald Rumsfeld also served as Chairman of Board from 1981Ã¢â‚ ¬ ” 1986 ; 1995 - 1996 at RAND Corporation .
RAND Corporation has contracted with BigPharma on a number of interesting projects .
Notably , RAND Corporation recently published a briefing of a project entitled “ Strategies and Models for Promoting Adolescent Vaccination For Low - Income Populations ” sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur .
All of the information mentioned in this article is culminating into a war of the minds and battle for consent .
The CDC and other entities are already postured and maneuvered into pulling the trigger on a vaccine campaign this fall .
The same policies mentioned in the document , “ Strategies and Models for Promoting Adolescent Vaccination For Low - Income Populations ” , Ã‚Â are suddenly being brought to the forefront as almost by magik .

Political reporter , BBC News
Rules for identifying campaign leaflets have been in place for nearly 30 years Another morning and a slew of press releases drop into the e-mail box from the Liberal Democrats , reacting to various government announcements .
The Conservatives , meanwhile , have sent out another e-mail giving details of events at their upcoming party conference .
What do the two have in the common ?
At first glance , not much .
But if you read down to the bottom of both messages , you will be told that each has been printed and published by a named individual on behalf of the party concerned .
Each also tells you that the individual and the party are based at a given address , in effect the party 's HQ .
Since 1983 , all election candidates have been required by law to provide certain information - known as an imprint - on unsolicited campaign literature to alert voters to who it comes from .
Leaflets pushed through a letterbox have to identify who has printed the material - normally a candidate 's agent or assistant - who has published it - normally the candidate - and a postal address where they can be contacted .
This is designed to help voters tell the material is genuine and enable them to complain about it if they want .
The rules were updated in 2000 to cover material sent out by political parties as well as candidates and anyone breaching them faces a potential £ 5,000 fine .
Ministers have been chugging along either unaware that there is a risk building up or being vaguely aware of it and keeping their fingers crossed
Mark Pack
But with a general election on the horizon , there are concerns that the laws are ill - equipped for the new digital battlefields that the campaign will be fought on .
Candidates will be using all means at their disposal to get their faces known and messages across , including text messages , social networking sites , campaign videos and internet ads , not to mention the political classes ' latest communication fad - Twitter .
' Good practice '
Current laws give ministers the power , subject to Parliamentary approval , to draw up specific rules for non-printed material but , nine years on , they have yet to do so .
In its most recent guidance , the Electoral Commission said candidates should as " a matter of good practice " include imprint details on their campaign websites .
But candidates are not required to do so and the watchdog advised ministers in 2003 to look at the issue , arguing candidates need to be equally accountable in all different mediums .
Do you need party details on tweets ?
While all mainstream parties and many candidates already do this , the Commission admits the practice is not " consistent " among all campaigners .
" We believe that this requirement should be applied consistently across all non-broadcast media if voters are to maintain trust in online campaign material and the current generally positive relationship between voters and campaigners online is to continue , " it says .
With electronic campaigning set to play a bigger role than ever before in the next election , some people are worried about this apparent discrepancy .
" Ministers have been chugging along either unaware that there is a risk building up or being vaguely aware of it and keeping their fingers crossed , " says Mark Pack , a former Lib Dem executive who co-wrote the party 's election law manual .
Although there has yet to be a serious breach of the rules Mr Pack believes this may be only a matter of time and there is uncertainty about how the law would be interpreted in such a case .
Citing a case in the US where the authorities in Florida have banned political adverts on Google because there is not enough room to display the imprints , he says there are potential " flashpoints " around the corner .
" Anyone can put something on the internet , send a text message or an e-mail as the bar to action is so low , " he says .
Those potentially falling foul of the rules could range from " over- enthusiastic " campaigners to those mounting " dishonest " attacks and misrepresenting opponents ' views .
" It is not out of the question you are going to get some foolishness and the more you can protect people from this the better for everyone . "
Finding space
Yet the idea that every electioneering text message or tweet should carry an imprint from its sender seems implausible .
With space at a premium in these missives , the Electoral Commission acknowledges it would be " counter - productive " if such details squeezed out the actual content of a message .
Sites like Youtube have become huge since the 2005 election
There is also the issue of where an imprint should appear on a social networking page or a YouTube video to ensure voters can see it or whether a prominent link to an official website is enough .
Ministers recognised the complexity of these issues in 2004 when they decided the ever - changing media landscape meant it was impractical to create laws which would be effective and lasting .
Five years on , it appears little has changed .
The Ministry of Justice says specific guidance for candidates is a matter for the Electoral Commission while pointing out there is " already legislation which specifies that unsolicited material must contain details of its printer and promoter " .
Dirty tricks
But critics like Mark Pack have urged ministers and watchdogs to end what he calls their " stand - off " and bring rules for digital communications into line with those for printed material .
" I think they have essentially let it drift because there has not been a case come up which has made everyone think we must do something about it , " he says .
Since 2005 the internet has grown hugely , with rising numbers of bloggers and social network sites - which all means that regulators will face new challenges such as the growing scope for dirty tricks in cyberspace .
Back in 2003 , the Electoral Commission said spoof websites were an acceptable part of the democratic debate as long as they were clearly identifiable as such and did not seek to deceive the voters .
But now spoof videos can be seen by millions of people within a matter of minutes , do the same judgements still apply ?
The answer is , come the next election , the watchdog will not be spending its time scouring the internet for potential " video nasties " .
A spokesman explains : " There is nothing in electoral legislation that would cover that kind of stuff .
Our job is to provide guidance for those people taking part in an election and to help them stay within the law . "
But he makes clear that complaints about potentially defamatory material , under electoral laws , remain a matter for the police and that cases will be investigated .

Ralph Hull , an early 20th century Ohio magician , was able to achieve one of the most amazing magic feats of all :
He could repeat a trick to fellow magicians , and they could n’t guess his secret .
According to philosopher Daniel Dennett , Hull called his trick “ The Tuned Deck . ”
It was a variant of the old “ pick a card , any card ” routine .
After you put your card back in the deck , Ralph would riffle the deck and listen to the sound it made to figure out your card , then produce it with a flourish .
The secret , Dennett explained , is that , “ The trick , in its entirety , is in the name of the trick … and more specifically , in one word : ‘ The ! ' ”
The audience thought he did the trick the same way each time .
A trained magician might suspect him of doing a palm , but the next time Ralph made it obvious he was n’t palming .
Maybe it was a false cut ?
But next time , there was no cut at all .
Because Ralph kept changing the method but keeping the illusion the same , no one ever figured out his secret .
The federal government is using the same trick .
“ The ” federal government .
As if it was a single entity with all parts operating in unison , always increasing its power over us in the exact same way .
Though the size and power of the government does increase under any administration , the mechanism changes each time .
Government grew under Reagan , Bush I , Clinton , Bush II and now Obama , but in different ways .
Government grows with any combination of Democrats and Republicans controlling the legislative and executive branches .
It grew when everything was under Republican control , it grew when the two parties split control , and it grows now under Democrat control .
Free Your Inner Yankee Philip Maymin Best Price : null Buy New $ 11.95 ( as of 03:00 EST - Details )
Sometimes it grows primarily through foreign policy , as under Bush II , and sometimes through domestic policy , as under Obama .
But previous policies of growth are rarely reversed : Our military is still in Iraq and Afghanistan and Germany and South Korea .
We still have the Departments of Energy , Labor and Education .
We still have the Federal Reserve .
Just when the populace figures out what tricks the current incarnation of the federal government is pulling , the government changes the method .
So what is a citizen to do ?
Are we really supposed to waste our time reading bills when those who vote on them do n’t bother ?
Must we pore over the minutiae of politics and protest each particular attack on our freedom ?
Who has that kind of time ?
The lesson from Ralph Hull is that it would n’t matter .
Pick a politician , any politician .
Maybe one particular election swings because of a hanging chad .
Maybe another is a choice between two candidates who differ in no substantive way .
No matter who you vote for , the Patriot Act is presented with a flourish .
So is war and socialized medicine and bailed - out banks .
Yankee Wake Up Philip Maymin Best Price : $ 4.95 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 02:35 EST - Details )
No , trying to expose the federal government ’s tricks is a pointless endeavor , because the tricks change but the performance does not .
What happened with the magicians who kept trying to figure out Hull ’s secret ?
With each repetition , and each rejected hypothesis , their resolve grew weaker and weaker until they simply stopped trying to figure it out .
And that ’s what will happen to us too if we just keep fighting each particular infraction on our liberty as it occurs .
We ’ll get tired , and they ’ll keep going .
We tried protesting the war under the previous administration .
We tried Tea Party protests and Town Hall attendance under this administration .
Did it help ?
Are we out of Iraq or Afghanistan ?
Have we stopped bailing out banks ?
Have we removed regulations limiting our health care options ?
If Ralph Hull 's secret had gotten out , people would simply stop watching him ; when you ignore a magician , he does n’t get your money .
But that 's the difference with government : they will take it anyway .
The government is like one of those annoying guys at parties who says , “ Give me a twenty and I ’ll make it disappear . ”
The only solution is to not let them take your money .
So how do we get the federal government out of our wallets , when they can tax us anything they choose and print however much more they want ?
We need some magic of our own .
We need to saw some laws in half , levitate a couple amendments , and make many government agencies disappear .

The Best of Philip Maymin
( UPDATE : I understand the Latino book is not anti-Latino , but in fact debunks anti-Latino prejudice .
Fair enough .
But I ’m still looking forward to the RNC ’s explanation for including “ bondage , ” “ anal , ” and “ clitoris . ” )
It ’s not very often the boys at AMERICAblog get to type the word “ clitoris ” in a political blog post , but thanks to Michael Steele and the headquarters of the Republican party , today is that special day .
Forget that copy of Playboy , kids , you do n’t need to go any further than your local RNC.com Web site .
Of course , in all seriousness , it ’s far worse than that – the Web site of the Republican National Committee is also promoting literature that is overtly anti-Semitic and anti-Latino .
It all started when earlier this week the GOP started promoting it ’s new Web site , http://www.gop.com/obamacard/.
The site is supposed to showcase how much money President Obama is supposedly spending by letting you , the visitor , spend money too on your new “ Obama credit card . ”
Just what products does the RNC propose you buy with your new Obama credit card ?
Anti-semitic , anti-Latino , and overtly pornographic literature – with pictures to boot .
Basically , the RNC site is set up as a faux online business , like Amazon.com , where you can buy goods by doing word searches .
Search for the word “ car , ” for instance , and you get pictures of various cars and how much you can pay for them with your ObamaCard .
But do n’t stop there .
Do a search for products dealing with the word “ Jew ” and the RNC suggests you buy the book “ The Jews and Their Lies ” ( bottom left ) .
Type in “ Latino ” and get “ The Latino Threat . ”
But the real fun starts when you type in the word “ gay . ”
Gay , you see , is banned by the RNC ( at least they have n’t lost their sense of irony ) .
“ Homosexual , ” however , is a product you can buy at the RNC site , and oh what they showcase with that word ( note the two men in the upper left corner – perhaps they ’re just very close friends , like Lindsey Graham and Aaron Schock ) .
A few other fun words you can search for on the RNC Web site …
Bondage :
Escorts :
And anal :
And if you have the time , try “ boob ” and “ clitoris ” too – you wo n’t be sorry .
But do n’t try “ vagina ” – Republicans ban vaginas .
But you already knew that .
Le président de la République a nommé mercredi l'ex - ministre socialiste au poste stratégique de directeur de l'Agence régionale de santé pour l'Ile - de - France .
Un débauchage supplémentaire qui risque d'agacer dans les rangs du PS .
Nicolas Sarkozy séduit une nouvelle figure de la gauche .
Et pas n'importe laquelle : Claude Evin , ancien ministre de la Santé emblématique de François Mitterrand entre 1988 et 1991 , dont la célèbre loi contre le tabagisme et l'alcoolisme porte son nom .
Il ne va certes pas intégrer le gouvernement de François Fillon ?
Mais comme l'annonçait Le Figaro il y a quelques mois déjà , et comme le confirmait Le Parisien , Nicolas Sarkozy l'a nommé officiellement mercredi en conseil des ministres à la fonction clé de directeur de l'Agence régionale de santé pour l'Ile - de - France .
Une sorte de « préfet de la santé » qui a par exemple le pouvoir de réorganiser les hôpitaux , source de conflits politiques locaux en série .
Claude Evin , symbole de l'ouverture de cette rentrée 2009 ?
Le principal intéressé s'en défend mordicus .
« Je ne franchis pas le Rubicon » , assure - t - il .
« Je suis toujours au Parti socialiste et n'ai pas l'intention de renier mes engagements en faveur du service public . »
Il rappelle avoir « milité depuis longtemps pour la création de ces agences régionales de santé qui , à mes yeux , ne sont ni de droite ni de gauche , et la ministre de la Santé m'a fait l'honneur de me solliciter avec l'aval du président de la République et du premier ministre » .
Aubry : « Nicolas Sarkozy casse la République »
Ses ex-camarades du PS risquent toutefois de l'accuser de servir de caution au gouvernement , notamment si celui- ci est amené à prendre des mesures impopulaires .
L'ancien ministre balaie cette hypothèse d'un revers de main .
« Je n'ai plus de mandats électifs au PS depuis 2007 , plaide - t - il .
Les gens qui me connaissent savent que j'ai des convictions et que je ne vais pas les mettre dans ma poche .
J'aborde cette mission l'esprit libre et sans arrière - pensée politicienne . »
Avant d'ajouter , dans un avertissement à peine voilé :
« Je pense que j'aurai les moyens de remplir cette mission , sinon j'en tirerai les conséquences . »
Première personnalité politique à réagir à cette nomination , Martine Aubry estime que ce geste d'ouverture est le signe « d'une politisation de la fonction publique » .
Cette fonction «est un poste de fonctionnaire , sauf que maintenant on considère que les fonctionnaires sont des politiques , c'est ça qui est inquiétant » , a estimé mercredi la première secrétaire du PS sur France Inter .
Avant d'enfoncer le clou : « Oui , ça devient politique , parce qu'on nomme des préfets , on nomme des fonctionnaires à la tête du client .
C'est cela aussi que casse aujourd ' hui Nicolas Sarkozy : la République tout simplement » .
Bernard Kouchner , Eric Besson , Fadela Amara , Jean - Marie Bockel , Martin Hirsch , les missions confiées à l'ex - locataire de Matignon Michel Rocard ou au directeur de Sciences Po Richard Descoings ?
Malgré sa volonté manifeste de conserver une indépendance , Claude Evin a toutes les chances d'apparaître aux yeux de l'opinion publique comme l'un des ralliés à Nicolas Sarkozy .
Le chef de l'Etat pense d'ailleurs déjà à la poursuite de sa politique d'ouverture : le sénateur Michel Charasse , ex-ministre du Budget socialiste et exclu du PS en 2008 , pourrait obtenir un siège prestigieux lors du renouvellement partiel du Conseil constitutionnel en 2010 .
Une autre grande figure des années Mitterrand qui céderait aux sirènes sarkozystes .
Omri ( Hal Scardino ) , a young boy growing up in Brooklyn , receives an odd variety of presents for his birthday : a wooden cabinet from his older brother , a set of antique keys from his mother Jane ( Linsday Crouse ) , and a tiny plastic model of an Indian from his best friend Patrick ( Rishi Bhat ) .
Putting them all together , Omri locks the Indian inside the cabinet , only to be awoken by a strange sound in the middle of the night .
Omri opens the cabinet to discover that the tiny Indian has come to life ; it seems that he 's called Little Bear ( Litefoot ) , and he claims to have learned English from settlers in 1761 .
Omri hides this remarkable discovery from his mother but shares it with Patrick ; as an experiment , Patrick locks a toy cowboy into the cupboard , and soon Little Bear has a companion , Boone ( David Keith ) , though predictably , the cowboy and the Indian do n't get along well at first .
Omri comes to the realizations that his living and breathing playthings are also people with lives of ...
WASHINGTON , Aug 25 ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney criticized President Barack Obama 's ability to handle national security after the Justice Department appointed a special prosecutor to investigate CIA interrogation abuses .
Cheney , who has emerged as a vocal defender of Bush administration policies since leaving the White House , said the intelligence obtained from harsh interrogation techniques had saved lives .
" The people involved deserve our gratitude .
They do not deserve to be the targets of political investigations or prosecutions , " he said in a statement dated Monday .
Cheney took issue with the Obama administration 's decisions this week to have a special prosecutor investigate CIA prisoner abuse cases and to have a new group handling terrorism interrogations report to the White House .
" President Obama 's decision to allow the Justice Department to investigate and possibly prosecute CIA personnel , and his decision to remove authority for interrogation from the CIA to the White House , serves as a reminder , if any were needed , of why so many Americans have doubts about this Administration 's ability to be responsible for our nation 's security , " Cheney said .
Earlier this year , Cheney had asked the CIA to declassify two memos that he said showed the effectiveness of using harsh interrogation methods on terrorism suspects .
The CIA in May rejected that request , but on Monday released the documents , with classified portions blacked out .
" The activities of the CIA in carrying out the policies of the Bush Administration were directly responsible for defeating all efforts by al Qaeda to launch further mass casualty attacks against the United States , " Cheney said .

On May 28 I wrote Mortgage Market Locks Up .
Ten year treasury yields started to soar and 30 year mortgages for good borrowers jumped a full point from 4.5 % to 5.5 % .
The question on my mind at the time was whether or not the mortgage action was a brief outlier .
It was n't .
Things are now worse .
Two days ago Michael Becker , a Mortgage Consultant at Green Pastures Mortgage & Finance wrote :
Mish , I ’ve attached two rate sheets to this e-mail .
One shows the rates from May 21st , and the other from today June 5th ( after a re-price ) .
You can see on May 21st 4.625 % was paying .375 points , and today 5.625 % is paying .25 points .
So in a little over 2 weeks rates have jumped 1 % .
That is a huge jump .
When you add in the effect of the new Home Valuation Code of Conduct ( HVCC ) appraisal process , many loans originations will never close .
This is because it is taking 15 - 25 days to get an appraisal back , and often those appraisals are coming 10 - 25 % low .
So locks expire or appraisals kill the deal , the latter possibly on purpose .
You are going to see the recovery in housing come to a complete halt .
Trade up buying is already dead .
Michael Becker
" Mortgage rates jumped again to 5.75 % and refis are frozen solid .
The trade - up market is dead but some new houses are still moving .... for now . "
Fannie Mae 4.5 % Mortgage Backed Securities
Two weeks ago when rates were hovering around 5.5 % Mark Hanson commented "
Mortgage banks that made unhedged commitments at 4.25 -4.75 % are now in a position to lose substantial sums of money .
" Today it 's an even bigger loss .

Interest Rate Buydowns Dead , ARMs Alive
Refis and trades up are not the only things dead .
A couple weeks ago when rates started to spike , one could have paid a point or less and bought the rate down to 4.5- 4.75 % .
Now , Jeff Bell informs me that the same buydown today might cost as many a 6 points !
Wow !
Mortgage - Bond Yields Climb to New High Since Fed ’s Buying Plan
Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities rose , setting a new high since the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy the bonds to drive down interest rates on new home loans and further thwarting the effort .
U.S. mortgage applications fell last week to the lowest level since February as a jump in borrowing costs discouraged refinancing and signaled that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’s bid to cap rates is stalling , according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released today .
The Fed initially said on Nov. 25 that it would buy as much as $ 500 billion of mortgage securities , before announcing in March that it would expand the program to as much as $ 1.25 trillion , as well as buy $ 300 billion of Treasuries .
Fed Is Out Of Control
Japanese Dolphin Hunt Takes A New Twist , Whales Not So Lucky
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Contrary to media reports saying that the annual dolphin hunt in Taiji , Japan was unfortunately underway , it now seems that it was more of a round - up .
About 5:30 AM yesterday , fisherman from the small coastal town — made infamous as the backdrop for the new dolphin documentary The Cove — drove about 50 pilot whales and 100 bottlenose dolphins towards the shore .
Instead of funneling the dolphins into the deadly cove for a blood bath , it appears that for now , concessions are being made in light of the public outcry from the movie .
According to the Associated Press , 50 dolphins will be sold to aquariums .
The rest will be set free .
Unfortunately , the 50 pilot whales did not receive a similar reprieve and were killed and sold for their meat .
So , we ’ve got a really mixed situation going on here — especially when it comes to dolphins being sold to aquariums .
But compared to the past , it ’s a step in the right direction — and we can thank the incredible work done by Louie Psihoyos and Richard O’Barry in drawing attention with The Cove .
According to one anonymous official at the Taiji fisheries association , the public pressure has been so great that the town was unclear over whether they might ever kill dolphins again .
“ I am elated , ” O’Barry , who was in Tokyo , told The Associated Press .
“ When I heard that , I did a backflip off the bed here . ”
We ’re cautiously optimistic that Taiji , Japan will end its dolphin hunt — especially as the international pressure is sure to ratchet up now that The Cove is set to debut in Europe this fall .
There ’s even talk of it being a front - runner for Best Documentary at the Oscars .

On 6th December 2004 a baby girl named Yan was born .
Her father , an internet entrepreneur , is called Shen Tong .
Yan was Shen ’s first child , and you might have expected him to have an excitable , sleepless night .
But oddly the opposite occurred .
He slept better than he had done for 15 years , six months and two days .
It ’s possible to be exact about the timing because 15 years , six months and two days earlier was 4th June 1989 and on that day Shen had been on a boulevard just off Tiananmen Square in Beijing .
He was a 20 - year - old student , and like thousands of others he was demonstrating in favour of political reform .
After martial law was declared , Shen watched as the army drove through the city .
Between outbursts of shooting , students tried to reason with the military .
Shen approached a truckload of soldiers ; he wanted , he says , to calm the surrounding crowd .
Suddenly an officer pulled out a pistol .
Parts of the rest of the story are hazy .
Shen was dragged back by others .
A shot was fired , and a female student , roughly Shen ’s age and standing just behind him , was hit in the face .
She died .
Shen remembers her covered in blood .
He is convinced that the bullet was intended for him .
Shen moved to the US , but violent images recurred in his dreams for many years — until , that is , the arrival of Yan .
Not only did he sleep well that night , but the following night , and the night after that .
Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a condition that can occur after a distressing event .
It involves a traumatic memory which comes back to mind repeatedly and involuntarily .
It ’s associated with chronic anxiety and hyper vigilance .
The numbers affected are contentious .
By one mid-range estimate tens of thousands of US veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from it .
As do British veterans of the Falklands war — more of whom have committed suicide than died in active service .
The Pentagon has sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into PTSD research .
But of course , as Shen Tong knows , you do n’t have to be a soldier to experience it .
Investigation of PTSD has been an important cause of new research into memory .
And our understanding of memory is , in turn , propelling a debate about what is known as enhancement , or the boosting of human capacities beyond a normal level .
The first issue to emerge …
14626955155f74f161d43712.80952575
The judge waves you into his chambers in the State Supreme Court building in Brooklyn , past the caveat taped to his wall 
“ Be sure brain in gear before engaging mouth ”  and into his inner office , where foreclosure motions are piled high enough to form a minor Alpine chain .
Every week , the nation ’s mightiest banks come to his court seeking to take the homes of New Yorkers who cannot pay their mortgages .
And nearly as often , the judge says , they file foreclosure papers speckled with errors .
He plucks out one motion and leafs through : a Deutsche Bank representative signed an affidavit claiming to be the vice president of two different banks .
His office was in Kansas City , Mo. , but the signature was notarized in Texas .
And the bank did not even own the mortgage when it began to foreclose on the homeowner .
The judge ’s lips pucker as if he had inhaled a pickle ; he rejected this one .
“ I ’m a little guy in Brooklyn who does n’t belong to their country clubs , what can I tell you ? ” he says , adding a shrug for punctuation .
“ I wo n’t accept their comedy of errors . ”
But the best part is that one is named Midge and another is named Slappy !

Much was made in the news , earlier this month , of the series of violent clashes that erupted between Uighurs , a Turkic , and predominantly Muslim , minority ethnic group in China , the Chinese state police , and Han Chinese residents in the the province of Xinjiang , in northwestern China .
But the media 's recent attention to the matter should be seen in light of a larger geo-political strategy , involving Turkey and the CIA , in ongoing furtherance of The Bernard Lewis Plan .
Originally implemented under the supervision of Zbigniew Brzezinski during the Carter administration , the plan was based on Lewis ' idea of an " Arc of Crisis " , created around the southern borders of Soviet Union , by empowering Muslim radicals to rebel against the communists , to bring about the fall of the Soviet Empire .
The key aspect of this strategy , over the last 30 years , as revealed in the book and movie , Charlie Wilson 's War , began with support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan , which became the CIA 's largest covert operation ever .
As outlined in Brzezinski's Grand Chessboard , control over central Asia , which in addition to Afghanistan , comprises the five former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan , is a key factor in mastery of all of Eurasia , and thereby , the world .
This is because , as is popularly known , Central Asia holds vast stores of energy resources .
Less known , however , is its role in the drug trade .
Since the implementation of Bernard Lewis ' Plan , and the US 's involvement in Afghanistan , the country now accounts for almost 95 % of the world 's opium production .
And it is profits arising mostly from this illicit trade that go largely to financing the deliberate spread of a fabricated brand of Islamic fundamentalism .
As mentioned by noted whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , " You get to a point where it gets very complex , where you have money laundering activities , drug related activities , and terrorist support activities converging at certain points and becoming one . "
Despite years of her testimony being suppressed by the State Secrets Privilege , it is her revelations , discovered in the course of her work for the FBI , that now help explain the significance of the immigration case against Turkish religious leader , Fethullah Gulen , living in self - imposed exile in the Pennsylvania , and explodes this entire complex of American foreign policy in the Middle East and Central Asia , and its broader implications for the Islamic world .
Fethullah Gulen , while also leading the movement behind Turkey 's current Islamic renaissance , is one of the key operatives who have been fronting for the CIA in the radicalization of Central Asia , involving drug trafficking , money laundering , and the nuclear black market , and false - flag terrorism .
A number of sources reveal that the Gulen organization has been used as a tool for the Special Operations Department of the Turkish police force , which evolved from the Counter - Guerrilla , the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio .
Operation Gladio was a clandestine initiative backed by the United States , which after WWII employed former SS to create ' stay - behind ' anti-communist .
It was responsible for the infamous " Strategy of Tension " in Italy during the 70s , which used false - flag terror operations , like that of the Red Brigade , to destabilize the country .
In Turkey , there is a popular belief that the Counter - Guerrilla are responsible for numerous unsolved acts of violence , and have exerted great influence over the country 's Cold War history , most notably for engendering the military coups of 1971 , and 1980 .
Among the documents that the attorneys for the State Department presented , in favor of rejecting Gulen 's application for a permanent visa , there are claims about the Gulen movement 's financial structure , it being emphasized that its economic power reached $ 25 billion .
The lawyers state :
Because of the large amount of money that Gulen 's movement uses to finance his projects , there are claims that he has secret agreements with Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Turkic governments .
There are suspicions that the CIA is a co-payer in financing these projects .
Most incriminating is the list of references that Gulen provided in an apparent effort to bolster his application , namely George Fidas , Graham Fuller , and Morton Abramowitz .
Graham Fuller happens to be listed as one of the American Deep State rogues on Sibel Edmonds ' State Secrets Privilege Gallery .
Graham E. Fuller is an American author and political analyst , specializing in " Islamic extremism " .
Formerly vice - chair of the National Intelligence Council , he also served as Station Chief in Kabul for the CIA .
A think piece that Fuller wrote for the CIA was identified as instrumental in leading to the Iran - contra affair .
The Iran - Contra affair was that network of activity whereby Israel sold weapons to Iran on behalf of the Americans , to fund the Contras , and then where a large - scale drug - smuggling operation , involving cocaine from Nicaragua , was used to fund the Mujahideen in Afghanistan .
George Fidas worked thirty - one years for the CIA , while Morton Abramowitz was also deeply involved with Afghan Mujahideen and Kosovo rebels .
Abramowitz was succeeded by Marc Grossman as ambassador in Turkey , after working under him in Ankara for a number of years .
During that period , the US opened an espionage investigation into activities at the embassy involving Major Douglas Dickerson , a weapons procurement specialist for Central Asia .
Dickerson and his wife , an FBI translator , later became famous when they tried to recruit Sibel to spy for this criminal network .
Grossman is currently receiving $ 1.2 million per annum from Ihlas Holding , a Gulen - linked Turkish conglomerate .
With regards to the separatist moves over Xinjiang , according to TurkPulse .
" One of the main tools Washington is using in this affair in order to get Turkey involved in the Xinjiang affair is some Turkish Americans , primarily the Fetullah Gulen . "
Another Turk used in this affair is Enver Yusuf Turani , also featured in Sibel˙s Gallery , who is Prime Minister of Xinjiang , with the US being the only country to recognize it as " East Turkistan " .
East Turkistan is the home of the " Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement , " a UN - nominated terrorist organization funded mainly by Osama bin Laden˙s al - Qaeda network and received training , support and personnel from both the al - Qaeda and the Taliban regime of Afghanistan . "
The Uighurs constitute as many as 22 , of the Guantanamo Bay detainees .
Five of those have been set free , and were eventually sent to Albania , amid much controversy .
In fact , Abramowitz and Fuller were key players in the establishment of " East Turkistan " , proclaiming the government in exile within 4 - 5 months , starting in May , 2004 and completing the proclamation in mid-September .
The ceremony was held at Capitol Hill under American flags in Washington .
The FSB , the Russian intelligence organization formerly called the KGB , has repeatedly taken action against the Gulen movement for acting as a front organization for the CIA .
The FSB has claimed that the " Nurcus " religious brotherhood in Turkey has engaged in espionage on behalf of the CIA , through the companies connected with Fethullah Gulen .
Russia has banned all of Gulen˙s madrassas , and in April of this year , banned the Nurcu Movement completely .
The Gulen Movement founded madrassas all over the world in the 1990˙s , most of them in the newly independent Turkic republics of Central Asia , including Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Russia .
The madrassas , says one writer named Lukery , " appear to be used as a front for enabling CIA and State Department officials to operate undercover in the region , with many of the teachers operating under diplomatic passports . "
Lukery called Sibel Edmonds to ask her to comment on the latest revelations .
She said , in full :
You 've got to look at the big picture .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , the super powers began to fight over control of Central Asia , particularly the oil and gas wealth , as well as the strategic value of the region .
Given the history , and the distrust of the West , the US realized that it couldn˙t get direct control , and therefore would need to use a proxy to gain control quickly and effectively .
Turkey was the perfect proxy ; a NATO ally and a puppet regime .
Turkey shares the same heritage / race as the entire population of Central Asia , the same language ( Turkic ) , the same religion ( Sunni Islam ) , and of course , the strategic location and proximity .
This started more than a decade - long illegal , covert operation in Central Asia by a small group in the US intent on furthering the oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex , using Turkish operatives , Saudi partners and Pakistani allies , furthering this objective in the name of Islam .
This is why I have been saying repeatedly that these illegal covert operations by the Turks and certain US persons dates back to 1996 , and involves terrorist activities , narcotics , weapons smuggling and money laundering , converging around the same operations and involving the same actors .
And I want to emphasize that this is " illegal " because most , if not all , of the funding for these operations is not congressionally approved funding , but it comes from illegal activities .
And one last thing , take a look at the people in the State Secrets Privilege Gallery on my website and you will see how these individuals can be traced to the following ;
Turkey , Central Asia , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - and the activities involving these countries .

Moffat says dark matter does not exist
In 1981 the inflationary universe model was proposed to solve some of these problems , in particular to explain the expansion of the universe and the existence of mysterious “ negative - mass ” matter .
It suggested that for a fraction of a second at the beginning of the universe , it expanded at an exponentially fast rate .
But even this theory left some questions unanswered .
Dark matter was invoked to explain how galaxies stick together .
The visible matter alone in galaxies — stars , gas and dust — is nowhere near enough to hold them together , so scientists reasoned there must be something invisible that exerts gravity and is central to all galaxies .
In the early 1990s Moffat proposed a radical alternative theory : that the speed of light was faster closer to the time of the big bang .
His early calculations suggested that light travelled as much as 1,030 times faster than its present value ( 186,000 miles per second ) just following the explosive beginning of the universe .
Last month theoretical astrophysicist Joao Maguelijo of Imperial College London published Faster than the Speed of Light , a new book describing his theories on a variable speed of light and
acknowledging Moffat ’s groundbreaking work .
In August 2002 the journal Nature published a paper by Paul Davies from the Australian Centre for Astrobiology , a followup on other papers based on Moffat ’s theory .
“ Had I not been aware of John ’s work , I would not have myself made a small contribution to this field , ” Davies says .
“ John has shown how it is possible to think outside the square when confronting some of the puzzles of cosmology .
In particular , his cosmological solutions seem to be in good agreement with the remarkable new astronomical results showing that the fine structure constant seems to have varied over cosmological history . ”
This work may herald a major reinterpretation of cosmological data , Davies adds , and require important changes to the conceptual scheme used as a framework for cosmology over the last half century .
But Moffat has his detractors within the physics community .
Now John Moffat and colleagues suggest that there is a good reason dark matter , a mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the universe , has never been directly detected :
It does n't exist .
In August 2007 , the University of Arizona astronomer and his colleagues published a report that a collision between two clusters of galaxies , namely the Bullet Cluster , had caused huge volumes of dark matter to separate from the ordinary matter composing the galaxies .
Many thought this was a proof to the existence of of dark matter .
But , John Moffat suggests now that his Modified Gravity ( MOG ) theory can explain the Bullet Cluster observation .
MOG predicts that the force of gravity changes with distance .
The study is published in the Nov. 21 issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ( 2007 ) .
" MOG gravity is stronger if you go out from the center of the galaxy than it is in Newtonian gravity , " Moffat explained .
" I say dark matter does n't exist .
It 's the gravity that 's changed . "
The MOG theory can explain the results of the detailed observations of the collision of galaxies and the dark matter was not necessary to explain the observations of the light bending .
Moffat thinks that the present day expectation by many that dark matter must exist is similar to the expectation by many leading scientists in the beginning of the 20th century that a " luminiferous ether " should exist .
This was a hypothetical substance , in which the waves of light were supposed to propagate .
Now it is commonly accepted that ether is not needed to explain know observations .

In 1981 the inflationary universe model was proposed to solve some of these problems , in particular to explain the expansion of the universe and the existence of mysterious “ negative - mass ” matter .
It suggested that for a fraction of a second at the beginning of the universe , it expanded at an exponentially fast rate .
But even this theory left some questions unanswered .

There ’s often a lot of talk and speculation about World Population growth .
Just like trying to figure out how much oil there is in the world , the whole exercise is very confusing and difficult .
Here ’s what I got from the latest book I am reading … it ’s very good and I recommend it to anybody .
Consilience by Edward 0 .
Wilson pg 306 onwards ( forgive my typo ’s )
The global population is precariously large , and will become much
more so before peaking some time after 2050 .
Humanity overall is im -
proving per capita production , health , and longevity .
But it is doing so
by eating up the planet ’s capital , including natural resources and bio -
logical diversity millions of years old .
Homo sapiens is approaching the
limit of its food and water supply .
Unlike any species that lived before , it
is also changing the world ’s atmosphere and climate , lowering and pol -
luting water tables , shrinking forests , and spreading deserts .
Most of the
stress originates directly or indirectly from a handful of industrialized
countries .
Their proven fórmulas for prosperity are being eagerly adopted
by the rest of the world .
The emulation cannot be sustained , not with the
same levels of consumption and waste .
Even if the industrialization of
developing countries is only partly successful , the environmental after -
shock will dwarf the population explosion that preceded
Some will , of course , call this synopsis environmental alarmism .
I earnestly wish that accusation were true .
Unfortunately , it is the
reality - grounded opinion of the overwhelming majority of statured
scientists who study the environment .
By statured scientists I mean
those who collect and analyze the data , build the theoretical models ,
interpret the results , and publish articles vetted for professional jour -
nals by other experts , often including their rivals .
I do not mean by
statured scientists the many journalists , talk - show hosts , and think - tank
polemicists who also address the environment , even though their opi -
nions reach a vastly larger audience .
This is not to devalue their profes -
sions , which have separate high standards , only to suggest that there
are better - qualified sources to consult for factual information about
the environment .
Seen in this light , the environment is much less a
controversial subject than suggested by routine coverage in the media .
Consider , then , the assessment made through the mid-1990s by
the statured scientists .
Their quantitative estimates differ according to
the mathematical assumptions and procedures variously used , but
most still fell within limits from which trends can be projected with
confidence .
By 1997 the global population had reached 5.8 billion , growing at
the rate of 90 million per year .
In 1600 there were only about half a billion people on Earth ,
and in 1940 , 2 billion .
The amount of increase
during the 1990s alone is expected to exceed the entire population
alive in 1600 .
The global growth rate , after reaching a peak during the
1960s , has been dropping ever since .
In 1963 , for example , each
woman bore an average of 4.1 children .
In 1996 the number had declined to 2.6 .
In order to stabilize the world population , the number
must be 2.1 children per woman ( the extra 0.1 allowing for child mor -
tality ) .
Long - term population size is extremely sensitive to this replace -
ment number , as shown by the following projections .
If the number were 2.1 , there would be 7.7 billion people on Earth in 2050 , leveling
off at 8.5 billion in 2150 .
If 2.0 , the population would peak at 7.8 billion ,
then drop by 2150 to 5.6 billion , the total in the mid-1990s .
If 2.2 , it would reach 12.5 billion in 2050 , 20.8 billion in 2150 ;
and if 2.2 could miraculously be maintained thereafter ,
the human biomass would eventually equal the weight of the world and then ,
after a few millennia , expanding outward at the speed of light , it would exceed the mass
of the visible universe .
Even if the global birth rate were reduced dras -
tically and immediately , say to the Chinese goal of one child per
woman , the population would not peak for one or two generations .
The overshoot is ensured by the disproportionate number of young
people already in existence , who look to long lives ahead .
How many people can the world support for an indefinite period ?
Experts do not agree , but a majority put the number variously between
4 and 16 billion .
The true number will depend on the quality of life
that future generations are willing to accept .
If everyone agreed to be -
come vegetarian , leaving nothing for livestock , the present 14 billion
hectares of arable land ( 3.5 billion acres ) would supply about 10 billion
people .
If humans utilized as food all the energy captured by plant
photosynthesis , some 40 trillion watts .
Earth could support about
16 billion people .
From such a frag would have to be excluded .
Even if , by force majeure , the population levels off at well under
10 billion by mid-century , the relatively extravagant lifestyle now en -
joyed by the middle classes of North America , Westem Europe , and
Japan cannot be attained by most of the rest of the world .
The reason is that the impact of each country on the environment is multiplicative .
It is dependent , in a complex manner , on the formula called PAT : pop -
ulation size times per capita affluence ( hence consumption ) times a
measure of the voracity of the technology used in sustaining consump -
tion .
The magnitude of PAT can be usefully visualized by the “ ecolog -
ical footprint ” of productive land needed to support each member of
the society with existing technology .
In Europe the footprint is 3.5
hectares ( a hectare is 2.5 acres ) , in Canada 4.3 hectares , and in the
United States 5 hectares .
In most developing countries it is less than
half a hectare .
To raise the whole world to the U.S. level with existing
technology would require two more planet Earths .
It matters little that North Dakota and Mongolia are mostly empty .
It makes no difference that the 5.8 billion people in the world today
Notes :
The PAT formula for estimating impact of population on the environ -
ment was developed originally by Paul R. Ehrlich and John P. Holdren
in “ Impact of population growth , ” Science , 171 ; 1212 -17 ( 1997 ) and has
been discussed in many aspects since .
“ It is a rough approximation , since
the three multiplicative factors are not independent …
It is especially
useful in assessing global impacts , where we normally must fall back on
using per-capita energy use in place of AT ’ : Paid Ehrlich , “ The scale of

People with psoriasis — an often distressing dermatological condition that causes lesions and red scaly patches on the skin — are less likely to react to looks of disgust by others than people without the condition , new research has found .
University of Manchester scientists used magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans to compare the brains of 26 men , half of whom had chronic psoriasis .
The researchers looked at the insular cortex — a part of the brain triggered by both feelings and observations of disgust ?
to see how participants responded to images of disgusted faces .
The study , published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , found that the volunteers with psoriasis had a much weaker response in their insular cortex than the healthy volunteers , suggesting they have developed a coping mechanism to protect themselves from adverse emotional responses to their condition by others .
“ Psoriasis has a significant negative impact on the physical and psychological well - being of those affected but little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms of how patients cope with the adverse social stigma associated with visible skin lesions , ” said Dr Elise Kleyn , the dermatologist who carried out the research .
“ We had previously shown that psoriasis patients commonly believe that they will be evaluated solely on the basis of their skin and so often avoid social situations they think will be stressful or humiliating as a coping mechanism .
“ For this study we wanted to investigate whether the social impact of psoriasis is associated with altered cognitive processing in response to facial expressions of disgust by measuring brain activity in the insular cortex .
“ We found a significantly reduced response in the insular cortex in the patients compared with the control volunteers when observing disgusted faces , but also that patients were half as likely to recognise that a face was expressing disgust .
This was not the case for other facial expressions , such as fear . ”
The research team , which was headed by world - renowned dermatologist Professor Chris Griffiths , believe that one explanation for their findings is that psoriasis patients develop a coping mechanism to protect them from stressful emotional responses by blocking the processing of disgusted facial expressions encountered in others .
Dr Kleyn added : “ We believe that other stigmatising conditions , such as severe acne or scarring , may elicit similar findings , although further research is clearly needed .
We think the insights provided by this study , however , could generate new strategies for managing stigmatising skin diseases . ”

Energizer " D " Battery Exposed A NaturalNews PhotoTour by Mike Adams
Rechargeable batteries are great for the environment .
Using them to power your electronics helps conserve valuable metals used in making batteries while preventing the throwing away of alkaline batteries after a single use .
Rechargeable NiMH batteries can be reused 1,000 times , effectively replacing 1,000 alkaline batteries and providing portable power at a fraction of the cost of buying 1,000 new batteries .
But most consumers are under the impression that rechargeable batteries do n't last very long .
After asking several people this question , I decided to look more closely at common rechargeable batteries with a question in mind :
Are battery companies intentionally making rechargeable batteries with lower capacities in order to encourage the sale of more profitable throwaway alkaline batteries ?
The search for the answer to this question took me right to the rechargeable Energizer " D " battery purchased off the shelf at Best Buy ( a big name electronics retailer in the U.S. ) .
This particular battery immediately caught my attention because the stated capacity of the battery is just 2500 mAh -- the same capacity as typical AA batteries which are physically far smaller than a " D " battery .
I wondered :
Why are rechargeable Energizer " D " batteries made with such low capacity ?

Sound familiar ?
The president was accused of being " a socialist , not a Democrat . "
His plan was described as " undisguised state socialism . "
One critic , who controlled some powerful media outlets , suggested that communists had infiltrated the president 's administration .
Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he 's not unique .
Obama has mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently , including during an interview on Late Night with David Letterman on Sept. 21 , 2009 :
" What 's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes , particularly during times of economic unease , then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up , " Obama said .
" FDR was called a socialist and a communist . "
Indeed , Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times .
Most of that criticism came in the 1930s , when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression .
• " Roosevelt is a socialist , not a Democrat , " declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23 , 1935 .
That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt , according to the New York Times .
• " The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism , declared Senator Simeon D. Fess ( R - Ohio ) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal 's leading socialist , " reported the Chicago Daily Tribune on Aug. 7 , 1934 .
" The president 's recent statements , " Fess said , " remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism , which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry , or both . "
• " The Russian newspapers during the last election [ 1932 ] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption , ' The first communistic President of the United States , ' " said Sen .
Thomas Schall , a Republican from Minnesota .
" Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President , which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country .
In fact , the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions . "
We found Schall 's comments in the book , All But the People : Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics , 1933 - 1939 .
And then there 's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst .
Hearst , a newspaper mogul , initially supported Roosevelt .
But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president 's policies .
He especially hated Roosevelt 's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy , and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal .
By 1936 , when Roosevelt was running for re-election , Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster .
Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his book William Randolph Hearst : The Later Years , 1911 - 1951 :
" On September 6 , Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration .
The New York American published a front - page editorial titled , ' The Radical Brand on the New Deal . '
It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon .
During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes : that communists had infiltrated the New Deal ; that communism was un-American and undemocratic ; that ' America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters . ' "
That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take .
The White House issued a statement that mentioned " a certain notorious newspaper owner , " and rebutted the accusations .
The statement concluded , " The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic , honorable , decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs . "
Hearst shot back in a front - page editorial , which he signed personally .
" Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists , the Frankfurter radicals , communists and anarchists , the Tugwell bolsheviks , and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following , " Hearst wrote .
" I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government , and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements . "
Hearst 's efforts were for naught .
Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide , while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy .
There 's not much controversy on this one , but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history .
We rate Obama 's statement True .
Die gute Nachricht vorweg :
Wie wir mittlerweile seit drei Jahren wissen , ist Petrus Datenschützer .
Oder wie Markus auch immer sagt : Irgendein Hacker hat da ein Script gebaut , das bei unseren Demos die Regenwolken vertreibt .
Jedenfalls meldet der Deutsche Wetterdienst für die Großdemo „ Freiheit statt Angst “ am Samstag in Berlin :
Mecklenburg - Vorpommern , Berlin und Brandenburg
Vorhersage für Region Nordost für Samstag , 12.09.2009
Am Sonnabend wird es noch einmal heiter bis wolkig und trocken sein .
Die Temperatur steigt auf 17 bis 21 Grad .
Der Wind weht schwach bis mäßig um Nord .
Auch ansonsten sieht alles danach aus , dass es wieder mal eine richtig fette Sache wird , wenn wir uns alle um 15:00 am Potsdamer Platz treffen .
Unterstützer :
Es haben mittlerweile 163 Unterstützerorganisationen , - verbände , - bands , Firmen und Initiativen den Demo - Aufruf unterzeichnet .
Das ist das breiteste Bündnis für Bürgerrechte und ein freies Internet und gegen Überwachung , das Deutschland je gesehen hat .
Nach vorsichtigen Schätzungen repräsentieren diese Unterstützer mehr als drei Millionen Mitglieder ( Doppelmitgliedschaften schon statistisch rausgerechnet ) , das ist mehr als die Summe aller Parteimitglieder der Großen Koalition und aller Mittel - und Kleinparteien zusammen .
Bühnenprogramm :
Es gibt mal wieder eine Reihe hochkarätiger Redner und Rednerinnen , darunter
Frank Bsirske ( Vorsitzender der Gewerkschaft ver.di )
( Vorsitzender der Gewerkschaft ) Franziska Heine ( Arbeitskreis gegen Internetsperren und Zensur )
( ) Thilo Weichert ( Datenschutzbeauftragter Schleswig- Holstein )
( Datenschutzbeauftragter Schleswig - Holstein ) Patrick Breyer ( AK Vorratsdatenspeicherung )
Rolf Gössner ( Internationale Liga für Menschenrechte ) .
Musikalisches Rahmenprogramm bieten die Bands „ Die Schwesta “ sowie „ mono & nikitaman “ .
Da die Demo diesmal bis 22:00
Uhr angemeldet ist , gibt es noch ein paar DJs zum Abschluss , darunter gerüchteweise auch ein sehr bekanntes Urgestein der Techno - Szene .
Demozug : Die Demo wird natürlich wieder sehr bunt werden .
Neben den mehr als 12 Wagen von Initiativen wie den Hedonisten , diversen Bürgerrechts - und Datenschutzgruppen und natürlich wieder der großen Datenkraken vom FoeBuD werden auch die mit aufrufenden Parteien vertreten sein .
Die Piraten bringen sogar ihren fetten 40 - Tonner mit .
Aber wer auf den letzten „ Freiheit statt Angst “ - Demos war , der wird sich erinnern , dass das Beeindruckendste die ganzen Transparente und Schilder waren , die die TeilnehmerInnen ( also Ihr ! ) selber gemalt und mitgebracht hatten .
Seit heute Mittag steht in Berlin auch bis Samstag ganztägig und - nächtlich ein eigener Raum zum Transparente - Malen zur Verfügung ( offene uni berlin ) .
Helfer und Material ( Bettlaken oder große Stoffreste , Latten z.B. auch aus losen Lattenrosten , Sperrholz , große stabile Pappen oder Pressholz wie z.B. alte Schrankrückwände , Farben wie z.b. weiße Wandfarbe als Hintergrund ) werden jederzeit gebraucht und sind willkommen .
Mithelfen : Auch für viele andere Sachen sind wird noch Hilfe benötigt .
Ihr könnt euch für den Fahrdienst melden , der das ganze Material wie Generatoren , Zelte und Laptops zum Potsdamer Platz und wieder zurück fährt .
Ihr könnt Demo - Ordner oder - Beobachter werden .
Ihr könnt beim Presseteam mithelfen .
Ihr könnt bei der Verpflegung für die Helferinnen und Helfer mithelfen .
Und und und .
Die FDP hat übrigens netterweise für Sonntag alle HelferInnen zum Dankeschön - Brunch eingeladen .
Das Aktionsbüro ( das wieder von den Grünen zur Verfügung gestellt wurde , auch dafür danke ) mit Ober - Koordinatorin Nina von der Humanistischen Union und den vielen Freiwilligen vom AK Vorrat und anderswo her nimmt auch sonst alle Hilfsangebote gerne entgegen .
Wer sich direkt im Wiki in die Helferlisten einträgt , erspart denen allerdings Arbeit und trägt zum kollaborativen und verteilten Gelingen der ganzen Sache bei .
Werbung : Der FoeBuD -Shop ist „ ausverkauft “ .
Alle Flyer und Plakate , die noch übrig waren , sind jetzt in Berlin und können im Aktionsbüro abgeholt werden .
In Berlin läuft bereits auch wieder ein kleiner Werbefilm in der U - Bahn , der durch zusätzliche Spendengelder finanziert wurde .
Presse : Morgen um 11:00 findet eine Pressekonferenz des Demo- Bündnisses im Haus der Demokratie und Menschenrechte statt .
Die Pressemappe gibt es hier .
Auf der Kundgebung selber wird es diesmal eine eigene Aussichts - Plattform für Pressefotografen geben , damit die etwas bessere Fotos machen können .
Anreise :
Wer noch nicht weiß , wie er nach Berlin kommt , kann sich bei den Mitfahrgemeinschaften ( für Autos und Bahn ) eintragen oder sich einem der Sonderbusse des FoeBuD oder der Piraten anschließen .
In dem ermäßigten Bus der Grünen aus Hamburg sind offenbar noch viele Plätze auch für Nichtmitglieder frei .
Auch Piraten sind willkommen zum entern , höre ich gerade ( full disclosure : Mein neuer Chef Jan Philipp Albrecht ist einer der Sponsoren des Busses ) .
Spenden : Die ganze Demo ist über Spendengelder finanziert .
Bisher fehlen noch grob 10.000 Euro , die durch eine Ausfallbürgschaft des AK Vorrat gedeckt sind .
Der muss aber auch nicht jedes Jahr nach der Demo wieder komplett pleite sein , daher sind Spenden weiterhin gern gesehen .
Auch kleine Beträge helfen .
Spendenkonto : Humanistische Union , Kontonummer 30 74 250 , Bankleitzahl : 100 205 00 , Bank für Sozialwirtschaft , Verwendungszweck : „ Demo Freiheit statt Angst “ .
Soviel erstmal als kleiner Überblick .
Mal sehen , was noch so an Updates in den nächsten zwei Tagen reinkommt .
Wir versuchen , hier den Überblick zu behalten , aber das ist bei der Breite an Aktivitäten schon kaum noch zu schaffen .
Jamie Kripke
The young couple flew into Wichita bearing , in the lovely swell of the wife 's belly , a burden of grief .
They came from a religious tradition where large families are celebrated , and they wanted this baby , and it was very late in her pregnancy .
But the doctors recommended abortion .
They said that with her complications , there were only two men skilled enough to pull it off .
One was George Tiller , a Wichita doctor who specialized in late abortions .
They arrived in Wichita on Sunday , May 31 .
As they drove to their hotel , a Holiday Inn just two blocks from the Reformation Lutheran Church , they saw television cameras .
They wondered what was going on , a passing curiosity quickly forgotten .
But when they got to their room , the phone was ringing .
Her father was on the line .
" There was some doctor who was shot who does abortions , " he said .
They turned on CNN .
Dr. Tiller had just been killed , shot in the head as he passed out church leaflets .
In their shock , they mixed up the clinic and the church :
We were supposed to be there .
What if it had happened while we were there ?
What if he could n't complete the procedure ?
Now there is only one doctor left .
After the first two doors of bulletproof glass , a sign warns that cell phones , cameras , and PDAs will be confiscated .
You put your ID into a turning wheel that spins it to the receptionist .
She studies it and hits the buzzer that opens the third bulletproof door .
In the waiting room , a sad woman with a tight perm waits for her daughter .
The receptionist lets you through a fourth bulletproof door and leads you down a green hall decorated with lovely pictures of nature , leaving you in a small room stocked with tissues and free condoms .
Twenty minutes later , the abortionist enters .
He 's a tall man in green surgical scrubs , remarkably vigorous at seventy , emphatic in speech and impatient in manner .
He has a long face and no lips , which gives him a severe look .
He apologizes for having very little time .
This is the day he sees patients for the first of three visits , giving them the seaweed laminaria , which slowly dilates the cervix , and his normal caseload has been doubled by Dr. Tiller 's patients — including two with catastrophic fetal abnormalities and a fifteen - year - old who was raped , all in the second trimester , all traumatized by the assassin who calls himself pro-life , a phrase he cannot utter without air quotes and contempt .
They hate freedom , he says .
He says it again .
He warns you not to use anyone 's name or you will put them at risk .
Walking out , he leaves the door open .
You hear voices drifting down the hall :
The worst picture of an abortion doctor ever .
Is that Fox ?
Yes , Bill O'Reilly .
Supposedly they were there to protect us .
You see a nurse you cannot name leading a middle - aged Indian woman to an examining room .
You 'll need to undress completely from the waist down .
You hear one of the receptionists you cannot name speaking in the carefully modulated voice the abortionist prescribed in his first book , Abortion Practice , a classic in the field : " Truax and Carkhuff have described empathy as the counselor 's ability to be sufficiently involved to make full use of his / her own emotional experience and sufficiently detached to differentiate his / her own emotional experience from those of the other . "
Steps come down the hall .
I'm Dr. Hern .
Where are you from ?
Lie down now .
Put your hand on your chest .
The phone rings .
Did you have an ultrasound ?
And they referred you here ?
Yesterday , the man arrested for Tiller 's murder warned that more killings were on the way .
All last week , the antiabortion groups put out statements denouncing the murder and praising the result .
One called the killer a hero .
As a result , a squad of U. S. marshals rushed out here last week on orders from the attorney general .
One of them paces the hall .
The second receptionist you cannot name asks him , Did you see that guy out there smoking a cigarette ?
Yeah , I saw him .
The first receptionist keeps talking .
If you can fax us the amnio .
We do n't know , we 'll have to wait to see what your body tells us .
Do you want us to run your Amex now ?
Another phone rings and the second receptionist answers .
It 's basically a three - day process .
We require that you stay here in Colorado .
The voices begin to overlap .
Are you on any medication ?
Have you had surgery in the last year ?
No , we do n't have any genetics counselors to interpret that for you .
We do n't get a lot of protestors .
It 's a liberal and tolerant community .
If that changes , we will contact you .
No , you 'll get up and get in your car and drive home .
And Lisa , if you have a change of heart , please call us — our schedule is completely full and you 'll be taking someone else 's place .
After another silence , a soft voice gets softer : I also want you to know , we do n't care what your reasons are .
We 're not going to judge you .
In the kitchen of the Boulder Abortion Clinic , the abortionist bolts down two microwave tamales .
He talks fast and does n't smile .
It is my view that we are dealing with a fascist movement .
It 's a terrorist , violent terrorist movement , and they have a fascist ideology ...
He goes on like that for some time .
Long before the first doctor got shot back in 1993 , he was warning that it would happen .
He was getting hate mail and death threats way back in 1970 , just for working in family planning .
They started up again in 1973 , two weeks after he helped start the first nonprofit abortion clinic in Boulder .
I started sleeping with a rifle by my bed .
I expected to get shot .
In 1985 , someone threw a brick through his window during a protest by the quote unquote Pro-Life Action League .
He put up a sign that said THIS WINDOW WAS BROKEN BY THOSE WHO HATE FREEDOM .
In 1988 , somebody fired five bullets through his window .
In 1995 , the American Coalition of quote unquote Life Activists put out a hit list with his name ( and Tiller 's name ) on it .
The feds gave them protection for about six months , then left them on their own .
People do n't get it , he says .
After eight murders , seventeen attempted murders , 406 death threats , 179 assaults , and four kidnappings , people are still in denial .
They say , Well , this was just some wingnut guy who just decided to go blow up somebody .
Wrong .
This was a cold - blooded , brutal , political assassination that is the logical consequence of thirty - five years of hate speech and incitement to violence by people from the highest levels of American society , including but in no way limited to George W. Bush , Ronald Reagan , Jesse Helms , Bill O'Reilly , Jerry Falwell , and Pat Robertson .
Reagan may not have been a fascist , but he was a tool of the fascists .
George W. Bush was most certainly a tool of the fascists .
They use this issue to get power .
They seem civilized but underneath you have this seething mass of angry , rabid anger and hatred of freedom that is really frightening , and they support people like the guy who shot George — they 're all pretending to be upset , issuing statements about how much they deplore violence , but it 's just bullshit .
This is exactly what they wanted to happen .
He goes on about Bill O'Reilly for a while .
Over the course of twenty - nine separate shows , O'Reilly accused " Tiller the Baby Killer " of performing a late abortion for any reason at all , even so a girl could attend a rock concert — a charge that is blatantly untrue .
O'Reilly is a disgrace to American society , he says .
But O'Reilly says he 's just exercising his right to engage in vigorous debate , you point out .
He 's full of shit .
This is not a debate , it 's a civil war .
And the other people are using bullets and bombs .
I think O'Reilly is a fascist , and he would fit right in in Nazi Germany as far as I 'm concerned .
It 's odd , you say , trying to be agreeable .
They always go after the doctors .
They never go after the moms .
His eyes snap up .
What moms ?
The patients ?
Yeah , the patients .
They 're not moms until they have a baby .
By the way , he hates the word abortionist .
Though it is a simple descriptive term like " podiatrist , " the opponents of abortion have turned it into a degrading and demeaning word that has the same negative connotations as the most despicable racial epithet .
All the same , it is the right word , an accurate word , and our discomfort with it is but a measure of how poisoned the language of abortion has become .
Late that night , he calls you at your hotel .
You 're reading one of his many scientific publications , which have titles like Shipibo Polygyny and Patrilocality or Urban Malignancy : Similarity in the Fractal Dimensions of Urban Morphology and Malignant Neoplasms .
This one argues that man is a " malignant ecotumor " laying waste the planet .
One of the main characteristics of a cancerous growth is that it resists regulation .
A cancer cell is a cell that reproduces without limits .
He 's sorry , he says , but he must turn down your request to ride in his car to the Tiller memorial in Denver .
He has to go with four U. S. marshals in an armored car .
Even his wife can't ride with him .
Same with dinner in a restaurant .
I will never be safe , he says .
I 'm always looking over my shoulder .
You use the term " partial - birth abortion " and he bristles .
It 's a barbaric and grotesque term for a procedure that was described at National Abortion Federation meetings in the early nineties by two doctors who did n't take the deadliness of the psychological warfare seriously , and then the Republicans took it up and it became this obscene and basically pornographic antiabortion pornography with pictures that made it look like you were killing this beautiful Gerber baby — and when he tried to tell his colleagues , No , this is not the safest way to perform a delayed abortion , they accused him of working with the antiabortion people and basically rode him out on a rail .
The whole thing turned into a tumultuous , writhing , tortured witch hunt — an incredibly painful experience .
Nothing pains him more than the disdain of other doctors .
Sometimes the young ones ask to come in for an afternoon so they can learn to make a little money while their careers get started — they think it 's as simple as changing a tire .
There 's no sense that this is an important operation that has to be done well , that a person 's life depends on it .
But let 's face it , abortion is the lowest - status activity in medicine .
That 's why they always call their clinics Family Planning Centers or Women 's Wellness Facilities or some crap like that .
Not his place .
It 's had the same name since 1975 .
Because I felt that performing abortions was the most important thing I could do in medicine .
The patients can be upsetting too .
They 're under terrible stress , of course , but sometimes they come in very angry .
One had conjoined twins and would have died giving birth , but she exploded when he told her she could n't smoke in the office .
And some treat him with contempt and disgust , usually the ones who have been directly involved in antiabortion activities .
They hate all abortion except for their special case .
One even said they should all be killed .
Only fourteen , she came with her mother .
What brings you here ?
he asked .
I have to have an abortion .
Why ?
I 'm not old enough to have a baby .
But you told the counselor we should all be killed ?
Yes , you should all be killed .
Why ?
Because you do abortions .
Me too ?
Yes , you should be killed too .
Do you want me killed before or after I do your abortion ?
Before .
He told her to leave .
Her mother was very upset .
But he is n't an abortion - dispensing machine .
He 's a physician .
He 's a person .
The abortionist 's mother is ninety - two , but she still has a girlish smile and twinkling eyes that summon gingham skirts and radio serials .
When you come in , she 's sitting in an easy chair surrounded by her family .
You bend down to shake her grandson 's hand .
So you 're the one who wants to be a pirate .
He nods and adds in a shy voice :
Or now maybe a doctor .
The phone rings and the abortionist goes to answer .
He speaks in a heated voice .
Hanging up , he 's visibly agitated .
That guy got your number off the Internet .
He 's a reporter .
You have to change your number .
Oh well , his mother says .
You have to change it .
We 'll talk about it later .
When he takes his family home , escorted by the U. S. marshals , she explains , almost apologetically , that her number has n't been listed for almost forty years because the antiabortion people used to make nasty calls at two o'clock in the morning .
Then there was a mix - up and it appeared in the phone book .
Warren kept saying ,
You have to change your number , and I said , I do n't want to change my number .
I 've had it all these years .
Now she does n't tell him about most of the calls .
He 's got enough to worry about .
As a boy ?
Always helpful .
When he was just three , she 'd give him a dust rag and let him dust .
She 'd set him on the counter and let him stir the cake .
When he was ten , she and her husband , they went out one night and left the girls with a babysitter who spanked the oldest girl for refusing to go to sleep .
When they got home , Warren said , Mother , I do n't want you to hire anybody else to take care of Cindy .
I can take care of her .
So they never hired a babysitter again .
Warren sang in the choir .
She felt it was important for the kids to go to church and Sunday school , and they did n't send them , they took them .
They got involved in church activities .
But politically , they were always on the liberal side .
Warren likes to tell the story of how they cried when Roosevelt died .
He was six , but he still remembers it .
He loved to go camping and fishing .
He played clarinet in the Highlander Boys Band .
He liked pranks — once he put an ad in the paper saying everybody could put their dead Christmas trees in a neighbor 's yard .
His father was a carpenter , so they did n't have much money and could n't afford to travel .
But they always had exchange students from all over the world — Germany , Brazil , Italy , France , Pakistan , Japan , thirteen countries in all .
That was a way the kids could learn how other people lived .
In fifth grade , Warren got interested in photography .
Soon he was selling sports pictures to The Denver Post , staying up till midnight to develop the film , make prints , and rush them down to the paper .
I probably saved every one of those pictures .
He won second prize in Kodak 's national contest for high school photography .
One thing that 's probably important , she says :
She had terrible migraines from as far back as she could remember .
She 'd get up in the morning and feel like her head was gonna roll down the hall .
And one day she asked Warren what he wanted to be and he said , I really want to be a doctor , Mother .
He thought he'd be a neuro brain surgeon and maybe he could figure out what to do about my headaches .
That same year , he read a book about Albert Schweitzer healing the sick in Africa and announced , Mother , I 'm going to go to Africa before I go to medical school .
And he did .
He raised money from the Lions Club and the Rotary Club so he could be a community ambassador with the Experiment in International Living .
She was n't surprised .
Usually when he says he 's going to do it , he 's going to find a way to do it .
At college , she says , he was the only white student in the African Club .
He worked three jobs to pay his tuition .
He began reading books like The Golden Bough , Man and His Gods , A Man Against Fate .
He learned ancient Greek and studied the Bible in the original .
Then he sat her down and said , Mom , I do n't believe in this stuff anymore .
She said , Well , you do n't have to believe in it .
Maybe I do n't believe in all of it either .
But she was n't worried .
She knew his heart .
In his last year of college , he went to a fundamentalist church to see an anticommunist movie called Operation Abolition .
He came home and told his parents quite a story .
You want to hear the Word of the Lord , you 've got to pay !
And I do n't mean that jigglin ' money , I mean that foldin ' money !
In an article he wrote for the school paper , he compared it to the " Two - Minute Hate " in George Orwell 's 1984 .
In medical school , he saw his first botched abortions .
Then he spent two years as a doctor for the Peace Corps in a Brazilian town so desperately poor , it was n't unusual to see a dead baby on a trash heap .
After that , he worked as a family - planning chief for the Nixon administration and spent some time in Appalachia , where he saw unintended pregnancies dragging families deeper and deeper into poverty .
In an article for The New Republic , he quoted one exhausted mother : Each one makes it harder on the ones we already got .
But even after all that , there are still some family members who can't accept what he does .
And other doctors too .
It really hurts him terribly , she says .
In his mind , he 's trying to help women who desperately need help .
And why can't these doctors , of all people —
In her opinion , he needs to retire .
He has a dozen books he wants to write .
And this just takes his life .
The shooting ?
He called her as soon as it happened .
He said , Jeanne just told me that George was shot in church .
He said MSNBC wanted to interview him , told her what time to watch , trying to stay calm , but she could tell how upset he really was .
It was all he could do to keep from losing it .
I could hear the terror in his voice .
But when he was on TV that night , all you saw was his anger .
Well , you know , the people that really know Warren could see it , I 'm sure .
But not that many people probably .
You 're a parent yourself , so you have to ask if she ever tried to get him to stop .
Especially now that he 's kind of making himself a target .
I know that , she answers .
I understand that .
But that would n't do any good .
He 's got a mind of his own .
The rims of her eyes are getting red .
She moves her glasses and dabs at them with a balled - up tissue .
You apologize for making her cry .
It 's okay .
It 's all right .
Then she tries to be cheerful again , for the sake of her guest .
The next morning , you 're just sitting down to breakfast when the phone rings .
It 's the abortionist 's mother .
She 's been calling hotels looking for you .
Please do n't mention that thing I told you , she says .
You know exactly what she means , a story so personal and revealing that she preceded it with the words
Do n't use this in your story .
You try to convince her that it would be the perfect humanizing detail .
I was up all night worrying about it , she says .
I would never forgive myself if anything happened .
You promise .
Jamie Kripke
The abortionist 's wife likes good coffee .
So you meet at an espresso bar where the menu is in Italian .
She has a strong Roman nose and black hair that breaks against her cheeks in an ebony wave .
Her earrings are shaped like dolphin tails .
In a charming mixture of English and Spanish , she tells you about growing up in Cuba , happy sun-filled days and good medical training until she started ducking the weekly " discussion " meetings and they told her she was n't a good communist .
But when she finally managed to leave , she saw the other side .
For example , when I going to Argentina , I have intrauterine device for anti-conception .
When the ginecólogo attend to me , " You need take off this !
This makes an abortion ! "
Later , working in a hospital , she saw women who tried to induce their own miscarriages bleed to death .
Then she got pregnant .
At eighteen weeks , she went to her gynecologist for the blood test .
They say ,
The baby 's no good .
Have really problem .
She went to a geneticist and a specialist in prenatal diagnosis .
The geneticist suggested an abortion , butthe prenatal diagnoser , for one hour he was making the sonogram high - resolution .
When he finish , he say , What do you think about the baby ?
And I say , I think he is good .
I feel it in my soul , and I want to take him .
He say , Go and take your baby .
Labor lasted thirty - six hours , intensive care a month .
The specialists told her the baby might have lifelong seizures or learning disabilities .
To lighten her workload , she moved to Barcelona and took a job in an abortion clinic .
She sees no contradiction in this .
Because I am happy in my pregnancy and I have a beautiful relationship with my belly .
For many reasons , I believe in God and my fate .
It 's true in myself .
But I know that many women do n't feel nothing when they 're pregnant and many women feel sad , feel angry .
In this situation , you never can judge who 's God .
You need to respect women .
All that led to the man who would become her husband .
She was at a medical conference in 2003 when he came up to her and said , You are so beautiful .
He was sixty - four , she was thirty - seven .
She was struck by his confidence .
I say , This man is really seguro de sí mismo — sure of himself .
I say , I like this man .
On the last night , he went to his knees and begged her to dance .
Stand up , she said .
Stand up !
But she felt good dancing with him .
They began to send letters across the ocean and talk for hours on the phone .
He was not one of these men who was just para enamorarla .
He tried to know her , the woman and the professional and the mother .
And he always showed to her his miedos , his fears and loneliness , especially the long grim years when he thought no woman could tolerate a life under siege by fanatics .
She could relate .
When I was aborting in Spain , I finished the abortion to a young woman , first trimester .
When I finish this procedure , she sit on the table , see me to my face , say , Oh , doctor , you are really nice , you are such angel , how do you kill babies ?
I say , I 'm sorry , I do n't kill any baby .
I aspirate gestational sac .
You kill your baby .
But most important , he always asked about her son .
Other men did not do that .
In March , he flew to Palma de Mallorca and they spent three beautiful days together .
In May , she noticed that her son had no grip in his left hand .
She took him to the hospital and they discovered a brain tumor — a big one , nearly four centimeters .
Warren started calling her every day , sometimes twice a day .
The hospital suggested high doses of chemotherapy , her doctor disagreed , Warren said to send him the MRIs .
He does n't rest one second .
He find find find information .
She decided to try surgery .
She told Warren not to come and moved into the hospital to focus on her son .
One by one , her other friends stopped calling .
Warren called three times a day .
At Christmas , she took her son to Boulder and Warren introduced him to Santa Claus .
I think I totally fall in love with him .
Warren said ,
Will you marry me ?
Warren is the most passionate man she has ever known , apasionado about everything he does .
He is the kind of people that he going up to the mountain and he see the beautiful sunset , he sit down , he do n't want to speak , and he cry .
In the summer of 2006 , they were married .
But that was not their happy ending .
At the end of May , when they were just back from a rafting trip in Utah , the wet clothes in a pile on the stairs , the phone rang .
Warren took the call in his office .
I start to take the breakfast in and he do n't have color in his face .
I say what happen ?
He say , A shooter shoot George Tiller .
I think it 's crazy people , and he say , No Amor , these people killed him .
But why ?
You know why .
I go to close the window but he no move , he no speak .
I say , Do you need my help ?
He say , No . I need a little time .
When the shock passed , he called CNN .
All day long the phones kept ringing .
I kept say , He 's on the other line .
He can not speak with you now .
Since that day , he has n't relaxed one second .
Jamie Kripke
The abortionist barely has time to eat .
Reporters come and go , the phone rings constantly , he disappears to the hidden rooms where no outsider is allowed to go .
Every so often he snatches a minute or two to drop into the counseling room .
I want to talk to you about this dustup with National Abortion Federation , he says .
They 're not going to like to see this dirty laundry , but you know , this was a witch hunt .
Just hideous attacks on my character .
And I think that it 's frankly far more painful to me than the fucking antiabortion people .
He suggests you read a paper he wrote , " Administrative Incongruence and Authority Conflict in Four Abortion Clinics . "
But he does n't have time to say why .
I have a lot of stuff to do .
You 're welcome to hang out .
You squeeze in another question .
This idea about mankind being a " malignant ecotumor . "
Does n't it just invite the hate ?
I 'm not inviting people to do anything .
I 'd like them to think .
What a concept .
But still .
I do think that helping people control their fertility is highly consistent with helping people be responsible citizens of the planet .
If somebody misunderstands it or tries to distort it , I do n't give a shit .
I 'm sorry , I 'm living in this country because I can say what I think .
But you 're seventy .
You have ideas for a dozen books .
Why not retire ?
I have work to do here .
I have important work to do here .
You wanted to cozy up to the next question but there 's no time , so you just blurt it out :
What are your limits ?
When would you tell a woman no ?
There 's no specific answer to that .
I'm in the process of turning down somebody who 's going to be thirty - four , thirty - five weeks , with an important reason for doing abortion .
I 'm not going to do it .
The phone rings .
Okay .
I 'll be right there , and he 's gone .
Hours pass .
You 've been moved to the nurses ' office , where a soft felt sunflower weaves through the metal in - box .
On the wall , a poster of female reproductive organs looks vaguely like the mother alien from Aliens .
You are staring at a flyer advertising the clinic 's services : " Specializing in late abortion for fetal disorders .
Outpatient abortion over twenty - six menstrual weeks for selected patients with documented fetal anomaly , fetal demise , or medical indications . "
The opponents of legal abortion often use the phrase " abortion on demand , " implying there are no restrictions at all .
This characterization is untrue .
It has always been illegal , even under Roe v. Wade , to perform abortions after viability without a compelling medical reason .
In Kansas , for example , where Dr. Tiller practiced medicine , the law for any abortion after twenty - two weeks requires two doctors to agree that failure to abort would put the mother at risk of " substantial and irreversible harm . "
But the abortionist 's long list of fetal abnormalities that have led women to his clinic ranges from anencephaly to dwarfism , and you know a few dwarfs .
You like to think you'd be happy with a dwarf child .
The abortionist comes in , remembers that the U. S. marshals do n't like him to use this room because the window is too exposed , and walks right back out .
You follow , asking about the patients who were supposed to see Dr. Tiller .
The patient I just finished was very unhappy to see me .
I think they are very antiabortion .
She had a fetal abnormality , and she and her husband are just devastated .
Stuff like that .
What kind of fetal abnormalities are we talking about ?
One was Down syndrome , another was a lethal brain abnormality along with a lethal heart abnormality .
Another one had a catastrophic — we 're not talking about cleft lip , we are talking about cleft face .
There was no face .
Is there any chance of interviewing some of them ?
Absolutely not .
The abortionist goes home , riding in the bulletproof car with three U. S. marshals .
You follow in a separate car .
Another set of marshals checks your credentials before they let you in .
Inside there 's a beautiful Bösendorfer piano with Beethoven on the stand and a primitive bow and arrow from the Amazon rain forest , where the abortionist has traveled to cure diseases and conduct ethnographic studies for more than forty years .
There are books everywhere , and many of the nature photographs he has published in environmental books and magazines .
Then he leads you to his office .
This is the descent into hell .
I have n't had a chance to clean this up .
It 's an understatement .
There 's a narrow path between the books and papers .
The stacks rise like the houses in Horton Hears a Who !
You walk around reading titles : Organization of Insect Societies .
Sister Carrie .
The Black Death .
Cleansing the Fatherland .
Abortion and Medical Ethics .
Eve 's Herbs .
The Complete Idiot 's Guide to MBA Basics .
There 's a book on clutter control , which is obviously not doing much good .
Even the bathroom is stuffed with boxes .
Do n't go in there .
It 's pretty bad .
He sits down to bang out a letter to President Obama .
As you know , Dr. Tiller was unarmed , vulnerable , and acting as an usher for his fellow worshippers .
It 's four in the afternoon and he still has n't eaten his miserable microwave tamales .
You can't help wondering if he 's the abstemious type who does n't take pleasure in simple things like food .
I enjoy food when I have a chance .
I love to cook .
Grown men lie down on the floor and cry with ecstasy over my paella .
What do the women do ?
They watch the men .
In three days , it 's the first light thing you 've heard him say .
So you take the opportunity to try to reach the emotional core everyone keeps telling you about .
This woman you refused to treat , what was her reason ?
She was raped .
I 'm very sympathetic , but I can't risk my medical license for someone who just did n't get around to doing anything about it .
I 've done some cases over thirty - six weeks , but very few .
For what cause ?
For some catastrophic problems .
Like what ?
Oh , anencephaly or lack of kidneys , you know .
Lack of a brain .
The antiabortionists say that in those cases , the woman should just give birth naturally and let God take the baby .
The sharp tone comes back .
Having a delivery is not a benign procedure .
When you are trying to keep the baby alive , that increases the risk for the woman .
And Reagan put in a bunch of rules about requiring to keep babies alive no matter how hopeless it is .
You have people going to Europe to get away from that .
You mean the hospital requires them to save the baby ?
The hospital requires full resuscitation measures , no matter what .
Also , his seaweed procedure is very slow and gentle on the cervix .
The tissue dehydrates , the collagen starts to pull apart , the uterus gets softer .
If you do a forceful dilation , you 're going to tear the cervix .
All around , his way is safer .
Safer for the mom ?
Not for the mom , he snaps , for the woman .
Till she 's had a baby , she 's not a mom .
While you wait , you try to chat up his staff .
Most do n't want to talk on the record , but Amanda says she 's been working here for thirteen years .
The abortionist is very caring with all of them , she says .
Like all doctors , he wants things done exactly his way .
But he does n't tolerate them being treated poorly .
He pays them well .
He gives them insurance and 401 ( k ) 's , which is not routine in the abortion trade .
Once , he took them all rafting down the Green River .
That was delightful .
He did n't care where anything was laid out in the camp .
The pens in the counseling room are always diagonal to the pad of paper , you 've noticed .
He 'll move them , too .
As he talks to you , he 'll move them .
So what brings out his emotions ?
Well , I think it is really difficult for him when women are experiencing pain and he 's not able to control that for them .
That really affects him .
How ?
He becomes very introverted .
Have you ever seen him cry ?
That 's a question for Dr. Hern .
Does it bother him when the patients show disgust ?
That 's a question for Dr. Hern .
The abortionist is on the phone , talking with the editor of a scientific journal .
Well , I went to George 's funeral in Wichita , and I was probably the most heavily protected son of a bitch in the state .
I was surrounded by rings of marshals and they might 've been able to get me with a shoulder - mounted rocket or something .
But the grief of this situation was pretty hard .
He hangs up and dials another number .
Well , it 's been a very tough week .
You know , I liked the world a lot better the way it was a week ago Sunday morning — with George in it .
Another line lights up .
Amor , cómo estás ?
Tengo mucho trabajo .
No , no , está bien , Amor .
Beso , beso , ciao .
Back on the other line , he tells a reporter that he 's just staggered by what happened last week and grieving the loss of a wonderful friend and an excellent doctor .
Then a graphic designer comes in to chat about his latest book , an elaborate collage of photographs , stories , and poems :
I have resigned myself to temporary complicity with evil in order to accomplish certain strategic things for people whose suffering is more important than my need to maintain moral purity
The poem is about his work in the Nixon administration , he says .
The phone rings again .
This time it 's the president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors , Steven Keiles .
The abortionist wants him to issue a statement denouncing the murder , the sooner the better .
I 'm sorry , this is not very complicated .
You make a statement and you issue it to the press , a one - page statement condemning the brutal assassination of a conscientious and dedicated doctor who helped tens of thousands of women .
As far as I 'm concerned , it should have been issued last Monday .
I do n't know why you have to go through a PR firm .
I 'm sorry , but it just seems very , very bureaucratic to me .
I know that abortion is controversial among the members , but I think that the statement by the NSGC would be very important .
He slamsdown the receiver .
That guy is a fucking clerk .
It 's ridiculous , the designer says .
I have no patience for this kind of bullshit .
George gave them so much money and so much help .
Encouraged by the designer , he starts ranting about the time the militant antiabortion activist Randall Terry prayed for his death on national Christian radio .
These guys are just despicable .
If anyone wants hope for the human species , do n't talk to me .
A receptionist comes to close the door so the patients do n't hear him .
In passing , the abortionist says you can never get used to this .
Next time he gives you a minute , you ask him to elaborate .
You can't , he says .
I think we 're hardwired , biologically , to protect small , vulnerable creatures , especially babies .
The fetuses may not be babies , but some of them are pretty close .
Since you 've become wary of even saying the word baby around him , always using fetus instead , this surprises you .
But he refuses to say any more .
He suggests you read an essay called " What About Us ? Staff Reactions to D&E . "
The antiabortion people quote the shit out of it .
It 's kind of antiabortion porn for them .
But the pro-choice people do n't like it either .
They do n't like it when you talk about how it really feels to do this work .
His voice is somewhere between bitter and proud .
So why did he write it ?
For that matter , why does he write so many papers and books ?
And why does he escape to the jungles of Peru every chance he gets ?
And what about this theory that man is a cancer ?
Is it all some kind of elaborate coping mechanism that makes it easier for him to do what he does ?
I wrote it because , A , I 'm a human being , and B , I 'm a writer , and C and D , I 'm a physician and I 'm trying to understand what we 're doing here .
You read the paper .
He describes the reactions members of his staff have when they see residue of late abortions , which include shock , dismay , amazement , disgust , fear , and sadness .
The later the pregnancy , the harder it is to accept .
One assistant resented the patients for putting them through such a horrible experience .
Two others described dreams where they vomited fetuses or felt an overwhelming urge to protect others from viewing the fetal parts .
Common coping mechanisms were denial , projection , and rationalization .
For the senior author , rationalization has been shown by his intensive involvement in professional meetings , where this matter is discussed , and by his seeking peer support from colleagues who have similar experiences .
Another great help was the relationships with the patients , which helped the senior author maintain his sense of commitment .
It ended with the passage the antiabortionists love to quote , always out of context , words so honest they are almost as painful to read as they must have been to write :
We have reached a point in this particular technology where there is no possibility of denying an act of destruction .
It is before one 's eyes .
The sensations of dismemberment flow through the forceps like an electric current .
It is the crucible of a raging controversy , the confrontation of a modern existential dilemma .
The more we seem to solve the problem , the more intractable it becomes .
The abortionist is in the basement doing an abortion .
Today is Thursday , operating day .
He said you could n't be here but he called at 7:30 A.M. and said he changed his mind .
Now it 's just after 8:00 .
It 's very quiet .
The waiting room is empty .
So are the examining rooms .
A receptionist tells you he just got done with a patient and should get back shortly .
A woman comes to the door .
Is it okay if I go outside for a minute ?
Sure .
Knock on the door if you 're starting to feel bad .
The phone keeps ringing .
If you have tissue samples , says the receptionist you cannot name , that makes it logistically easier .
Can I put you on hold one second ?
She opens the door for the sad woman and her daughter .
Thank you , the daughter says in an emphatic tone that suggests she 's not just talking about the door .
A few minutes pass and the phone rings again .
Good morning , Dr. Hern 's office .
Okay , did you get any measurements from the ultrasound ?
Okay .
And where was this done ?
Okay .
Another line rings .
Could you hold for a second ?
Good morning , Dr. Hern 's office .
Okay , I can make an appointment .
Can I have your last name and date of birth ?
Can you hold for a second ?
When the calls slow down , the receptionist tells you about the time a pro-life reporter pretended to be looking for information and then quoted her by name .
They do these things to scare you .
They like to let you know they know where you live .
The U. S. marshals keep walking up and down the hall , carrying black bags that look ominously tactical .
The abortionist comes upstairs and moves you to the nurses ' office so he can do an interview with a reporter from The Wichita Eagle .
Her husband was in the church when Tiller got killed .
They 're just getting started when he jumps up .
I 'm sorry , I have to go see a patient .
The receptionist you cannot name is on the phone again .
Is someone reading the results for you ?
Is there someone who can interpret them for you ?
The other receptionist lets a man in the door .
Thanks for being here , she says .
You 'll wait downstairs .
The abortionist comes back to the reporter from Wichita .
The antiabortion movement is the face of fascism , he says .
It can not be separated from the ruthless and cynical manipulation of antiabortion rhetoric by the Republican party .
The receptionist opens the door again .
It 's a woman in an ankle - length Amish dress .
You 've seen her before .
She 's usually with another woman in the same kind of dress .
She 's waiting downstairs , the receptionist says , hitting a button that rings an internal line .
Dr. Hern ?
Can you tell B — — her mother is coming down to be with her ?
While you wait , you read another one of the abortionist 's essays .
It has been my practice to rupture membranes with ring forceps , it says .
Another man comes to the door .
I 'll tell her you 're on your way down , the receptionist says .
The phone rings .
Dr. Hern 's office .
I can check for you .
He 's with a patient .
Are you sure you do n't want me to take a phone number ?
The phone rings again .
Dr. Hern 's office .
At 11:30 , the abortionist comes up in a cheerful mood .
I have to go check the level of molecular degeneration in my tamales .
It 's the second lighthearted thing you 've heard him say this week .
And when he comes back from the kitchen , he says another .
I identified a new species in my tamales .
But I think with a gastroenterologist standing by ...
The receptionist smiles .
It 's your risk .
The two Amish women leave .
The abortionist walks them to the door .
Have a safe trip home , he says .
Give my regards to Dr. H — .
In the counseling room , which the marshals have judged safe , he sits down with a weary sigh and picks up the phone .
Amor , he says .
In the nurses ' office , the soft felt sunflower weaves through the metal in - box .
The poster that looks like the mother alien glares down at you .
From the room next door , the abortionist 's voice rises so high you can hear it through the wall .
I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I can't meet with every person who wants to talk to me .
He stops in to say hello , forgetting the rule about not using this room for a moment .
I have to go downstairs and finish seeing a patient , he says .
The phone rings .
June 24 is the first time we are seeing patients .
At that time , based on the information you gave me , the fee will be $ 7,500 .
A young woman wearing a 1920s flapper scarf that Isadora Duncan might have worn comes up the stairs alone .
At that very moment , you are reading page 83 of Abortion Practice , the section called Isolation :
One of the loneliest persons in the world is the woman who has not told anyone she is pregnant or considering an abortion .
Some women have no one to whom they can turn ; others insist on suffering alone as a form of self - punishment .
The individual abortion counselor may , and frequently does , fill that gap for both kinds of patients .
The woman in the flapper scarf stops at the receptionist 's office .
Thank you so much , she says .
You 're so helpful .
You 're wonderful ladies .
Another woman stops at the desk .
She 's a Latina with short black hair , here for her sister .
Can I wait ?
I want to say goodbye to everyone .
The phone rings .
Who referred you to our office ?
And they did the ultrasound ?
Can you call them and have them send it to us ?
Do you have a pencil handy ?
You have a whole week .
Do n't give up .
The phone rings .
Well , have you had an ultrasound ?
Okay .
If it 's between nineteen weeks and twenty - four weeks , it 'll be between $ 5,000 and $ 7,500 .
Five minutes later , it rings again .
No , we need to know what the measurements are before you travel all the way to Colorado .
It 's a measurement in millimeters and centimeters .
Fax it to us .
Everything is based on the measurement .
Three minutes later , it rings again .
Dr. Hern 's office .
Four minutes later , it rings again .
Dr. Hern 's office .
At 1:35 , the sad woman emerges from the basement with her daughter , who is very tall for fifteen .
The sad woman goes out the bulletproof doors and the daughter sits down in the waiting room .
The receptionist goes out to check on her .
Are you waiting for your mom ?
She answers in a soft and girlish voice that makes you think of the army of Beanie Babies in your daughter 's closet .
Yeah , she 's coming .
You 'll get a good night 's sleep tonight .
Tomorrow , drink a lot of fluids and get rest .
At 1:43 , the phone rings .
Dr. Hern 's office .
Now it 's 1:47 , and you 're sitting down in the counseling room with the young couple who arrived in Wichita just in time to see the news cameras that surrounded the Reformation Lutheran Church .
The woman has light - brown hair and wears conservative glasses .
She is calm , somber , and depleted .
Her husband sits in the opposite chair watching her carefully .
He says he does not want her to talk for too long .
She 's feeling weak .
As gently as you can , you ask her to tell you why she chose abortion .
We had found out that something was wrong at twenty - eight weeks , seriously wrong .
And they found out that it was going to put me , my health , perhaps in danger if I carried through to the end of the pregnancy .
And it was a planned pregnancy ?
Oh yes .
This was a wanted pregnancy , absolutely .
And when you arrived in Wichita ?
We were caught between grieving about going through this and this awful situation .
And then what did you do ?
I was scared to stay so close to where something like this could happen .
We went home right away .
She corrects herself .
Well , we tried to call here to see if we could fly here , but they were already overbooked and obviously the whole emotional thing , so they recommended that we wait a week .
And you could n't find any other doctor close to home ?
They do these kinds of procedures in Canada , where we come from , but because I was a very complicated case , and because I did n't feel comfortable with the way they wanted to do it , it was very high risk , and I wanted to come to someone who really knows and is an expert at this .
Do you mind explaining why it was so complicated ?
Because of the abnormalities of the child .
It was giving me health complications .
What was wrong ?
It was severe abnormalities .
You change the subject , asking what was wrong with the Canadian doctors .
They do it very fast .
They do n't use the seaweed , they do n't take their time , and it puts the woman at risk .
And you 're at risk of losing your uterus .
I would like to have children , so I did n't want to have that risk .
And how did it go , the surgery ?
Well Dr. Tiller said that —
Hern .
Oh , sorry , sorry , sorry .
Dr. Hern said that I was a very complicated case .
He said it went well , but it was n't an easy thing to do .
Was it painful ?
Yeah , it was painful physically and mentally .
You do n't want to push it .
So you ask if there 's anything else they want to say .
The husband answers .
It 's important that people have a choice .
At the end of the day , when things go bad , you know ?
I mean , God forbid something happens to Dr. Hern , where are we going to go next ?
Australia ?
China ?
It 's important that people know that choice is very important when it comes to things like this .
Five minutes later , you catch the abortionist in the nurses ' office , where the U. S. marshals do n't want him to go , and ask him to tell you what was wrong with the couple 's baby — excuse me , fetus .
You 're pretty sure it was the one with the lethal brain and lethal heart .
But he wo n't say .
So you ask him how it went .
It was very difficult .
Did it take a long time ?
Yeah , it was a long time .
Very long procedure .
How long is long ?
Forty - five minutes .
The average procedure is five minutes .
What was the problem ?
Well , she was very far along .
It was the position of the uterus , and she had a previous C- section , poor dilation , it was very difficult .
I think any other procedure would have been very , very dangerous for her .
She was in danger of her life ?
Oh yeah .
She would have risked having a ruptured uterus in an induction procedure .
In surgery , or in birth ?
Well , she 's at risk , at this point , no matter what she decides to do .
That 's why I 'm quite sure this was the safest option for her .
No doubt about it .
The abortionist gives you directions to the Temple Emanuel in Denver .
Later that evening , you will drive down with his wife and son , chatting about life under communism and brain surgery from the patient 's point of view .
You 'll have a copy of the abortionist 's speech , which he stayed up till 1:00 A.M. writing , but when he ascends to the dais , for reasons you feel more than understand , you will turn on your recorder anyway .
He 'll start to choke up when he says that Tiller was gentle , considerate , and compassionate , then recover and roll into the refuge of his annealing anger :
This brutal , cold - blooded , premeditated political assassination is the inevitable and predictable result of over thirty - five years of rabid antiabortion harassment , hate rhetoric , violence ...
When he comes off the stage to embrace the wife you cannot name , he will break down in racking sobs .
The son you cannot name will stroke his shoulder .
You will be standing right next to them , close enough to hear him say , Amor , Amor , Amor , close enough to hear members of the audience — who came by word of mouth , because the rabbi considered it too dangerous to advertise publicly — whisper their gratitude .
Thank you for your courage .
Thank you for your commitment .
One woman squeezes his hand between hers .
It 's because of people like you that my relatives survived the 1940s .
But this comes later .
Right now , it 's 2:27 and the receptionist you cannot name is talking on the phone again .
No , he can't do it tonight .
The soonest we can schedule it is the twenty - third .
She cups her hand over the receiver .
This woman wants to come tonight — to fly in .
Absolutely not , the abortionist says .
I absolutely can't do it .
The receptionist takes her hand off the phone .
He can't do it until the twenty - third .
He can't see you tonight .
She pauses to listen .
He 's trying to live his life as well , she says .
The best we can do is the twenty - third .
She pauses again .
I would say check with the doctor who referred you .
Do you want to take a deep breath ?
Take a deep breath and call me back .
Another pause , then the receptionist continues .
He can't change his mind .
This is beyond his control .
All you need to know is he can see you on the twenty - third .
You need to plan a plane trip to Colorado on the twenty - second .
Talk to your husband for a minute and call me back .
My name is —
But you can not say her name .
Three weeks later , the woman from Canada calls you on the phone .
She says she has some things she wants to tell you .
It was the most tragic and terrible experience of my life , she begins , speaking with force , the words rushing out .
She has a son almost ready to start kindergarten , she was afraid she would n't survive to raise him , and she wants to have a big family , with lots of children , and the situation was so crazy with the marshals and the bulletproof glass and the constant fear of a mad killer with a gun .
Dr. Hern was under so much pressure .
She could see the stress in his face .
I did n't have a chance to tell you all this because after the procedure I just wanted to curl up in a ball , and I did n't know how I felt back then , to be honest .
Now I 'm still recovering and still sad and still mourning , and I realize how grateful I am that Dr. Hern was able to take me under such quick and terrible circumstances .
That 's what gets me so upset .
He 's a doctor who is trying to help people — it 's shocking that people would want to hurt him .
Without Dr. Hern , she says , she does n't know what she would have done .
It 's crazy that he 's the only one left .
She is grateful , grateful , so grateful that she will be here to raise her son .
And as the words tumble and repeat you hear , in the urgency unleashed by her deliverance , a love too sad for sermons , too personal for headlines , a private benediction , the abortionist 's reward , the love song of Warren Martin Hern , M.D .

I was really hoping I could have titled this , “ I Am George Clooney ” or “ I Am LeBron James ” ( hell , I ’d be satisfied if I could have labeled this , “ I Am Josh Groban ” ) but unfortunately I can ’t .
I have to be honest with myself .
I am Larry David .
Like Larry , I am constantly vexed by how people live their lives .
I too wish that everyone would behave just like me and that life would be much easier if everyone did .
And just like Mr. David , I also feel like I ’m always doing the right thing but apparently whatever I ’m doing makes people loathe me .
I have never watched an episode of “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ” and thought , “ Goddamn !
That Larry David is an annoying prick . ”
Rather I have simply watched on , nodding my head and thinking , “ Mr. David , everything you are saying is exactly right .
You are a wise , wise man . ”
There was one episode where Larry was out to dinner with his wife Cheryl and when it was time for dessert Cheryl suggested that they go somewhere else for it .
Larry : “ Why ?
Why ca n’t we just have dessert here ? ”
Cheryl : “ Because it would be nice to go somewhere else for dessert . ”
Larry : “ Why ?
Why break up dinner and dessert ? ”
Cheryl : “ It will be like a little adventure . ” ( pause ) Larry : “ I do n’t see how that ’s an adventure .
“ EXACTLY !!!!
( FYI , I remember watching this episode with my girlfriend and we got into a huge argument when I said Larry was right .
As a result we have never had dessert after dinner in a restaurant . )
Listening to Larry David speak about people is like listening to the voice inside my head , the only difference being that the voice in my head is shockingly whinier than Larry ’s .
And it ’s not that we ( notice how I use the familiar with Larry and myself ) hate people .
We love people – as long as they are acting in a way that we find acceptable .
That ’s fair !
The sad irony of it all is that if Larry David met me , he probably would dislike me as well .
Despite our similar views I doubt that there would be any kinship between us .
While I would want to bond with him about how I too ca n’t stand when other people do n’t follow the rules , Larry would probably dismiss me as one of those “ other people ” .
What ’s worse is that acting like a Larry David without being a Larry David is even more unforgivable than if I were the original .
If I was old I could have the excuse of just being crotchety .
If I was Jewish I could perhaps rely on my faith and community to get me through the tough times of people hating me .
And If I was rich I could tell everybody to go fuck themselves .
But I ’m none of these things .
I ’m truly shooting zero for three .
I ’m much worse than Larry David – I ’m Larry David without the benefits or perks .
Historical News and Comment
A Brief Introduction to Holocaust Revisionism
Arthur R. Butz
Dr. Arthur R. Butz is an associate professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois .
He is also the author of a major revisionist study of the Holocaust story , The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , as well as a member of the IHR Journal 's editorial advisory committee .
Earlier this year , as the Holocaust story was flaring on the Northwestern campus as an issue of often intensely acrimonious debate , Butz once again found himself in the center of the storm .
( For more on this , including the key role played by IHR media project director Bradley Smith , see the May and July 1991 issues of the IHR Newsletter . )
At the height of the controversy , Butz presented his view of the Holocaust story in a succinct essay that appeared in the school paper , The Daily Northwestern , May 13 , 1991 , under the title " A Short Introduction to the Study of Holocaust Revisionism , " Here is the complete text of his piece , which includes a correction of an error that appeared in the Daily Northwestern version :
I see three principal reasons for the widespread but erroneous belief in the legend of millions of Jews killed by the Germans during World War II : U.S. and British troops found horrible piles of corpses in the West German camps they captured in 1945 ( e.g. Dachau and Belsen ) ; there are no longer large communities of Jews in Poland ; and historians generally support the legend .
During both world wars , Germany was forced to fight typhus , carried by lice in the constant traffic with the East .
That is why all accounts of entry into the German concentration camps speak of shaving of hair and showering and other delousing procedures , such as treatment of quarters with the pesticide Zyklon .
That was also the main reason for a high death rate in the camps , and for the crematoria that existed in all .
When Germany collapsed in chaos , then of course all such defenses ceased , and typhus and other diseases became rampant in the camps , which quartered mainly political prisoners , ordinary criminals , homosexuals , conscientious objectors and Jews conscripted for labor .
Hence the horrible scenes , which however had nothing to do with " extermination " or any deliberate policy .
Moreover , the West German camps involved were not the alleged " extermination camps , " which were all in Poland ( e.g. Auschwitz and Treblinka ) and which were all evacuated or shut down before capture by the Soviets , who found no such scenes .
The " Final Solution " spoken of in the German documents was a program of evacuation , resettlement and deportation of Jews with the ultimate objective of expulsion from Europe .
During the war Jews of various nationalities were being moved east , as one stage in this Final Solution .
The legend claims that the motion was mainly for extermination purposes .
The great majority of the millions allegedly exterminated were East European -- not German or West European -- Jews .
For that reason study of the problem via population statistics has been difficult to impossible , but it is a fact that there are no longer large communities of Jews in Poland .
However , the Germans were only one of several parties involved in moving Jews around .
The Soviets deported virtually all of the Jews of eastern Poland to their interior in 1940 .
After the war , with Polish and other Jews pouring out of the East into occupied West Germany , the Zionists moved large numbers to Palestine , and the United States and other countries absorbed many Jews , in most cases under conditions making impossible a numerical accounting .
Moreover , the Polish borders were changed drastically at the end of the war ; the country was literally moved west .
Historians generally support the legend , but there are precedents for nearly incomprehensible blindness on the part of scholars .
For example , throughout the Middle Ages even the Pope 's political enemies conceded his false claim that the 4th century Emperor Constantine had ceded rule of the west to the Pope , although all knew very well that Constantine had been succeeded by more emperors .
Near unanimity among the academics is especially suspect when there exist great political pressures ; in some countries , Holocaust Revisionists have been prosecuted .
It is easy to show that the extermination legend merits skepticism .
Even the casual reader of the Holocaust literature knows that during the war virtually nobody acted as though it were happening .
Thus it is common to berate the Vatican , the Red Cross and the Allies ( especially the intelligence agencies ) of their ignorance and inaction , and to explain that the Jews generally did not resist deportation because they did not know what was in store for them .
If you add all this up you have the strange claim that for almost three years German trains , operating on a continental scale in densely civilized regions of Europe , were regularly and systematically moving millions of Jews to their deaths , and nobody noticed except for a few of our Jewish leaders who were making public " extermination " claims .
On closer examination even those few Jewish leaders were not acting as though it were happening .
Ordinary communications between the occupied and neutral countries were open , and they were in contact with the Jews whom the Germans were deporting , who thus could not have been in ignorance of " extermination " if those claims had any validity .
This incredible ignorance must also be attributed to Hans Oster 's department in German military intelligence , correctly labeled " the veritable general staff of the opposition to Hitler " in a recent review .
What we are offered in evidence was gathered after the war , in trials .
The evidence is almost all oral testimony and " confessions . "
Without the evidence of these trials there would be no significant evidence of " extermination . "
One must pause and ponder this carefully .
Were trials needed to determine that the Battle of Waterloo happened ?
The bombings of Hamburg , Dresden , Hiroshima and Nagasaki ?
The slaughter in Cambodia ?
Yet this three - year program , of continental scope , claiming millions of victims , requires trials to argue its reality .
I am not arguing that the trials were illegal or unfair , I am arguing that such historical logic as the legend rests on must not be countenanced .
Such events cannot happen without generating commensurate and contemporaneous evidence for their reality , just as a great forest fire cannot take place without producing smoke .
One may as well believe that New York City was burned down , if confessions to the deed can be produced .
Detailed consideration of the specific evidence put forward in support of the legend has been a focus of the Revisionist literature and cannot be undertaken here , but I shall mention one point .
The claim of the legend is that there were no technical means provided for the specific task of extermination , and that means originally provided for other purposes did double duty in improvised arrangements .
Thus the Jews were allegedly gassed with the pesticide Zyklon , and their corpses disappeared into the crematoria along with the deaths from " ordinary " causes ( the ashes or other remains of millions of victims never having been found ) .
Surely any thoughtful person must be skeptical .

A Fighter with a big heart comes to Fort Worth to build a new playground for a low income school :
A Parent Teacher Association had been working hard to raise the funds needed to build a safe playground for the 870 + children attending this low - income school .
A $ 5,000 grant that the school received for the playground had a stipulation .
After raising the remaining funds needed for the playground equipment the school would have to build it themselves .
They needed 150 volunteers to do the build successfully .
A parent started contacting as many athletes as she could think of .
She knew that strength and stamina was what the school was going to need to get the playground built in one day .
There were few responses .
Professional fighter , Evan Tanner of UFC ( Ultimate Fighting Championship ) heard about the need for tough guys with big hearts and offered to fly in from Las Vegas to help .
" Your Cause is a good one . "
" I will be there , " Evan Tanner simply stated .
The playground build was on Saturday , November 3rd .
Starting at 8 am and ending at 5 pm when the playground was completed .
Evan Tanner showed up bright and early with a smile on his face and ready to work .
Tanner spent the first part of the day building a rock climb side by side with a parent and some teachers .
After that job was done he moved outside to the site and just jumped in and moved from one task to another .
Seeing each task completed before he moved on to the next .
Not once did he stand still unless it where for a picture with a fan .
" Tanner managed to nearly have a hand in putting together every part of this playground today . "
" He is amazing . "
" I have never seen anything like it , " said a local volunteer .
After the equipment was up , concrete in , and everything leveled it was lunch time .
Tanner had a few minutes to get some food in before he spent his lunch time signing autographs for the 50 or more kids attending .
He brought trading cards and gave each child an autographed picture writing something inspirational on each one .
" The ones to my daughters say , Live strong and dream big and Live well , Laugh often , and Love much , " revealed a fan .
He also signed a t - shirt here or there upon request .
The children seemed to be in awe .
He then met with some local heroes out in the parking lot .
The local fire department showed up to support the build day .
The bunch of heroes took part in getting some autographs as well .
Once lunch was over he was back at work moving the mountain of mulch .
" That man is a machine , a human shovel , " said a volunteer from a local church .
" I guarantee that Tanner moved a third of that mountain himself ! " said a parent and volunteer .
" He brought the same intensity to the playground build that he brings to the octagon , " stated a fan .
" He has the most heart of anyone I have ever met , a true inspiration . "
" Not too many people get to meet someone as humble and giving as Mr. Evan Tanner . "
" He flew here to work for strangers , for free . "
" He made this day for the kids even more special than I had hoped for . "
" It is nice to know that some athletes remember that they can make a difference outside of their sport . "
" I am Lucky to have met him , " declared volunteer and Playground Leader .

It 's real meat , all right .
But it ai n't Kobe .
The US Department of Agriculture categorizes beef into eight grades of quality .
The bottom three — utility , cutter , and canner — are typically used in processed foods and come from older steers with partially ossified vertebrae , tougher tissue , and generally less reason to live .
ConAgra was n't exactly forthcoming on what 's inside Slim Jim .
Mechanically separated chicken
Did you imagine a conveyor belt carrying live chickens into a giant machine , set to the classic cartoon theme " Powerhouse " ?
You 're right !
Well , maybe not about the music .
Poultry scraps are pressed mechanically through a sieve that extrudes the meat as a bright pink paste and leaves the bones behind ( most of the time ) .
Corn and wheat proteins
Slim Jim is made by ConAgra , and if there are two things ConAgra has a lot of , it 's corn and wheat .
Lactic acid starter culture
Although ConAgra refers to Slim Jim as a meat stick ( yum ) , it has a lot in common with old - fashioned fermented sausages like salami and pepperoni .
They all use bacteria and sugar to produce lactic acid , which lowers the pH of the sausage to around 5.0 , firming up the meat and hopefully killing all harmful bacteria .
Dextrose
Serves as food for the lactic acid starter culture .
Slim Jim :
It 's alive !
Salt
Salt binds the water molecules in meat , leaving little H2O available for microbial activity — and thereby preventing spoilage .
One Slim Jim gives you more than one - sixth of the sodium your body needs in a day .
Sodium nitrite
Cosmetically , this is added to sausage because it combines with myoglobin in animal muscle to keep it from turning gray .
Antibiotically , it inhibits botulism .
Toxicologically , 6 grams of the stuff — roughly the equivalent of 1,400 Slim Jims — can kill you .
So go easy there , champ .
Hydrolyzed soy
Hydrolysis , in this instance , breaks larger soy protein molecules into their constituent amino acids , such as glutamic acid .
Typically , the process also results in glutamic acid salt — also known as monosodium glutamate , a familiar flavor enhancer .

There has been a revival of the zombie film in recent years
If zombies actually existed , an attack by them would lead to the collapse of civilisation unless dealt with quickly and aggressively .
That is the conclusion of a mathematical exercise carried out by researchers in Canada .
They say only frequent counter - attacks with increasing force would eradicate the fictional creatures .
The scientific paper is published in a book - Infectious Diseases Modelling Research Progress .
In books , films , video games and folklore , zombies are undead creatures , able to turn the living into other zombies with a bite .
But there is a serious side to the work .
In some respects , a zombie " plague " resembles a lethal , rapidly spreading infection .
The researchers say the exercise could help scientists model the spread of unfamiliar diseases through human populations .
My understanding of zombie biology is that if you manage to decapitate a zombie then it's dead forever
Professor Neil Ferguson
In their study , the researchers from the University of Ottawa and Carleton University ( also in Ottawa ) posed a question :
If there was to be a battle between zombies and the living , who would win ?
Professor Robert Smith ?
( the question mark is part of his surname and not a typographical mistake ) and colleagues wrote : " We model a zombie attack using biological assumptions based on popular zombie movies .
" We introduce a basic model for zombie infection and illustrate the outcome with numerical solutions . "

To give the living a fighting chance , the researchers chose " classic " slow - moving zombies as our opponents rather than the nimble , intelligent creatures portrayed in some recent films .
" While we are trying to be as broad as possible in modelling zombies - especially as there are many variables - we have decided not to consider these individuals , " the researchers said .
Back for good ?
Even so , their analysis revealed that a strategy of capturing or curing the zombies would only put off the inevitable .
In their scientific paper , the authors conclude that humanity 's only hope is to " hit them [ the undead ] hard and hit them often " .
They added : " It 's imperative that zombies are dealt with quickly or else ... we are all in a great deal of trouble . "
According to the researchers , the key difference between the zombies and the spread of real infections is that " zombies can come back to life " .
Professor Neil Ferguson , who is one of the UK government 's chief advisers on controlling the spread of swine flu , said the study did have parallels with some infectious diseases .
" None of them actually cause large - scale death or disease , but certainly there are some fungal infections which are difficult to eradicate , " said Professor Ferguson , from Imperial College London .
" There are some viral infections - simple diseases like chicken pox have survived in very small communities .
If you get it when you are very young , the virus stays with you and can re-occur as shingles , triggering a new chicken pox epidemic . "
Professor Smith ? told BBC
News : " When you try to model an unfamiliar disease , you try to find out what 's happening , try to approximate it .
You then refine it , go back and try again . "
" We refined the model again and again to say ... here 's how you would tackle an unfamiliar disease . "
Professor Ferguson went on to joke : " The paper considers something that many of us have worried about - particularly in our younger days - of what would be a feasible way of tackling an outbreak of a rapidly spreading zombie infection .
" My understanding of zombie biology is that if you manage to decapitate a zombie then it 's dead forever .
So perhaps they are being a little over - pessimistic when they conclude that zombies might take over a city in three or four days . "

Editor ’s note :
This is a guest post from Jeff Rose .
We last heard from Mr. Rose when he was kind enough to give us a glimpse into the life of a financial planner .
Today he fills us in on how to be financially studly .
Jeff Rose is an Illinois Certified Financial Planner and co-founder of Alliance Investment Planning Group .
He is also the author of Good Financial Cents , a financial planning and investment blog .
You can also learn more about Jeff at his website Jeff Rose Financial .
Throughout a man ’s life , he is presented with opportunities to leave his mark .
The title that all men desire and hope that their name is mentioned in the same breath as is the unmistakable title of “ Stud . ”
In grade school , being a stud was making the starting five of the basketball team and being the first to french kiss a girl .
In high school , it was cruising around in your slick hot rod , leading the football team to state , and landing the hottest cheerleader on the team .
College introduced the beer bong and how much cooler your parties were than the one down the street .
After graduation and well into your career , the next studly phase of your life begins .
At this point in your life , women do n’t care how much you “ could ” bench press , the fact that you did 21 shots in one night ( and lived to tell about it ) , or that you almost won the state championship in 2004 .
They want a man who has control of their finances and has a plan in place .
They want a financial stud .
Have Some Cash
You better have some cash in your wallet and in the bank .
I make it a point to always have at least $ 100 - $ 200 cash in my wallet .
For me , that ’s weird to say because I ’ve always been an ATM guy .
I keep cash on hand for times that debit cards just wo n’t work .
Whether it ’s buying the next round , leaving a generous tip , or simplifying the splitting of a dinner bill , having some cash on hand looks impressive .
But do n’t just keep cash in your wallet .
You want to make sure you have a decent amount of cash stashed away in your savings account as an emergency fund as well .
Having a decent amount of money in your savings is a sign that you are financially responsible and have the discipline to be able to put some money away .
How much is enough ?
3 months of your monthly household expenses is a start , but to be a true financial stud you should be somewhere in the 6 - 8 month range .
If you want to feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger is his prime , then 12 months will give you “ the pump ” you ’re looking for .
Got Debt ?
Get Rid Of It
Whether young or old , there ’s nothing less attractive than having extra baggage .
Even worse than having flabby love handles is having a mountain of debt .
Just to confirm , I had a fellow female blogger , Mrs. Micah , give me her take on what makes a man a financial stud .
Mrs. Micah says , “ I think that being debt - free is sexy .
It shows you can look after yourself , it frees up your future together , etc . ”
For anybody that has struggled with debt , I know how burdensome it can be .
It ’s even worse when you have to pass that burden on to your significant other .
If you have debt , then having an action plan to get out of it will keep your stud credentials .
Forget the Bench Press … Max Out the Roth IRA
For the younger investor , maxing out your Roth IRA each year is the equivalent of being able to bench press 415 for reps .
Let ’s say that by the age of 25 you are able to sock away the maximum Roth IRA limit of $ 5,000 .
If you continue to do so for 30 years , averaging 8 % return , you ’ll have a $ 600,000 tax free nest egg waiting for you at retirement .
And when you ’re finally put out to pasture , you ’ll be one happy stud .
Become a 401k Expert
Many times I hear of people just picking funds in their 401k because of what their co-workers are doing or because they thought the fund sounded cool .
Whatever you do , do not be that guy .
I had a friend in his early 20 ’s who was putting most of his money in the “ Total Return Fund ” because it sounded the most aggressive .
Newsflash : it was 100 % bond fund .
Granted , it helped him prevent major losses in the past year , but for a long term strategy , it ’s not the way to go .
Do n’t get your 401k advice from chats around the water cooler ; head to Google and do some research .
Budgets Are Sexy
A financial stud does n’t spend just to spend .
A man needs to know where his money is going month to month .
If spreadsheets are n’t your thing , try writing down your bills so you can see how much money is really going out each month .
Do n’t just take my word for it .
Check out J. Money ’s blog , Budgets Are Sexy , to get a grip on your finances .
Here ’s what J. Money says , “ Short answer : Budgets = Confidence = Manly .
Long answer : Maintaining a budget is key in becoming financially studly .
If you know where your money is coming and going , you ’ll know your strengths & limitations .
And if you know your strengths & limitations , you can outwit your opponent at any time !
Plus , you ’ll be able to make quick decisions on the spot which girls love .
And you know what else girls love ?
Confidence .
And this , my friend , is what the budget gives you . ”
Do n’t Get Superman Syndrome
Life insurance when you ’re single is n’t really that important , but when a family is involved , it should take precedence .
Face it , there is a 100 % chance you are going to die .
Last time I checked , that ’s better odds than Sea Biscuit at the Kentucky Derby .
The last thing you want to do is croak too soon and leave your family in financial distress .
Let me give you you an example .
I had a married couple as clients where the husband was physically fit .
He was not overweight , exercised regularly and did n’t smoke .
He was a doctor whose financial resume qualified him as a legitimate stud .
Unfortunately , an unexpected massive heart attack left the wife and their two kids without a father .
Thankfully , the father was wise enough to have enough life insurance for his wife to pay off what little debt they had left , pay the kids ’ way through college , and give the wife the option not to have to work the rest of her life .
Dealing with the loss of a loved one is tough enough , but adding unnecessary financial burden can leave a mourning family in shambles .
Are you a financial stud ?
Do n’t worry it ’s not too late .
If you are missing some of these studly qualities , make a commitment to make some changes .
You ’ll go from a “ dud ” to “ stud ” in no time .

NEW YORK — While Chris Brown was the one who was sentenced Monday ( June 22 ) after striking a plea deal , the judge at the hearing also spoke to Rihanna and told her to avoid her onetime boyfriend under a " stay away " order .
According to an abuse expert , the judge 's actions send " the wrong message " to victims .
" It 's difficult when the criminal - justice system gets involved , because suddenly , the victim is on the sideline , " said Bea Hanson , who works at Safe Horizon , an organization in Manhattan that helps abuse victims .
" It 's really about the abuser , and in this case , you have someone who sounded like she wanted to be with him .
And the problem with the ' stay away ' is the judge in that case said to her [ that ] it 's as much about her as it is him .
And that really sends the wrong message to victims of domestic violence .
Because she 's not the one that hit him ; she was hit .
And what it ends up looking like is that this [ order ] is something against her as well . "
Under the guidelines of the order , Brown can't contact Rihanna in any fashion for five years , which is the duration of his probation .
Brown is n't even allowed to be in the vicinity of Rihanna during events that both celebrities might attend .
According to Rihanna 's attorney , Donald Etra , the judge told his client that if she were to contact Brown , it would be a violation against him that could have him facing jail time .
Etra also told media gathered outside of the courthouse following the hearing that Rihanna did n't want the " stay away " order issued against Brown .
She thought the previous order of protection was fine .
Hanson said these types of decisions are difficult for any former couple to deal with , but grow larger in domestic - abuse cases .
" The problem here is that closure is imposed by somebody outside the relationship , " she said .
In addition to the probation , Brown also has to complete 180 days of community labor and undergo a year 's worth of domestic - abuse counseling .
Hanson suggested that Rihanna undergo some type of additional healing process as well , whether it 's counseling or a retreat : " Whatever it is for her that makes her feel like a strong woman , " she said .

ALEC SOTH has created a photographic career out of finding chemistry with strangers .
On his frequent road trips through America , he ’s drawn to loners and dreamers he spots from his car ; sometimes he will do several pass - bys before striking up a conversation .
Often that will lead to a portrait session with his large - format 8 - by - 10 view camera .
“ It ’s the bird flying around that swoops down and grabs the worm and then flies off , ” said Mr. Soth , 39 , who winced slightly at the ethical implications of that image .
“ But I have good intentions , and people very often enjoy that interaction .
It ’s almost like , finally , someone showed up and we can talk . ”
Mr. Soth ’s lush , painterly large - scale color prints , which reflect a striking intimacy and comfort between subject and photographer , first gained attention from the art world in 2004 .
A self - described “ complete nobody ” at the time , Mr. Soth , a Minnesota native , had made a self - printed book called “ Sleeping by the Mississippi . ”
It included landscapes and portraits shot over five years on car trips alongside the river ’s meandering path from Winona , Minn. , to Baton Rouge , La. , and drew on the American literary theme of the Mississippi as a metaphor for wandering and freedom .
After seeing a copy of the book , curators for the 2004 Whitney Biennial put him in the show ; his image “ Charles , ” of a man in a flight suit standing on the roof of his house holding a model airplane in each hand , was used on the Biennial poster .
An avalanche of coverage followed , touting him as one of the great discoveries of the show .
This attention led to a more professional publication of the book by Steidl , along with representation by Gagosian Gallery and international assignments that precipitated his joining Magnum Photos .
The workers at Argentina ’s occupied ceramics factory FASINPAT won a major victory this week : the factory now definitively belongs to the people in legal terms .
Since 2001 , the workers at Zanon have fought for legal recognition of worker control at Latin America ’s largest ceramics factory which has created jobs , spearheaded community projects , supported social movements world - wide and shown the world that workers do n’t need bosses .
The workers at Argentina ’s occupied ceramics factory , FASINPAT ( Factory Without a Boss ) , won a major victory this week : the factory now definitively belongs to the people in legal terms .
The provincial legislature voted in favor of expropriating the ceramics factory and handing it over to the workers cooperative to manage legally and indefinitely .
Since 2001 , the workers at Zanon have fought for legal recognition of worker control at Latin America ’s largest ceramics factory which has created jobs , spearheaded community projects , supported social movements world - wide and shown the world that workers do n’t need bosses .
" This is incredible , we are happy .
The expropriation is an act of justice , " said Alejandro Lopez the General Secretary of the Ceramists Union , overwhelmed by the emotion of the victory .
" We do n’t forget the people who supported us in our hardest moments , or the 100,000 people who signed the petition supporting our bill . "
Hundreds of workers from the FASINPAT factory waited anxiously until the late hours of the night for the legislature ’s decision .
The expropriation law passed 26 votes in favor and 9 votes against the bill .
Thousands of supporters from other workers ’ organizations , human rights groups and social movements , along with entire families and students , joined the workers as they waited outside the provincial legislature in the capital city of Neuquén .
Enduring the Patagonian winter weather , activists played drums and shouted : " here they are the workers of Zanon , workers without a boss . "
FASINPAT has operated under worker control since 2001 when Zanon ’s owners decided to close its doors and fire the workers without paying months of back pay or severance pay .
Leading up to the massive layoffs and plant ’s closure , workers went on strike in 2000 .
The owner , Luis Zanon , with over 75 million dollars in debt to public and private creditors ( including the World Bank for over 20 million dollars ) , fired en masse most of the workers and closed the factory in 2001 - a bosses ’ lockout .
In October 2001 , workers declared the plant under worker control .
The workers subsequently camped outside the factory for four months , pamphleteering and partially blocking a highway leading to the capital city of Neuquén .
While the workers were camping outside the factory , a court ruled that the employees could sell off remaining stock .
After the stock ran out , on March 2 , 2002 , the workers ’ assembly voted to start up production without a boss .
Since the occupation , the workers renamed the factory FASINPAT ( Factory without a Boss ) .
The workers set up a stage with a giant screen for the thousands of supporters to view the legislative vote .
As the decision was read , workers embraced one another in tears in disbelief that after 8 years of struggle they finally won legal control of the factory .
" This decision reflects an organized struggle that won the support all of society , " said Veronica Hullipan from the Confederation of Mapuche .
She said that the network of Mapuche indigenous communities in the Patagonia have supported the Zanon workers ’ struggle and said legal decision is a " political triumph of workers ’ organization . "
Zanon workers reminded their supporters that the struggle of Zanon , was also the struggle of Carlos Fuentealba , a public school teacher from the province of Neuquén killed by a police officer during a peaceful protest in defense of public education .
The Zanon workers have not only created jobs , but they have supported workers struggles locally , nationally and internationally .
Workers from FASINPAT were present at the protest where Fuentealba was shot point blank in the head with a tear gas canister , in police repression ordered by the conservative ruling coalition of Neuquén MPN , which has ruled the Patagonian province since the 1976 - 1983 military dictatorship .
" This is an important chapter in the struggle of the Zanon workers , who have been fighting in the streets for more than 9 years .
First they tried to evict us in order to auction off the factory , the workers ’ struggle and the community pressured the government to expropriate the factory , " Raul Godoy , Zanon worker told the national news daily Página / 12 .
Today , the plant exports ceramics to 25 countries .
Many legislative representatives wanted to demand that the workers at the self - managed factory " guarantee a pact for social peace . "
But for the workers , the pact for social peace is broken when businessmen fraudulently go bankrupt and throw hundreds of workers out into the street .
" The capitalists are constantly declaring war with tariff increases , by privatizing public companies and with firings .
Before this situation , the workers must defend themselves ; and the workers at Zanon commit to defending ourselves , in the street , however we have to . "
According to the legislation passed , the FASINPAT cooperative which employs 470 workers and exports ceramics to more than 25 countries , will remain under the control of the cooperative .
The state would pay off 22 million pesos ( around $ 7 million ) to the creditors .
One of the main creditors is the World Bank – which gave a loan of 20 million dollars to Luis Zanon for the construction of the plant , which he never paid back .
The other major creditor is the Italian company SACMY that produces state of the art ceramics manufacturing machinery and is owed over $ 5 million .
However , the workers have resisted the state pay - off , saying that courts have proven that the creditors participated in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the plant in 2001 , because the credits went directly to the owner Luis Zanon and not investments into the factory .
" If someone should pay , Luis Zanon should pay , who is being charged with tax evasion , " said Omar Villablanca from FASINPAT .
Victory , then an eviction
While the victory of FASINPAT brings hope to many of the 200 occupied factories currently operated under worker self - management in Argentina , many are still facing legal attacks .
Early yesterday morning , just hours after the Zanon victory , a police operative evicted the factory Textil Quilmes , a thread factory occupied in the new wave of factory occupations in 2009 .
The four workers on night guard were evicted violently .
The Buenos Aires provincial government is currently debating an expropriation bill for Textil Quilmes and several other new occupations in the Buenos Aires province .
The textile workers are resisting the eviction at the factory ’s doors , rallying support to re-enter the factory despite police presence .
They also had temporary legal protection , following an expropriation bill that was approved unanimously by the lower house in the provincial legislature .
The workers occupied the plant on February 11 , 2009 .
" We camped outside the plant to avoid the bosses ’ liquidation of the machinery .
And the workers decided to take a direct action , occupy and form a cooperative , " said Eduardo Santillán , a Quilmes textile worker .
With the remaining cotton left in the plant , the workers immediately began to produce cotton thread .
At the time of the firing , more than 80 worked at the plant .
In a common practice for business owners who file bankruptcy despite an increased demand for their product , the owner Ruben Ballani of Febatex owed the workers months of unpaid salaries , unpaid vacation time and social security .
The workers also reported that the owner would force his employees to work 12 hour shifts , a practice outlawed nearly 100 years ago .
Six months after the workers were fired and the union ( Sindicato Textil – AOT ) failed to intervene , the workers at Textil Quilmes started up production .
They claim that the union , who turned their backs on the workers once they were fired , is now negotiating on behalf of the bosses .
The occupations in Argentina continue to rise as the global economic crisis hits the South American nation .
The Arrufat chocolate factory , Disco de Oro empanada pastry manufacturer , Indugraf printing press , Febatex thread producer and Lidercar meat packing plant joined the ranks of the worker occupied factory movement from 2008 to 2009 .
Textil Quilmes has fought along with workers from other factories occupied since the onset of the global economic crisis to demand expropriation laws ; none have a definitive legal future .
Many independent analysts expect the global recession to hit Argentina ’s real economy .
Unemployment rates have gone up and industry growth has halted , while the financial sector remains unaffected because it already took a major blow in 2001 .
Those who benefited from Argentina ’s economic recovery of course are now those who are using this crisis as an excuse to downsize and lay - off workers with the promise of public bailout packages and government credits .
The phenomenon of worker occupations continues to grow as the world falls deeper into the current recession .
Nearly 20 new factories in Argentina were occupied since 2008 .
This may be a sign that workers are confronting the current global financial crisis with lessons and tools from previous worker occupied factories post -2001 economic collapse and popular rebellion .
Today , some 250 worker occupied enterprises are up and running , employing more than 13,000 .
Many of these sites have been producing under worker self - management since 2002 , providing nearly a decade of lessons , experiments , strategies and mistakes to learn from .
Zanon and others from the occupied factory movement have proven that they are capable of doing what bosses are n’t interested in doing : creating jobs and work with dignity .
This may be why government representatives , industry leaders and factory owners have remained silent and often times reacted with hostility on this issue ; they are afraid of these sites multiplying and the example they have set .
At Zanon , workers constantly use the slogan : " Zanon es del pueblo " or Zanon belongs to the people .
The workers have adopted the objective of producing not only to provide jobs and salaries for more than 470 people , but also to create new jobs , make donations in the community and to support other social movements .
For many at the recuperated enterprises , the occupation of their workplace meant much more than safe - guarding their jobs , it also became part of a struggle for a world without exploitation .
While the Zanon victory is a step in the right direction , many of the occupations are facing eviction orders .
FASINPAT can now operate legally and focus their attention to producing ceramics in a faltering economy .
The Zanon collective has expressed their continued commitment to defending workers ’ rights and self - management , which means defending all worker occupations with slogan : " si nos tocan a uno , nos tocan a todos " : " if they mess with one of us , they mess with all of us . "

The Kindle edition books Animal Farm by George Orwell .
Published by MobileReference ( mobi ) & Nineteen Eighty - Four ( 1984 ) by George Orwell .
Published by MobileReference ( mobi ) were removed from the Kindle store and are no longer available for purchase .
When this occurred , your purchases were automatically refunded .
You can still locate the books in the Kindle store , but each has a status of not yet available .
Although a rarity , publishers can decide to pull their content from the Kindle store .
These books were added to our catalog using our self - service platform by a third - party who did not have the rights to the books .
When we were notified of this by the rights holder , we removed the illegal copies from our systems and from customers ' devices , and refunded customers .
We are changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers ' devices in these circumstances .
If you 're into keeping tabs on irony , check this out .
Amazon apparently sent out its robotic droogs last night , deleting copies of the George Orwell novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty - Four from Kindles without explanation , then refunding the purchase price .
As you can imagine , a lot of people caught in the thick of Winston and Julia 's love story are n't very happy -- and rightfully so -- the idea that we " own " the things we buy is pretty fundamental to ... ownership .
We 're not sure exactly what happened , but it seems that the publisher of said novels , MobileReference , has changed its mind about selling content on the Kindle , and poof !
Amazon remotely deleted all previously purchased copies .
It 's all a bit Orwellian , is it not ?
Good thing we " permanently borrowed " hard copies of both from our middle school library , huh ?
Let Hate Week commence .
According to commenters on Amazon , this message was sent out from the company 's customer service department :
While that publisher 's version of the book may have been removed , it appears other versions of the novels are still available . : Drew Herdener , Amazon.com 's Director of Communications , pinged us directly with the following comment , and now things are starting to make a lot more sense .
Seems as if the books were added initially by an outfit that did n't have the rights to the material .
Still , what 's upsetting is the idea that something you 've purchased can be quietly taken back by Amazon with no explanation and no advance notice .
It 's a rotten policy , regardless of the motivations behind this particular move .

In an important step forward for the international Palestine solidarity campaign , the British Trade Union Congress ( equivalent of the ACTU ) has voted to back a boycott of Israeli goods .
After a heated debate at its national conference , the TUC General Council passed a motion calling on the British Government to condemn the Israeli military aggression and the continuing blockade of Gaza , end arms sales to Israel which reached a value of £ 18.8 million in 2008 , and seek EU agreement to impose a ban on the importing of goods produced in the illegal settlements .
Their statement went on : “ To increase the pressure for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories , and the removal of the separation wall and the illegal settlements , we will support a boycott …of those goods and agricultural products that originate in illegal settlements – through developing an effective , targeted consumer - led boycott campaign working closely with the Palestine Solidarity Campaign – and campaign for disinvestment by companies associated with the occupation as well as engaged in building the separation wall . ”
The TUC statement was far from perfect – the final motion was a compromise between left and right – but it is nonetheless highly significant that Britain ’s peak union body would align itself so clearly with the Palestinian cause , and with the growing international boycott campaign .
This is just the latest indicator that an increasing number of organisations and individuals are prepared to take a stand against Israel .
For example the September 25 Palestine protest in Australia was endorsed by the Victorian Trades Hall Council , which passed a motion stating that “ VTHC stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine on this day and their continuing struggle for freedom and human rights . ”
And in the same week as the TUC Congress , hundreds of artists and activists put their names to an open letter to the Toronto International Film Festival objecting to Tel Aviv being chosen as the first of its “ city to city ” showcases .
The letter said that to celebrate Tel Aviv without talking about occupation or this year ’s bloody attack on Gaza is “ like rhapsodising about the beauty and elegant lifestyles in white - only Cape Town or Johannesburg during apartheid without acknowledging the corresponding black townships of Khayelitsha and Soweto .
“ In the wake of this year ’s brutal assault on Gaza , we object to the use of such an important festival to stage a propaganda campaign on behalf of what South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , former US president Jimmy Carter , and UN General Assembly president Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann have all characterised as an apartheid regime . ”
The fact that more and more people are gaining the courage to take a stand indicates that since the Gaza war , the ideological defences of Israel are starting to crack open .
While the apologists for Zionism still hurl accusations of anti-Semitism at anyone who dares to criticise Israel ’s crimes , the baseless nature of such charges is increasingly clear .
The claim that Israel is the victim , or even that blame for the conflict should be shared by both sides , has become untenable in the wake of the Gaza war , a one - sided bloodbath that sickened millions around the world , including in the usually indifferent West .
Support for Israel is increasingly associated ( correctly ) with foul war - mongering and anti-Muslim racism .
It is indicative that skinhead fascist demonstrators in Britain , protesting to kick Muslims out of the country , now carry Israeli flags on their marches .
But while the truth about Israel is becoming clearer to ever wider layers of people , it remains the case that Western governments – in particular the US and Australia – stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel no matter how odious the crimes it carries out .
If anything , the Australian government is even more pro-Israel than the US .
It even went so far in September as to ban SBS from referring to the occupied territories as Palestinian land – a stance that aligns them with the extreme right - wing fringe of Zionism .
On the university campuses , students campaigning for Palestine have met with numerous attempts to stop them from speaking out .
And the mainstream media in Australia is still relentlessly pro-Israel .
This indicates the vital importance of building an ongoing solidarity movement that can combat the right - wing pro-Israel arguments , and establish that solidarity with Palestine is as necessary and as justifiable as it was to oppose the Iraq war , or the apartheid regime in South Africa .

“ I had this dream from childhood of not needing to climb mountains anymore .
I wanted to go to school in my own flying machine . ”
This was the childhood dream of Wu Zhongyuan , of China ’s Henan province .
It is also , quite likely , a childhood dream of most you , dear Gadget Lab readers .
Unlike you , though , Zhongyuan actually did something about it .
He built his own helicopter .
The device , which likely breaks almost every airspace and safety law simultaneously , is made from steel scaffold , has blades cut from Elm and is powered by an old motorcycle engine .
Zhongyuan says that the ‘ copter , which took three months and around $ 1600 to build , can soar to 800 meters ( 2600 feet ) .
We ’re not sure if it can even get airborne , though , as currently the machine is grounded by Chinese authorities .
How did he come up with his ramshackle design ?
The internet , of course .
“ I did n’t have a design .
The only source for me to get relevant knowledge was surfing the internet via my mobile phone , ” he said to news site Ananova .
We love it .
A personal helicopter is a fantastic project , and we wish Zhongyuan luck getting it off the ground .
Of course , we ’d never go near the thing .
Imagine being half a mile up and when the engine cuts out on you .
No thanks .

We have moved from Tier 1 financial intuitions in the US to some of the bigger regional banks failing at a good clip .
This news will probably mark the official end of the US summer equity rally and revive worries over the financial health of other regional banks .
Regulators have closed Colonial BancGroup Inc. ’s banking operations and shut two companies in Arizona , one in Las Vegas and one in Pittsburgh .
That brings the official tally of failed banks this year to 77 !
Colonial was not a minnow either , it had assets of $ 25 b and deposits of about $ 20 b !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœdollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢sÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ summer of discontent is probably over .
Factors favor the greenback to remain coveted by investors .
For an investment reason , probably not , for risk - aversion needs , absolutely .
That being said , there are improving fundamentals in the US which are providing some support for green shoot economics .

Global bourses are giving back their gains at an alarming rate ( retreat is far quick than attack ) , dragging gold and oil lower in tandem .
Perhaps we are beginning to realize that we have got ahead of ourselves again .
We are not arguing that the recession is not over ; just commenting that fair value is probably over - stated !
We are running before we walk .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.46 % , GBP - 1.06 % , CHF - 0.34 % and lower against JPY +0.15 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.94 % and AUD - 1.10 % .
Like a lead weight , the loonie has fallen from grace , dropping for a 2nd - straight week as losses in stocks and commodities overshadowed Canadian fundamental reports that is persuading investors that the recession may be abating .
Despite being the strongest currency last month of all the developed currencies vs. the USD , last week it led the charge lower vs. its Southern partner .
With equities ending their summer rally , look for higher yielding currencies to lead the charge lower !
Last weeks data was mixed , both sales ( +1.9 % ) and trade ( deficit narrowed - $ 55 m ) were a pleasant surprise , but housing starts took some of the shine off some economists optimistic views ( - 4.1 % ) .
The trade gains can be attributed to the double - digit surge in crude exports ( oil had advanced +20.0 % in a month ! ) .
The loonie , like most of the other major currencies rise has been rapid and certainly somewhat overdone in the short term .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s anticipated that weekly oil stocks will once again show an increase which will only further pressurize commodity currencies .
For now , investors are looking to buy USD on pull backs .
Right on cue and inline with other high yielding currencies , the AUD declined the most in 6 - weeks vs. the greenback and 2 - weeks vs. JPY as regional bourses fell the most this year on the back of global confidence numbers and the renewed threat of regional Bank financial failure in the US .
If the US summer equity rally is over , look for investors to want to sell the AUD on rallies ( 0.8185 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 65.84 down - 116 c ) .
Finally , crude is starting to take notice of bearish fundamentals that do not warrant elevated energy prices .
On Friday , oil tumbled just under - 5 % to a 2 - week low , dragging with it gas prices , after a report showed that confidence among US consumers unexpectedly declined this month .
Naturally the market is questioning if fuel demand will rebound this year , already the strength of demand remains suspect .
Last week the IEA raised its oil demand outlook for this year and next on accelerating Chinese industrial activity , but , is it sustainable ?
They have already built a large reserve of commodities .
The EIA reported higher crude inventories last week .
This has certainly capped short term gains !
The data showed that crude stocks in the world ’s largest energy consumer rose by +2.5 m barrels last week , against expectations for just a +700 k build .
The latest data on industrial production for some of the larger countries remains negative and should provide support for further demand destruction .
We are now officially over the hump of the US driving season and just about to enter historically a weak demand month of Sept .
We have technically been subjected to elevated prices for too long .
In reality , we may have seen the worst of this recession , but global growth will remain very subdued .
This certainly does not bode well for any strong rebound in the coming months .
Reality continues to tell us that inventories are high , demand is still really weak and the risk is increasing that we will see a bigger correction towards $ 60 .
Similar to most commodities , the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ pared gains and managed to print new 2 - month lows again this morning as the greenback rallied on weaker confidence numbers , thus eroding the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ sÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appeal as an alternative investment ( $ 939 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,268 down - 328 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,229 down - 80 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,646 down - 67 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year bondÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 11 bp on Friday ( 3.57 % ) and a further 7 bp ( 3.50 % ) in the O/N session .
Treasury prices rose ( largest gain in 8 - months ) , after last weeks US data showed that the cost of living was unchanged and that retail sales surprisingly fell last month , confirming that inflation continues to remain subdued .
All this occurred despite the record quarterly refunding of $ 75 b being issued !

Sure , cars like the Cayenne and even the Panamera are enormous in comparison to the 911 .
But there 's still only so big Porsche can go .
That is , on land at least .
Not one to be told to stick to its core business , Porsche 's design arm has teamed up with a Singapore shipyard to design a state - of - the - art catamaran megayacht .
We first reported on the RFF135 by Porsche Design and Royal Falcon Fleet back when the idea was announced , but now that the project has started to materialize , the two companies have begun releasing details and images .
Worlds apart from the speedboat which Porsche Design penned for Fearless , the RFF135 is a massive twin - hull design measuring 135 feet in length ( hence the name ) with a 41 - foot beam .
That 's enough space to accommodate 10 guests and 10 crew members below decks in 472 square meters of area , with another 208 square meters of deck space up top .
That 's almost unfathomably large , and to propel the vessel up 35 knots ( about 40 mph ) , the catamaran will be equipped with twin V16 turbodiesel engines from German manufacturer MTU , each producing a massive 4,600 horsepower .
Do n't ask about miles per gallon – this puppy will drink down 750 liters of diesel every hour , but at least you 're bound to look damned good doing it , right ?

The Porsche Design Group and Singapore - based megayacht builder Royal Falcon Fleet have reached the first milestone of the construction of the RFF135 .
The first joint project for the two companies , it is a luxurious anomaly on the water : a power catamaran with a length of more than 40 metres .
The outer hull and the interior are in keeping with the functional , timeless and puristic hand of the Porsche Design Studio at Zell am See ( Austria ) , which was responsible for the styling .
The appearance of the RFF135 is particularly extraordinary , as it was conceived as a " spacecraft on the water , " as was requested by the customer .
In this form , the catamaran platform offers completely new possibilities for configuration in exterior and interior design .
Unlike a great number of mega- yachts , the interior was styled in a highly modern way and captures the dynamic contours of the hull .
Its typical Porsche design is unmistakable : Luxurious and functional , it dispenses with floridness and opulence of any kind .
On the contrary , an unadorned design and authentic , premium and comfortable materials constitute the flair of the interior .
The generous impact of its space goes beyond established standards for a 135 - foot ( 41.2 metre ) yacht .
After the successful completion of the development phase , the construction of the hull for the first RFF135 began in September 2008 .
At the end of the year , the hull will be relocated to Sweden , where the technological installations and interior fit - out will be carried out .
Royal Falcon Fleet has engaged the Kockums and the Incat Crowther firms for the construction design of the catamaran .
Kockums , a Swedish subsidiary of Thyssen - Krupp , is known for leading - edge technology in the area of marine technology .
The Australian - based shipbuilding engineers of the Incat Crowther firm have decades of experience in the construction of large power catamarans .
The launch of this first Royal Falcon Fleet power catamaran designed by Porsche Design is planned for the fourthquarter of 2010 .
"
In 1987 , we designed the ' Kineo ' power yacht , an exclusive speedboat , of which there are only three examples worldwide and which drew attention for its characteristic dolphin form , " says Dr. Jürgen Geßler , CEO of Porsche Design Group .
" Our newest project once again demonstrates that our design , outstanding in many ways , is setting trends in numerous fields .
With the first Royal Falcon Fleet yacht , we are building a bridge to the Porsche Design Sport textile collection that was developed specifically for the maritime area . "
" We have now reached an important milestone in mastering this path - breaking project , " says M. A. Zaman , president and CEO of Royal Falcon Fleet .
" Under the guidance of highly qualified experts from Australia , France , Sweden and the U.S. , we are constructing the hull of the RFF135 .
On December 15 , 2009 , it is going from Asia to Sweden , where it will be completed .
And at the end of 2010 , the first Royal Falcon Fleet will be launched – the ultimate luxury experience at sea .
"
In many respects , this project is an anomaly , " says Roland Heiler , executive director of the Porsche Design Studio at Zell am See .
" The sole requirement from Royal Falcon Fleet was to implement contours outside of the stereotypical boat aesthetic .
This gave us considerable creative latitude and the result was a revolutionary design – a real challenge for the ship architects .
This innovative yacht concept quickly drew them into its thrall , however , so that all the participants are now working painstakingly on the realisation of the design .
" Royal Falcon Fleet , a Singapore - based builder of luxury yachts , was founded by a Swedish investor .
The goal of the firm is to develop mega-yachts that stand out for their innovative design , cutting - edge technology , and handcrafted European interiors .
The Porsche Design Group , based in Bietigheim - Bissingen , is a majority - owned subsidiary of Porsche AG in Stuttgart .
The activities of the company are concentrated on the company divisions Porsche Design , Porsche Design Driver 's Selection and the Porsche Design Studio at Zell am See in Austria .
The Porsche Design Studio at Zell am See , Austria , stands for the clear , timeless , unmistakable design signature that distinguishes all products of the Porsche Design Group .
Moreover , the studio also handles industrial and product design for other companies .
The Porsche Design Studio is one of the most renowned design houses in Europe .

The Renault team and its boss Flavio Briatore have begun criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Junior and Nelson Piquet Senior following an alleged attempt " to blackmail " the French squad .
Renault is facing allegations of race - fixing after Piquet Jr told the FIA saying he had been asked to crash during the Singapore Grand Prix in order to benefit team - mate Fernando Alonso .
Briatore denied the accusations as " outrageous lies " and threatened with legal action , a threat that materialised on Friday , when Renault announced it had begun criminal proceedings against Piquet and his father .
" The FIA has announced that it is to hold an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council ( ' WMSC ' ) on 21 September 2009 , " said Renault in a statement .
" The ING Renault F1 Team is to attend that meeting and answer allegations that members of the team conspired with Nelson Piquet Jnr to cause a deliberate accident at the 2008 Singapore GP , so that Fernando Alonso might benefit from the resulting safety car .
" The ING Renault F1 Team had not commented publicly during the FIA 's initial investigation into this matter .
" However , today the ING Renault F1 Team and its Managing Director Flavio Briatore personally , wish to state that they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Junior and Nelson Piquet Senior in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jnr to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season .
" The matter will also be referred to the Police in the UK . "
ZiiLabs formerly 3D Labs – A Creative company , has unveiled a new mobile computer that ’s like an Android - based iPod Touch .
It is the most High - end Android Mobile w have seen till date .
It supports advanced 3D and outputs full high - definition ( HD ) video — but it ’s currently available only to developers .
Zii Egg StemCell Computer is , at present , essentially a showcase for ZiiLabs ’ innovative chip architecture , which runs either its own open Linux - based OS , dubbed Plaszma , or an “ optimized ” Android to exploit ZiiLabs ’ processor technology .
They call their technology Stem - Cell Computing
The Egg ’s specifications are very impressive :
• 3.5 ” 320×480 capactive 10 - point multi - touch display
• Up to 32 Gbytes internal NAND flash
• 256 Mbytes RAM
• Support for 1080 p HD output via HD Cable
• Two cameras : a forward facing VGA cam , and a rear - facing high def camera
• 802.11b/g Wi -Fi , and Bluetooth 2.1 + Enhanced Data Rate
• Hardware GPS receiver with antenna
• 3 - axis accelerometer
• Full - size SDHC slot , which can take a corresponding card with up to 32 Gbytes of storage
• Support for OpenGL ES , an open standard for embedded 2D and 3D graphics
All of that is packed into a case that ’s 4.53 x 2.4 x 0.47 inches , and weighs just 3.8 ounces .
That ’s just slightly longer and thicker than Apple ’s iPod Touch , but about 8/10 ths of an ounce lighter .
The Egg also comes with the Opera Mobile 9.7 Web browser .
Many of those are features “ not yet found on any Android device , ” notes Gareth Myles , site editor with MobileTechAddicts .
“ Overall , it appears to top any Android gadget that has been officially announced . ”
One of the biggest weaknesses of the Android platform is the current lack of advanced 3D support and games , which has nicely been overcome by this device .
what ’s Bad – Both the Egg lacks a cellular radio , so there are no cellular voice calls , just like iTouch .
And it seems equally straightforward to add a cellular chipset to the Egg.
ZiiLab ’s support for the Android smartphone OS is intended to make that addition attractive and feasible .
The Egg ships with the Plaszma software —
An optimized version of Android can be loaded onto it , and the company plans to release shortly an “ after - sales installer upgrade ” to make that possible .
As an introductory offer , a 32 G byte model of the Zii Egg is bundled free with the just - released development package , which includes the Plaszma OS , the companion SDK , and the optimized Android OS .
The starter kit is $ 399 .
Android was tweaked to exploit the core ZiiLabs applications processor , an ARM - based system on a chip , dubbed the ZMS - 05 module .
The module ’s dual - core ARM subsystem handles most of the routine chores .
But a separate “ media processing array ” handles all the 2D , 3D , video , digital signal processing and similar tasks .
According to the company press release , this array consists of 24 floating point processors , with a total raw processing power of 8 GFLOPS .
The company ’s “ stem cell ” architecture refers to the fact that the chip module can rearrange these processors as needed for specific tasks , pulling in additional processors , or releasing them , as the type and amount of work changes .
The ZMS - 05 modules will start volume shipments in September with a starting per-unit price of $ 75 .

Civil society will have to provide unrelenting leadership if global carbon emissions are to peak in less than 10 years and go ‘ negative ’ , experts say .
By Stephen Leahy
UXBRIDGE , Canada , Jan 15 2009 ( IPS )
Global emissions of carbon dioxide must reach a peak in less than 10 years and then begin a rapid decline to nearly zero by 2050 to avoid catastrophic disruption to the world ’s climate , according to a new report .
Emissions of carbon dioxide will actually need to “ go negative ” – with more being absorbed than emitted – during the second half of this century , according to “ State of the World 2009 : Into a Warming World ” released by the U.S. - based Worldwatch Institute this week .
“ 2009 is a pivotal year to deal with climate change , ” said Christopher Flavin , president of well - respected Worldwatch Institute ( WI ) , a U.S. - based environmental think tank .
“ Humanity will face grave danger if we do n’t move forward now , ” Flavin told IPS .
Climate change is happening faster and with larger impacts than previously predicted , concludes the 26th annual “ State of the World ” report , devoted entirely to the challenges and opportunities of global climate change .
Even an additional warming of 2 degrees Celsius poses unacceptable risks to key natural and human systems , warned climate scientist W.L.
Hare , one of the report ’s 47 contributors .
Two degrees C. has long been the European Union ’s hoped for target to stabilise the climate .
But Hare ’s research and that of others shows that 2C could cause significant loss of species , major reductions in food - production capacity in developing countries , severe water stress for hundreds of millions of people , and significant sea - level rise and coastal flooding .
“ We need a very big step forward on a new international climate agreement this year , ” said Flavin

The Canadian Press
TORONTO - A lawyer who rose through the ranks of the Ontario government to become a prominent cabinet minister and went on to a high - profile role selling Toronto to investors was charged Tuesday with criminal negligence causing the death of a bicycle courier who fell from a moving vehicle .
Michael Bryant , a former attorney general considered by many political observers to have the right stuff for a run at the premier 's job , was also charged with dangerous operation of a vehicle in the incident that played out Monday in front of horrified witnesses in the city 's upscale Yorkville district .
A source close to the former minister told The Canadian Press that Bryant and his wife , Susan Abramovitch , were driving home after a quiet evening dinner to celebrate their 12th anniversary .
After being charged , a forlorn - looking Bryant , a 43 - year - old lawyer known for his energetic tenacity , emerged from a city police station after spending the night in custody to briefly to face the media spotlight which he once eagerly sought in his political career .
" May I ask for your understanding in not making a full statement today or taking your questions on last night 's tragic events , " Bryant said as his lawyer stood by .
" At an appropriate moment , I will of course speak to you . "
He then extended his " deepest condolences to the family involved " and offered thanks to those who had offered their support before leaving .
Police did not identify the 33 - year - old victim , but a woman at Toronto 's Action Messenger confirmed the death of Darcy Allan ( Al ) Sheppard , who was also an amateur comedian .
Police said they had contact with Sheppard barely on hour before his death , when his ex-girlfriend called police just after 9 p.m. and told them Sheppard was at her home and refused to leave .
Officers arrived and escorted him away , said Const .
Tony Vella , adding there were no allegations of criminal activity such as assault and there was no indication he was intoxicated .
Toronto police Sgt. Tim Burrows said Bryant had not been drinking and was being released under unspecified conditions on his own recognizance pending a court appearance Oct. 19 .
Bryant had " absolutely not " received any special treatment , Burrows said .
Criminal negligence causing death carries a maximum sentence of life in prison , while dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death carries a maximum 14 - year term .
The incident took place on bustling Bloor Street between Bay Street and Avenue Road , a popular area of restaurants , hotels and high - end jewelry and clothing stores .
Tips from those who claim to have seen what happened poured in to police .
According to information obtained by officers , an altercation occurred between a driver and a cyclist that ended in a minor collision .
" The cyclist that was involved in the collision then approached the driver of the motor vehicle and grabbed hold of the vehicle , " Burrows said .
" The driver at that time proceeded west . . . with the cyclist attached to the vehicle who , at this time , was to all intents and purposes a pedestrian , until he fell off . "
Police responded to a call at 9:50 p.m. and Sheppard was taken to hospital , where he died of severe injuries .
The death came as a blow to the biking community in a city where tensions between cyclists and motorists are ever present .
" We 're all in a daze , " a courier who identified himself as Craig said at a downtown Toronto courier hangout .
Many said they knew Sheppard personally .
" He was always very happy , very helpful and very professional , " said Barry Ridley , who at 55 years old has been a courier for 39 years .
" He always helped everybody and anybody .
If a woman had a bag that was too heavy , he would get off his bike and carry it to her office . "
Ridley said it would take a lot for Sheppard to get angry .
" I saw him that morning and he was so calm , collected and full of laughter and asking me for new jokes he could use on his improv , " he said .
However , Craig described Sheppard as someone who could be hotheaded at times .
" But it does n't matter how hotheaded you are , " he said .
" You do n't deserve to be dragged behind a car for several blocks . "
" Ugly indeed , " read one comment posted to the chat forum BikingToronto.com -- a small sample of the torrent of reaction on cycling sites .
" I 'm reserving full judgment until more details come to light , " writes the blogger , posting under the name Scarr .
" In any event , this should never have escalated to the point that it did . "
Police , who said Bryant made one of many 911 calls they received , " was not in any way trying to evade or elude our investigation . "
A woman who was in the car -- identified by the source as Bryant 's wife -- also called 911 , police said .
Officers , who were also in possession of surveillance video , were still interviewing witnesses and asking for any others to come forward .
Intelligent , energetic and articulate , Bryant stood out from other politicians , said Bryan Evans , a politics professor at Ryerson University .
" He 's got a rare combination of talents which in political life really come together and allow someone to shine , " he said .
But those qualities also " clearly annoyed " some people , including Premier Dalton McGuinty , he said .
Bryant had long been considered a top contender to succeed the premier , and observers believe it was McGuinty 's decision to stay on for the 2011 election that ultimately prompted Bryant to strike out on his own .
On Tuesday , McGuinty said the investigation should be allowed to take its course .
" It 's just very sad , " McGuinty said .
" It is very tragic how events that unfold inside a minute can have such a profound impact on people 's lives , negative impact . "
Bryant , an outspoken public figure who represented a downtown Toronto riding , was attorney general , aboriginal affairs minister and minister of economic development following the McGuinty Liberals ' win in October 2003 .
As attorney general , he was responsible for strict laws against street racing and drunk driving .
Bryant also banned pit bulls and , most recently , helped handle the province 's response to the collapse of the province 's domestic auto industry .
Bryant left provincial politics in May to accept a position with Invest Toronto , a new corporation whose mandate is to attract investment to the city .
In a statement , Toronto Mayor David Miller , who is also chairman of Invest Toronto , expressed his condolences to Sheppard 's family and friends but refused further comment in light of the criminal case against Bryant .
Let ’s talk about WSGI
Recently Armin Ronacher ( whose blog you should be reading if you do anything at all involving Python and the web ) has published a couple of good articles poking at the current state of WSGI , the standard interface for Python web applications .
Some of his comments dovetail nicely into concerns I ’ve been trying to put into words for a while now , so I ’m glad he ’s posting on the subject and providing some context .
In short , I ’ve come to have some rather severe misgivings about WSGI — both as currently constituted and as it ’s likely to be in the future — which break down into three areas :
As an interface for Python applications to speak HTTP , WSGI leaves quite a lot to be desired .
As an interface for Python web developers to implement and work with , WSGI is antiquated and frustrating .
As an interface for composing useful functionality from the various Python web components , WSGI is far from sufficient .
So .
Allow me to explain .
HTTP is hard , let ’s go shopping !
My biggest gripe with WSGI from an HTTP standpoint is simply that it seems to have a track record of muddling or outright punting on some of the more interesting / complex features of HTTP .
One simple example is the common optimization of compressing ( via gzip ) the outgoing HTTP response , which usually provides a significant boost in performance as seen by end users of web applications .
WSGI seems at first to forbid applications from applying this optimization :
Note : applications and middleware must not apply any kind of Transfer - Encoding to their output , such as chunking or gzipping ; as “ hop - by - hop ” operations , these encodings are the province of the actual web server / gateway .
But gzipping of the response body is indicated by the Content - Encoding header , which per the HTTP spec is not a “ hop - by - hop ” header .
So is a WSGI application or middleware allowed to gzip an outgoing response body ?
I wish I knew .
Django ships an optional middleware class which applies gzipping to suitable outgoing responses .
The Pylons book provides a detailed example of how to write a WSGI middleware for gzipping and seems to encourage its use .
And I know there are other implementations of this feature in the wild .
But I have a sneaking suspicion that WSGI intends to forbid this feature to any part of the stack other than the server , which would greatly diminish its utility ( applications and middlewares are far more likely to have access to information which lets them make reliable judgments about when to apply gzipping , while servers can only apply some relatively blind heuristics ) .
Meanwhile , chunked transfer — which does involve an actual hop - by - hop header — is clearly forbidden , even though HTTP handles it just fine and it ’s an integral part of certain techniques for long - polling ( e.g. , Comet ) applications .
As such , the spec basically derails the idea of building those types of applications within WSGI .
When I mentioned this in passing in a thread on the Python web - sig list it was suggested that servers could simply look for certain signs that a response should be chunked , but that ’s insufficient : for one thing , it requires the server to make guesses about what the application author meant to do .
For another , it presupposes that any middlewares involved in the request / response cycle will implement the same heuristics and avoid attempts to consume the response body ( since it ’s likely that the response body will be some sort of iterable which can only be consumed once , or which poses a threat of prohibitive resource use or a gateway timeout if consumed all in one go ) .
If WSGI applications could use the Transfer - Encoding header we ’d have an easy way to signal this to servers and middlewares , and although the implementation still would n’t be simple it would at least have the capability to be much more reliable .
Django currently has several open tickets related to this very issue , and I would n’t be surprised if other libraries and frameworks face similar problems .
For one final example I ’ll pick on a genuinely hard problem which I ’ll be harping on again in a bit : character encoding .
The WSGI spec impresses upon its readers ( or upon this reader , at least ) the overwhelming desire for everybody to just quiet down and use ISO - 8859 - 1 instead of whatever character set is actually convenient .
Although it does go so far as to mimic HTTP ’s ability to use MIME - encoding for non -latin - 1 characters , its requirements regarding string types then go on to place heavy burdens not only on Python implementations which have native Unicode strings , but also on applications which might want to do useful things like , say , implement a subclass of str which knows whether it needs to be HTML - escaped or not ( which bit Django when we implemented auto - escaping ; the “ solution ” is a throwaway upcast to str to satisfy the WSGI spec ’s overzealous type checking ) .
Problems like these leave me with the feeling that WSGI simply is n’t up to the job of providing Python ’s “ one obvious way to do ” HTTP .
Welcome to 1997
Meanwhile , as an interface for programmers to actually implement and work with in their applications , WSGI feels like nothing so much as a blast from the past , and is designed from the ground up to give this impression .
The original standard for web programming was , of course , CGI , and its programming model looked like this :
The server sets up an environment containing variables which indicate various aspects of the request .
The server invokes the CGI program in that environment .
The server passes the request body ( if any ) to the program on standard input .
The program uses the CGI environment variables and the standard input ( if any ) to figure out what to do .
The program spits the status line and headers to standard output , followed by a separator , followed by the response body .
The server reads this and turns it into an HTTP response back to the client .
WSGI ’s programming model , meanwhile , is as follows :
The server sets up a dictionary — called environ — containing keys which indicate various aspects of the request .
The server invokes the WSGI application ( a Python callable ) , passing it the environ .
The server provides the application with a callable to use to signal the return status and headers .
The application uses the WSGI environ to figure out what to do .
The application spits the status line and headers out through the supplied callable , then begins yielding the response body .
The server reads this and turns it into an HTTP response back to the client .
The parallels here are deliberate : at heart , WSGI is CGI , and this is allegedly a good thing .
But it means that WSGI inherits a collection of pathological edge cases , and lays them all squarely at the application author ’s feet .
If there were a good , solid , standard implementation of WSGI request parsing that everybody used ( say , in a module in the Python standard library ) , this would n’t be as big a problem .
But the reference implementation of WSGI is incomplete , and the bits of the standard library which would obviously supplement it have issues ( once again , Armin provides useful explanations ) .
In a way , WSGI has been a victim of its own success .
It ’s been so heavily promoted as an easy and standard way to implement Python web applications that many developers have simply jumped in head - first and rolled their own solutions , which often turn out to be incomplete or incorrect : the intersection of HTTP , web server quirks , CGI backwards - compatibility and the Python standard library is full of “ fun ” situations which make the development of solid , reliable WSGI stacks far more complex and subtle than the marketing materials would have you believe .
The result is that while there are a few good ( as in , mostly complete and free of major bugs ) implementations , most people are n’t using them .
And even if people tried to use them , dependencies between third - party Python packages are a whole ‘ nother world of pain .
But that ’s really just the tip of the iceberg .
WSGI ’s insistence on the CGI programming model , for example , means that non-trivial WSGI stacks have to burn a lot of cycles doing useless work , since every application and every middleware in the chain has to do its own parsing of the environ when invoked .
Parsing once and handing the result down the stack is not how WSGI is meant to work .
WSGI ’s curious insistence on compatibility with CGI also means that , here in 2009 , the Python web - development world still has n’t been able to significantly improve on 1997 ’s application programming model .
Various libraries and frameworks have implemented useful , normalized abstractions and simpler object - oriented API s for HTTP requests and responses , but adherence to WSGI rules out ( in the practical sense that arbitrary WSGI components ca n’t be relied on to have any knowledge of these abstractions or APIs ) meaningful reuse and interoperability .
As a result , the only thing we can really count on is an interface that ’s so low - level and complex that the first thing most people do is try to hide it under something easier to work with .
And , of course , character encoding rears its ugly head again .
WSGI requires that ( in Python 2.x ) everything be of type str or StringType .
In other words , bytestrings .
I ’ve heard that some popular libraries and frameworks do their best to handle encoding quirks and just let application authors deal with Unicode ( translating to / from bytestrings at the boundaries ) , but once again it ’s something that has to be handled repetitively and independently at each point in the processing chain .
Current discussion on the future of WSGI seems to be favoring a continuation of this “ feature ” into Python 3.x , where it will grow from being incredibly annoying to being downright dangerous , since Python 3.x does not allow you to be as promiscuous about mixing Unicode and bytes as Python 2.x .
The result , if implemented , is likely to be lots of preventable type errors and lots of subtler , hard - to - diagnose problems resulting from the mismatch of a Unicode - based string type and incompatible byte - based WSGI environments .
You got framework in my gateway interface !
Finally , WSGI simply cannot live up to what ’s expected of it in terms of providing an interface which allows arbitrary Python web components to be interoperable enough to compose useful applications .
While this is not technically a goal of WSGI — which aims simply to provide a way for Python applications to speak HTTP — it ’s become something of a major focus in the last couple of years .
Given that the same thing seems to be happening elsewhere ( e.g. , with Ruby and Rack ) , I suspect there ’s a corollary to Zawinski’s Law at work here : every gateway interface expands until it looks sort of like a framework API .
The problem is that WSGI is n’t and never will be a framework API , and attempts to use it in place of one are pretty much doomed to eternal complication .
One obvious issue is that the only way to add additional processing in WSGI is by introducing middlewares between the server and the application , creating a sort of onion - skin model where a request passes from the server , through one or more layers of middleware , finally arriving at the application which emits a response , which goes back through the middlewares and out to the server .
This sounds like a workable model , but it really is n’t , and Django has learned that lesson the hard way : we have an onion - skin middleware system , and it ’s resulted in things which are one logical unit of functionality being broken up into separate physical chunks of code because otherwise you get into catch - 22 situations where there ’s no one order of middlewares that will do what you want ( e.g. , Middleware A needs to be invoked before Middleware B in both request and response processing ) .
This is , I think , why some sort of “ lifecycle ” method API is a frequent request for WSGI .
Having an officially - blessed way to write some code and insert it at a precise point in the processing chain would be incredibly useful and open up a lot of functionality that ’s either difficult or impossible to obtain right now .
A deeper issue is that the only official way for servers , middlewares and applications to communicate with each other is by passing around the WSGI environ ( on the incoming request ) or the HTTP headers ( on the outgoing response ) .
This opens up a couple nasty cans of worms :
If middlewares or applications pass information by mutating the environ or headers , we face a haphazard situation where different components can unknowingly trample on each other ’s information by making successive changes to the same keys .
If middlewares or applications pass information by adding keys to the environ or adding new headers , we avoid the trampling issue but now have to tightly couple middlewares and applications in order to make sure everything knows which additional keys or headers to look for and what they mean .
Trying to go outside WSGI by setting up side channels does n’t help with either of these problems .
And the only other solution seems to be monkeypatching ( for example , if a middleware wants to signal to some component that it should enter a non -default or debugging mode , it could reach in and directly tweak some bit of the relevant code ) , but that ’s a “ solution ” that ’s likely to be worse than the problem .
What to do ?
Unfortunately , I do n’t think any of these problems have simple solutions .
An easier - said - than - done summary corresponding to my main bullet points might be :
Make WSGI a more thorough implementation of HTTP .
Develop a complete , correct and efficient implementation of the relevant bits and get them in the standard library .
Get smart people from all the frameworks in a room together and hammer out some standards , IETF - style , from things that are known to work in the real world .
Of course , I could be completely wrong about all of this , and if I am I ’m sure someone will helpfully point that out or offer alternate ideas .
So if you ’ve got ‘em , fire away :)
Coming into 2009 Michael Young was a shortstop in decline moving to a corner infield position .
He still has value as a shortstop , but many expected his value to collapse for 2010 and beyond .
Pablo Sandoval was a sleeper coming into 2009 with the potential for catcher eligibility .
He has yet to get his five games at catcher , but has supplied very good numbers at the corner infield positions in his first full year .
How similar are this weeks clones and what can their differences tell us ?
Name GP AB R HR RBI SB CS K % BB % BABIP HR / F P/ PA Micheal Young 99 400 58 16 47 7 2 16.50 % 8.30 % 0.356 14.20 % 3.7 Pablo Sandoval 98 403 44 16 63 4 2 15.40 % 6.80 % 0.347 16.20 % 3.4
Michael Young
Moving to third base made Young a forgotten player this year .
He has never had an OPS over .900 in his career , getting to .899 in his 2005 season .
That was also the last time he topped 20 homers .
Since that year his power has dropped and his strikeout rate has gone from 13 percent to 16.5 percent .
His ability to hit line drives has always been one of his better skills , with a career line drive rate of 24.9 percent .
This drives a .341 BABIP , which allows him to maintain a .350 career OBP even though his walk rate is not elite .
Unfortunately BABIP fluctuations from season to season lead to drops in his OBP and has limited his run totals .
He has averaged 99 runs in per 162 games in his career .
While his runs totals are limited , his five category numbers have been extremely consistent .
His production is great at shortstop , but at third you need more than an above average , five category guy .
You need a power bat .
His return to his 2005 level of production has made him a viable option again .
He wo n’t be an RBI option , even with 20 - plus homers this year since he bats in the two and three slots in the lineup , but he can be a solid fpir category guy at the hot corner .
Defense is n’t usually a big factor in fantasy decision , but poor defense forced Young to move to third .
So far it has worked out , but his defense at third has been poor as well .
He has a - 13.9 UZR / 150 so far at third this year and a career - 13.5 UZR / 150 at short stop .
With the money owed he is n’t going to the bench and his offense this year has more than made up for this , but if the offense falls up his playing time could be troublesome going forward .
Pablo Sandoval
MLB : JUL 26 Giants at Rockies
July 26 , 2009 : Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval during a regular season game between the San Francisco Giants and the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field in Denver , Colorado .
The Rockies beat the Giants 4 - 2 . ( Icon / SMI )
So many saw Sandoval as the huge sleeper who could get catcher eligibility by the end of May .
Someone who could hit .300 and with 20 homers at catcher is always a valuable commodity , but there was concern that he might not play enough at catcher .
He likely wo n’t get the two games he still needs to get eligibility in most leagues this year and is unlikely to play as a catcher in the future .
Surprisingly , he has remained valuable , with a line of .324/.372/.551 so far this year .
The contact numbers look very much like Young ’s so far .
He makes good contact and could use some work on his walk rate , but his solid BABIP has helped make him a .300 hitter .
His power is still growing , but as a groundball hitter he will have trouble topping 30 homers in AT&T Park .
He has a groundball rate of 46.9 percent this year , which is very similar to Michael Young ’s career rate of 45.3 percent .
Sandoval wo n’t be leaving San Francisco any time soon , but playing in the NL West has to limit his power numbers .
Sandoval has become a fan favorite this year and looks like an established member of the Giants lineup for the next four to five years .
He has a body that might not age very well — he has been called “ 22 going on 30 ” by Dave Cameron — but has earned him the nickname “ Kung Fu Panda . ”
Conclusion
They may look alike this year statistically , but Sandoval has the better chance to maintain his numbers and value worthy of a third basemen .
Young is going to be a very risky pick next year at third base , while Sandoval should be a solid top 10 option .
For the rest of 2009 though , they look fairly equal , with Young getting more runs and Sandoval getting more RBIs .

The service is used to send alerts to communities and corporations
A Texas - based firm is suing the micro-blogging site Twitter , alleging that its three patents for a similar service are being infringed .
TechRadium 's system , called Iris , provides notification technology so that alerts can be sent to many users .
Alerts can be sent to a number of devices , including mobiles .
The firm claims several organisations may choose to use the free Twitter service instead of paying for Iris , resulting in lost revenue .
Clients using the Iris system include the US army and a number of corporations and municipal organisations .
The three patents outline an " author interface " for distributing alerts and messages from a single sender to many recipients .
This " from one to many " ethos is the cornerstone of Twitter 's model .
TechRadium 's complaint claims that Twitter " intentionally , knowingly , and with " callous disregard " , infringed on the firm 's patents .
TechRadium 's federal lawsuit is claiming for unspecified damages and a permanent injunction against Twitter .
The lust for power , which of all human vices was found in its most concentrated form in the Roman people as a whole , first established its victory in a few powerful individuals , and then crushed the rest of an exhausted country beneath the yoke of slavery .
For when can that lust for power in arrogant hearts come to rest until , after passing from one office to another , it arrives at sovereignty ?
Now there would be no occasion for this continuous progress if ambition were not all - powerful ; and the essential context for ambition is a people corrupted by greed and sensuality .
And could we use the Internet and Twitter to persuade General Mills to give this a try ?
But given that Wheaties sales have been slipping ( they 've declined 14 percent over the past year ) , here 's what I wonder : could Wheaties as a brand be reinvigorated if those bright orange boxes started celebrating achievements of the brain , as well as the body ?
Would parents feel better about buying a breakfast cereal that inspired their children to become rocket scientists , disease - battling chemists , life - saving biomedical engineers , or billionaire software designers ?
Ever since the 1930s , the front of the Wheaties box has featured a parade of notable athletes , from Lou Gehrig to Jesse Owens to Mary Lou Retton to Michael Jordan .
Over the decades , the Breakfast of Champions has exclusively celebrated achievement on the baseball diamond or in the stadium .
What do those two things have to do with one another ?
Two things are happening this week : those of us with kids are sending them back to school , and General Mills is introducing a new variety of Wheaties cereal called Wheaties Fuel , aimed at men .
Wheaties , invented in 1922 , occupy a significant spot in American culture .
Accomplishing something meaningful in the world of sports , we all know , is likely to land you on the front of the Wheaties box .
It is of course important to encourage our kids to participate in sports .
But the career goal of making a living as a professional athlete is statistically improbable for most of them .
Why not present them with other kinds of champions as role models ?
I 'd like to see a Wheaties box featuring Sally Ride , the first American woman in space ( who also happened to be an astrophysicist and Stanford PhD ) ; Internet pioneers Tim Berners - Lee and Vint Cerf ; the great primatologist Jane Goodall ; cognitive scientist Steven Pinker ; Regina Benjamin , a physician who works in rural Alabama ( and who last year won a MacArthur " genius " grant ) ; Tesla Motors engineer JB Straubel ; Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus ; robotics pioneer and entrepreneur Helen Greiner ; Herbert Boyer , who co-founded Genentech and helped bring the first biotech drug to market ; Dean Kamen , a prolific inventor of medical devices and technologies for the developing world ( not to mention the Segway scooter ) ; or Kim Ung - young , a Korean who has the highest recorded IQ of any living person .
And what about younger smarties , like the winner of the Scripps National Spelling Bee , the Intel Science Talent Search , or the Lemelson - MIT Prize , or the top student teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition or the Global Green Challenge ?
The back of these boxes might explain a little bit about the accomplishments of the person ( or people ) featured on the front .
Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers , the founders of the FIRST Robotics Competition , like to talk about " changing the culture " of this country , so that we honor achievements in science , engineering , and technology as often as we honor achievements in sports .
Why not start in the cereal aisle ?
Rather than simply launching a brand extension like Wheaties Fuel , I 'm suggesting that Wheaties could reach an entirely new customer base : kids who enjoy intellectual challenges as much as sports -- and parents who want to get their kids thinking about doing something for a living other than dunking a basketball .
Are you with me ?
If so , here are a couple things you can do :
- Post a comment below in support of the idea .
Perhaps you 'll mention an intellectual champion or two you 'd like to see on the front of a Wheaties box .
- Share your support of this idea on Twitter , along with a link to this blog post ... and use the tag #wheaties in your tweet .
- Spread the idea any other way you can think of .
- Send General Mills an e-mail , perhaps with a link to this blog post ( let 's dub this a " Product Issue . " )
And if you disagree with me , feel free to post a comment about that too .
If we succeed with this project , perhaps next we can persuade a certain theme park operator to start awarding free trips to Nobel Prize winners , not just athletes : " Professor Shimomura :
You 've just won the Nobel Prize in chemistry .
What are you going to do next ? "
" I 'm going to Disney World ! "
“ Sin taxes ” on cigarettes have turned out to be the most effective weapon in the campaign to reduce smoking .
Why not try it on Flamin ’ Hot Cheetos , vanilla Coke and Twinkies ?
With increasing vigor , public health experts and think tanks are calling for extra taxes on foods and drinks that are heavy in calories and light on nutrition .
New York Gov. David Paterson proposed an 18 % soda tax last year as a budget - balancing measure , only to abandon it three months later in the face of stiff public opposition .
Lawmakers in at least five other states have gone on the record in support of the idea .
Junk - food taxes are often mentioned as a way to help fund a restructuring of the healthcare system , though no one in Congress has endorsed them .
The notion is catching on with the general public , however .
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month found that 55 % of respondents favored a tax on unhealthful snack foods , up from 52 % in April .
Support for a soda tax rose to 53 % from 46 % .
And 63 % of those who opposed the idea said they would change their minds if the revenue were used to fund healthcare reform and combat health problems related to obesity .
A report this summer from the Urban Institute said such taxes are needed to ensure that rising obesity rates do n’t cause the average American life expectancy to fall for the first time in history .
“ We are killing 100,000 people per year , so something needs to get done , ” said University of Virginia pediatric cardiologist Arthur Garson , one of the study ’s authors .
Many citizens object to such “ nanny state ” attempts at social engineering .
“ This is the most ridiculous idea I ’ve heard , ” said Kellie Glass , a registered dietitian in Ashland , Ky. , who does n’t care to be penalized for indulging in ice cream now and then .
“ Folks are just not going to give up all the foods they love , even if they are more expensive . ”
Junk - food taxes are also unfair , because the poor would be hardest hit , said fiction writer Julie Cochrane of Marshall , Va. : “ I am not about to raise taxes on a single mom scraping by on a low - wage job . ”
Still , the logic of a junk - food tax seems clear .
Fattening foods tend to be cheap , and fresh produce and lean cuts of meat are often the priciest .
A tax could help offset that imbalance , nudging people to eat more of what they should and less of what they should n’t .
“ This seems an absolute no - brainer to me , ” said Kelly Brownell , director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University who has long promoted such taxes .
But research suggests it ’s hardly that simple .
To make a significant dent in escalating rates of obesity , taxes would have to be steep and widespread .
Two - thirds of states now impose a modest soft - drink tax -- the average rate is 5.2 % -- and though the taxes are linked to a drop in body weight , the difference is extremely slight : about 3 ounces for a 5 - foot - 10 , 279 - pound person .
Taxes on foods such as candy bars and microwave popcorn are even less effective , according to available data .
There ’s even evidence that such taxes can have the perverse effect of increasing consumption of fatty or salty foods .
There are reasons why taxes curb smoking but might have little effect on obesity .
Raise the cigarette tax , and smokers can either pay up or quit .
Raise the tax on sugar - sweetened colas , however , and customers can switch to sports drinks or punch , which often contain even more calories .
Moreover , tobacco taxes apply to all products you can legally smoke .
Junk - food taxes are less logical .
A 5.5 % snack tax in Maine , for instance , covered blueberry muffins and fresh - baked apple pies , but not English muffins or frozen pies .
Tobacco taxes are also much higher than anything likely to be adopted for food and beverages .
Slapping a 10 % tax on a $ 1.50 - bottle of Coke would raise the price a mere 15 cents -- not enough to persuade most shoppers to drink Diet Coke instead .
Many calorie - laden foods are simply too cheap to be priced out of the market by any but the most draconian of taxes .
Studies mostly bear this out .
Several economic studies based on the effects of actual price increases have concluded that a 10 % tax on sodas , sports drinks and fruit juice cocktails would prompt consumers to reduce consumption by 8 % to 11 % .
Some studies found that price hikes motivated people to switch to drinks such as milk , coffee and tea -- changes that in theory could reduce weight .
How meaningful is an 8 % to 11 % cutback ?
A clinical trial of 810 adults in May found that reducing soda intake by 100 calories a day was linked to half a pound of weight loss after 18 months .
Other studies failed to match those modest results .
For example , a trio of economists analyzed 16 years of U.S. household health data to study the feasibility of using a soft - drink tax to help Americans lose weight .
In a 2008 paper , the researchers calculated that a 1 - percentage - point increase in the tax would reduce the average body mass index by just 0.003 units .
In other words , an overweight person with a BMI of 27 would end up with a BMI of 26.997 -- still well short of the 20 - 25 range considered healthy .
Even a soft - drink tax increase of 20 percentage points would n’t help much , because soda accounts for only 7 % of calories in the American diet .
Taxes on snack foods are likely to be even less effective .
A team from the U.S. Department of Agriculture contemplated a tax on salty foods such as cheese puffs and pretzels .
But unless the tax topped 10 % , it would translate into much less than 1 pound of weight loss a year , the researchers reported in 2004 .
A 2007 paper titled “ Cheap Donuts and Expensive Broccoli ” used federal data to predict the effect of a 100 % tax on all high - fat and low - nutrient foods .
It concluded that even this unrealistically high tax would ultimately reduce BMIs by less than 0.2 points .
The experience of Maine ’s 5.5 % snack tax is particularly discouraging .
Enacted to help close a budget gap , it lasted 10 years before it was repealed under pressure from angry voters .
Despite the price hike on such items as ice cream , hot cocoa , cake , cookies and pudding , Maine ’s adult obesity rate doubled from 10 % to 20 % while the tax was in effect .
The flip side of taxing junk food is subsidizing healthful foods .
The Department of Agriculture has calculated that cutting prices of fruits and vegetables by 10 % would increase consumption by 6 % to 7 % .
In the Changing Individuals ’ Purchase of Snacks -- or CHIPS -- study , Minnesota researchers cut prices in half for low - fat snacks in 55 high school and office vending machines .
Sales nearly doubled , the researchers reported in 2001 .
In another experiment , cafeteria sales of fruit and salad tripled when prices were cut in half .
In a third , a half - off sale on fruit boosted purchases by a factor of four .
California public schools began removing soda from vending machines in 2004 , but it ’s unclear whether students are any thinner -- especially because the machines still sell sports drinks that contain almost as much sugar , said Gail Woodward - Lopez , associate director of the UC Berkeley Center for Weight and Health .
Still , experts caution that government attempts to influence diet could have unexpected results -- especially when taxes are involved .
A 2007 British study used government data on household diets and food expenditures to predict the effect of extending the country ’s 17.5 % sales tax to various foods .
When items high in saturated fat were slapped with the tax , the model estimated that deaths would rise by 1,800 to 4,000 a year because consumers would be prompted to switch to foods with more salt .
To fix that problem , the scientists ran a model in which the tax applied to all kinds of unhealthful foods .
This time , deaths fell by as many as 2,500 a year , but cholesterol levels rose as people switched from salty foods to fatty dairy items .
And unfortunately , consumers in both scenarios did the last thing any anti-obesity crusader would want :
Facing higher grocery bills , they bought fewer fruits and vegetables .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
In Meat Wagon , we round up the latest outrages from the meat and livestock industries .
Standard j - school - style journalism takes a lot of lumps these days–and justifiably so .
To maintain an illusion of “ objectivity , ” traditional reporters write like above - the - fray observers merely recording “ the facts ” –as if choosing which facts to record were n’t itself subjective .
( In reality , of course , a reporter is a thinking human being trying to figure out what ’s going on and tell a story . )
Yet sometimes , j - school style articles have a delicious subtlety .
And if you know enough about the topic in question to provide context and connect the dots ( both frowned upon by j - school types ) , they can deliver rich information .
I ’m thinking of this fantastic Associated Press article by Garance Burke on the ongoing food - poisoning outbreak associated with agribusiness giant Cargill .
As I reported last week , a large - scale California beef - packing plant owned by Cargill churned out , packaged up , and distributed widely some 830,000 pounds of ground beef tainted with antibiotic - resistant salmonella .
At least 28 people in three states have been laid low by the pathogen .
For salmonella , the CDC reckons that for every confirmed illness , 38 people have actually fallen ill .
Thus we can assume that around 1000 people have caught the bug .
Burke ’s AP article delivers key additional information .
To wit :
• Good thing it ’s summer , because the Cargill plant in question supplies the National School Lunch Program .
I love the oblique way this fact comes out in Burke ’s story .
The author writes :
Last year , in the wake of the biggest beef recall in history linked to a Southern California slaughterhouse , inspectors visited the Fresno [ Cargill ] facility and 17 other plants that sold meat to the National School Lunch Program .
And that ’s the last we hear about the school lunch program .
It should be noted that among demographic groups , kids rank among the most vulnerable to food - borne illnesses .
• Here ’s where Burke did excellent reporting–turns out that at that inspection last year , the USDA caught Cargill up to some dodgy business , and little about it .
The reporter dug up a document showing that the USDA inspectors observed workers at the plant “ using electric prods to coax skittish cattle through a narrow chute leading into the slaughterhouse . ”
The reporter continues :
When three cows refused to budge , they were stunned and rendered unconscious “ so that they could be pulled through the restrainer to be shackled , hung and bled , ” the [ USDA} records state .
Dragging knocked - out cattle across a filthy slaughterhouse floor invites contamination of the resulting meatmeat .
As Burke puts it , the practice “ could increase the risk for E. coli and salmonella contamination because cow hides can pick up bacteria from feces that sometimes collect in or around the chute , experts said . ”
The reporter gets a memorable quote from a former USDA inspector : “ All kinds of feces and urine get into those chutes because they typically are n’t cleaned out during the day because too many animals need to get in . ”
Nice !
And when that stuff gets caked onto an unfortunate beast ’s hide , chances that it will end up in the ground beef increase .
From unpacking Burke ’s story , it looks like the USDA somehow rebuked the Cargill plant for the dragging practice .
And Cargill responded with a creative excuse : “ The plant ’s parent company , Cargill Meat Solutions , said the animals balked because there were too many auditors present that day . ”
In other words , it was all the inspectors ’ fault !
Not surprisingly , given the meat industry ’s power , the USDA caved .
Reports Burke :
The company appealed the alleged violation .
The USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service later rescinded the citation and instead sent Beef Packers a letter of concern .
Now , this is insane on its face .
The company ’s excuse , as far - fetched as it is , might explain why the animals balked against being marched to slaughter ; but it does not explain the practice of dragging knocked - out cows across a floor seething with bacterial pathogens just as they ’re about to be processed into burger meat .
That ’s like punching a kid in the face at school , and getting out of trouble by saying , “ but he threw a spit wad at me ! ”
The excuse , even if accurate , does n’t mitigate the viciousness of the response .
And Burke was n’t done .
The reporter wanted to know if the USDA had done a follow - up inspection since witnessing the cow - dragging .
The priceless response :
Agency spokeswoman Bryn Burkard said a Freedom of Information
Act request would have to be made to learn if the plant had been inspected since .
I hope that request is in .
As great as the story is , it neglects to mention that the salmonella in question is antibiotic - resistant .
And once you mention that , you have to get into the meat industry ’s egregious , systematic reliance on dosing animals with antibiotics as a matter of course to keep them alive under cramped , filthy conditions .
And then there ’s the unfortunate fact that President Obama still has n’t named a director of the food Safety Inspection Service , the USDA sub - branch responsible for monitoring the safety of U.S. meat production .
And that last anyone ’s heard , the job ’s front - runner is industrial dairy man Dennis Wollff , who has scant experience in food safety .
And Cargill is n’t just any meat - packing company .
It ’s a vast , globe - spanning agribusiness firm with huge positions in everything from fertilizer production and livestock feed to grain trading and processing .
And it strides the U.S. meat industry like a colossus .
According to researchers Mary Hendrickson and William Heffernan ( PDF ) , it ’s the nation ’s third - largest beef packer , third - largest cow feeder , fourth - largest pork packer , and third - largest turkey producer .
But even without this critical context , the AP ’s Burke has done great reporting and written an important story .
Luxembourg Premier Jean - Claude Juncker ' We Have Been Occupied Before '
The tone between Germany and Luxembourg has been anything but friendly in recent weeks .
SPIEGEL spoke with Luxembourg 's Prime Minister Jean - Claude Juncker about German humor , European tax havens and his own future in the EU .
Years ago , as the New Statesman 's correspondent at a UN conference in Chile in the early 1970s , I chanced upon Robert McNamara , the former US defence secretary , in a narrow passage .
" War criminal , " I hissed as he went by .
He looked hurt and confused ; he must have suffered the same humiliation many times .
Later , I came to regret my youthful gesture , as one of the principal architects of the US disaster in Vietnam sought to remake his life at the World Bank and to atone for the criminal decisions for which he will always be remembered .
One reason for my change of heart was the release of White House tapes which showed the role McNamara had played in defusing the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 .
Another was the 2003 documentary film The Fog of War , in which McNamara drew intelligent lessons from the huge errors of Vietnam .
Yet , on reading Bernd Greiner 's book , which casts a pitiless light on that most controversial of American wars , I wondered whether my original reaction had not in fact been correct .
For among Greiner 's conclusions is that McNamara and his colleagues were by no means wandering lost in the fog of war .
Far from it ; they knew all too well what was going on .
They knew about the horror and the excessive violence ; they knew civilians were being targeted ; and they knew that the policy was doomed to failure .
Their crime , and it was a crime , was to allow it to carry on .
“ Alternatives were available , " Greiner writes , and the decision - makers knew about them .
They could have spoken out in favour of a different policy , with the support of " a substantial part of the political elite " .
One alternative would have been to secure a neutral , reunified Vietnam with communist participation in government .
Indeed , that prospect was always on offer .
So why did a succession of US presidents ( with the diplomatic support , let us not forget , of their British allies ) remain bogged down in a quagmire of their own creation ?
The question is still relevant today , as the protagonists in a similarly hopeless war in Afghanistan seek , and fail , to find a way to abandon a strategy that clearly has no hope of success .
Greiner 's book is not a definitive history of the Vietnam war , but a well - documented essay on its violent , criminal reality and the failure of American society to come to terms with what happened .
His implicit criticism of the role of the United States in Indochina , and his outright condemnation of US war crimes , derive from his distinctive perspective as a German historian .
Inevitably , even though Greiner himself never spells this out , an uncomfortable comparison between US and Nazi war crimes grows in the reader 's mind .
Only in an astonishing final section , where the author discusses the widespread American opposition to the trial of William Calley , does the shadow of Nuremberg flit across the pages .
Lieutenant Calley was the officer held primarily responsible for the 1968 My Lai Massacre , in which 500 men , women and children were killed .
The American public , across the political spectrum , objected to the way he was singled out for punishment , and the people rose up in their hundreds of thousands to support him .
" Free Calley " was a slogan employed both by those hostile to the war and by those who would have liked it to be prosecuted more vigorously .
Although an account of My Lai makes up a central portion of War Without Fronts , the author argues that it was not exceptional : rape , torture and the murder of civilians had gone on before and continued afterwards .
Greiner does not exonerate the murderers , the rapists and the practitioners of torture ; but he also identifies the " real " war criminals - those who , from the top down , connived in allowing this to happen .
He examines , in turn , the politicians , the generals , the officers and the soldiers themselves .
They all knew what was going on , but could not find it in themselves to call a halt .
My Lai took place in March 1968 , but did not become public knowledge until more than a year later , in November 1969 , when the facts were laid out by the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh ( the accurate details provided immediately after the event by Vietnamese insurgents were dismissed as propaganda ) .
Yet concern about the nature and conduct of the war had been growing , particularly among veterans , for several years , and the then US defence secretary , Melvin Laird , became worried that My Lai would spark further revelations .
He set up the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group to secure all information relating to US crimes during the occupation and to rebut the flow of accusations that was expected .
In the process , says Greiner , the working group created " the most extensive archive about American war crimes " , one barely touched by historians - until now .
Greiner 's book concentrates on three episodes in the ground war in South Vietnam - the case of Task Force Oregon , which operated in 1967
in the five provinces immediately south of the border with North Vietnam ; My Lai itself ; and Operation Speedy Express , launched during the " pacification " of the five provinces south - west of Saigon in 1968 - 69 .
The details of these operations serve to bolster Greiner 's contention that My Lai was no exception .
Task Force Oregon was given the job , in April 1967 , of driving 300,000 people in Quang Ngai Province into " relocation centres " .
These were , in effect , prisons holding peasants loyal to the Vietcong .
The province was then declared a " free fire zone " , in which few prisoners were taken , troops were allowed to rape at will , and civilians were indiscriminately fired on .
By the end of 1967 , 70 per cent of the settlements of the province had been destroyed .
Much of this " calculated terrorism against civilians " was reported at the time by Jonathan Schell in the New Yorker , but even Schell did n't know that the Americans were also operating secret " Tiger Force " death squads , whose activities were fully uncovered only in 2003 , thanks to the enterprise of two reporters from the Toledo Blade .
Greiner describes how the death squads " shot peasants in the field without any pretext and murdered anyone who happened to cross their path ; they tortured prisoners and executed them singly or in groups ; they raided villages
in the late evening or early morning and mowed down with machine - gun fire everyone they could find - peasants who had gathered for
a meal or were sleeping , children playing in the open , old people taking a walk " .
They raped and murdered their victims and mutilated their bodies .
Greiner notes that US customs officers came across dozens of parcels of human bones and skulls , often sent home to friends and relatives .
Operation Speedy Express was a repeat in the South of what had occurred in the North , with the additional use of helicopter gunships .
Once again , civilians found themselves in an extensive " free fire zone " and helicopter crews embarked on indiscriminate killing of non-combatants .
My only regret is that Greiner deals solely with the activities of the US army .
The equally heinous crimes of the US air force - the carpet - bombing of the North , the aerial destruction of Laos and Cambodia , and the bombardment by B - 52s of selected areas of the South - are referred to , but left largely unexamined .
During Operation Rolling Thunder , which lasted from 1965 until 1968 , the four southern provinces of North Vietnam had more bombs dropped on them than any other area in history .
When I travelled through North Vietnam during a halt in the bombing in the early weeks of 1970 , I came across villages , towns , bridges , factories and railways that had been destroyed .
Two years later , in May 1972 , President Nixon ordered the launching of Operation Linebacker , a six - month campaign that virtually destroyed the remaining industrial centres of the North .
It was , writes Greiner , " the most massive attack in the history of aerial warfare " .
Designed to cover the withdrawal of front - line troops from the South , and to bolster the morale of the abandoned South Vietnamese army based in Saigon , it was perhaps the most cynical of the innumerable criminal acts of a filthy war .
“ We 're gonna level that goddam country , " Nixon was recorded as saying in June 1971 .
" We 're gonna hit 'em , bomb the livin ' bejesus out of 'em . "
To which Henry Kissinger replied : " Mr President , I will enthusiastically support that , and I think it 's the right thing to do . "
This served to prolong the war for several more years , until finally the Americans were ejected from the country they had tried to destroy .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a firestorm in the global markets and threatened a financial meltdown , a few of the Lehman executives at the center of that conflagration are starting to resurface .
Former Chief Legal Officer Thomas Russo has a senior position at a New York law firm , while Jeremy Isaacs , who headed the firm 's operations in Europe and Asia , has launched a new investment business .
Even ex-Chief Executive Richard Fuld has a new job .
The first anniversary of the firm 's collapse revives painful memories for those who have argued the investment bank should n't have been allowed to fail when such rivals as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were saved just days later .
Many top Lehman executives , including ex-Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan and former Chief Operating Officer Joseph Gregory , are still keeping low profiles amid lawsuits and regulatory investigations into the failure .
One former Lehman LEHMQ employee who did n't want to be identified said the bankruptcy was very painful for all of the firm 's staff , and many just want to put the collapse behind them .
" I feel horrible , " Fuld told Congress in October , less than a month after the bankruptcy .
" What has happened is an absolute tragedy . "
Lehman asked the Federal Reserve for help , but it did n't get much , Fuld said .
But days after the firm filed for bankruptcy , on Sept. 15 , the Fed and other regulators rushed to save Goldman GS , +2.12 % and Morgan Stanley MS , +2.35 % by granting them many of the things that Lehman had n't gotten , he argued .
Lehman asked the Fed to let it become a bank holding company , which could have given the firm more access to deposits , considered a more stable source of funding .
Lehman also asked the Fed to broaden the types of collateral that could be used to tap the Term Securities Lending Facility , one of the main programs used by the government to boost liquidity during the financial crisis .
On the day Lehman prepared to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors , the Fed " significantly " relaxed those collateral requirements , Fuld recalled .
" Had these changes been made sooner , they would have been extraordinarily helpful to Lehman . "
As Goldman and Morgan Stanley shares slumped in the wake of Lehman 's collapse , the Securities and Exchange Commission banned short sales , or negative bets , against roughly 800 of the largest financial - services stocks -- four days after the bankruptcy filing .
A few days after that , the Fed allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies .
See full story .
Investigation
Most former Lehman executives are still keeping out of the limelight .
The Justice Department subpoenaed at least a dozen Lehman executives , including Fuld , Callan , Gregory and Ian Lowitt , a former co-chief administration officer at the firm , according to a Wall Street Journal report last October .
Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined to comment , and the Journal noted that it's not clear which executives are targets of the investigation or witnesses .
Richard Fuld , Chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers Holdings , testifying at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the causes and effects of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , in Washington , Oct. 6 , 2008 .
In March , New Jersey 's attorney general sued nine former Lehman executives , including Fuld , Callan , Gregory , Lowitt , Thomas Russo and Bart McDade , former president and chief operating officer of the firm .
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine , a former CEO of Goldman , said Lehman executives should be held accountable for " fraud and misrepresentation " that left his state 's pension funds with more than $ 100 million in losses .
Matrix
Fuld recently started Matrix Advisors LLC in an office at 780 3rd Ave. in New York , a building that also is home to Paulson Investment Co. Inc. PLCC , Renaissance Capital , Itar - Tass News Agency and offices of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand .
It 's not clear what Matrix does .
A representative at the office said she would pass a late - August message seeking comment on to Fuld .
Patricia Hynes ,
Fuld 's lawyer , did n't respond to an email .
An executive at Renaissance Capital said he'd heard that Fuld operates from the building but had n't seen him .
The executive added that if someone had seen Fuld , he thinks they would have mentioned it .
On leave
Callan started at Credit Suisse in September 2008 , running a hedge - fund advisory group .
Callan advised hedge funds at Lehman before she took on the CFO position there in late 2007 .
At Credit Suisse , she coordinates departments to make sure that they are working well together to service hedge - fund clients .
In February , Callan took a leave of absence from Credit Suisse .
A spokeswoman for the investment bank said on Aug. 20 that Callan was still on leave , adding that she did n't know why the former Lehman CFO was away from work .
The spokeswoman also confirmed that Callan was still an employee of Credit Suisse .
Erin Callan
Steven Eckhaus , Callan 's lawyer , did n't return an email seeking comment .
Both Callan and Gregory left their posts at Lehman in June 2008 .
Harlem Children's Zone
Gregory , Lehman 's former chief operating officer , does n't appear to have taken another formal job .
However , he remains one of the trustees of the Harlem Children 's Zone , a charity that tackles poverty in Harlem , working alongside finance - industry giants including Stanley Druckenmiller , Gary Cohen , Zoe Cruz , Kenneth Langone and Richard Perry .
Gregory is also listed as secretary of the board of trustees at Hofstra University and as a member of the national board of advisers for the Posse Foundation , which promotes diversity at universities .
In August , Gregory filed a $ 233 million claim against Lehman 's bankruptcy estate to recover equity - based compensation that he 'd deferred while working at the firm .
MarketWatch phoned Gregory 's home in Huntington , N.Y. , and the woman who picked up said , " Gregory residence . "
She also said she would pass a message on to Gregory .
Other lenses
Thomas Russo , former chief legal officer at Lehman , is now senior counsel at law firm Patton Boggs LLP in New York .
He also taught a course at Columbia Business School this summer called " Credit Crisis : As Seen Through Other Lenses . "
Joseph Gregory
Reading material for the course included a 2008 presentation Russo gave to the Group of Thirty finance and economic experts led by former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker .
Russo warned about the potential for broader trouble from the mortgage meltdown and said that any ways to boost liquidity and limit distressed asset sales should be considered .
Other suggested reading included articles on Bear Stearns and American International Group AIG , +0.87 % , two other financial giants that almost perished last year , along with stories on whether the Fed caused the financial crisis .
None of the material focused on Lehman .
Russo declined to comment .
' Bart ' McDade
Herbert " Bart " McDade III , former Lehman president , helped integrate the firm's U.S. capital - markets business with Barclays Capital after the British bank Barclays PLC bought the unit out of bankruptcy protection in mid-September 2008 .
McDade left Barclays Capital a few months later .
He was reportedly hired earlier this year by Nomura to head up a securitization team at the Japanese firm .
Nomura spokesman Ralph Piscitelli declined to comment .
An assistant who answered the phone at the front desk of Nomura in New York on Aug. 20 said she could n't find a listing for Herbert McDade or Bart McDade in the U.S. or at any of Nomura 's offices around the world .
See related story on the Nomura and Barclays acquisitions of Lehman assets .
Isaacs ' new venture
Jeremy Isaacs , Lehman 's former head of Europe and Asia , started an investment firm called JRJ Ventures LLP late last year with Roger Nagioff , who 'd headed Lehman 's fixed - income division .
Isaacs announced plans to leave Lehman just before the firm filed for bankruptcy .
London - based JRJ has 10 employees , according to the U.K. 's Financial Services Authority , which maintains a registry of regulated firms .
Other former Lehman staff at JRJ include Joanna Nader , Huarong Tang , Fouad Braidy , Era Sahni and Peter Sugarman , according to the FSA 's register .
Going to Sears
Former Lehman co-Chief Administrative Officer Scott Freidheim was hired by Edward Lampert 's Sears Holdings in December .
Freidheim was named an executive vice president for operating and support businesses at Sears .
He also joined the retailer 's internal holding - company business unit 's board of directors .
He helps oversee Sears units that sell products and services including food , home appliances , home electronics , shoes , lawn and garden tools and sporting goods .
Freidheim also helps oversee support units at the retailer , including information technology , legal , finance , marketing and human resources .
A Sears spokesman said Freidheim was unavailable for comment in late August .
Wealth 's pursuit
Ian Lowitt , the other former co-Chief Administrative Officer at Lehman , joined Barclays in September 2008 , soon after the bankruptcy .
That month , Barclays also bought the assets of Lehman 's private - investment - management business in its Americas region .
The deal helped the bank launch Barclays Wealth in the U.S.
The unit provides stock broking , private banking , investment management and fiduciary services to people with at least $ 10 million in investable assets .
Lowitt became chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth in April .
He oversees all infrastructure , including business strategy and development , finance , legal and compliance , human resources , information technology , marketing and communications .
A spokeswoman for Barclays Wealth said Lowitt was unavailable for comment in late August .

The Abolition of the State
By : Wayne Price
Bloomington , IN : Author House , 2007 , 196 pp. , $ 14.49
W AYNE PRICE ’S THE ABOLITION OF THE STATE is a well considered , well researched , and well written book .
I shall try to summarize his major points in the first several chapters .
Chapters 9 , 10 , and 11 deal with the failure of revolutions in Russia and Spain and the success of the counter - revolution in Germany , and I shall discuss them as well .
Both anarchists and Marxists believe in a revolution from below by the working class .
Both see the state as a “ committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie ” ( Communist Manifesto ) .
) .
Marxists would replace the existing state with a new state that would wither away when the class struggle ceases .
( Price questions this , given his view of Lenin and Trotsky as incorrigible centralizers . )
Anarchists , on the contrary , “ plan to go immediately into a stateless society ” ( p.5 ) .
Homo Sapiens began about 50 thousand years ago , but states did not start until about 5 thousand years ago .
Hence , state is not “ required by human nature . ” • Reformism — whether Fabian or Scandinavian — cannot work because even if social democrats get elected and control the government , “ they do not control the economy . . . [ and ] have to manage a capitalist economy ” ( p. 25 ) .
Cooperatives and other alternate institutions are fine , but they are no strategy for overthrowing capitalism .
Decentralism : Small closely knit communities should be the goal .
( According to Ralph Borsodi , 2/3 of the national product could be made more cheaply on homesteads ; only 1/3 is more effectively made by mass production . )
Price acknowledges Marx and Engels ’ insistence on worker democracy , but faults them for not rooting it locally in worker institutions and communities .
Price believes in a federation of cooperative communities and of worker - controlled industries — a federalized pluralistic system ( pp. 81,97 ) .
Anarchists and socialists , generally speaking , agree on the beginning and ending of the struggle for a classless society .
Both begin with a sine qua non — a bottom - up workers ’ revolution ( although some anarchists believe this must be a spontaneous movement , and some socialists believe in the leadership of a workers ’ party ) .
The ending for both is a withering away of the state and the end of exploitation in a classless society .
With his customary acuity , Engels put his finger on the fundamental difference between anarchists and Marxists :
Bakunin maintains that it is the state which has created capital , that the capitalist has his capital only by the grace of the state .
As , therefore , the state is the chief evil , it is above all the state which must be done away with and then capitalism will go to blazes of itself .
We , on the contrary , say :
Do away with capital , the concentration of all means of production in the hands of the few , and the state will fall of itself .
The difference is an essential one : Without a previous social revolution the abolition of the state is nonsense ; the abolition of capital is precisely the social revolution and involves a change in the whole mode of production .
Now then , inasmuch as to Bakunin the state is the main evil , nothing must be done which can maintain the existence of the state , that is , of any state , whether it be a republic , a monarchy , or anything else .
Hence , complete abstention from all politics .
To commit a political act , and especially to take part in an election , would be a betrayal of principle ( Letter to Theodor Cuno , 1-24- 1872 , italics , Engels ’ ) .
THE QUESTION , THEN , IS Does the state flow out of class struggle , or does class struggle flow out of the state ?
As indicated , Price accepts Engels ’ formulation of the state as a committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie .
Nevertheless , he is unequivocal about the anarchist plan to go immediately into a stateless society .
In my view , as long as class contradictions persist , so does the need for state .
Socialism does not emerge in vacuo ; it is birthed from the womb of capitalism .
However , Price is not naïve .
He realizes that people will not be perfect after a libertarian revolution :
What if [ a rogue community ] declares itself open only to white people , or it teaches creationism in its schools , or it dumps pollution into the river on which other communities are located ? . . .
What would a non-statist society do ( p.78 ) ?
He imagines a regional conference at which several proposals are brought forward :
1 ) Leave the rogue community alone , let them stew in their own juice ;
2 ) Organize a regional militia to march on the offending community ;
3 ) Wage a propaganda campaign , organize an economic boycott , demonstrate non-violently .
Clearly # 1 is unacceptable .
Of course , there is an enormous difference between the functioning of a bourgeois and a putative libertarian society , but let us take a quick glance at some use of state force in past American history , some rare exceptions to the usual use of state force to crush workers .
In 1957 , despite a unanimous decision by the U.S. Supreme Court ( Brown v. Board of Education ) , Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus , supported by mobs , could be countered only by federal paratroopers .
Again , in 1963 , only federal marshals could insure the admission of black students to the U. of Alabama .
And , for that matter , none of the three proposals put forward by Price ’s imagined conference would end the Confederacy in 1861 .
That was then , now is different , some would say .
But the Rush Limbaughs , Sean Hannitys , Ann Coulters , Glen Becks , et. al. will not go away , and their mobs are even now arming themselves in great numbers .
Leon Trotsky sums up what he saw as the anarchist fallacy as follows :
Like every sect which founds its teaching not upon the actual development of human society , but upon the reduction to absurdity of one of its features , anarchism explodes like a soap bubble at that moment when the social contradictions arrive at the point of war or revolution .
1
As for the United States , that moment came on April 12 , 1861 with the opening shots of the battle of Fort Sumter .
IN A SOCIALIST REVOLUTION , would the state wither away if it is not abolished outright ?
Here is where Price makes an important factual error , despite his otherwise well researched book : he claims that Lenin said , in his most libertarian work State and Revolution , “ the state might exist indefinitely ” ( p.50 ) .
Nowhere in this work does Lenin say this .
Again and again Lenin stresses the withering away of the state .
“ The more democratic the ‘ state . . . no longer a state in the proper sense of the word , ’ the more rapidly does every state begin to wither away ” ( emphasis his ) 2 .
Then why did it show no signs of withering away after the Bolshevik Revolution ?
Was the degeneration of the Russian Revolution into a totalitarian regime due to the Bolsheviks ’ scorn of decentralization , to their lust for centralized power ?
First , unlike some ( including both Richard Pipes on the right and Noam Chomsky on the left , who maintain that the October revolution was a Bolshevik coup d’état ) , Price clearly believes that the Russian Revolution was a genuine workers ’ revolution from below .
Whatever the Bolsheviks did , whatever mistakes they made , was in their view a defense of a bottom - up workers ’ revolution .
This is in sharp contradistinction to , say , the top - down Cuban Revolution .
Regis Debray , a close ally of Castro in the early days , wrote in Revolution in the Revolution :
The next point is :
No political front which is basically a deliberative body can assume leadership of a people ’s war ; only a technically capable executive group , centralized and united on the basis of identical class interests , can do so ; in brief , only a revolutionary general staff .
( tr. , Bobbye Ortiz , Monthly Review , July - Aug. , 1967 ) , 86 .
For Castro ( and Debray ) “ the duty of the revolutionary is to make the revolution ” ; for Marx , the revolutionary was the spark ( in Russian , iskra ) — only the workers can make the revolution .
It is folly to think that an elite group would cede its power — once won — to the people .
And in Cuba , China , and Vietnam , it has n’t .
Like Debs , Lenin followed the Marxist dictum of a bottom - up revolution , the opposite of what Debray postulates .
After warning that 3 conditions are necessary for a successful revolution ( the government must be collapsing ; the vanguard — for Lenin , the workers and the soldiers — must be in motion ; and the vast majority of people must support the revolutionary party ) , Lenin concludes :
We could not have retained power July 16 - 17 politically , for , before the Kornilov affair , * the army and the provinces could and would have marched against Petrograd .
Now ( Oct. ) the picture is entirely different .
We have back of us the majority of a class that is the vanguard ….
We have back of us a majority of the people . . . ( emphasis his ) 3 .
And perhaps the most remarkable passage in State and Revolution is the one in which Lenin envisions a post - revolutionary world of democracy and equality :
The workers , having conquered political power , will break up the old bureaucratic foundations , until not one stone is left upon another ; and they will replace it with a new one consisting of these same workers and employees , against whose transformation into bureaucrats measures will at once be undertaken , as pointed out in detail by Marx and Engels : ( 1 ) not only electiveness , but also instant recall ; ( 2 ) payment no higher than that of ordinary workers ; ( 3 ) immediate transition to a state of things when all fulfill the functions of control and superintendence , so that all become “ bureaucrats ” for a time , and no one , therefore , can become a “ bureaucrat .
” ( Last 3 words stressed are Lenin ’s emphases ; rest are mine . )
4
How differently things turned out !
PRICE IS AWARE of Lenin and Trotsky ’s insistence that “ the revolution would succeed only if it spread to Western Europe ” ( 127 ) .
He concludes :
Under the failure of the revolution to spread , foreign invasions and civil wars , and the extreme poverty of the country , such concepts overwhelmed the libertarian aspects of Lenin ’s vision and produced a totalitarian nightmare ( p. 58 ) .
Given these factors , who can say with any certainty that the degeneration of the Bolshevik Revolution owed primarily — some would say solely — to the Lenin - Trotsky drive toward centralization ?
In my view , that would be ahistorical , denying the civil war , the backwardness of the people , the lack of industry , the post - WWI exhaustion of both the troops and the people , the famine , the foreign invasion on several fronts , and the failure of the revolution in Western Europe .
To quote Lenin on centralization without mentioning that he wrote many of those passages in the midst of a civil war and a struggle against foreign invasion , as many do , seems to me disingenuous .
Price faults the Bolsheviks for four major actions : During the Civil War , ( 1 ) the signing of the Brest - Litovsky peace treaty with Germany and ( 2 ) suppression of the anarchist Makhno guerrillas ; and After the Civil War ( 3 ) Bolshevik authoritarianism and ( 4 ) the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising .
In March , 1918 , there was a vigorous debate within the Bolshevik Party .
Three positions were argued : Lenin for peace ; the anarchists for a revolutionary war ( the position supported by Price ) ; and Trotsky for “ no war , no peace . ”
Both the latter two positions staked everything on troops of the Central Powers responding to appeals of the Russian soldiers and revolting .
We must keep in mind that World War I left 7 million Russians dead , wounded , or imprisoned and that those troops still active were exhausted , typhus - ridden , and malnourished .
Remember , also , that a key slogan of the Bolsheviks in their rise to power was “ Peace , Land , and Bread . ”
Had they not sued for peace , they would have continued a hopeless war , Lenin maintained , and they would have reneged on their pledge .
The two positions for waging a revolutionary war seemed risky .
A majority sided with Lenin ; and Trotsky — perhaps reluctantly — signed the peace accord with the Central Powers at Brest - Litovsk .
As for the struggle with the Makhnoites , here is what the historian W. H. Chamberlain has written :
Typical excerpts from the diary of Makhno ’s wife are : “ Feb. 23 , 1920 — Our men seized Bolshevik agents , who were shot .
“ Feb. 25 , 1920 — Moved over to Maiorovo .
Caught three agents for the collection of grain there .
Shot them . . . . ”
Further details of Makhno ’s harassing guerrilla activity are to be found in the reports of the Soviet Ukranian Front for the same year , 1920 : “ June 8 — At the station Vasilekka Makhno blew up the railroad bridge . . . shot 14 captured officials of Soviet and robbed the food warehouse of the railroad workers .
. . .
Aug. 16 — Having seized Mirgorod for a dayand - a- half , Makhno ’s followers robbed all the warehouses of the county food committee , destroyed the buildings of Soviet and workers ’ organizations , smashed 15 telegraph machines , killed 21 workers and Red soldiers . ”
In these dry reports there is a decided hint of a fierce hatred of Makhno ’s partisans for everything connected with the city : railroads , telegraph lines , everything connected with the city / town an advantage over the village5 .
I do not quote this at length to stress the brutality : the Ukraine was a sea of blood and betrayal ( e.g. Makhno ’s aide Karetnik murdered the renegade Grigoriev and his envoys at a parley ) .
What happened in the Ukraine — on all sides ( Whites , Reds , Petlurists , Austrians , Makhnoites ) — was frightful .
( Price mentions only Red transgressions .
This is tendentious . )
I quote this at length because I think Price sometimes belittles the importance of the social forces involved : the conflict between urban workers and peasants .
He calls this “ a dogmatic theory of class conflict ” ( p.123 ) .
The workers of Petrograd were hungry , even starving , and the Red Army also desperately needed food .
( Price claims that the Bolsheviks could have chosen a more reasonable policy to get grain .
Possibly , but starvation is not the optimal condition for reasonableness .
Tendentiousness again : the Makhnoites and their peasants also could have been reasonable . )
BUT AFTER THE CIVIL WAR . . .
External political opposition — Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries — had been banned during the later part of the Civil War .
Now , in the tenth Party Congress , internal opposition ( e.g. Workers ’ Opposition ) within the Party was banned , 6 even while General Tukhachevsky ’s troops were crushing the Kronstadt rising .
The insurgents at Kronstadt had demanded an end to the dictatorship of the Bolshevik Party and the restitution of government by Soviets , which had been promised — and demanded — by Bolsheviks during their rise to power .
March , 1921 was a crucial moment in the history of Bolshevism .
Lenin referred to the Kronstadt uprising as “ the flash which lit up really better than anything else . ” )
For Trotsky , it was a “ tragic necessity . ”
I agree that it was tragic , but not that it was a necessity .
True , power to the Soviets at that time would have removed the Bolsheviks from power , but their holding on to it at all costs proved , as we now know , disastrous .
This may seem a contradiction to what I just wrote about actions regarding the Brest - Litovsk treaty and the treatment of the Makhnoites , but we should bear in mind that the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising and the tenth Congress ’ ban on internal party dissension both took place not during WWI or the Civil War , but after them ( although — it should be mentioned — foreign troops , including those of the United States , were still on Russian soil ) .
A troubling question : Should criteria for holding onto power differ from the criteria for seizing power ?
( See Lenin ’s criteria for latter above . )
As Nietzsche wrote , “ Whoever battles with monsters had better see to it that [ the battle ] does not turn him into a monster . ”
As I have said , Lenin and Trotsky believed that their revolution could be saved only by a workers ’ revolution in Europe .
( Marx believed that the revolution would begin in Germany , deepen in France , and end in England . )
But the Spartacist revolution in Germany in 1919 failed , and the terrible inflation and depression of the 1920s helped Hitler in his rise to power .
Here Price sides with Trotsky who faults the German Communists for not forming a common front with the Social Democrats — bad as they were — to fight against the Nazis , who , of course , were much , much worse .
IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR , Buenaventura Durruti , the great Anarchist leader , whose forces in the Aragon made the only Republican advance during the war , cited the need for a centralized national defense council .
This has been denounced by some anarchist historians as a move toward authoritarian socialism ; but Price rightly defends Durruti .
Pace those anarchists , the key question is not whether to have decentralized militias or a centralized council : the real issue is how truly democratic would those bodies be ?
In Trotsky ’s original plan for the Red Army , there would be no insignia or ranks , and each unit would be run by an elected committee , one of whose jobs would be to choose officers .
Military discipline would be recognized only in active combat , and even their unit commanders would have had to operate without the sanction of the death penalty .
( See Geoffrey Hosking ’s History of the Soviet Union . )
Unfortunately , this plan was scrapped in face of the German advance , but , again , we must remember that the troops at the time were backward — they were mostly poor peasants — and I have already pointed out how exhausted and demoralized they were .
I can only say that in my outfit in Italy , the 88th Infantry Division , Trotsky ’s democratic , egalitarian plan might have worked .
Surely , it would have had a better chance of working .
As in a factory , those on the line know more about operations than their higher - ups .
( See Bill Mauldin ’s cartoons about the combat sagacity of ordinary GIs compared to that of the brass . )
As Engels pointed out , anarchists abstain from political power .
Yet in the Spanish Civil War , a contradiction arose .
In 1936 , the anarchists , through their dominance of the trade union ( National Confederation of Labor , CNT ) and their political association ( Federation of Iberian Anarchists , FAI ) , controlled Barcelona and the surrounding region .
Luis Companys , president of the Catalan Generalitat , “ offered to resign in [ the anarchists ’ ] favor if they wanted but proposed instead that they work together ” ( 141 ) .
The anarchist labor leaders joined the bourgeois government as ministers ( the anarchist Garcia Oliver becoming Minister of Justice ! ) , the same government that — strengthened by Russian arms deliveries — later repressed the Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista ( POUM ) and eventually the anarchists themselves .
Price is right , in my view , to support Durruti ’s group in strongly criticizing the anarchist leaders for their failure to take power and for their subsequent collaborationism .
I AGREE WITH PRICE that “ [ T ] here is a libertarian interpretation of Marx which is fairly close to the real views of many anarchists ” ( 42 ) .
Despite his false attribution to Lenin in State and Revolution that “ the state might exist indefinitely , ” Price has given us much to chew on .
I do have a few cavils :
He describes Paul Goodman and Noam Chomsky as reformists ( 174 ) .
As a friend of the late Goodman , I can almost hear him howling from Beyond .
And I am sure Chomsky , too , would object to this characterization of him .
Reformists believe that society can be fixed by tinkering , while Goodman and , I think , Chomsky believe in the necessity for a social revolution .
Without offering any proof , he describes Amadeo Bordiga as an authoritarian sectarian — his policy “ was a precursor of Third - Period Stalinism ” ( 149 ) .
Although he is quite familiar with the works of Hal Draper and others in the Workers Party / Independent Socialist League , he concludes that “ Trotskyists became variants of social democrats or Stalinists or both ” ( 159 ) .
Not all !
In my opening summary , I mentioned Price ’s reliance on Ralph Borsodi ’s claim that “ [ A ] third of the national product was more effectively made centrally , by mass production , but two - thirds was cheaper to make on homesteads ” ( 89 )
This claim needs development , in my view .
Price has a thoughtful discussion of Errico Malatesta and the question of majority / minority rights in a democracy .
It would have been helpful to look at the experiences of the Students for a Democratic Society .
In his discussion of “ emotionally cold antisocial people ” ( Ch. 5 ) , he could have been helped by Wilhelm Reich ’s Character Analysis and The Mass Psychology of Fascism , where Reich tries to show the connection between economic exploitation and sexual repression .
and , where Reich tries to show the connection between economic exploitation and sexual repression .
Chapter 11 , “ The Fight Against Naziism in Germany ” would have been strengthened by a look at Ruth Fischer ’s Stalin and German Communism .
( Fischer was a co-leader , with Arkadi Maslow , of the ultra - left Maslow - Fischer group within the German Communist Party . )
( Fischer was a co-leader , with Arkadi Maslow , of the ultra - left Maslow - Fischer group within the German Communist Party . )
He situates the anarchist Karl Hess as neutral between capitalism and a cooperative , production - for - use economy .
But Hess was a major speech writer for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential election .
BUT THESE ARE QUIBBLES .
I think Marxists and Anarchists can learn from each other and , in fact , need each other .

Whales need friends as well as family
Killer whales create and visit social clubs just like people do , scientists have discovered .
Up to 100 fish - eating killer whales come together in the Avacha Gulf , off the coast of Russia .
But no - one knew why these orcas form these huge superpods , when they normally live in smaller groups .
Now scientists report in the Journal of Ethology that these groups act as clubs in which the killer whales form and maintain social ties .
Fish - eating killer whales ( Orcinus orca ) in the Avacha Gulf live in stable groups called pods that contain an average of ten individuals and up to 20 in the largest pods .
But researchers have seen up to eight of these pods coming together to form large groups of up to 100 animals .
As far as the eye can see , in every direction you see killer whales surfacing
Erich Hoyt , WDCS
These large aggregations of pods are seen in numerous places around the world where large numbers of killer whales occur such as British Columbia , Alaska , Iceland and Antarctica .
It is unlikely that the whales gather for protection as they have no natural predators .
In the past researchers have suggested that the killer whales meet to increase their foraging success or to breed .
But the behaviour has not been quantified before .
To investigate , Olga Filatova of the Moscow State University and colleagues from the Far East Russia Orca project observed and photographed whales in the Avacha Gulf from a 4 m long boat .
" At first we might see just a few spouts on the horizon .
Then quickly we move among them , keeping a distance of a hundred metres so as not to bother them , " explained project co-director Erich Hoyt of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) , which provided the majority of funding for the project .
" As far as the eye can see , in every direction you see groupings of two to six killer whales surfacing , spouting then dipping below the surface . "
" Each grouping has a focal mother figure surrounded by her offspring , some of whom may be full grown males with up to 2 m dorsal fins that tower over the females , " he says .

They also used a special underwater directional microphone called a hydrophone to record the sound of the killer whale vocalisations .
Each pod of fish - eating killer whales in the Avacha Gulf has a specific vocal dialect which could be pinpointed by the hydrophone , while individual killer whales can also be identified by the shape of their dorsal fins and markings .
That allowed the scientists to analyse the killer whales ' behaviour .
The whales rarely forage and feed when they gather into a much larger superpod , the scientists found .
That suggests they do not gather to herd fish or increase their foraging success .
In fact , say the scientists , depending on the type of prey , a superpod might have the effect of decreasing the feeding success of each whale making it unproductive to feed in large groups .
However , the killer whales did interact much more during these large gatherings that lasted from a few hours to almost half a day .
When meeting killer whales from other family pods , they made contact with each other , swam in synchrony and rubbed flippers much more often , the researchers found .
Sexual activity also increased , suggesting that these big aggregations provide a chance to assess potential breeding partners .
However , these behaviours likely have a greater function beyond reproduction , the scientists believe .
Club life
They enable the killer whales to establish and maintain social bonds and it is for that reason that the killer whales gather in core meeting areas and form large aggregations .
" The superpods are like big social clubs , " says Hoyt .
" These clubs could help them stay acquainted , could be part of the courting process but could have other functions that we need to learn about . "
Maintaining social bonds is crucial for many social mammals which live and hunt together .
Looking for a mate ?
But maintaining connections with the wider community may be especially important for killer whales , which tend to live long lives in relatively small communities with low birth rates .
Killer whales also face challenges with high calf mortality rates which may be as high as 50 % in the first six months .
" Understanding more about their social lives , including their reproduction , will be crucial to our future understanding of them and our ability to keep their population healthy , " Hoyt says .
The team has also recently extended the study outside of the Avacha Gulf further north and south along the Kamchatka coast and to the offshore Commander Islands to learn more about other killer whale groups , including the mammal - eating type of killer whale that feeds on porpoises , seals and sea otters .

It ’s about time .
Today , July 22nd , Open Source for America , a coalition of more than 60 organizations joined together to advocate open source in the U.S. federal government launched .
This comes after decades of Microsoft spending millions every year to encourage the government to buy Microsoft ’s proprietary software .
Open Source for America , which includes industry leaders such as Red Hat , Google , Novell , and Oracle in its membership , is meant to provide , according to the group ’s statement , a “ unified voice to help effect change in U.S. Federal Government policies and practices to allow the federal government to better utilize open source software for cost efficiency , security and enhanced performance . ”
The alliance will spell out to the the U.S. federal government that open - source software will provide an “ an open , transparent and cost - effective option for government agencies ” to deliver services to citizens .
With an economy that on the rocks , encouraging the government to move to open - source software makes a good deal of sense .
Indeed , the Federal government has long relied on open - source software long before that phrase even appeared .
When I worked at NASA , for example in the mid-80s , financial circumstances already made sure we used free software .
For example , the popular Beowulf Linux clustering software got its start at Goddard Space Flight Center due to necessity and used COTS ( Commercial , off - the - shelf ) computers .
Thus , Open Source for America is formalizing support for a do - it - yourself approach that government technology workers have long taken .
As Jim Whitehurst , Red Hat ’s CEO wrote in a blog , “ Open source provides an answer to government agencies at all levels as they look for opportunities to carve out IT costs , improve security and increase efficiency . ”
Exactly .
According to the organization ’s press release , “ the mission of Open Source for America is to serve as a centralized advocate and to encourage broader U.S. Federal Government support of and participation in free and open source software .
Specifically , Open Source for America will : help effect change in policies and practices to allow the Federal Government to better utilize these technologies ; help coordinate these communities to collaborate with the federal government on technology requirements ; and raise awareness and create understanding among federal government leaders about the values and implications of open source software . ”
This is n’t just a corporate lobbying effort though , The organization ’s Board of Advisors of includes respected well - known open - source lawyers , Eben Moglen and Andy Updegrove and community leaders like Stormy Peters of the GNOME Foundation and Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation .
The group ’s founding membership list is a who ’s who of open - source companies , organizations , and groups like the Electronic Freedom Foundation , which rely on open - source software to further their own mission .
David Thomas , principal with Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti , a Washington DC lobbying group and spokesman for the Open Source for America campaign , said in a statement “ Open Source for America is bringing together some of the industry ’s brightest minds , who will work together with policymakers and the public so that technologies enabled by the software freedoms can help make government IT deployment more secure , more cost - effective , faster to deploy , with greater privacy and the ability to help eliminate vendor lock - in .
Open source software may not be a cure - all , but it could save billions of dollars , help foster innovation and empower our government to work smarter . ”
Thomas concluded , “ Open source software can help deliver improved government service – plain and simple – and the Administration recognizes this more than any in our nation ’s history ”
About once a year , the internet news fills up for a week or so with talk of how a new largest - known prime has just been found .
This largest - known prime has invariably been found by GIMPS , a distributed computing project designed to find large Mersenne primes .
Of course , mainstream media does n’t like reporting things unless they can give people the illusion of some sort of immediate practical purpose .
So what to do when you ca n’t think of a practical use for some recently - discovered 10 - million - digit prime numbers ?
Make one up , of course !
Just say that they have applications in cryptography :
Scientists in the US and Germany have found the two largest prime numbers ever calculated in a discovery which could dramatically increase the effectiveness of cryptographic systems .
– v3.co.uk
The Source of the Myth : RSA Encryption
Like all good myths , the Mersenne prime cryptography myth is so widespread because it is so close to being true .
The most widely - used form of encryption used on the internet is RSA encryption , which works by multiplying two huge prime numbers together to form an even larger number with exactly two prime factors .
Since factoring numbers is believed to be computationally difficult , reversing this process is currently a very difficult problem , which leads to RSA providing reasonably strong encryption .
The thing is , RSA typically uses primes that have a few hundred digits , not a few million digits .
Some of the reasons for this are as follows :
You do n’t need to use million - digit primes .
Considering that even cracking RSA that uses 250 - digit primes is an extremely difficult problem that has n’t been completed yet , and the problem gets exponentially more difficult as you add more digits , even the most paranoid of people should be comfortable using primes with a couple thousand digits .
You might argue that some big government agencies would want RSA to be as secure as possible for their transactions , so they might want to use million - digit primes , but any agency that is that worried about security should n’t be using public key cryptography in the first place .
Using primes with millions of digits actually decreases security .
As of this writing , there are 26 known primes with more than one million digits , so to break RSA encryption that makes use of primes with millions of digits you can just test each one of the known million - digit primes to see if they are one of the factors .
RSA only works because there are lots of primes with hundreds of digits to choose from ( as in billions of billions of billions of them , and then some ) .
Manipulating numbers with millions of digits is slow .
Internet - based public key cryptography systems need to be fast if they ’re to be of any practical use , so it does n’t make much sense to try to use a cryptography system that relies on multiplying and finding residues with numbers that take several megabytes just to store .
Just imagine trying to do some online banking when you have to transmit this number along with every other piece of data that you send back to the server .
Not all media outlets are so bad as to directly say that the primes found by GIMPS are useful for cryptography , but the vast majority of them imply it at some point throughout the story .
Consider the following examples , which are taken from stories about newly - discovered GIMPS primes :
Mersenne primes are important for the theory of numbers and they may help in developing unbreakable codes and message encryptions .
– BBC News
Current cryptographic systems rely on the challenge of factoring large primes .
– ScienceNews.org
While those tidbits of information are quite true ( well , almost — see the comments ) , when taken in context they are entirely misleading and cause the reader to think that GIMPS primes have applications in today ’s cryptography systems .
It ’s like running a story about a recent plane crash that includes a sentence about how it ’s a good idea to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle .
So Why Do We Search for Huge Primes ?
The main reason that we search for huge primes is simply for sport .
It gives our idle CPU cycles something to do .
Non-mathematicians seem to balk at that idea and call it a huge waste of CPU cycles / time , and they ’re probably right , but so what ?
Have you ever played a video game ?
This is our version of going for a high score .
If that does n’t seem like a particularly good reason to you , perhaps one of the reasons given by GIMPS itself will satisfy you .
One thing that you ’ll notice though is that cryptography is not mentioned anywhere on that page .
Berkeley -- " Practice makes perfect " is the maxim drummed into students struggling to learn a new motor skill - be it riding a bike or developing a killer backhand in tennis .
Stunning new research now reveals that the brain can also achieve this motor memory with a prosthetic device , providing hope that physically disabled people can one day master control of artificial limbs with greater ease .
In this study , to be published July 21 in the open- access journal PLoS Biology , macaque monkeys using brain signals learned how to move a computer cursor to various targets .
What the researchers learned was that the brain could develop a mental map of a solution to achieve the task with high proficiency , and that it adhered to that neural pattern without deviation , much like a driver sticks to a given route commuting to work .
The study , conducted by scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , addresses a fundamental question about whether the brain can establish a stable , neural map of a motor task to make control of an artificial limb more intuitive .
" When your own body performs motor tasks repeatedly , the movements become almost automatic , " said study principal investigator Jose Carmena , a UC Berkeley assistant professor with joint appointments in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences , the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute , and the Program in Cognitive Science .
" The profound part of our study is that this is all happening with something that is not part of one 's own body .
We have demonstrated that the brain is able to form a motor memory to control a disembodied device in a way that mirrors how it controls its own body .
That has never been shown before . "
Researchers in the field of brain - machine interfaces , including Carmena , have made significant strides in recent years in the effort to improve the lives of people with physical disabilities .
An April 2009 survey by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation found that nearly 1.3 million people in the United States suffer from some form of paralysis caused by spinal cord injury .
When other causes of restricted movement are considered , such as stroke , multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy , the number of Americans affected jumps to 5.6 million , the survey found .
Already , researchers have demonstrated that rodents , non-human primates and humans are able to control robotic devices or computer cursors in real time using only brain signals .
But what had not been clear before was whether such a skill had been consolidated as a motor memory .
The new study suggests that the brain is capable of creating a stable , mental representation of a disembodied device so that it can be controlled with little effort .
To demonstrate this , Carmena and Karunesh Ganguly , a post - doctoral fellow in Carmena 's laboratory , used a mathematical model , or " decoder , " that remained static during the length of the study , and they paired it with a stable group of neurons in the brain .
The decoder , analogous to a simplified spinal cord , translated the signals from the brain 's motor cortex into movement of the cursor .
It took about four to five days of practice for the monkeys to master precise control of the cursor .
Once they did , they completed the task easily and quickly for the next two weeks .
Signals from the brain 's motor cortex were translated by a " decoder " into deliberate movements of a computer cursor .
The task involved moving the cursor from a central starting point to a nearby target .
UC Berkeley researchers have learned that the brain is capable of developing a motor memory of the task , much like it masters other physical skills such as riding a bike or playing tennis , but with the added distinction that the control is of a device separate from one 's own body .

As the tasks were being completed , the researches were able to monitor the changes in activity of individual neurons involved in controlling the cursor .
They could tell which cells were firing when the cursor moved in specific directions .
The researchers noticed that when the animals became proficient at the task , the neural patterns involved in the " solution " stabilized .
" The solution adopted is what the brain returned to repeatedly , " said Carmena .
That stability is one of three major features scientists associate with motor memory , and it is all too familiar to music teachers and athletic coaches who try to help their students " unlearn " improper form or techniques , as once a motor memory has been consolidated , it can be difficult to change .
Other characteristics of motor memory include the ability for it to be rapidly recalled upon demand and its resistance to interference when new skills are learned .
All three elements were demonstrated in the UC Berkeley study .
In the weeks after they achieved proficiency , the primates exhibited rapid recall by immediately completing their learned task on the first try .
" They did it from the get - go ; there was no need to retrain them , " said Carmena .
Real - life examples of resistance to interference , the third feature of motor memory , include people who return to an automatic transmission car after learning how to drive stick - shift .
In the study , the researchers presented a new decoder - marked by a different colored cursor - two weeks after the monkeys showed mastery of the first decoder .
As the monkeys were mastering the new decoder , the researchers would suddenly switch back to the original decoder and saw that the monkeys could immediately perform the task without missing a beat .
The monkeys could easily switch back and forth between the two decoders , showing a level of neural plasticity never before associated with the control of a prosthetic device , the researchers said .
" This is a study that says that maybe one day , we can really think of the ultimate neuroprosthetic device that humans can use to perform many different tasks in a more natural way , " said Carmena .
Yet , the researchers acknowledged that prosthetic devices will not match what millions of years of evolution have accomplished to enable animal brains to control body movement .
The complexity of wiring one 's brain to properly control the body is made clear whenever one watches an infant 's haphazard attempts to find its own hands and feet .
" Nevertheless , beyond its clinical applications , which are very clear , this line of research sheds light on how the brain assembles and organizes neurons , and how it forms a motor memory to control the prosthetic device , " Carmena said .
" These are important , fundamental questions about how the brain learns in general . "

Card issuers told :
Stay far afield from students The Credit CARD
Act of 2009 bans card issuers from offering pizza , T - shirts , hats and other freebies in exchange for signing up for a credit card on “ or near ” campus .
How close is near ?
On Sept. 29 , the Fed clarified : 1,000 feet — a distance of almost three football fields .
Card issuers can’t market credit cards within 1,000 feet of a college campus , the Federal Reserve said Tuesday .
That ’s just one of many Credit CARD Act - related clarifications the Fed announced .
The central bank — continuing its efforts to protect young consumers from predatory card marketing — also provided further guidance on who can act as a co-signer for someone who ’s under 21 years of age , what items issuers cannot give out to get someone to sign up for a credit card and more .
It is common practice for the Fed to follow up the release of a law , especially one as sweeping as the Credit CARD Act , with clarifications of some of the law ’s most vague language .
While the Fed did shed light on some of the vagaries of the act , it failed to clarify others with quite the precision hoped for by college administrators and consumer advocates .
Here ’s a rundown of how the Fed fared on its college quiz :
Q : Card issuers will be prohibited from marketing credit cards “ near campus . ”
How is “ near campus ” defined ?
A : The Fed defines “ near campus ” as “ within 1,000 feet of the border of the campus of an institution of higher education , as defined by the institution of higher education . ”
But it extends the forbidden zone to include “ related events ” such as concerts and sporting events .
Quoting the Fed : “ An event is related to an institution of higher education if the marketing of such event uses the name , emblem , mascot , or logo of an institution of higher education , or other words , pictures , symbols identified with an institution of higher education in a way that implies that the institution of higher education endorses or otherwise sponsors the event . ”
That likely means college football bowl games are off limits for card merchandisers , too .
Q : What items are included under “ prohibited inducements ? ”
A : The act bans any “ tangible item … such as a gift card , a T - shirt , or a magazine subscription ” but does not prohibit discounts , rewards points or promotional credit terms to attract customers .
The prohibition applies to mailings to students living on or near campus as well .
On the other hand , if the tangible item , such as a refreshment , is offered to a student regardless of whether they apply for a card , it is not considered an inducement .
The prohibitions apply solely to tangible offerings to college students on or near campus or at an event sponsored by an institution of higher education .
The card issuer , however , must have “ reasonable procedures ” in place to determine if an applicant is a college student before giving them the tangible item .
A : The Fed struck all reference to parents , legal guardians and spouses included in the original language , reasoning that simply any individual over 21 years of age “ having a means to repay debts incurred by the consumer ” may qualify as a co-signer .
Attention , college students 21 and older : Expect to be hit up by younger sorority sisters and fraternity brothers at co-signing parties .
Q : Who can request a credit line increase ?
A : The cardholder can make such a request with the written permission of their co-signer , who agrees to assume liability for the higher limit .
The permission form is not required if the co-signer makes the request however .
Q : What does the phrase “ an independent means of repaying ” credit card debt mean ?
A : Those younger than 21 must either secure a qualified co-signer , or provide financial information “ indicating an independent means of repaying ” their credit card debt .
What ’s that mean ?
According to the Fed , credit card issuers can request proof of ability to make minimum monthly payments that includes : salary , wages , tips , bonuses and commissions from full - or part - time jobs and self - employment as well as income from interest , dividends , child support , alimony payments , retirement benefits and public assistance .
Card issuers may request this proof from co-signers or under - 21 applicants .
See “ Want a credit card ?
Prove you can pay the bill ” for more details .
Q : Does a secured credit card qualify as an “ independent means of repaying ? ”
A : The Fed does n’t weigh in on this specifically .
Q : Does the Credit CARD
Act cover lines of credit ?
A : No. Although Title III referenced both credit card accounts and “ open - end consumer credit plans , ” such as lines of credit , the Fed excluded the latter because the act applies solely to card issuers .
Q : Are the requirements on card issuers triggered when they issue a card or open an account ?
A : Open an account .
Quoting the Fed : “ Otherwise , the provision could be construed to require card issuers to evaluate a cardholder ’s ability or obtain the signature of a co-signer even when a card is being sent to an existing cardholder to replace an expired card . ”

In Texas , the schools have been in session for two weeks now , and you can see the fatigue starting to set in .
The initial excitement of being back in school has worn off .
In the mornings , school parking lots are full of students with tired stares who are still getting used to getting up early for school .
So , how important is it to get a good night 's sleep ?
What is sleep doing for us , after all ?
It is strange that we do n't know more about what happens to the body and brain during sleep .
After all , we spend about a third of our lives asleep .
Think about it , by the time you turn 30 , you have spent about 10 years of your life asleep .
A review paper in the September , 2009 issue of Psychological Bulletin by Matthew Walker and Els van der Helm discusses some influences of sleep on .
They point out that there are a two key stages to learning new information .
First , there is the period in which you are exposed to the information .
Psychologists call that encoding .
Then , there is the period after you have been exposed to the information in which the information has to be locked into memory by affecting the connections between neurons in your brain .
This process of locking in the memory is called consolidation .
It turns out that sleep matters a lot for both aspects of memory .
Sleep deprivation ( and particularly deprivation of a particular stage of sleep called or sleep ) affects brain circuits that make it harder to remember new things .
It has a particularly big effect on information that is emotionally positive or neutral .
Because many things learned in school are emotionally positive or at least not negative , that means that lack of sleep can have a particularly large effect on information learned in school .
Sleep also affects the consolidation of memories .
There are a few influences that sleep has on this consolidation process .
First , quite a bit of memory consolidation happens during sleep , so disrupting sleep will make it harder for memories to be retained for the long term .
Second , sleep helps to separate the emotional component of a memory from the other content of a memory .
So , if a student has a bad interaction with a teacher or friend during the day , sleep will help make the memory feel less negative the next day .
Now , the way many people try to deal with a lack of sleep is to drink something with ( like coffee , soda , or Red Bull ) .
Caffeine does " wake you up . "
But it does not seem to revive the brain circuits involved in helping you to form memories .
Unfortunately , then , there is no liquid substitute for getting a good night 's sleep .
In the end , you need to sleep both to be prepared to learn new things and to make sure that the things you learn get locked into your brain .
THE FAMILIARITY OF GRAYSON’S RHETORIC … .
It seems freshman Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) has sparked something of a controversy with a speech on the House floor last night .
Republicans are pouncing on a late - night House floor speech from Rep. Alan Grayson , during which the freshman Florida Democrat said the Republican health care plan calls for sick people to “ die quickly . ”
“ It ’s a very simple plan , ” Grayson said in the speech Tuesday night .
“ Do n’t get sick .
That ’s what the Republicans have in mind .
And if you get sick America , the Republican health care plan is this : die quickly . ”
The after - hours speech , which included prominent banners behind the congressman to reinforce his point , drew immediate calls from some Republicans for an apology .
“ That is about the most mean - spirited partisan statement that I ’ve ever heard made on this floor , and I , for one , do n’t appreciate it , ” Tennessee Republican Rep. Jimmy Duncan told the Politico .
Conservatives are up in arms ; GOP offices are going after Grayson with a vengeance ; and Rep. Tom Price ( R - Ga. ) is introducing a House resolution to condemn the Florida Democrat , who has quickly developed a reputation for shooting from the hip .
Igor Volsky had a good piece on the substance of Grayson ’s remarks : “ No Republican wants Americans to die , but the party ’s efforts to stonewall meaningful health care reform perpetuate a status quo in which 45,000 Americans die every year because they lack health care coverage and thousands more see their policies canceled or denied by private insurers that are beholden to Wall Street ’s profit expectations and not patient health .
Grayson intentionally over - stated his case .
It ’s not that Republicans want to kill people ; it ’s that their opposition to meaningful health care reform and their “ free market ” alternatives would further deregulate insurers and allow companies to continue pushing individuals into high deductible policies that do n’t provide adequate coverage and actually harm Americans who ca n’t afford their medical bills . ”
As for the politics , is n’t it a little late in the game for congressional Republican to feign outrage about death - related rhetoric ?
Ryan Grim noted this morning , “ [ C ] harges that the opposition ’s health care plan will kill people have been about as common on the House floor lately as resolutions naming post offices . ”
Rep. Ginny Brown - Waite ( R - Fla . ) said Dem plans would tell seniors to “ drop dead . ”
Rep. Paul Broun ( R - Ga. ) said Democratic plans for a public option would “ kill people . ”
Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - N.C. ) said Dems ’ proposals might “ put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government . ”
Plenty of other House Republicans have made similar remarks , and not one of them has every apologized .
House Democrats have n’t even asked .
Grayson may have been deliberately provocative to highlight a larger point , but if “ die quickly ” is beyond the pale , the GOP should probably start lining up now , asking for forgiveness for months of dishonest fear - mongering .
For The Golden Compass :
Into this wild abyss ,
The womb of nature and perhaps her grave ,
Of neither sea , nor shore , nor air , nor fire ,
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly , and which thus must ever fight ,
Unless the almighty maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more worlds ,
Into this wild abyss the wary fiend
Stood on the brink of hell and looked a while ,
Pondering his voyage ...
-- John Milton , Paradise Lost , Book II
For The Amber Spyglass :
The morning comes , the night decays , the watchmen leave their stations ;
The grave is burst , the spices shed , the linen wrapped up ;
The bones of death , the cov'ring clay , the sinews shrunk & dry'd
Reviving shake , inspiring move , breathing , awakening ,
Spring like redeemed captives when their bonds & bars are burst ,
Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field ,
Let him look up into the heavens & laugh in the bright air ;
Let the inchained soul , shut up in darkness and in sighing ,
Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years ,
Rise and look out ; his chains are loose , his dungeon doors are open ;
And let his wife and children return from the oppressor 's scourge .
They look behind at every step & believe it is a dream ,
Singing : " The Sun has left his blackness & has found a fresher morning ,
And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear & cloudless night ;
For Empire is no more , and now the Lion & Wolf shall cease . "
-- from " America : A Prophecy " by William Blake
O stars ,
is n't it from you that the lover 's desire for the face
of his beloved arises ?
Does n't his secret insight
into her pure features come from the pure constellations ?
-- from " The Third Elegy " by Rainer Maria Rilke , translated by Stephen Mitchell
Fine vapors escape from whatever is doing the living .
The night is cold and delicate and full of angels
Pounding down the living .
The factories are all lit up ,
The chime goes unheard .
We are together at last , though far apart .
-- from " The Ecclesiast " by John Ashbery
A Numbers Game
Summer 2009 Jason Mark
From the Editor
At least since the days of Malthus , people have wondered when the planet will be too full of people .
During the last several generations – as the number of humans has grown exponentially and our use of resources has skyrocketed – the question has taken on particular force .
This place can feel intolerably crowded , and it seems only reasonable to ask :
How many more souls can we possibly fit ?
But I think that to wonder in 2009 when Earth will be overpopulated misses the point .
It seems obvious to me at least that we are already well past full .
The clearest proof of that are the 1.1 billion people who live without clean water , the more than 900 million people who are hungry , the 16,000 children who die every day from hunger - related causes .
Yes , I know that modern , chemical - based agriculture can grow enough food to feed 6.8 billion people and perhaps many more .
But the fact that millions still die from filthy water or insufficient food just shows that we are grappling with political scarcity as much as ecological scarcity .
And for those whose lives are all too nasty and short , the distinction does n’t matter one bit .
According to most projections , we will reach the 9 billion mark sometime around 2045 and then begin leveling off .
I suppose that the planet can accommodate that many Homo sapiens .
If we all lived modest lives as , say , farmers , pastoralists , and craftsmen and took good care of our ecological life - support systems , it just might work .
But 9 billion of us can’t live as Americans , or even like the slightly thriftier Europeans .
There are simply not enough resources .
That fact is why discussions of population are so complicated :
It ’s not just how many of us there are , but how much each of us consumes .
The tension between population and consumption is part of the reason why debates over US immigration ’s environmental impact is so fraught , as Kari Lydersen reports in “ Border War ” .
It clouds environmentalists ’ personal views on how many children to bear ( “ The Division Over Multiplication ” ) .
As Deborah Rich writes in “ Hold Steady ” , resolving the push - and - pull between population and consumption is key to efforts to create some kind of green economy .
When discussing human population and ecological sustainability , then , it ’s insufficient simply to cite numbers .
A tricky kind of calculus must also be figured in .
In a recent essay , eco-intellectual Bill McKibben wrote that we can’t address global climate change with addition alone : that is , one CFL at a time , one new bike lane town by town .
Saving the atmosphere will also require the multiplier effect of government policies that amplify individuals ’ actions .
The math metaphor is also useful for thinking about overpopulation .
There ’s no question that we need to first stabilize our numbers and then start to decrease them .
But subtraction wo n’t be enough .
We will also need to use some division .
For those already living in affluence , that division function will mean a radical reduction of material possessions ; for those who are poor , the division could bring an improvement in their quality of life .
On the far side of the equal sign , we will hopefully find a little more global equality .
On paper , the equation looks pretty straightforward .
The real question is whether we are smart enough to solve it in real life .
Five Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee who voted on Tuesday to shoot down a proposed public option for the health care reform bill — a measure which polls show is favored by 81 % of Democrats — are coming under close scrutiny for their ties to the health care industry .
According to Intershame.com — a site which aims to draw attention to misbehavior — those five senators have collectively been the recipients of over $ 19 million in donations from health care , pharmaceutical , and health insurance companies over the course of their Congressional careers .
ADVERTISEMENT
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - MT ) alone accounts for nearly $ 8 million of the total .
In addition , five of his former staff members — including two former chiefs of staff — are now lobbyists representing organizations with a strong interest in the health care bill .
Joan Walsh of Salon took Baucus to task for his vote , writing , “ So let ’s get this straight : Baucus admits the public option would ‘ hold insurance companies ’ feet to the fire , ’ but he voted against it ?
Is there any clearer evidence that Baucus is in the pocket of the health insurance industry ? ”
Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR ) comes in second on the Intershame list , with about $ 4 million in health industry donations , and Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) is third at around $ 3 million .
Like Baucus , both Lincoln and Conrad have former chiefs of staff who are now health industry lobbyists .
Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com did some number - crunching last June which revealed the extent to which health insurance donations can influence Congressional voting .
“ Lobbying contributions appear to have the largest marginal impact on middle - of - the - road Democrats , ” Silver wrote .
“ Liberal Democrats are likely to hold firm to the public option unless they receive a lot of remuneration from health care PACs .
Conservative Democrats may not support the public option in the first place for ideological reasons , although money can certainly push them more firmly against it .
But the impact on mainline Democrats appears to be quite large . ”
Calls are already appearing at places like the liberal message board Democratic Underground for progressives to sponsor primary challenges to all three senators .
ADVERTISEMENT
Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) at $ 2.5 million and Tom Carper ( D - DE ) at $ 1.5 million fill out the Intershame list .
Both voted in favor of the weaker Schumer version of a public option , which would not include robust measure to control costs , but against the stronger version proposed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller .
Carper has also been a prominent supporter of a “ trigger , ” which would activate a public option only “ if there is no meaningful competition after a couple of years . ”
“ If money is the reason these five Democrats rejected the public option , ” Intershame concludes , “ then it only took a little over 19 million dollars over 20 years to buy the five votes the health insurance industry needed to kill any meaningful reform to their industry .
19 million dollars is nothing compared to the profits the insurance industry will make if a public option is defeated .
They got a great deal for that 19 million .
The American people ?
Not so much . ”
YOWZA !
Burgers
We ’re having a week of burger posts at Foodo – so fire up those grills and git a move on !
~ Sean ~
This is a complex burger with multiple components and is not for the faint of heart .
At over 1 / 2 lb. of beef per serving you better come with a big appetite .
I do n’t want to know how many calories or grams of fat are in these bad boys , but my guess would be its a couple days worth .
Light your charcoal or fire up your grill then begin preparations .
For three out of four of us this was two meals .
Gannon , the smallest of us weighing in at a whopping 70 lbs was the only one who was able to eat the entire burger in one sitting !
A fair amount of work goes into these monsters but it ’s worth it .
Dig in
These were really good !
There was a lot going on in these burgers , that ’s for sure .
The original name does n’t really cut it so feel free to call it what you want .
How about Chipotle Carmelized Onion , Blue Cheese , Grilled Avo , BLT Buger .

Today we 're releasing the Sputnik JavaScript test suite .
Sputnik is a comprehensive set of more than 5000 tests that touch all aspects of the JavaScript language as defined in the ECMA - 262 standard .
Soon after the V8 project started we also began work on what would become the Sputnik tests .
The goal was to create a test suite based directly on the language spec that checked the behavior of every object , function and individual algorithm in the language .
The task was given to a team in Russia – hence the name " Sputnik " – which went about systematically producing tests .
As the test suite grew we used it to ensure that V8 conformed to the spec and to detect unexpected changes in our behavior .
Now that the test suite is complete we 're happy to be able to release it as an open source project , under the BSD license .
We hope Sputnik can be as useful to other implementers of JavaScript as it has been to us , particularly at a time where implementations change rapidly .
The goal is not that all implementations should pass all tests .
V8 set out with that intention and we learned the hard way that sometimes you have to be incompatible with the spec to be compatible with the web .
Rather , we want Sputnik to be a tool for identifying differences between implementations .
One of the biggest challenges for web developers today is the many incompatibilities between browsers .
Finding these differences is the first step towards removing them .
In an ideal world web developers would not have to worry about which browser is being used to view their site and users would not have to worry about whether a site supported their browser .
We hope the Sputnik tests will make the browser community take another step towards making that a reality .

An alternative to MS Windows , the most popular operating system in the world , comes at last from Korea .
A beta versiojn of the Tmax Window 9 operating system will be released in October and will be available for purchase in November .
TmaxCore introduced its new personal computer ( PC ) operating system , Tmax Window , at " TmaxDay2009 , " hosted at the Grand InterContinental Hotel in Seoul on July 7 , 2009 .
TmaxCore is an affiliate of TmaxSoft , the largest software company in Korea .
Tmax Window is a PC operating system that was developed over the past four years as an alternative to MS Windows .
It uses TmaxCore 's own technology to provide 100 % support for existing and future MS Windows applications , according to the developers of the OS .
The product launch for Tmax Window in November is expected to cause upheaval in the operating system market , which is currently dominated by Microsoft .
TmaxCore has consulted with vendors of computer parts and major PC manufacturers to conduct extensive interoperability and driver compatibility tests , and is now moving quickly toward releasing a finished product .
After a one - month test period starting in October , during which general users can " test - drive " the product for free , Tmax Window will be available for purchase .
The operating system provides the basic environment of the computer , and is required for the operation of other applications .
This makes the operating system an indispensable product for all personal computers .
The Korean market is even more lopsided , with MS Windows controlling 99 % of the market .
Essentially , there is no competition for Windows in Korea ; computer users have historically had no alternatives when it came to operating systems .
Until now .
Tmax Window offers the following features :- Compatibility with MS Windows and MS Office suite - Stability through microkernel and avoidance of " feature bloat " - Compatibility with applications from a wide range of operating systems -
A database management system ( DBMS ) included for efficient data management - Security settings that can be tailored to the individual or enterprise user -
User interface that feels familiar to users of MS Windows Furthermore , Tmax Window is expected to retail for much less than MS Windows .
At " TmaxDay2009 , " TmaxCore demonstrated the speed of the Tmax Window booting process , which is lighter and faster than that of MS Windows .
To prove Tmax Window compatibility with MS Windows applications , TmaxCore presenters ran MS Office and browsed the internet with Internet Explorer .
Ahn Il - soo , the CEO of TmaxCore , said , " When considering the underdeveloped and underinvested Korean software industry , the ambition of a Korean software company to participate in the world market by developing a PC operating system with its own technology not only holds significant meaning of historic proportions but can be considered the greatest challenge for any software company to undertake .
" The Korean software industry hopes that Tmax Window will lay the foundation for future growth , as the release of this locally developed operating system is expected to heighten the importance of the local software in the minds of the general public , and could potentially open doors for other local firms .
Park Dae-yeon , the Chairman of TmaxSoft , said , " In the future , software will be a driving force in enhancing Korea 's national competitiveness and a growth engine for the country ; this is why the advent of Tmax Window is a critical turning point in Korean software history .
With Tmax Window , which can be used not only in desktops but also in netbooks , ATMs and POS systems , TmaxSoft will take a lead in the global software market as well as the local Korean market .
" Also revealed for the first time were the TmaxCore products Tmax Office and Tmax Scoutor , an office product and a web browser respectively .
Tmax
Office supports the latest document formats and is compatible with MS Office files .
Tmax Scoutor is a robust internet browser that complies with international web standards and also supports ActiveX technology .
Dr. Park , the Chairman of TmaxSoft , highlighted the fact that as a part of the core infrastructure of nearly every industry , software sales will be a prominent future growth engine .
He also emphasized the need to create and support a wide range of software products , such as operating systems , databases , and middleware products .
The integration of these products to build stable , high - performance systems , he said , is crucial to ensure survival amid strong global competition .
TmaxCore was driven to develop an original operating system that would complement its database and middleware products .
With the release of Tmax Window , TmaxCore joins the ranks of companies like IBM and Microsoft -- companies that are capable of providing a complete range of software products .
After designing the leading Korean database and middleware products , Dr. Park set his sights on the operating system market .
His goal with Tmax Window was to break into the Korean software market , which has been largely dominated by MS Windows , and offer computer users a new choice .
Dr. Park said , " MS Windows virtually monopolizes the current domestic PC operating system market with a 99 % market share ; nearly 500 billion KRW ( $ 500 million ) of royalties each year have gone to overseas companies . "
He added , " This enormous market share has nowhere to go but down , and represents a golden opportunity for TmaxSoft . " Furthermore , Dr. Park was confident that Tmax Window 's revolutionary compatibility features -- unlike MS Windows , Tmax Window can run UNIX and MS Windows applications -- could change the future of the world .
Dr. Park left the crowd with these final thoughts : " If Tmax Window takes even 10 % of the world operating system market , the impact on Korea 's economy would be huge , generating 4.4 billion dollars in annual sales and creating more than one hundred thousand new jobs in Korea , " he said .
" If a giant global software company were to arise in Korea , as many as ten new global brands could be created , thanks to inter-industry effects . "
Sussex University student Hester Stewart died after taking GBL
Two " party " drugs linked to the death of young people will be banned under plans unveiled by the Home Office .
The move will make BZP - also known as herbal ecstasy - and industrial solvent GBL , sold as a " legal high " , illegal .
The parents of Hester Stewart , 21 , who died after taking GBL in Brighton last month , wrote to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith asking her to change the law .
And a coroner urged BZP to be banned after mortgage broker Daniel Backhouse , 22 , died after using the drug .
The proposal would categorise BZP - which Mr Backhouse had mixed with ecstasy powder - as a Class C drug .
' Changing environment '
Ms Smith said : " I am determined that we respond to the dangers of these drugs and that is why I have committed to controlling them .
" It is absolutely right that we continue to adapt our drug policy to the changing environment of substance misuse .
" This is the next step in tackling the unregulated market of so - called ' legal highs ' . "
BZP - made illegal in the Republic of Ireland earlier this year - would carry a UK prison term of up to two years for possession and 14 years for dealing .
The drug , originally a worming treatment for cattle , can cause serious heart problems , vomiting , anxiety attacks , mood swings and seizures .
GBL is taken as a substitute for party drug GHB , which is already outlawed .
The Home Office 's consultation paper on the drugs also includes proposals to ban some anabolic steroids , which have been linked to infertility and liver problems .
Unemployment in the Valley is now higher than it was after the dotcom bust .
The job market is so bad that some folks are giving up , quitting the tech industry , and going into healthcare ( and green - tech , which is n't exactly thriving right now , either ) .
Desperately awaiting the next big tech boom ...
Pui-Wing Tam , Wall Street Journal :
For much of last year , unemployment in Silicon Valley remained under control as the tech industry initially held up in the downturn .
But by late last year , tech spending had weakened , and companies such as eBay Inc. were announcing layoffs .
As a result , Silicon Valley 's unemployment rate -- which was below California 's average and largely tracked the national average last year -- has soared , surpassing the state average in May .
By June , the area 's unadjusted unemployment rate was 11.8 % , worse than California 's 11.6 % and the national rate of 9.7 % , according to the latest figures from California 's Employment Development Department .
The rate of job losses was particularly steep in sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing , where employment dropped more than 13 % in June from a year earlier .
Only a few segments of Silicon Valley 's economy are now showing growth .
Employment in the local health - care sector rose 4.2 % in June from a year ago , according to the EDD .
The clean - technology industry -- which covers energy efficiency and alternative energy , such as solar and wind power -- is also still attracting investment , pulling in $ 1.2 billion in venture - capital funding in the second quarter .

Chart : The Wall Street Journal
WASHINGTON  A year after he became a surprise of the Republican presidential field , Ron Paul is still on message .
" It is surreal that in a free country we are talking only about HOW government should fix health care , rather than WHY government should fix health care , " Paul , a Texas congressman and medical doctor , wrote in a recent Internet posting .
" This should be between doctors and patients . "
Running for president in 2008 , Paul raised more than $ 33 million and built a robust Internet following .
It did n't always translate into votes and never produced a primary victory , but it did help the libertarian build a platform for his free - market philosophy .
And he 's using it to sing a decidedly different song from Democratic and Republican choruses in Washington .
-
On the " Cash for Clunkers " program that gives government aid for people trading in old gas guzzlers , which will then be destroyed : a bad idea because it destroys a vital market for the poor .
" A new driver or new worker needs a cheap car , " Paul said .
-
On the release of two American journalists by North Korea to former President Bill Clinton : a " wonderful " confirmation of Paul 's contention that the U.S. should talk to and trade with North Korea .
" Despite this ranting about ' do n't talk to them , invade them , bomb them ' ... it is just great to show you can talk to people no matter how bad they look , " Paul said in a recent interview .
Long treated as a fringe voice even in his own party , Paul is not so alone these days .
His Campaign for Liberty has a reported 200,000 members .
The group has raised about $ 4 million so far this year , a fraction of what his presidential campaign took in , but notable during a recession .
His legislation requiring an audit of the Federal Reserve has 282 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives .
Paul , who turned 74 this week , says he would be " very disinclined " to run for president again , but has n't ruled it out .
Much has been written about the effective use of the Internet by mainstream politicians like Barack Obama , who has a reported 13 million e-mail contacts in a grassroots advocacy group outside the White House .
But the Web has helped outsiders like Paul , too .
Jesse Benton , a Paul adviser , says Paul 's frequent YouTube video messages have been seen 1.9 million times this year .
Paul argues in a recent video post that the U.S. should start trading with the nuclear - armed nation of North Korea , considered part of the " axis of evil " by the Bush administration .
" We started trading with China a long time ago , " Paul said .
" And they have become more capitalistic , not less .
While China has become more capitalistic , we have become more socialistic . "
Paul is distressed by the hundreds of billions in economic stimulus spending and health care reform proposals that could hit $ 1 trillion in costs .
The country , he predicted , is " a long way from the recession / depression ending , so there is going to be a lot more spending . "
That spending , Paul said , will eventually lead to inflation , which he calls a regressive tax on the poor who are disproportionately hurt when the costs of necessary goods go up .
" The most dangerous thing ( is ) that Washington is actually thinking they have solved the problem , " Paul said .
" There is a lot of money there , but people are still suffering . "

Counter - Strike Creator Reveals ' Tactical Intervention '
After seeing his amateur mod become an unprecedented hit , Le joined Valve in 2000 to work on Counter - Strike in a professional capacity .
According to IGN , Le worked on Counter - Strike 2 for a time , but the project " never really got off the ground " and was " put on the shelf . "
Feeling unwanted pressure to work on another big project , Le left Valve on good terms , moved into his parents ' basement , and began work on a project that would never see the light of day .
Since then , he has secured funding from South Korean IT company FIX Korea to develop Tactical Intervention , his new take on the terrorists vs. counter - terrorists theme .
" I enjoyed Counter - Strike , but I wanted to have my own game , " said Le . " I was never able to put in all the cool features I wanted because the people who played Counter - Strike would [ complain ] about all the changes .
They liked the game as it is . "
Tactical Intervention is reportedly based on a heavily - modified version of Valve 's Source engine .
The game will address many of the problems Le has with Counter - Strike , including lengthy rounds , camping , and sniper cheapness .
Said Le : " I hated how powerful snipers were in Counter - Strike .
They really unbalanced the game . "
According to Le , the game is nearly complete and will enter beta - testing soon .
A release is planned for later this year .

It 's Always Sunny ... in Space
By Steven Lloyd Wilson | Industry | August 10 , 2009 |
Glenn Howerton , Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day , creators ( and stars of ) “ It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia ” are developing a sci- fi comedy called “ Boldly Going Nowhere . ”
It focuses on the mundane day to day life of normal people who happen to live on a spaceship .
They ’ve already shot a version of the pilot but are going back to rewrite the script and reshoot it to have a bit more of a science fiction flavor to it .
It ’s a neat idea , with echoes of “ Red Dwarf ” and the meta - idea that good science fiction is about people who do n’t know they ’re in science fiction , they ’re just living their normal lives .
One of the reasons Star Wars was so successful was that it made space dirty , grimy and infested with selfish people instead of the shiny hypoallergenic pseudo - utopia of 2001 and the like .
Of course , I ’d watch this even if they just froze the characters from “ Always Sunny ” and woke them up in a thousand years .
Green Man … in space .
The Nightman Cometh … in space .
Everything is better if you add “… in space ” to the end .
Of course , they ’re talking to Fox , so the new pilot will probably end up shot over a weekend and have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the series , which will air at times decided by a random number generator , but only out of order on a Turkish game show channel .
Eventually we ’ll get to see all thirteen episodes on DVD at which point some other studio will make a feature film for us .
Random tidbit of the day : Steven Spielberg is producing an untitled show for TNT dealing with an alien invasion , starring Noah Wylie .
Noah Wylie , TNT ’s answer to Kevin Sorbo .
The best news though , in order to wash those horrid Teen Choda Awards from your palate was that the Hugo awards were presented yesterday .

TEL AVIV , Israel , July 8 ( UPI ) -- Despite differences between the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama and Israel over Iran and the Middle East peace process , and human - rights groups ' allegations of war crimes against the Palestinians , Washington continues to provide the Jewish state with billions of dollars ' worth of arms and equipment every year .
And there 's no sign that this will change any time soon .

Indeed , Obama has endorsed a military aid package worth up to $ 30 billion , without conditions , over the next 10 years that was set up by the administration of President George W. Bush in 2007 .
That represents a 25 percent increase in the vast U.S. military and security assistance given to Israel during the Bush administration .
With annual military aid of some $ 2 billion , Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. largesse in the world .
Arms sales have largely been an important instrument of U.S. foreign policy for many years .
But these days there are new dynamics to consider .
With the U.S. military transforming itself from a force designed to fight major conventional inter-state wars with armored phalanxes , carrier task forces and the biggest , most powerful air force in the world to one able to counter agile non-state insurgent forces , as in Iraq or Afghanistan , the vast U.S. defense industry needs to find other markets for its tanks , warships and fighter - bombers .
Hence the huge $ 30 billion package for Israel , which should help keep production lines for the F - 35 advanced stealth fighter and other big - ticket items going for a while .

Most of this military aid is simply a credit line to U.S. defense contractors since the money has to be spent on American systems .
As it is , the Israelis were only marked down for a $ 30 billion package because the Bush administration wanted to provide a weapons package for the Arab states , mainly Saudi Arabia and its partners in the Gulf , amounting to $ 20 billion over 10 years .
That , it said , was to bolster U.S. regional allies against an expansionist Iran .
To do that meant giving Gulf states access to advanced technology that had largely been reserved for the Israelis .
Thus Israel had to be kept sweet so it did not use its considerable clout in the U.S. Congress to block the proposed sales to the Arabs , as the Jewish state has done many times in the past to ensure its qualitative edge .
But when the Israelis invaded the Gaza Strip on Dec. 28 , 2008 , in considerable force with the declared objective of halting rocket attacks by the fundamentalist Hamas faction that ruled the territory , but ultimately seeking to crush its military capability , human - rights groups appealed to the outgoing Bush administration to halt arms supplies to the Jewish state .
Amnesty International and others argued that the Israeli forces were committing war crimes by killing large numbers of civilians -- men , women and children -- and using U.S. - supplied weapons to do it .
Bush demurred .
Obama also refused after he took office in January 2009 .
That was two days after Israel called off its 22 - day war , apparently so as not to offend the incoming U.S. president .

" Obama has thus far failed to realize that the problem in the Middle East is that there are too many deadly weapons in the region , not too few , " says Stephen Zunes , who heads the Middle Eastern Studies program at the University of San Francisco and is a longtime regional affairs analyst .
" Instead of simply wanting Israel to have an adequate deterrent against potential military threats , Obama insists the United States should guarantee that Israel maintain a qualitative military edge , " Zunes added in an assessment published in Foreign Policy in Focus in March .
" Thanks to this overwhelming advantage over its neighbors , Israeli forces were able to launch devastating wars against Israel 's Palestinian and Lebanese neighbors in recent years . "
That was a reference to a 34 - day war Israel fought with Lebanon 's Hezbollah guerrillas , backed by Iran and Syria , in July and August 2006 .
Now , the Americans are concerned that while they are trying to open a dialogue with Iran over its nuclear program , the Israelis , who see that as a mortal threat to their existence as a nation , will launch pre-emptive strikes against Iran -- using U.S. - supplied weapons systems .
In fiscal 2008 , U.S. foreign military sales totaled $ 36 billion , 50 percent up on 2007 .
According to Frida Berrigan of the New America Foundation 's Arms and Security Initiative , sales in the first half of 2009 reached $ 27 billion and could hit $ 40 billion for the year .
Some experts predict that over the next decade arms will be the single biggest U.S. export , with Israel taking a big chunk , such as up to 75 of the new F - 35 stealth fighters .

The problem with averages , says Sam L. Savage , is that “ plans based on average assumptions are wrong on average . ”
This is the thesis of his new book , “ The Flaw of Averages ” ( John Wiley & Sons Inc. , $ 22.95 ) .
He argues that this flaw helped to mask the subprime - mortgage crisis and contributed to General Motors Corp . ’s bankruptcy , among countless other disasters .
It is the flaw of averages that causes businessmen , engineers , generals and others to underestimate risk in the face of uncertainty .
To make his point immediately clear , Mr. Savage , whose father was a highly acclaimed statistician at the University of Chicago and author of “ The Foundations of Statistics , ” cites the apocryphal example of the statistician who drowned while wading across a river that was , on average , only three feet deep .
“ In everyday life , ” said Mr. Savage , “ the flaw of averages ensures that plans based on average customer demand , average completion time , average interest rate and other uncertainties are below projection , behind schedule and beyond budget . ”
When people use a single number , usually a historical average , to predict the future , they invite systematic errors and generate unintended consequences , mostly negative , argues Mr. Savage , who received his doctorate in 1973 in the application of computers to operations research .
The subject of his dissertation was “ computational complexity . ”
Today he is a consulting professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University and a fellow of the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge .
Virtually no institution , profession or household can avoid the consequences of the flaw of averages , asserts Mr. Savage , who has helped to devise a solution that has recently been made possible in part by the exponential increase in computer power .
Terri Dial quickly grasped the concept of the flaw of averages years ago .
“ Consider a drunk staggering down the middle of a busy highway , ” Mr. Savage told a group of Wells Fargo bank executives in 1995 .
“ And assume that his average position is the center line .
Then the state of the drunk at his average position is alive , but on average he ’s dead . ”
Ms. Dial , who began her Wells Fargo career as a teller in the 1970s , immediately exclaimed , “ That ’s the reason we always blow the budget on our incentive plan ! ”
Since the number of checking accounts sold by employees averaged 200 per year , the bank decided to give $ 1,000 bonuses to workers who performed above average , Ms. Dial explained by way of a simple example .
The bonus of the average employee would be zero .
So zero must be the average bonus , right ?
Wrong .
Roughly half the employees will exceed the average , so the average bonus will be about $ 500 , much higher than Wells Fargo projected .
On a grander scale , Mr. Savage argues , the flaw of averages caused the subprime - mortgage debacle , which precipitated a worldwide crisis that threatened to bring down the global financial system .
The housing bubble relentlessly inflated during the first half of this decade , and subprime mortgages flourished across the country , especially in bubble areas .
In those regions , such as California and Florida , middle - income families with decent credit histories could not qualify for prime mortgages given the prices of the houses they were buying and the down payments they were offering .
No problem .
Regression lines , based on the trend of average home prices and extended into the future , projected uninterrupted increases in home values .
Subprime adjustable - rate mortgages were especially popular because of their initially low “ teaser ” interest rates .
After home prices continued to soar , providing the homeowners with substantial equity , they could easily refinance into a 30 - year fixed - rate prime mortgage .
“ Astonishingly , ” Mr. Savage notes , the possibility that home prices could decline “ was not even considered by some of the risk models monitoring the economy , ” including , reportedly , a model used by Standard & Poor ’s , which rated as AAA thousands of securities backed by subprime mortgages .
“ This is like a model of coin flips that generates only heads ” he exclaimed .
And it exquisitely illustrates the flaw of averages , he argues .
The rest is history .
Now consider GM .
The auto giant had spent years producing and selling gas - guzzling sport utility vehicles epitomized by the Hummer .
SUVs were extremely profitable , and they sold briskly for years , even after gas prices began rising early this decade .
GM ran the numbers based on past averages and continued to produce millions of gas - guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks , virtually ignoring the hybrid market .
GM did not appreciate how risky its business model had become .
“ It ’s very different when someone says , ‘ There is a risk that gas prices will go up , ’ compared to when someone says , ‘ If gas prices go up by 50 percent , we have at least a 60 percent chance of bankruptcy , ’ ” explains Mr. Savage .
Mr. Savage is at the forefront in developing a new methodology called probability management .
He claims that probability management can avoid the systematic errors and unwelcome unintended consequences inherent in relying on single numbers and trends , usually historical averages .
Probability management is still in its infancy , Mr. Savage stresses , and much work needs to be done .
He is now working with companies such as Merck & Co. Inc. , the big pharmaceutical firm , and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , an oil giant , to put probability management into day - to - day use .
Mr. Savage has developed new computer simulation modeling software for Shell , Merck and others .
The software can graphically depict the precise probability of success of any venture pursued with a particular strategy , based on thousands of potential outcomes .
“ Eventually , it should be possible for firms to create consolidated , auditable risk statements , which may provide more warning about future financial upheavals of the kind we had in 2008 , ” said Mr. Savage , who will soon offer an inexpensive version of his software .
Probability management is a data - management system in which the entities being managed are not numbers but uncertainties .
Mr. Savage identifies an uncertainty as a probability distribution , which essentially represents a range of possible outcomes .
These distributions are used to test the stability of uncertain business plans , engineering designs or military campaigns .
It is essential to replace numbers , usually historical averages , with distributions to cure the flaw of averages , Mr. Savage said .
There are input probability distributions , which correspond to uncertain demand levels for a product , the magnitude of potential earthquakes or the sizes of enemy forces .
And there are output probability distributions , which correspond to the profit of a business , the deflection of the bridge or the number of battle casualties .
The central database is a “ scenario library ” that contains thousands of potential future values of uncertain variables .
Probability management relies on interactive computer simulations capable of performing thousands of probability calculations and storing thousands of numbers in a single cell of a spreadsheet .
These calculations and numbers represent the interaction of an enormous number of interrelated variables , and they gauge the probability of a seemingly limitless number of possible future outcomes .
“ Simulation does for uncertainty what the light bulb does for darkness , ” Mr. Savage said .
“ It does n’t eliminate uncertainty any more than light bulbs prevent the sun from setting .
But simulation can illuminate the flaw of averages just as the bulb illuminating your basement staircase reduces the odds that you will break your neck . ”
Building on his analogy , Mr. Savage continued : “ Electricity is to light bulbs as input probability distributions are to simulation . ”
Because most people who use light bulbs have no idea how to generate their own electricity , they consume electricity generated by experts and distributed through the power grid .
Most managers have no idea how to generate input distributions , so they rely on statisticians , engineers and econometricians , who generate and supply probability distributions .
The scenario libraries , the repositories of corporate intelligence on uncertainty , perform the role that the power grid plays for the light bulb .
Complex business interrelationships that are invisible when historical averages are used suddenly become visible through the computer simulation of countless potential outcomes .
In the case of the housing bubble , input and output probability distributions would certainly have considered the prospect of plunging home values — unlike some risk models emphasizing historical averages .
In the case of GM , computer - simulated graphics would have demonstrated the riskiness of its business model and displayed the precise odds of its looming catastrophe .
To wit : “ If gas prices go up by 50 percent , we have at least a 60 percent chance of bankruptcy . ”
As home prices and GM ’s SUV output both soared , Ms. Dial left Wells Fargo and landed in Britain .
Her 2005 arrival and brief tenure as chief executive of Lloyds TSB Retail Bank was heralded by the British press as “ the human cyclone in London . ”
At her instigation , Mr. Savage and a colleague initiated a series of courses for Lloyds executives at Cambridge University .
By all accounts , Ms. Dial performed admirably at Lloyds — so much so that Citigroup , the beleaguered U.S. financial giant brought to its knees by the subprime - mortgage crisis , hired her away from Lloyds last year to run its flagging U.S. consumer business .
Time will tell whether Mr. Savage ’s early recruit in his campaign to overwhelm the flaw of averages will succeed at Citigroup .
In describing the challenges facing the former bank teller , Mr. Savage set the stakes for his protege : Human Cyclone Meets the Financial Tsunami .

Some 1400 years ago , across the arid Arabian Peninsula roamed disparate savage tribes in a constant state of war with one another .
Acts of violence , pillage and slave trading were their way of life .
Out of necessity and expediency , they refrained from active warfare for only one month a year - the month of Moharam ( the forbidden month ) .
Even during this lull in active warfare , the various tribes rearmed and prepared for the next eleven months of bloodletting .
Violence of the worst kind and form was their way of life .
Although the ongoing warfare inflicted great suffering and death , it remained the major means of livelihood for the survivors in the harsh desert that sustained little other than the hardy goats , desert - suited camels and the indispensable vehicles of war - horses .
Violent death ruled .
The victor had a reprieve for a time ‘ til he became the victim .
Then there was a new summons .
An orphan from the tribe of Quraish by the name of Muhammad , the son of the late Abdullah , offered the savages a deal they could n't refuse .
He said that they should stop worshiping all the various idols in the idolatry of Mecca and turn to the one and only god , Allah , one of their numerous idols .
He said it is Allah who is the creator of the universe and Allah has another world of immense bounty and pleasure .
He promised the savages that by embracing Allah , banding together and carrying out his commands they assure themselves of great worldly spoils as well as eternal admission to a glorious paradise .
Muhammad promised further that instead of warring against one another , as they have done for millennia , for pittance of reward , they could venture out beyond the impoverished desert into a world of great wealth and bounties .
Muhammad motivated his rapidly growing body of followers to rally around him by proclaiming , ( 1 ) if they are victorious they will have the treasures of the infidels as well as their women and children as slaves to hold or sell , ( 2 ) if the faithful kill the infidels in doing the work of Allah , further reward awaits them in paradise and , ( 3 ) in the unlikely event that they are killed , they find themselves in Allah 's glorious paradise for an eternal life of joy and bliss .
The outlandish , frequently confused and often contradictory incoherent rhetoric of Muhammad made the less gullible few question his sanity .
They dismissed him as , " Insane Poet . "
Yet , the generality of the savages found in him their savior -- the one who would lead them to all the good in this world and the next .
It was a win -win proposition for them .
Win and you are rewarded handsomely , lose your life , and you go directly to heaven .
How could they refuse ?
Muhammad preached that earthly life is a small price to pay for eternal life .
It is the next life that the faithful should seek .
Hence , Islam can rightfully be considered a cult of death , not life .
It will never run out of volunteers to sacrifice their life until Islam itself expires .
Gladly placing their lives on the line , sword in hand , on the steed of greed , the well - adapted killers of Arabia sallied outward under the banner of Islam .
In a space of a few centuries , they rampaged through much of the civilized world and inflicted death and great destruction in their path .
An early victim of these marauding conquerors was Persia - Iran -- arguably one of the greatest civilizations known to humanity .
It was the ancient Iranians who gave humanity its first charter of human rights , championed the ideals of tolerance , justice and autonomy of the diverse peoples in their vast empire .
Islam systematically destroyed that civilization and , over time , tried its utmost to replace it with a way of thinking and behaving rooted in the tribal past .
Millions of Iranians resisted the savagery and paid with their lives .
Some were forced to live under jazyyeh -- poll tax levied on non-Muslims .
Others lost their identity and heritage and embraced the ways of their new rulers .
It is this band , an oppressive tyrannical minority , that is presently ruling Iran .
Yet , even under the rule of Islamofascism , the overwhelming majority of Iranians of various ethnicity and religion , remain faithful to their ancient creed -- a creed that was given to the world by Zoroaster .
The faith of Zoroaster , based on the triad of Good Thought , Good Speech and Good Deed , constituted the standard of life for the Persian .
Other teachings of the faith of Zoroaster , arguably the most ancient divine religion , have inspired the teachings of other faiths .
The influence of Zoroastrianism in Judaism , for instance , is so compelling that some religious scholars have called Judaism , " Moses through Zoroastrian eyes . "
Furthermore , it was during the rule of the Zoroastrian kings of Persia that the Old Testament was for the first time recorded in written form .
Teachings such as Good and Evil , Heaven and Hell , Resurrection , and Paradise derive from the Faith of Zoroaster .
In reality , both Judaism and Christianity have their roots in Zoroastrianism .
W.Y. Evans - Wentz , an Oxford professor , one of the world 's leading authorities on Eastern mysticism and religion , contends , " Without Zarathustra there would be no Christ .
" The spiritual bond between the faith of Zoroaster and Christianity is further evidenced by the travel of the three Zoroastrian Magi who anticipated the birth of the infant Jesus and traveled from Iran to celebrate his birth .
It is evident that Islam succeeded in stifling the magnificent Persian civilization .
Once again with renewed vigor , militant Islam is aiming to destroy another civilization -- the Judeo - Christian civilization , a civilization that constitutes a living falsification of the Islamic primitive and backward creed .
Islamofascism presents a clear and present danger , not only to Western civilization , but to the entire civilized world as is evidenced by the ruling Islamists in Iran .
Iran of today , on the one hand , has the potential of rapidly becoming a nuclear state and becoming a formidable adversary that would not settle for anything less than the total subjugation of the free world .
On the other hand , in Iran 's people and culture is a genuine potential for replacing the doomsday - bent Mullahcracy and making Iran the free world 's staunchest partner in the Islamic world .

September 22 , 2009 -- Morning Star --
Democracy activists in Swaziland celebrated on September 22 after the leader of the country 's opposition was acquitted of terrorism charges and freed from prison after 340 days .
Banned People 's United Democratic Movement ( PUDEMO ) leader Mario Masuku ( pictured above ) was arrested and charged with terrorism on November 15 , 2008 .
The charge centred on seditious statements he had allegedly made during the funeral of a militant .
Judge Mbutfo Mamba acquitted Mr Masuku because the evidence was too weak to link him to the charge .
As Mr Masuku left the court amid scenes of jubilation , he told his comrades that the struggle for democracy and human rights in Africa 's last absolute monarchy had only just begun .
In a message to all its supporters , PUDEMO spokesperson Zakhele Mabuza said : " The war still continues until the total liberation of the oppressed people of Swaziland .
We have no doubt that you will still be fighting on our side even beyond this trial , for we now need to channel our energies towards ensuring that the royal regime is taken down brick by brick . "
PUDEMO statement on the release of President Mario Masuku
By Zakhele Mabuza , PUDEMO national spokesperson
September 22 , 2009 -- The Peoples United Democratic Movement ( PUDEMO ) wishes to formally inform its members , allies and friends both at home and abroad of the acquittal and release of its president , Comrade Mario Masuku , a few hours ago .
He had been charged for allegedly making ``seditious statements '' and ``supporting terrorism ' ' .
He had been in detention since November 2008 .
Since his detention and subsequent banning of PUDEMO , Masuku and his organisation have remained resilient and refused to be intimidated by the oppressive and archaic tactics of the state .
In court , the state failed to provide evidence and information to sustain the fabricated charge , hence Justice Mbutfo Mamba dismissed the case and granted Comrade Masuku his freedom .
Support and solidarity
PUDEMO wishes to express its appreciation for the unwavering support and solidarity displayed by our friends and allies both at home and abroad .
They played an instrumental role in adding more pressure on the royal regime to release Comrade Masuku .
We know this was only a battle and the war continues until the total liberation of the oppressed people of Swaziland .
We have no doubt that you will still be fighting on our side even beyond this trial , for we now need to channel our energies towards ensuring that the royal regime is taken down brick by brick until its foundation is destroyed !
The legal team
We mentioned last week that as PUDEMO , we are very pleased with our legal team .
This is a team of lawyers who have always fought fearlessly for the rights of the people .
We wish to thank them for their excellent work and until Swazis are liberated they must know the challenge is still there and hope more lawyers will realise this and join the fight for the liberation of the politically oppressed and abused masses of our country .
The Masuku family
Throughout the challenge , the Masuku family has remained in support of Comrade Masuku and has never turned around to curse PUDEMO .
This is because the family completely understands PUDEMO 's mission of liberating the oppressed people of Swaziland .
We salute Mrs Masuku for her resilence in the face of hostile and challenging circumstances that she was subjected to .
But like a true fighter , she has remained strong and focused together with the entire extended Masuku family .
The way forward
The release of our president does not mean the people of Swaziland are now free .
PUDEMO remains committed to ensure the full liberation and transformation of our people is realised as it is clearly explained in our document The Roadmap to a Democratic Swaziland , adopted in our sixth national congress in Matsulu in 2006 .
Work therefore shall continue in spite of the dangers , threats , intimidation , kidnappings , assaults , torture , random raids , etc. constantly meted out by the oppressive regime on our members .
We therefore , shall continue to fight side by side with all our democracy - loving friends and allies until final victory !
Joint Swazi Action Campaign Committee ( South Africa ) salutes PUDEMO President Mario Masuku on his firm stance until the day of his release and calls for the intensification of the struggle for democracy
Sensing that the Opposition was not keen to object to his proposal , the chief minister quickly announced tabling of a resolution in this regard in the on - going session .
Yeddyurappa said the resolution , if approved by both the Houses of the Legislature , would be sent to the Centre , as a means to impress upon it the necessity to enact a legislation .
“ There is a need for a national debate on the subject .
Let us start it from Karnataka by passing the resolution in both the Houses , ” he stated .
If not a legislation , the government has the right to stop all facilities to parents having , or intend to have , more than two children .
If the opposition parties cooperate , a decision can be taken , the CM added .
Yeddyurappa further said : “ In all these years we have not managed to provide even the basic facilities to the poor and it is better to take preventive steps before the situation goes out of hand . ”
This policy is not for those who can afford a decent living but for those who are below the poverty line ( BPL ) .
The CM categorically stated that any new norm on family planning will not affect existing BPL families but was one for the future .
Earlier , Opposition leader V S Ugrappa asked the government to table a resolution in the House in this regard and not to restrict it to mere lip service .
“ The growing population was a major challenge to not just the State but the entire country , " he stated .
But the CM ’s new interest in the two - child norm , which he evidently developed during his recent China visit , drew criticism from the JD( S ) .
Senior JD( S ) leader M C Nanaiah gave the example of Western Europe where the fall in population has reduced the quality of peoples ’ lives .
That ’s the headline on this article from St. Petersburg Times : “ Cuba ’s leaders see private farmers as key to saving socialism . ”
It is an interesting read , further documenting the failure of all forms of socialism .
Someone in the White House should read this .
But is the notion itself absurd ?
The undoing of socialism is the solution being discussed here .
The idea that this somehow saves socialism is about as silly as the idea of government stimulus saving capitalism .
In 1991 , Phillip Johnson published Darwin on Trial .
In 1996 , Michael Behe published Darwin ’s Black Box .
In 1998 , William Dembski published The Design Inference .
While numerous other books on the subject have been published , these three books are considered landmark works in the discussion over intelligent design .
Now there is a fourth .
Stephen C. Meyer ’s new book , Signature in the Cell , may be the most persuasive case for intelligent design yet published .
The timing could not be better , since 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species .
Stephen Meyer received his Ph.D. from Cambridge in the philosophy of science .
He directs the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle .
He has authored or co-authored numerous books and articles , but I will venture to guess that Signature in the Cell will be the one for which he is remembered .
Meyer ’s book differs from the others mentioned above in that he makes the case for intelligent design on the basis of the information ( the digital code ) stored in DNA .
Meyer makes his case by means of a running personal narrative , describing his own discovery and examination of what he calls “ the DNA enigma .
” The first two chapters provide some context for the discussion to follow .
Here Meyer provides some insights into the scientific and philosophical issues that are at stake .
In chapters 3 - 5 , Meyer looks in detail at what it is any scientific theory about the origin of life must explain .
Here he describes the DNA enigma in detail .
Chapters 6 - 7 look at what scientists in the past have theorized about the origin of life .
In chapters 8 - 14 , Meyer examines the various theories that have been and are being offered to explain the origin of life .
Chapters 15 - 16 then present Meyer ’s positive case for intelligent design .
The final chapters ( 17 - 20 ) defend intelligent design against the most common objections .
Signature in the Cell is absolutely fascinating .
For over twenty years , I have been reading books on the relationship between science and faith , creation , evolution , intelligent design , the interpretation of Genesis 1 , and Meyer ’s book is without question one of the top 5 .
Those who are committed to an atheistic and materialist philosophy will be all over this book , but I am slightly optimistic that it may actually change the nature of the debate among scientists who are interested in going where the evidence leads .
In fact , one of the most helpful sections of this book deals with the very definition of “ science , ” an issue that has hindered helpful discussions and debates .
Although I enthusiastically recommend Meyer ’s book to any who are interested in the scientific study of the origin of life , I do want to raise one important point .
Advocates of intelligent design are directing most of their efforts toward addressing scientific questions and objections .
They are not addressing the questions theologians might have about the implications of their work .
If they were , it would probably bring more criticism down upon their heads .
Be that as it may , Christian theologians do need to ask questions about the implications of their works .
The most serious theological problem I run across in the writings of certain intelligent design proponents can be illustrated by a quote from Michael Behe ’s book Darwin ’s Black Box .
On page 203 , Behe writes :
We must also consider the role of the laws of nature … .
If a biological structure can be explained in terms of those natural laws , then we cannot conclude that it was designed .
I find this idea expressed either implicitly or explicitly in many books and articles by intelligent design advocates , but it is not acceptable to Christians .
Why ?
Because God designed things that can be explained in terms of natural laws as well as those that cannot .
In fact , God designed the natural laws themselves !
God not only designed irreducibly complex biological systems ;
He designed simple biological systems .
He designed everything .
It is the failure to deal with this issue adequately that has led many to see in the work of some intelligent design proponents a “ God of the gaps ” argument .
Another related issue that some proponents of intelligent design do not take into account is the relationship between primary and secondary causes .
Just because science can explain the secondary causes behind some natural phenomenon does not rule out the existence of the primary cause , namely God .
A good example of this is seen in the development of a child from the joining of a sperm cell and an egg cell .
We know from Scripture that God created each of us in the womb ( e.g. Ps. 139:13 ) , but scientists can also trace the development of a child from the point of fertilization through birth .
We do not have to choose between the primary and the secondary cause .
Both exist , and both are in operation .
From a Christian perspective , if Meyer ’s formulation of the intelligent design argument is true , then what he is observing is an instance in which the primary cause ( God ) , operating apart from any secondary cause ( natural laws , etc. ) , left visible evidence in the material world - specifically in the genetic code found in DNA .
Now what if scientists do someday discover a natural explanation ?
Does this rule out the existence of God ?
To read some intelligent design proponents , you would be hard pressed to avoid that conclusion .
It does n’t , however , as long as we understand that God is also working through the secondary causes that scientists study every day .
All of this being said , Meyer ’s book is a must - read .
It will certainly encourage proponents of intelligent design .
We can only hope that it will also encourage intelligent discussion .

President Obama announced that he will reappoint Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank ( Fed ) , and I ’m more than OK with the president ’s decision .
Bernanke ’s policies over the past year and a half have put the Fed in a precarious position , but Bernanke says he has an “ exit strategy ” and it ’s just as well that he ’s staying to try to implement it .
If he was replaced now , his successor could , with some justification , blame the Fed ’s difficult situation on Bernanke , and Bernanke could counter that he had an exit strategy his successor should have implemented .
Now it will be Bernanke ’s responsibility .
Perhaps the biggest legacy of Bernanke ’s tenure as Fed chair , regardless of how long he stays , is his expansion of the Fed ’s toolbox for dealing with economic downturns .
Prior to Bernanke ’s tenure , the Fed ’s primary activity was controlling the quantity of money through open market operations , which was undertaken by buying and selling Treasury securities .
Bernanke greatly expanded the Fed ’s asset portfolio by purchasing securities from private and semi-private issuers .
It bought from money market funds , and still owns a substantial amount of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac .
This goes well beyond the Fed ’s policy pre-Bernanke .
Also prior to Bernanke ’s tenure , the Fed made “ discount ” loans to banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System .
Bernanke expanded the use of discount loans , making them available to financial institutions that not only were not Fed members but were n’t even commercial banks .
Again , this goes well beyond the Fed ’s pre-Bernanke policy .
And , the Fed stepped in to rescue AIG as it was collapsing , also unprecedented .
This is all history now , and would be Bernanke ’s legacy whether he stayed or was replaced .
This expansion in the activities of the Fed sets a precedent — I think , a bad one — for future Fed action in the face of economic downturns .
Essentially , the Fed was engaging in industrial policy as it was propping up the financial system , deciding that some firms would survive ( Goldman Sachs ) , some would go under ( Lehman Brothers ) , and some would be taken over by other institutions ( Bear Sterns , Merrill Lynch ) .
It ’s worth a remark , and probably even more extensive discussion than I ’ve given here , because with all the attention focused on the Fed ’s expansion of the monetary base , I ’ve seen little written about the discretionary policy the Fed followed as it expanded its set of policy tools to deal with the downturn .
For this reason , I ’m not a Bernanke fan .
Now , with the Fed holding a massive amount of excess bank reserves , the Fed must keep those reserves from being lent and entering the money supply , or inflation will skyrocket .
Bernanke knows this , and his exit strategy , not explained in detail , would mop up these reserves to hold inflation in check .
The problem is , any method of mopping up these reserves would cause interest rates to rise , and as long as the recovery is fragile , Bernanke will be reluctant to do this .
There is the real risk that Bernanke wo n’t want to see higher interest rates until inflation starts to appear , and that by then it will be too late to stop a more substantial inflation .
This problem is a result of Bernanke ’s policies , and I support leaving Bernanke in charge of the Fed to deal with the problem .
To put someone else in at this point would allow the new Fed chairman to put the blame on Bernanke ; to leave Bernanke in charge clearly locates all the responsibility with him .
He says he has an exit strategy , and while I hope it works , I ’m concerned enough to think that it wo n’t .
Bernanke is a smart guy , and very knowledgeable , so I have no complaint with him on those grounds .
I do believe , however , that he is overly ambitious in his view of the Fed ’s agenda .
Keeping inflation in check should be the Fed ’s first priority , and Bernanke ’s more expansive view of the Fed ’s role is likely to distract him from that primary goal .
Another problem I see with Bernanke ’s tenure is the close relationship that has developed between the Fed and the Treasury .
Bernanke is helping the Treasury finance it ’s huge deficit , and that too will prove inflationary if it keeps up .
To keep inflation in check , Bernanke should reestablish the Fed ’s independence from the Treasury and make it clear that as the recovery progresses , the Fed will design monetary policy to prevent inflation , and the Treasury will be on its own to finance the deficit .
Bernanke is in the best position to do this , because he can say that his actions of the past two years were designed to deal with an extraordinary situation , and with the recovery underway the Fed will be turning its attention back to price level stability , which should be its first priority .
A new Fed chairman could be accused of turning his back on the “ successful ” Bernanke policies if he were to try to reassert the Fed ’s independence .
While I ’m not a Bernanke fan , I do think he is in a better position than any other plausible candidate to steer the Fed on the right course , and if he fails to do so , it will be easier to identify who ’s to blame than if someone else stepped in at this point .
Obama and Osama are at last participating in the same narrative .
For the US president 's critics – indeed , for many critics of the West 's military occupation of Afghanistan – are beginning to speak in the same language as Obama 's ( and their ) greatest enemy .
There is a growing suspicion in America that Obama has been socked into the heart of the Afghan darkness by ex-Bushie Robert Gates – once more the Secretary of Defence – and by journalist - adored General David Petraeus whose military " surges " appear to be as successful as the Battle of the Bulge in stemming the insurgent tide in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq .
No wonder Osama bin Laden decided to address " the American people " this week .
" You are waging a hopeless and losing war , " he said in his 9/11 eighth anniversary audiotape .
" The time has come to liberate yourselves from fear and the ideological terrorism of neoconservatives and the Israeli lobby . "
There was no more talk of Obama as a " house Negro " although it was his " weakness " , bin Laden contended , that prevented him from closing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In any event , Muslim fighters wold wear down the US - led coalition in Afghanistan " like we exhausted the Soviet Union for 10 years until it collapsed " .
Funny , that .
It 's exactly what bin Laden told me personally in Afghanistan – four years before 9/11 and the start of America 's 2001 adventure south of the Amu Darya river .

Almost on cue this week came those in North America who agree with Obama – albeit they would never associate themselves with the Evil One , let alone dare question Israel 's cheerleading for the Iraqi war .
" I do not believe we can build a democratic state in Afghanistan , " announces Dianne Feinstein , the California Democrat who chairs the senate intelligence committee .
" I believe it will remain a tribal entity . "
And Nancy Pelosi , the House Speaker , does not believe " there is a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan " .
Colin Kenny , chair of Canada 's senate committee on national security and defence , said this week that " what we hoped to accomplish in Afghanistan has proved to be impossible .
We are hurtling towards a Vietnam ending " .
Close your eyes and pretend those last words came from the al - Qa'ida cave .
Not difficult to believe , is it ?
Only Obama , it seems , fails to get the message .
Afghanistan remains for him the " war of necessity " .
Send yet more troops , his generals plead .
And we are supposed to follow the logic of this nonsense .
The Taliban lost in 2001 .
Then they started winning again .
Then we had to preserve Afghan democracy .
Then our soldiers had to protect – and die – for a second round of democratic elections .
Then they protected – and died – for fraudulent elections .
Afghanistan is not Vietnam , Obama assures us .
And then the good old German army calls up an air strike – and zaps yet more Afghan civilians .
It is instructive to turn at this moment to the Canadian army , which has in Afghanistan fewer troops than the Brits but who have suffered just as ferociously ; their 130th soldier was killed near Kandahar this week .
Every three months , the Canadian authorities publish a scorecard on their military " progress " in Afghanistan – a document that is infinitely more honest and detailed than anything put out by the Pentagon or the Ministry of Defence – which proves beyond peradventure ( as Enoch Powell would have said ) that this is Mission Impossible or , as Toronto 's National Post put it in an admirable headline three days ' ago , " Operation Sleepwalk " .
The latest report , revealed this week , proves that Kandahar province is becoming more violent , less stable and less secure – and attacks across the country more frequent – than at any time since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
There was an " exceptionally high " frequency of attacks this spring compared with 2008 .
There was a 108 per cent increase in roadside bombs .
Afghans are reporting that they are less satisfied with education and employment levels , primarily because of poor or non-existent security .
Canada is now concentrating only on the security of Kandahar city , abandoning any real attempt to control the province .
Canada 's army will be leaving Afghanistan in 2011 , but so far only five of the 50 schools in its school - building project have been completed .
Just 28 more are " under construction " .
But of Kandahar province 's existing 364 schools , 180 have been forced to close .
Of progress in " democratic governance " in Kandahar , the Canadian report states that the capacity of the Afghan government is " chronically weak and undermined by widespread corruption " .
Of " reconciliation " – whatever that means these days – " the onset of the summer fighting season and the concentration of politicians and activists for the August elections discouraged expectations of noteworthy initiatives ... " .
Even the primary aim of polio eradication – Ottawa 's most favoured civilian project in Afghanistan – has defeated the Canadian International Development Agency , although this admission is cloaked in truly Blair - like ( or Brown - like ) mendacity .
As the Toronto Star revealed in a serious bit of investigative journalism this week , the aim to " eradicate " polio with the help of UN and World Health Organisation money has been quietly changed to the " prevention of transmission " of polio .
Instead of measuring the number of children " immunised " against polio , the target was altered to refer only to the number of children " vaccinated " .
But of course , children have to be vaccinated several times before they are actually immune .
And what do America 's Republican hawks – the subject of bin Laden 's latest sermon – now say about the Afghan catastrophe ?
" More troops will not guarantee success in Afghanistan , " failed Republican contender and ex-Vietnam vet John McCain told us this week .
" But a failure to send them will be a guarantee of failure . "
How Osama must have chuckled as this preposterous announcement echoed around al - Qa'ida 's dark cave .
Today marks the beginning of a new weekly post discussing notables in the TV ratings arena .
A couple big shows came back this week , so there 's lots to talk about .
I 'll do a day by day breakdown of anything that should interest people .
I 'm ignoring Saturday since it 's dominated by Cops and America 's Most Wanted , and no one really watches on Saturdays anyways .
Just a little note , I 'm using overnight data ( live + same day DVR ) .
The numbers will be the 18 - 49 demographic which is what the advertisers covet .
Total viewership is n't that important , but if I see a skewed discrepancy between the 2 , I will bring it up .
Sunday ( 9/13 )
ABC canceled Defying Gravity , and the last scheduled episode sucked with a .8 rating .
NBC destroyed the competition expectedly with Sunday Night Football .
King of the Hill bowed out with a respectable 2.9 , low in comparison with previous seasons , but still the highest among scripted shows that night .
Monday ( 9/14 )
The Jay Leno Show jumped into the 10 PM slot , and defied all expectations , mine included .
I initially predicted at least a 3.5 , but had no idea it would get a whopping 5.1 .
The final performance episode of American 's Got Talent garnered a good 3.3 .
One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl season premieres met the CW standard getting 1.2 and 1.4 respectively .
Gossip
Girl did well with women which really is all the CW is looking for .
They know nobody watches the network , so they target a specific demo .
Tuesday ( 9/15 )
I have to start everything off with the Jay Leno Show .
It 's one of the biggest experiments and we had to keep a close eye on it .
It had a huge 35 % drop to 3.3 which is still amazing by NBC standards , especially for 10 .
With one week until the season premiere , NCIS repeated strongly with 2.4. 90210 and Melrose Place in their second episode this season continued to post low ratings with 1.2 and 1.0 respectively .
I expect a Melrose Place cancelation at this rate .
Wednesday ( 9/16 )
The Jay Leno Report continues with less than exciting news .
He actually gained from the previous day to reach 3.4 .
Glee continued to be strong with 3.1 though there is a large gap between the demo and viewership which was only 6.64 million , much lower than the demo would indicate .
This indicates the show does n't have broad appeal , a high school dramedy musical not being typical viewing fare for retirees , so it could pose a problem to Fox .
I do n't see much opportunity for ratings growth though the current numbers are good .
Thursday ( 9/17 )
Leno continued to slip reaching a low of 2.7 .
I know it 's too early but yesterday after seeing the ratings , I was ecstatic to see it go down .
There were several season premieres this week .
Bones on the new day got an impressive 3.0 while Fringe without the benefit of American Idol actually lost viewers to drop to 2.9 .
The Vampire Diaries continued it 's success with the help of Twilight obsessed , television challenged females ( I know I 'm being silly and petty ) getting 1.6 , very high for CW standards .
Supernatural did n't do too hot again , getting a measly 1.2 , good for CW averages , but it is one of the best shows on TV right now and would get 2 - 3 times more viewers on another network .
After crashing and burning last season , Parks and Recreations came back with 2.1 , much better than it ended last season with .
The Office season premiere was way down from last year , but managed to receive 4.0 , still a very high number .
The much anticipated series premiere of Community managed to keep most of The Office 's viewers getting 3.7 .
I 'm really happy about that and hope it can maintain those numbers .
Friday ( 9/18 )
Leno fell again to 2.1 on a really bland Friday which NBC won handily with Dateline .
There was nothing else on Friday , seriously .
Remember , Dollhouse comes back next week at 9 !!!!
I 'm such a shill for Joss Whedon ...
Since this is new , any feedback would be welcome .
Google ( GOOG ) announced this week it will be " rolling out a series of enhancements to AdSense 's contextual targeting capabilities , which will more accurately match relevant ads to Web pages . "
Good !
Maybe now we can get past one of the Internet 's oldest problems : embarrassing ads placed by contextual targeting .
Click through to see Google 's worst contextual ads ever →
" Contextual targeting " is Google 's practice of scanning its publishing partner 's Web pages for certain keywords or phrases and then using those words and phrases to find the right to ads to serve to visitors of those pages .
A post on a group of cute puppies could turn up a Google ad for adopting puppies .
But sometimes this process goes horribly wrong .
For example , back when terrorists attacked tourists in Mumbai last year , In.com headlined a story " Terrorists killed the man who gave them water . "
Google 's ad for the occasion ?
" Terrorism : Pursue a certificate in terrorism 100 % online .

Ads by Google . "
Whoops !
Thing is , there have been plenty more awkward incidents like that -- way too many , really .
We 've collected some of the best worst examples here .
Each of them are entirely explainable -- a video about US Airways airplane crash would draw an ad for US Airways tickets because of the obvious keyword match -- but given Google 's technological prowess , each are ultimately inexcusable .
In a post to an official Google blog , we believe that with these changes users will start to see even more relevant ads , advertisers will generate more attractive returns by finding the right users , and publishers should make more money over time . "
But let 's be honest .
Woojin could also probably could have added : " And maybe we 'll embarrass ourselves and our partners a whole lot less . "

sooo ... it was a gorgeous day and if I had a penis , i'd probably be out there , enjoying the day and whacking off too - but not for a passerby 's benefit - and the funny thing is that I was so totally horny too .. the thought had crossed my mind to go over there and randomly fuck your brains out and then continue on my way as if nothing happened ( I might have had my own masturbatory fantasy about it later that night ) but you looked like a total goober , ( especialy with the ridiculous mastaburatory face you were making ) and you are obviously are a spaz because you have to get off on trying to shock and offend people .. you didnt shock or offend me - it was just another random , fucked up thing in my day .

How to Get Out of a Rut and Out of a Slump
Do you have any tips on how to get out of a rut ?
I ’m always stuck and ca n’t seem to finish anything at work , but I really need this job and I ’m afraid I will be fired .
How do I keep the job and continue to bring home the paychecks that my family desperately need ?
The reader question came at the perfect time , because before I got the email , I found myself unable to think of what to write either .
I believe I started my struggle at around 8:15 am ( or thereabouts ) and it ’s now 10:18 pm .
For literally two hours , I was surfing the web , chatting unenthusiastically with people online and clicking send / receive in my email program so many times it would ’ve broke if it was a mechanical button .
I finally decided to do something about it , I went to a coffee shop .
In the middle of a billion people ordering lattes , music in the background and loud friendly college students who I ’m sure could n’t wait to get back to school , reading the email turned on my thinking cap and words are pouring out right this moment .
The solution was simple really – a little change in environment and a little help from someone else .
I know , many of you are working right about now and leaving the office is n’t exactly possible , so here are a few suggestions next time your brain needs a bit of thawing :
Go Get Some Coffee – No , not to Starbucks .
I mean the free coffee in the lunch room .
For the housework challenged ( or just plain old lazy ) amongst us , making fresh coffee actually works much better than pouring it into our cup because it takes your mind off the task that you are stuck at .
Do Something Else – Unless your parents own the business and you are the only heir to the company , you probably have more than one task that you need to complete .
If you are stuck , try to focus your attention on another task and come back to the original project later .
Sometimes , a change of pace is all you need .
Talk to Your Boss – Do n’t go in with your white flag and admit defeat .
What I mean is to just talk to your boss and have an intelligent conversation .
It does n’t even have to be about the task you are stuck on , but a second opinion might spark your creative engine again .
I would suggest talking to a coworker , but not every boss likes to see their employees chatting all the time .
Do Something Related but Totally Different –
If you also write about personal finance , you could read a trade magazine for example .
If you are a coder , you may want to write a small application related to what you are passionate about .
Sometimes , the time spent away from work is just as important than time spent at work .
Give Your Job Serious
Thought – I know this sounds impossible , but you may be better off with a different career .
There may be another position within the company that fits your skill set better , and who knows ….
you may thrive after you made the change .
Give your strengths some serious thought , and try to determine if the slump is just temporary .
After some honest sessions , you may be able to find the path that ’s the brightest and easiest to walk .
I know this is general , but the reader was in the programming field and specific advice is out of my area of expertise .
I promised him that I will write an article about it , so perhaps my amazing readers can be of more help .
Do you have any suggestions for him ?
Have you been in a rut but managed to crawl out of it ?
How did you do it ?
It is inevitable in modern American politics that each new president inaugurates his own brand of bushwa - rubbish , lies , eyewash , whatever you choose to call it - that reminds one of nothing so much as the previous guy ’s bushwa .
Mr. Obama is no exception .
Consider :
Soon after taking office , Obama & Co. rebranded George Bush ’s “ war on terror , ’’ choosing to call it instead “ overseas contingency operations . ’’
There is a history here .
In 2005 , Bush ’s people tried to rename the WOT , suggesting instead the delightfully Rumsfeldian “ global struggle against violent extremism ’’ ( GSAVE ! ) or “ the long war ’’ ( nice movie title ) when discussing , well , the war on terror .
Those never caught on , and there is no reason to believe the jaw - cracking “ overseas contingency operations ’’ will either .
The White House knows that wars , of late , have been losing propositions .
It is no accident that Obama ’s new drug czar ( “ Czar ’’ - so harsh !
So Russian ; perhaps the Club Med title “ Gentle Organizer ’ ’ would work better here ) told the Wall Street Journal that “ he wants to banish the idea that the United States is fighting ‘ a war on drugs . ’ ’’
Of course , it ’s not like we are making peace with drugs either .
Oh , never mind .
The Bush administration oversaw “ bailouts ’’ of its fat cat friends on Wall Street .
The people - friendly Obama administration continues to throw money at its bankrupt pals , but prefers to talk about “ rescuing ’ ’ failed companies and the American economy .
Neither phrase softens the blow to the taxpayers footing the bill , the Los Angeles Times noted sardonically : “ We suggest they call the package an ‘ iPod , ’ because everyone will pay for an iPod . ’’
With 10 percent unemployment creeping up , the Obama - ites better have their economic Newspeak ready .
They do !
As hundreds of thousands of Americans file new jobless claims each week , the administration brags about the vast numbers of jobs it has “ created or saved . ’’
All administrations claim to create jobs , even in periods of high unemployment , but economists are marveling at Obama ’s new , bogus metric of jobs “ saved . ’’
“ The expression ‘ create or save , ’ which has been used regularly by the President and his economic team , is an act of political genius , ’’ a not - exactly - admiring Harvard economist Greg Mankiw writes on his blog .
“ You can measure how many jobs are created between two points in time .
But there is no way to measure how many jobs are saved . ’’
Yes , we can !
Everyone knows that healthcare reform will be a hard sell , so the administration has its neologisms at hand .
The New York Times recently revealed that instead of “ managed care , ’’ the Obama - ites will be pushing the coinage “ evidence - based care . ’’
Likewise they plan to avoid the term “ rationing , ’’ but alas no usable circumlocution has yet emerged for a system that aims to , well , ration healthcare .
I have a not - terribly - original idea .
Why do n’t we call healthcare reform “ iPhone ’ ’ ?
Nobody objects to paying for an iPhone , and people are more than happy to wait in line to buy them .
Like Canada ’s healthcare system , iPhones have a single service provider , AT&T .
I ’m phoning my congressman : Vote for the iPhone !
Remember signing statements ?
Those were the dastardly little postscripts George Bush attached to legislation that he did n’t completely approve of .
Signing statements ignore the “ fundamental principle ’’ of the separation of powers , the American Bar Association huffed .
On the campaign trail , candidate Obama was asked , “ Do you promise not to use presidential [ signing statements ] to get your way ? ’’
“ Yes , ’’ he answered .
“ I taught the Constitution for 10 years , I believe in the Constitution , and I will obey the Constitution of the United States .
We are not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around Congress . ’’
That was easy !
Less easy is explaining away his six signing statements so far , an impressive one - a- month clip .
“ Signing statements serve a legitimate function in our system , ’’ Obama now says , “ at least when based on well - founded constitutional objections . ’’
Mr. President , meet my friend George Orwell , inventor of Newspeak , who memorably wrote , “ Political language has to consist largely of euphemism , question - begging and sheer cloudy vagueness . ’’
New bushwa same as the old bushwa ?
It ’s a lot less different than we had been led to believe .

Central Tokyo
Highways are a great site , built high above the ground , winding past apartment and office windows through the over - developed city below .
Despite a great subway and train system , roads are still an important part of transport for the city .
The roads in Tokyo have struggled to find room to accommodate the growth of traffic and have had to therefore build highways in the sky and sometimes also tunnels underground .
A road called the Central Circular Route has been under planning and construction for a long time now , and is almost coming to completion .
It will link Ikebukuro , Shinjuku and Ohashi Junction ( just below Shibuya ) so that passage from Ikebukuro to the Tomei and Chuo Freeways is made much easier .
The Circular Route will later continue under Yamate Dori and join up with highways heading for Haneda Airport at Ooi Junction .
Some of the construction on this route is quite amazing to consider .
The road has been made by advanced tunneling machinery .
There have been a number of tours open for people to go inside and take photographs .
The last one was a special premium tour for bloggers .
Unfortunately I missed it or you would probably be scrolling down another set of 35 photos here .
The Circular Route between Shinjuku and Ohashi Junction is underground .
To expel the exhaust fumes from the tunnel , tall chimneys have been built along the route .
You can see these white chimneys in the photos I took recently from the Carrot Tower in Sangenjaya ( close to Shibuya ) .
I am not sure what explanation residents along the route got about the exhaust chimneys , but I can not imagine they were too happy to hear about their construction .
The Ohashi Junction Loop is also quite an engineering feat .
The loop road need to bring the cars from 35 metres underground out of the tunnel to 35 metres above ground to reach Highway 3 , which is built above Route 246 .
The loop line moving cars a vertical distance of 70 metres is a huge structure .
Its area is so large it could contain a normal size soccer pitch measuring 170 metres by 110 metres .
The route is planned to open next year in March .

Non Traditional Models of Intelligence and the Gaian Mind Where are you ?
Right now ?
I do n’t mean your physical body .
I mean , if you ’re using your physical body as reference , where are you in there ?
The easy answer would be the brain .
Maybe if you look a little deeper your answer may be the heart .
If you look even deeper though , the question becomes hard to answer .
In the dream state for example , you have no connection to your physical body , except the silver cord , a popular concept in metaphysics that ties you to the body during astral travel .
Sometimes , in your dreams , you ’re not even you , but …
A few years ago , when I was grading papers for a graduate literature course , I became alarmed at the inability of my students to write a clean English sentence .
They could manage for about six words and then , almost invariably , the syntax ( and everything else ) fell apart .
I became even more alarmed when I remembered that these same students were instructors in the college ’s composition program .
What , I wondered , could possibly be going on in their courses ?
I decided to find out , and asked to see the lesson plans of the 104 sections .
I read them and found that only four emphasized training in the craft of writing .
Although the other 100 sections fulfilled the composition requirement , instruction in composition was not their focus .
Instead , the students spent much of their time discussing novels , movies , TV shows and essays on a variety of hot - button issues — racism , sexism , immigration , globalization .
These artifacts and topics are surely worthy of serious study , but they should have received it in courses that bore their name , if only as a matter of truth - in - advertising .
As I learned more about the world of composition studies , I came to the conclusion that unless writing courses focus exclusively on writing they are a sham , and I advised administrators to insist that all courses listed as courses in composition teach grammar and rhetoric and nothing else .
This advice was contemptuously dismissed by the composition establishment , and I was accused of being a reactionary who knew nothing about current trends in research .
Now I have received ( indirect ) support from a source that makes me slightly uncomfortable , the American Council of Trustees and Alumni , which last week issued its latest white paper , “ What Will They Learn ?
A Report on General Education Requirements at 100 of the Nation ’s Leading Colleges and Universities . ”
Click on the square at top right to read the paper .
Founded by Lynne Cheney and Jerry Martin in 1995 , ACTA ( I quote from its website ) is “ an independent , non-profit organization committed to academic freedom , excellence and accountability at America ’s colleges . ”
Sounds good , but that “ commitment ” takes the form of mobilizing trustees and alumni in an effort to pressure colleges and universities to make changes in their curricula and requirements .
Academic institutions , the ACTA website declares , “ need checks and balances ” because “ internal constituencies ” — which means professors — cannot be trusted to be responsive to public concerns about the state of higher education .
The battle between those who actually work in the academy and those who would monitor academic work from the outside has been going on for well over 100 years and I am on record ( in “ Save The World On Your Own Time ” and elsewhere ) as being against external regulation of classroom practices if only because the impulse animating the effort to regulate is always political rather than intellectual .
It is of course true that political motives can also inform the decisions made by academic insiders ; the professorial guild is far from pure .
But the cure for the politicization of the classroom by some professors is not the counter - politicization urged by ACTA when it crusades for “ accountability , ” a code word for reconfiguring the academy according to conservative ideas and agendas .
Nevertheless , I found myself often nodding in agreement when I was reading ACTA ’s new report .
In it , the 100 colleges and universities are ranked on a scale from A to F based on whether students are required to take courses in seven key areas — composition , literature , foreign language , U.S. government or history , economics , mathematics and natural or physical science .
It ’s hard to quarrel with this list ; the quarrel and the criticism have been provoked by the criteria that accompany it .
These criteria are stringent and narrow and have been criticized as parochial and motivated by nostalgia and politics ; but in at least four of the seven areas they make perfect sense .
Credit for requiring instruction in mathematics will not be given for linguistic courses or computer literacy courses because their “ math content is usually minimal . ”
Credit for requiring instruction in the natural or physical sciences will not be given for courses with “ weak scientific content ” or courses “ taught by faculty outside of the science departments ” ( i.e. , the philosophy or history of science ) .
Credit for requiring instruction in a foreign language will not be given for fewer than three semesters of study because it takes that long to acquire “ competency at the intermediate level . ”
And credit for requiring composition will not be given for courses that are “ writing intensive ” ( there is a significant amount of writing required but the focus is on some substantive topic ) , or for courses in disciplines other than English and composition ( often termed “ writing in the discipline ” courses ) , or for courses in public speaking , or for remedial courses .
In order to qualify , a course must be devoted to “ grammar , style , clarity , and argument . ”
The rationale behind these exclusions is compelling : mathematics , the natural sciences , foreign languages and composition are disciplines with a specific content and a repertoire of essential skills .
Courses that center on another content and fail to provide concentrated training in those skills are really courses in another subject .
You can tell when you are being taught a mathematical function or a scientific procedure or a foreign language or the uses of the subjunctive and when you are being taught something else .
Things are not so clear when it comes to literature and history .
Why should the literature requirement be fulfilled only by “ a comprehensive literary survey ” and not by single - author courses ( are n’t Shakespeare and Milton “ comprehensive ” enough ) , or by a course in the theater or the graphic novel or the lyrics of Bob Dylan ( all rejected in the report ) ?
With respect to science , composition , foreign language instruction and mathematics , ACTA is simply saying , Do n’t slight the core of the discipline .
But when the report decrees that only broad surveys of literature can fulfill a literature requirement , the organization is intervening in the discipline and taking sides in its internal debates .
Why should trustees and alumni have a say in determining whether the graphic novel — a multi-media art that goes back at least as far as William Blake — deserves to represent literature ?
( For the record , I think it does . )
This part of the report is an effort to shape the discipline from the outside according to a political vision .
This holds too for the insistence that only the study of American history “ in both chronological and thematic breadth ” can fulfill the history requirement .
Here the politics is explicit : such courses , we are told , are “ indispensable for the formation of citizens and for the preservation of our free institutions . ”
Indispensable I doubt ( this is academic hubris ) ; and while the formation of citizens and the preservation of our free institutions may be admirable aims , it is not the task of courses in history to achieve them .
The question of how best to introduce students to the study of history should be answered not by invoking external goals , however worthy , but by arguing the merits of academic alternatives ; and I see no obvious reason why a course on the Civil War or the American revolution or the French revolution ( or both of them together ) would not do the job as well as a survey stretching from the landing at Plymouth Rock to the war in Iraq .
( At any rate , the issue is one for academic professionals to decide . )
But if I have no problem with alternative ways of teaching literature or history , how can I maintain ( with ACTA ) that there is only one way to teach writing ?
Easy .
It ca n’t be an alternative way of teaching writing to teach something else ( like multiculturalism or social justice ) .
It can , however , be an alternative way of teaching history to forgo a broad chronological narrative and confine yourself to a single period or even to a single world - changing event .
It is the difference between not doing the job and getting the job done by another route .
This difference is blurred in ACTA report because it is running ( and conflating ) two arguments .
One argument ( with which I agree ) says teach the subject matter and do n’t adulterate it with substitutes .
The other argument says teach the subject matter so that it points in a particular ideological direction , the direction of traditional values and a stable canon .
The first argument is methodological and implies no particular politics ; the other is political through and through , and it is the argument the authors are finally committed to because they see themselves as warriors in the culture wars .
The battle they are fighting in the report is over the core curriculum , the defense of which is for them a moral as well as an educational imperative as it is for those who oppose it .
The arguments pro and con are familiar .
On one side the assertion that a core curriculum provides students with the distilled wisdom of the western tradition and prepares them for life .
On the other side the assertion that a core curriculum packages and sells the prejudices and biases of the reigning elite and so congeals knowledge rather than advancing it .
Have we lost our way or finally found it ?
Thirty - five years ago there was no such thing as a gay and lesbian studies program ; now you can build a major around it .
For some this development is a sign that a brave new world has arrived ; for others it marks the beginning of the end of civilization .
It probably is neither ; curricular alternatives are just not that world - shaking .
The philosophical baggage that burdens this debate should be jettisoned and replaced with a more prosaic question :
What can a core curriculum do that the proliferation of options and choices ( two words excoriated in the ACTA report ) cannot ?
The answer to that question is given early in the report before it moves on to its more polemical pages .
An “ important benefit of a coherent core curriculum is its ability to foster a ‘ common conversation ’ among students , connecting them more closely with faculty and with each other . ”
The nice thing about this benefit is that it can be had no matter what the content of the core curriculum is .
It could be the classics of western literature and philosophy .
It could be science fiction .
It could be globalization .
It could be anything so long as every student took it .
But whatever it is , please let it include a writing course that teaches writing and not everything under the sun .
That should be the real core of any curriculum .
Some 2.4 million persons currently hold security clearances for authorized access to classified information , according to a recent Government Accountability Office report ( pdf ) to the House Intelligence Committee , citing an estimate from the security clearance Joint Reform Team .
This figure does not include “ some of those with clearances who work in areas of national intelligence , ” the GAO noted ( at p.1 ) .
An accurate tally of the number of cleared government employees and contractors — as opposed to a round - number estimate — is not currently available anywhere in government .
The House version of the FY2010 intelligence authorization act ( sec. 366 ) would require an annual report that indicates the number of individuals with security clearances .
In 1993 , an estimated 3.2 million persons held security clearances , according to a 1995 GAO report ( cited by the Moynihan Commission , chapter 4 ) .
Many senior staffers , including the studio head , for Sony Online Entertainment ’s Seattle Studio , the team behind the much delayed , The Agency , have suddenly left their positions .
Studio director and executive producer Matt Wilson , art director Corey Dangel , and producer John Smith all decided it was time to move onto greener pastures , and , in doing so , formed their own company , Detonator Games .
“ It ’s true that Corey and I no longer work for SOE , ” Wilson said .
“ This was a very hard decision to make , but it ’s the right decision for both us and the project .
There were a variety of factors into making this decision , but we wish SOE and The Agency the best success . ”
This recent walk off prompts many questions about the games ’ future .
Amidst much delay and lack of media , many are speculating whether the game , which is set for a 2010 release date , is undergoing a massive reconstruction .
A representative of SOE completely denies this , when they stated :
“ The Agency is not undergoing a reboot of any sorts – that is incorrect …
The team in Seattle is still working diligently on this project and we ’re looking forward to showing you new content in the future ” .

The Labrador retrievers are genetically identical
South Korea 's customs service says it has deployed the " world 's first cloned sniffer dogs " to check for drugs at its main airport and border crossings .
Six puppies cloned from a Canadian - born sniffer dog in late 2007 have reported for duty after completing a 16 - month training programme .
The clones are all called Toppy , a combination of " tomorrow " and " puppy " .
The customs agency says clones help to lower crime - fighting costs as it is difficult to find good sniffer dogs .
Only about 30 % of naturally - born sniffer dogs make the grade , but South Korean scientists say that could rise to 90 % using the cloning method .
' Better performance '

The new recruits are part of a litter of seven puppies who were cloned from a " superb " drug - sniffing Canadian Labrador retriever called Chase in 2007 , officials said .
One dropped out of the training due to an injury .
" They are the world 's first cloned sniffer dogs deployed at work , " Park Jeong - Heon , a customs spokesman at Seoul 's Incheon International Airport , told AFP news agency .
" They showed better performances in detecting illegal drugs during the training than other naturally - born sniffer dogs that we have . "
The cloning work was conducted by a team of scientists at Seoul National University , who created the world 's first cloned dog - an Afghan Hound named Snuppy .
The state - funded project cost about 300 m won ( $ 239,000 ; £ 146,000 ) .
Arsenal are currently fifth in the Premier League
The company that owns Arsenal Football Club has reported higher profits , with property sales proving as important as football .
Arsenal Holdings said pre-tax profit rose to £ 45.5 m in the year to 31 May , up from £ 36.7 m from the previous year .
Revenue was £ 313.3 m , with matchday revenue contributing £ 100.1 m and the sale of 208 private apartments at Highbury Square bringing in £ 88 m .
Arsenal also said manager Arsene Wenger had money to spend on new players .
Transfer activity Arsenal have only brought in two players , Andrey Arshavin and Thomas Vermaelen , in the current year .
The club said the " limited " transfer activity was due to Mr Wenger 's assessment " rather than any necessity or financial constraint " .
Wenger said : " I have always worked in clubs who make money .
" I would not feel that I do my job well if we lost money at the end of the season - never , no matter what happens on the sporting side - because you put the club in trouble and , in my opinion , that can not be accepted from any manager . "
The club has not won a major trophy since the FA Cup in 2005 .
Club ethos Football revenue rose to £ 225.1 m , from £ 207.7 m last year , which the club said was down to more matches as Arsenal reached the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the Champions League tournament .
The board 's policy continues to be that all proceeds from player sale transactions are made available to Arsene Wenger for re-investment
Arsenal results statement Matchday revenue exceeded £ 100 m for the first time .
The club was debating whether to launch a rights issue to raise funds , especially as the crash in the housing market made selling flats in Highbury Square more difficult .
But Arsenal has since decided against that , saying that to do so would be against its principles .
" Now that we have resolved any issues linked to the financing of Highbury Square , in the final analysis I believe it distils down to a decision about whether it is appropriate to raise money from shareholders to purchase the registrations and pay the wages of footballers , " said chairman Peter Hill - Wood .
" This is not something that Arsenal has ever done previously in its history and it would be at odds with our ethos of running the club as a business which is self - sustaining and pays its own way in the world . "
Wage costs Players ' wages rose to £ 104 m , from £ 101.3 m in 2008 .
" There continues to be significant upward pressure on players ' wage expectations and the activities of other clubs in the market and the introduction of the 50 % income tax rate from April 2010 mean this looks set to continue , " Arsenal said .
After tax , the company reported a record profit of £ 35.2 m , up 37 % from last year .
Arsenal said that it had now sold 445 of the 655 private apartments in its Highbury Square redevelopment of its former grounds in North London .
That has brought in £ 172.4 m to the club so far .
Profits from player sales actually fell , down to £ 23.2 m from £ 26.5 m last year .
That mainly came from the sales of Alexander Hleb to Barcelona and Justin Hoyte to Middlesbrough .
It also still received money from former Arsenal players David Bentley and Lassana Diarra - currently at Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid respectively - as a result of sell - on clauses .
The club sold striker Emmanuel Adebayor and defender Kolo Toure to big-spending Manchester City in the summer , but these deals took place in the current financial year .
" The board 's policy continues to be that all proceeds from player sale transactions are made available to Arsene Wenger for re-investment back into the development of the team , " the club said .

What if Zeus called down the thunder using his iPhone , or Pan , the Greek god of nature , serenaded his nymphs with an iPod instead of a flute ?
These are the questions that inspired Californian sculptor Adam Reeder , whose latest project , Socio - Technic Evolution , puts a high - tech spin on classical sculpture to examine the way technology has changed how Western culture interacts with the world .
The collection of four life - size sculptures - Pan with His iPod , Zeus with His iPhone , Atlas and The Sleeping Gamer - has already won Reeder several awards and helped him graduate with a master of fine arts from San Francisco 's Academy of Art University .
Reeder , 33 , said he came up with the idea after his daughter turned six and , instead of asking for a Barbie , wanted an iPod .
It highlighted for him how much technology had changed childhood and our lives .

While the national average price of gasoline is nowhere near the record highs of last summer , it has been on a bit of a climb lately , jumping about ten cents over the past week , and is now at $ 2.63 per gallon .
At this time last year the price of gasoline was $ 3.84 per gallon — nearly 50 % higher — so today ’s average price really is n’t all that bad , comparatively speaking .
However , the glass - half - empty part of me would also like to point out that the price of gas is still $ 1 higher than the lows hit back in January of this year .
Â
With the economy still kind of sluggish and the ranks of unemployed growing , even a slight increase in the price we pay at the pump can make a dent in our finances .
The state with the lowest average price is South Carolina , with an average price of $ 2.38 per gallon .
Â
There are currently eight states with an average gas price below $ 2.50 per gallon .
The state with the highest average price is Hawaii , with an average price of $ 3.11 per gallon .
Â Hawaii , Alaska and California are the only states with an average gas price above $ 3 per gallon .
It will be interesting to see where the price of gas goes from here .
Â
A lot of it will be tied to what people feel will happen with the economy .
Â
If economic data continues to show that the economy is bottoming , if not improving , the price of gas will likely continue to climb higher , although probably not by much .
Â
However , if data comes out and shows that things are actually getting worse with the economy , the price of gas will head back down .

Gordon Brown has gone about as far as politically possible to intervene in the debate over American adverts casting the NHS in a bad light , by tweeting his support for the institution .
Anger across Britain grew by the hour yesterday as details spread of the US adverts showing across the Atlantic .
The ads , paid for by a right - wing group , made several damaging assertions about the NHS in an effort to prevent President Barack Obama 's healthcare reforms .
Comment : Why I 'll never understand Americans
The ads were followed by damaging debate in the US , in which the NHS was branded " evil " and " Orwellian " .
But British anger over the misleading ads spread throughout the internet , focusing , predictably , on Twitter .
A campaign entitled # welovethenhs was set up , and quickly received so much support the site crashed .
Gordon and Sarah Brown , and health secretary Andy Burnham , eventually sent in their own messages of support .
The prime minister wrote : " NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death .
Thanks for always being there . "
Mr Burnham wrote : " Over the moon about strong support for the NHS - an institution I will defend to my dying day , second only to Everton FC . "
At one point yesterday , the hash tag was attracting 750 new tweets every five seconds .
Meanwhile , Tory MEP Daniel Hannan has come in for criticism after he went on American Television to say the NHS was a " 60 - year mistake " .
" I would n't wish it on anybody , " he continued .
Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley rebuked Mr Hannan : " There are millions of people who are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS .
" It does them and the NHS a disservice for Daniel Hannan to give Americans such a negative and partial view .
That we can access healthcare free at point of use , based on need , is something others envy . "
Former deputy prime minister John Prescott hit back at the comments as proof of the Conservative party not pursuing a progressive agenda .
There has been a lot of discussion about decadal climate predictions in recent months .
It came up as part of the ‘ climate services ’ discussion and was alluded to in the rather confused New Scientist piece a couple of weeks ago .
This is a relatively “ hot ” topic to be working on , exemplified by two initial high profile papers ( Smith et al , 2007 and Keenlyside et al , 2008 ) .
Indeed , the specifications for the new simulations being set up for next IPCC report include a whole section for decadal simulations that many of the modelling groups will be responding to .
This figure from a recent BAMS article ( Hawkins and Sutton , 2009 ) shows an estimate of the current sources of prediction error at the global and local scale .
For short periods of time ( especially at local scales ) , the dominant source of forecast uncertainty is the ‘ internal variability ’ ( i.e. the exact course of the specific trajectory the weather is on ) .
As time goes by , the different weather paths get averaged out and so this source of uncertainty diminishes .
However , uncertainty associated with uncertain or inaccurate models grows with time , as does the uncertainty associated with the scenario you are using – ie .
how fast CO2 or other forcings are going to change .
Predictions of CO2 next year for instance , are much easier than predictions in 50 years time because of the potential for economic , technological and sociological changes .
The combination of sources of uncertainty map out how much better we can expect predictions to get : can we reduce error associated with internal variability by initializing models with current observations ?
how much does uncertainty go down as models improve ?
etc .
From the graph it is easy to see that over the short term ( up to a decade or so ) , reducing initialization errors might be useful ( the dotted lines ) .
The basic idea is that a portion of the climate variability on interannual to decadal time scales can be associated with relatively slow ocean changes – for instance in the North Atlantic .
If these ocean circulations can be predicted based on the state of the ocean now , that may therefore allow for skillful predictions of temperature or rainfall that are correlated to those ocean changes .
But while this sounds plausible , almost every step in this chain is a challenge .
We know that this works on short ( seasonal ) time scales in ( at least some parts of the world ) because of the somewhat skillful prediction of El Niño / La Niña events and relative stability of teleconnections to these large perturbations ( the fact that rainfall in California is usually high in El Niño years for instance ) .
But our ability to predict El Niño loses skill very rapidly past six months or so and so we ca n’t rely on that for longer term predictions .
However , there is also some skill in seasonal predictions in parts of the world where El Niño is not that important – for instance in Europe – that is likely based on the persistence of North Atlantic ocean temperature anomalies .
One curious consequence is that the places that have skillful and useful seasonal - to - interannual predictions based on ENSO forecasts are likely to be the places where skillful decadal forecasts do worst ( because those are precisely the areas where the unpredictable ENSO variability will be the dominant signal ) .
It ’s worth pointing out that ‘ skill ’ is defined relative to climatology ( i.e. do you do a better job at estimating temperature or rainfall anomalies than if you ’d just assumed that the season would be just like the average of the last ten years for instance ) .
Some skill does n’t necessarily mean that the predictions are great – it simply means that they are slightly better than you could do before .
We should also distinguish between skillful ( in a statistical sense ) and useful in a practical sense .
An increase of a few percent in variance explained would show up as improved skill , but that is unlikely to be of good enough practical value to shift any policy decisions .
So given that we know roughly what we are looking for , what is needed for this to work ?
First of all , we need to know whether we have enough data to get a reasonable picture of the ocean state right now .
This is actually quite hard since you ’d like to have subsurface temperature and salinity data from a large part of the oceans .
That gives you the large scale density field which is the dominant control on the ocean dynamics .
Right now this is just about possible with the new Argo float array , but before about 2003 , subsurface data in particular was much sparser outside a few well travelled corridors .
Note that temperature data are not sufficient on their own for calculating changes in the ocean dynamics since they are often inversely correlated with salinity variations ( when it is hot , it is often salty for instance ) which reduces the impact on the density .
Conceivably if any skill in the prediction is simply related to surface temperature anomalies being advected around by the mean circulation , it could be possible be useful to do temperature only initializations , but one would have to be very wary of dynamical changes and that would limit the usefulness of the approach to a couple of years perhaps .
Next , given any particular distribution of initialization data , how should this be assimilated into the forecasting model ?
This is a real theoretical problem given that models all have systematic deviations from the real world .
If you simply force a model temperature and salinity to look exactly like the observations , then you risk having any forecast dominated by model drift when you remove the assimilation .
Think of a elastic band being pulled to the side by the ‘ observations ’ , but having it snap back to it ’s default state when you stop pulling .
( A likely example of this is the ‘ coupling shock ’ phenomena possibly seen in the Keenlyside et al simulations ) .
A better way to do this is via anomaly forcing – that is you only impose the differences from the climatology on the model .
That is guaranteed to have less model drift , but at the expense of having the forecast potentially affected by systematic errors in , say , the position of the Gulf Stream .
In both methods of course , the better the model , the less bad the problems .
There is a good discussion of the Hadley Centre methods in Haines et al ( 2008 ) ( no sub reqd . ) .
Assuming that you can come up with a reasonable methodology for the initialization , the next step is to understand the actual predictability of the system .
For instance , given the inevitable uncertainties due to sparse coverage or short term variability , how fast do slightly differently initialized simulations diverge ?
( Note that we are n’t talking about the exact path of the simulation which will diverge as fast as weather forecasts – a couple of weeks , but the larger scale statistics of ocean anomalies ) .
This appears to be a few years to a decade in “ perfect model ” tests ( where you try and predict how a particular model will behave using the same model but with an initialization that mimics what you ’d have to do in the real world ) .
Finally , given that you can show that the model with its initialization scheme and available data has some predictability , you have to show that it gives a useful increase in the explained variance in any quantities that someone might care about .
For instance , perfect predictability of the maximum overturning streamfunction might be scientifically interesting , but since it is not an observable quantity , it is mainly of academic interest .
Much more useful is how any surface air temperature or rainfall predictions will be affected .
This kind of analysis is only just starting to be done ( since you needed all the other steps to work first ) .
From talking to a number of people working in this field , my sense is that this is pretty much where the state of the science is .
There are theoretical reasons to expect this to be useful , but as yet no good sense for actually how practically useful it will be ( though I ’d welcome any other opinions on this in the comments ) .
One thing that is of concern are statements that appear to assume that this is already a done deal – that good quality decadal forecasts are somehow guaranteed ( if only a new center can be built , or if a faster computer was used ) .
For instance :
… to meet the expectations of society , it is both necessary and possible to revolutionize climate prediction . …
It is possible firstly because of major advances in scientific understanding , secondly because of the development of seamless prediction systems which unify weather and climate prediction , thus bringing the insights and constraints of weather prediction into the climate change arena , and thirdly because of the ever - expanding power of computers .
However , just because something is necessary ( according to the expectations of society ) does not automatically mean that it is possible !
Indeed , there is a real danger for society ’s expectations to get completely out of line with what eventually will prove possible , and it ’s important that policies do n’t get put in place that are not robust to the real uncertainty in such predictions .
Does this mean that climate predictions ca n’t get better ?
Not at all .
The component of the forecast uncertainty associated with the models themselves can certainly be reduced ( the blue line above ) – through more judicious weighting of the various models ( perhaps using paleo - climate data from the LGM and mid-Holocene which will also be part of the new IPCC archive ) , improvements in parameterisations and greater realism in forcings and physical interactions ( for instance between clouds and aerosols ) .
In fact , one might hazard a guess that these efforts will prove more effective in reducing uncertainty in the coming round of model simulations than the still - experimental attempts in decadal forecasting .

THE Archbishop of Cardiff , the Most Reverend Peter Smith , attacks proposals to change the law on euthanasia as “ morally wrong ” .
I take that to mean that he regards a bill going through Parliament as immoral , because it would allow us to help a family member with terminal illness , agonising incurable pain , maybe a son or daughter in a vegetative state , to die if that was their wish .
I wonder how the Archbishop could justify such views to the parents of Daniel James or Terry Schiavo or Hannah Jones or Eluana Englaro .
You might remember Daniel James .
This 23 - year - old rugby player , at the peak of physical perfection , was paralysed in a training accident .
For him , life was no longer worth living .
After failed suicide attempts he told his parents he wished to escape from “ the prison ” of his body .
They took him to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland where assisted suicide is legal , where they could say their final farewells .
Were they “ immoral ” to help their beloved son in that way ?
After a car crash an American woman , Terry Schiavo , vegetated in a coma for 15 years with no hope of recovery .
Her parents and husband finally insisted on the removal of the feeding tube that prevented her release .
Predictably , the pro-life zealots of America tried to stop this , even though Terry herself had said before her accident that she would not want to be kept alive in a sort of limbo .
Was it “ morally wrong ” for the family who loved her to do this ?
Do you remember the tragic story of Hannah Jones , the 13 - year - old schoolgirl who refused an operation that might have prolonged her life ?
Instead she told her parents she would prefer to live as normally as possible and face an inevitable early death .
Were they morally wrong to agree ?
For 16 years in Italy , Beppino Englaro kept vigil at the bedside of his 37 - year - old daughter Eleuna , another accident victim , as she lay in an irreversible coma .
At last he was given permission to remove her feeding tube .
Was he morally wrong to do so ?
The Vatican thought so .
Monsignor Rino Fisichella , head of the Pontifical Academy for Life , said that what had been authorised was euthanasia .
“ A coma is a form of life and no one can take it upon themselves to put an end to the life of a person . ”
Some life , and I ’m still waiting to hear the Monsignor condemn the man who this month , in his words , took it upon himself to put an end to the life of the American abortion doctor George Tiller .
Or of those who took it upon themselves to put an end to the lives of five other doctors and four abortion clinic workers .
Archbishop Smith targets those overseas clinics where sufferers are allowed to “ die with dignity ” .
But you do n’t have to cross the Channel for assisted suicide .
According to Professor Emily Jackson of the London School of Economics , an expert on euthanasia , it happens right here in Britain , thousands of times a year .
The most common cause of death in Britain , she says , is “ death by killing ” .
Killing by doctors .
She claims that one third of all registered deaths are by deliberate morphine overdose , another third by the removal of life support , hastening death in most cases by just a few days or weeks .
( In passing , let ’s remember that George V was killed by a morphine overdose , injected by his personal physician Lord Dawson on the night of January 20 , 1936 .
This was done so that news of the monarch ’s death would appear in next morning ’s Times , instead of “ the less appropriate evening papers ” ) .
Meanwhile , polls have shown that 80 % of the population support the right to die – and what scriptural authority says we do NOT have that right ?
Yes , I ’ve heard the arguments against – unscrupulous relatives will hustle poor old uncle into a clinic then claim whatever loot he leaves .
And I dismiss them as typical scare tactics .
While concluding that I do n’t want any Last Rites .
Just my last Right .

( CNN ) -- Facebook , for better or worse , is like being at a big party with all your friends , family , acquaintances and co-workers .
Facebook can be a great tool , and an occasional annoyance .
What kind of Facebooker are you ?
There are lots of fun , interesting people you 're happy to talk to when they stroll up .
Then there are the other people , the ones who make you cringe when you see them coming .
This article is about those people .
Sure , Facebook can be a great tool for keeping up with folks who are important to you .
Take the status update , the 160 - character message that users post in response to the question , " What 's on your mind ? "
An artful , witty or newsy status update is a pleasure -- a real - time , tiny window into a friend 's life .
But far more posts read like navel - gazing diary entries , or worse , spam .
A recent study categorized 40 percent of Twitter tweets as " pointless babble , " and it would n't be surprising if updates on Facebook , still a fast - growing social network , break down in a similar way .
Take a CNN quiz :

The Friend - Padder .
The average Facebook user has 120 friends on the site .
Schmoozers and social butterflies -- you know , the ones who make lifelong pals on the subway -- might reasonably have 300 or 400 .

Office workers of a bank celebrate a colleague birthday .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Scott Horton apparently reported on several declarations filed in Federal Court in Eastern Virginia that included explosive allegations regarding the military contractor Blackwater and its owner Erik Prince .
Andrew Sullivan linked to him – but between Sullivan ’s linking and my clicking on Sullivan ’s link , the article was taken down .
A search of The Daily Beast for Scott Horton ’s article turns up nothing except a link to Jeremy Scahill of The Nation ‘s recent piece on the same subject .
Andrew Sullivan had excerpted this summary of the charges contained in the Declarations on his blog :
Both men requested anonymity to avoid mortal threats .
“ It appears that Mr. Prince or his employees murdered , or had murdered , one or more persons who have provided information , or who were planning to provide information , to the federal authorities , ” said John Doe # 1 .
John Doe # 2 says he received personal threats after leaving Blackwater .
Prince “ views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . ”
He “ intentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy , knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis . ”
Blackwater “ employees openly and consistently used racist and derogatory terms of Iraqis and other Arabs , such as ‘ ragheads ’ or ‘ hajis . ’ ”
Blackwater deployed to Iraq individuals who ( a ) made “ statements about wanting to … ‘ kill ragheads ’ or achieve ‘ kills ’ or ‘ body counts , ’ ” ( b ) drank excessively , ( c ) used steroids , and ( d ) failed to follow safety and other instructions governing the use of lethal weapons .
Mental - health professionals who raised concerns about deployment of such individuals were fired .
Prince obtained “ illegal ammunition … designed to explode after penetrating within the human body ” and smuggled it into Iraq for use .
Prince distributed other illegal weapons for use in Iraq .
Prince was aware of the use of prostitutes , “ including child prostitutes , ” at Blackwater ’s “ Man Camp ” in Iraq , which he visited .
The actual declarations can be found here – John Doe 1 ( pdf ) – and here – John Doe 2 ( pdf ) .
These papers were part of opposition to a motion – the complete set of which can be found here .
( Beware – it ’s a few hundred pages of pdfs ) .
I have emailed Scott Horton to see if he has any comment / explanation for why his article is no longer up on the Daily Beast .
Edit : The Daily Beast still has not gotten back to me .
Mr. Horton replied telling me that he was looking into why his article was taken down himself .

Pros : A useful and practical introduction to AR
Cons : A bit amateurish
Reviewed by : Ian Elliot
Augmented reality is a re-write of virtual reality and we all know what happened to VR .
Despite being promoted by TV programs , movies , books and the “ press ” in general it really is still a speciality technology .
You need special hardware and lots of computer power to do VR even in a crude form .
AR however is a little different in being a fusion of VR and real graphics .
In short it aims to put computer generated objects into a video of the real world .
If VR is about putting you into the virtual world AR is about putting the virtual into the real world .
It turns out that this task is actually a lot easier than full VR and we are much more likely to accept the result of a fairly low resolution AR display .
For example , you can create a fairly crude 3D graphic of a tank or a robot and place it in a live video scene and it sort of works .
The key is to have the crude representation behave as if it was a real object and then allow human psychology to invest it with the reality that it is mimicking .
It 's an extension of what we do to inanimate objects every day when we treat them as proxy humans .
This book is a complete introduction to using the freely down - loadable ARTag software SDK in C++ and C# .
There is also a brief introduction to using OpenGL to create 3D graphics but if you have never used a 3D API before you will probably need to consult another book .
The book also emphasises hobbyist / enthusiast approached to applying AR to games which being honest are never going to be commercial propositions .
Do n’t let this put you off - there are probably countless real commercial applications of AR just waiting for the right programmer to notice them .
Apart from the obvious applications of AR such as allowing clients to walk around augmented rooms and game playing this is a technology that is in search of its killer application .
This is a good introduction and might just spark such an idea .

Then - Atty . Gen. John Ashcroft violated the rights of U.S. citizens in the fevered wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by ordering arrests on material witness warrants when the government lacked probable cause , a federal appeals court said in a scathing opinion Friday .
In a ruling that said Ashcroft could be sued for prosecutorial abuses , a three - judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the former attorney general immunity from liability for how he used the material witness warrants in national security investigations .
Members of the panel , all appointees of Republican presidents , characterized Ashcroft ’s detention policy as “ repugnant to the Constitution , and a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history . ”
Civil liberties advocates cheered the ruling in the case brought by Kansas - born Muslim convert Abdullah Kidd , saying it spotlighted excesses committed by the Bush administration in the post - 9/11 scramble to thwart terrorist plots .

“ The court made it very clear today that . . .
Ashcroft ’s use of the federal material witness law circumvented the Constitution , ” said Lee Gelernt , the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued Kidd ’s case .
“ Regardless of your rank or title , you ca n’t escape liability if you personally created and oversaw a policy that deliberately violates the law . ”
The ruling could allow Kidd ’s suit for damages to proceed to trial if the government does n’t appeal to a larger 9th Circuit panel or seek Supreme Court review .
A spokesman for Ashcroft , Mark Corallo , did n’t return phone calls .
Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller said : “ We will review the court ’s decision and make a determination in the future as to what the government ’s next step will be . ”

Although the ruling denied immunity to Ashcroft , the government would probably be responsible for covering any successful damage claims brought by those found to have been wrongly arrested .
Kidd , a former University of Idaho running back whose birth name was Lavoni T. Kidd , sued Ashcroft after he was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport en route to a Saudi scholarship program in March 2003 .
He was handcuffed , strip - searched and shuttled among interrogations in Virginia , Oklahoma and Idaho before being released 16 days later and ordered to surrender his passport and live with his wife and in - laws in Nevada .
The arrest led to Kidd being denied a security clearance and losing his job with a government contractor .

In his 2005 complaint , Kidd noted that then - FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III , in an appearance before a congressional subcommittee during Kidd ’s detention , had pointed to his arrest and that of confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed as evidence of government progress in reining in terrorists .
“ To this day , the government has never explained why the director of the FBI would tell the United States Congress that the arrest of Mr. al Kidd -- supposedly a witness -- represented one of the government ’s noteworthy recent successes in the war on terrorism , ” the complaint stated .
It is unclear how many U.S. citizens were picked up on material witness warrants in the sweep conducted by national security forces after the 2001 terrorist attacks .
Like the preventive detention abroad of foreign terrorism suspects and the CIA ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” program , in which suspected enemies were whisked from foreign locales to interrogation “ black sites , ” the material witness arrests were conducted in secret .
At least two other prominent Muslim converts are known to have been arrested as supposed material witnesses .

Alleged would - be “ dirty bomber ” Jose Padilla was detained at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and held for 3 1/ 2 years without charges before his 2007 conviction in an unrelated terrorism case in Florida .
Brandon Mayfield , an Oregon attorney erroneously connected to the 2004 Madrid train bombings , was also arrested as a material witness and held for two weeks .
He was never charged , and has received an apology from the U.S. government as well as a $ 2 - million settlement .
Constitutional law scholars applauded the 9th Circuit decision as affirmation of citizens ’ rights to be free from illegal detention .
“ This is really important , ” said Erwin Chemerinsky , dean of the UC Irvine School of Law .
“ This is a federal court of appeals saying that what was done here under the material witness statute was clearly a violation of the Constitution -- that it was not protected by prosecutorial absolute immunity . ”
Advertisement
That means that the unknown numbers of wrongfully detained suspects could sue Ashcroft for damages , claiming their rights were violated , Chemerinsky said .
Georgetown Law professor David Cole said that Ashcroft adopted an aggressive “ preventive paradigm ” after Sept. 11 designed “ to incapacitate people who government officials thought suspicious but lacked evidence of any wrongdoing .
They were locked up and then investigated , rather than the other way around . ”
Virtually all of the targets had nothing to do with terrorism , Cole said .
The Supreme Court has made a distinction between using material witness warrants to ensure someone ’s appearance at trial and misusing them to detain someone to be investigated for suspected wrongdoing , the panel noted in its 98 - page opinion .
Advertisement
The panel also cast the previous administration ’s practice of detaining suspects without cause as behavior that the framers of the Constitution would have found abhorrent .
The judges , alluding to the George W. Bush administration , said that although “ some confidently assert that the government has the power to arrest and detain ” suspects without evidence of wrongdoing , the panel considered such preemptive detentions “ an engine of political tyranny . ”
The opinion was written by Circuit Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. , an appointee of Bush ’s , whose practices in the war on terrorism were at the heart of the case .
Circuit Judge Carlos T. Bea , a fellow Bush appointee , wrote a separate opinion partially concurring and partially dissenting .
Smith was joined fully by Senior Circuit Judge David R. Thompson , named to the bench by President Reagan .

Gary McKinnon wants to be tried in the UK rather than the US Human rights arguments against extraditing a British man accused of hacking into US military networks were not " confronted , " a court has heard .
Gary McKinnon , 43 , from Wood Green , London , wants to overturn a refusal to put him on trial in the UK on charges of computer misuse .
Edward Fitzgerald QC accused the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC of misapplying the law .
Mr McKinnon , who has Asperger 's Syndrome , faces trial in America .
Mr Starmer decided there was " insufficient evidence " to support a UK prosecution under the Computer Misuse Act .
If there is no UK prosecution , Mr McKinnon would inevitably be extradited to stand trial in the US , the judges heard .
Lawyers for the DPP are arguing the decision not to prosecute was " entirely rational " and was " manifestly not one which is susceptible to judicial review " .
Mr McKinnon , who was arrested by British police in 2002 , has already appealed unsuccessfully to the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights to avoid extradition .
Mr McKinnon is accused of hacking into 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa during 2001 and 2002 .
The US government says this caused damage costing $ 800,000 ( £ 500,000 ) at a time of heightened security in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks .
He claims he was looking for details of UFOs .
" Psychological suffering " Mr Fitzgerald told two High Court judges in London that extraditing Mr McKinnon would lead to " disastrous consequences " because of his medical condition , including possible psychosis and suicide .
Mr Fitzgerald also said Mr Starmer had failed to confront the new evidence concerning Mr McKinnon 's medical condition and deal with the human rights issues it raised .
I 'm utterly disgusted over the whole debacle Paul , Merseyside HAVE YOUR SAY
If sent to the US , Mr McKinnon was likely to receive a substantial prison sentence and was unlikely to be repatriated to serve his sentence , Mr Fitzgerald said .
And the process of extradition , trial and sentence would expose Mr McKinnon to " an avoidable and unnecessary risk of serious psychological suffering " with " all of the attendant disastrous consequences , " he added .
This application for judicial review at the High Court in London is the second recent legal challenge in Mr McKinnon 's case .
In the first , Mr Fitzgerald accused the home secretary of reaching a " flawed " decision , following medical evidence of the severe mental suffering that extradition would cause .
The judges are expected to give their ruling in both legal challenges later this month .

Renetta Atterberry thought she had lost her East 102nd Street house .
So she was shocked to learn in January -- five years after her mortgage company filed for foreclosure -- that it was still in her name .
Worse , the long - vacant rental home had been vandalized and she faced a raft of housing code violations .
Since then , she has been saddled with debts of about $ 12,000 to pay for demolition and back taxes .
" I thought I had nothing else to do with that home , " said Atterberry .
" I was so embarrassed and humiliated by this . "
Her mortgage company did n't buy the house and never took it to sheriff 's sale to see if somebody else would , leaving Atterberry the legal owner , responsible for upkeep and taxes .
These so - called " bank walkaways " are another troubling development in the foreclosure crisis , particularly in cities like Cleveland with weaker housing markets , say housing advocates and government officials .
Lenders or mortgage companies decide they do n't want homes they have already foreclosed on , sometimes because the value has plummeted or they believe the homes could become costly liabilities if they are socked with housing code violations .
But without that sale , the property can languish abandoned and ripe for vandalism .
As liens and liabilities mount -- creating a so - called " toxic title " -- it becomes even harder to transfer the property .
Neighborhoods and local governments are left to deal with the mess .
" It 's a growing issue .
It 's all over the state .
It 's not just Cleveland , " said State Rep. Mike Foley .
" That kind of lack of respect for communities that banks have made a ton of money off of in the past is infuriating . "
Properties left in ' legal limbo '
Joseph Schilling , associate director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech and an expert on abandoned property , said the issue of bank walkaways is increasing .
Lenders may decide that given low prices and their mounting inventory of foreclosed property , it makes sense to walk away .
" But as a result , it leaves the property in this type of legal limbo and it leaves the community and local government really holding the bag , " Schilling said .
The problem has gotten the attention of government officials who are trying to fill a void in Ohio law and force companies that foreclose on property to act .
State Rep. Dennis Murray of Sandusky is drafting a bill he hopes to introduce in the next two months that would require lenders or mortgage service companies to take foreclosed properties to sheriff sale within a certain time -- or see their mortgage lien erased .
The lender would n't be required to buy the property -- only to take it to sale .
More time could be given to lenders working to keep people in their homes by restructuring the mortgage .
Under Murray 's plan , property that does n't sell could go to a local land bank .
" We 're saying fish or cut bait , " Murray said .
" You can either take it to sheriff 's sale . . . or if you 're going to walk away from the property , do it now so the land bank process and the reclamation can get started . "
Separately , Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Nancy Margaret Russo recently began ordering those granted a foreclosure decree in her courtroom to file the paperwork for a sheriff 's sale in about 30 days -- or face being ordered to court for a contempt hearing .
" I think it 's a big problem , " Russo said .
" It 's creating more abandoned homes with nobody responsible for taking care of them . "
It 's not clear whether she has the jurisdiction to issue such orders .
But Russo -- who was not aware of Murray 's initiative when she began hers -- believed it was time to start a discussion .
Beachwood lawyer James Sassano , who represents mortgage servicing companies in foreclosure cases , said he does n't believe Russo has the jurisdiction but understands that she wants to get properties into the hands of people who would be responsible for them .
And while he has n't seen Murray 's draft legislation , he questions whether it would be constitutional to erase the mortgage holders ' lien .
Frank S. Alexander , a professor at Emory University School of Law , said he 's not aware of any state with a remedy similar to what Murray is proposing .
" I happen to like it , " said Alexander , after being told about Murray 's plans .
" And it would require lenders to act more cautiously in foreclosing . "
And he noted that many states are looking to tighten their foreclosure laws .
" I think Ohio because of the magnitude of the problem -- particularly in Cuyahoga County -- and the longevity of the problem , is out in front on trying to come up with creative solutions . "
Practice draws academic interest
How often these walkaways happen is n't clear , and there are mortgage companies that work to hasten sales .
But researchers at the Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development at Case Western Reserve University are studying the issue after noticing that foreclosure filings in Cuyahoga County remained about the same in 2007 and 2008 but that sheriff 's sales were down last year .
Researcher Michael Schramm said they also began hearing from people in various cities and neighborhoods about homes languishing in foreclosure without being sold .
Schramm said that Cuyahoga County saw more than 14,000 foreclosure filings both in 2007 and in 2008 .
In 2007 there were nearly 10,000 sheriff 's sales , but the number dropped in 2008 to about 8,000 .
Lenders or mortgage service companies may decide not to seek a sheriff 's sale because they 're working to restructure a mortgage or the homeowner has gone into bankruptcy .
But there 's no doubt they 've also walked away from homes when it's in their financial interest to do so .
" In the old days when values were much higher , it made a lot more sense to press the foreclosure sale , " said Dave Sarver , whose Cleveland Heights - based Sarver Realty specializes in selling properties taken back by banks at sheriff 's sales .
But now , he says , when a growing number of properties are worth only a few thousand dollars , it does n't make sense for mortgage companies to take title to properties with little value and the potential for costly city code violations .
In Cuyahoga County , foreclosed homes that lenders or mortgage companies bought at sheriff 's sales have recently sold for as little as 30 percent of the home 's previously appraised value , according to the Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development .
In the city of Cleveland the numbers are even worse -- with lenders selling foreclosed homes for just 15 percent of their former value .
Another slice of the dismal pie :
In Cleveland more than 60 percent of the foreclosed homes sold by mortgage companies went for $ 10,000 or less .
Some lenders also lose interest during the foreclosure process .
" The property becomes abandoned while the foreclosure is pending and it becomes stripped , vandalized , damaged or deteriorated to the point where it just does n't make sense to spend money to have it offered at sheriff 's sale , " said Larry Rothenberg , a lawyer with Weltman , Weinberg & Reis , a large creditors - rights firm based in Cleveland .
But those business decisions do n't sit well with those left to deal with them .
" They have a responsibility , " said Cleveland City Councilman Tony Brancatelli .
He said that if lenders or mortgage companies start a foreclosure , they should finish it .
Or they should take off the mortgage lien so that the title can be cleaned up and the property transferred into responsible hands .
' I see shocked people every single week '
Some of the fallout that results when properties languish vacant and abandoned shows up in Cleveland Housing Judge Raymond Pianka 's courtroom .
" I see shocked people every single week , " Pianka said .
" They thought the burden was lifted because they filed bankruptcy or because somebody somewhere told them they 're no longer responsible , and then they 're pulled back in facing criminal code violations . "
His court also has worked with such owners on moving the property into the hands of another owner such as a nonprofit agency , the city land bank or the next door neighbor .
But trying to transfer a problem to somebody else can become a thorny and protracted process if the long - gone owner can't be found or the foreclosed house is saddled with so many financial obligations that it is too expensive to touch .
Some transfers have been helped along when lenders remove the lien or agree to what 's called a short sale and accept less than what 's owned on the mortgage .
Shawn Martin does n't know what will happen to his property on Reno Avenue in Cleveland , where a foreclosure was filed on the two - family rental house in 2006 .
The sheriff sale had been scheduled , and Martin figured his lender took possession after he drove by and saw the windows boarded up and a tarp on the roof .
But nobody bought it -- not even his mortgage company .
" They backed out on it and just left it without even telling me , " Martin said .
" It just sat there and decayed without me even knowing about it . "
The house has been demolished and Martin is worried about being stuck with the bill .
" This is a nightmare , " he said .
Carol Zung 's two - family rental property on Adams Avenue in Cleveland is still standing -- and that presents its own set of problems .
A few months ago she got a call from police that the empty house had been ransacked , a call that reached her in Savannah , Ga. , where Zung moved to find work after a cascade of financial troubles .
The house had been foreclosed on and set for sheriff 's sale in November 2007 .
Whether it even went to sale can't be gleaned from the court docket , which Zung has been checking in the hopes that this incredibly frustrating burden will be transferred off her 69 - year - old shoulders .
Now there 's another wrinkle .
During a recent check , Zung learned her mortgage holder had gotten the foreclosure decree vacated and the case dismissed .
But the property is still in her name and she owes around $ 37,000 on the mortgage .
Zung has been through bankruptcy and said she has no money .
" What do I do now ? " she said .
" There 's part of my mind that 's given up .
Let other people figure out this mess . "
It is not just the homeowners who are affected when the property languishes .
Neighbors can be left to suffer with vandalism and diminished property values , and taxpayers may be left with the costs of removing nuisance and blighted conditions .
" Those are the people who are picking up the tab for the business practices of calculated abandonment , " said Kermit Lind , a clinical professor at Cleveland State University 's Cleveland - Marshall College of Law and an expert on foreclosures .
Sarah Butler knows the fear of living next door to a foreclosed and vacant house .
From her home on Reno she watched as vandals and trespassers descended on Martin 's two - family after the renters moved out .
She saw looters strip the house of everything from gutters to the refrigerator .
Once , one of her back windows was broken .
And sometimes people would pull into the driveway at 3 a.m. and wake her up with all their noise .
" You 've got to leave , nobody lives here , " she 'd shout from her window .
Homeowners , too , sometimes walk away -- for their own financial reasons or because they feel eviction from their foreclosed homes is inevitable .
Once they 're gone they may be hard to track down .
But others , like Renetta Atterberry , abandon a house in the belief that it 's no longer theirs .
She does n't know why she did n't get notices about what happened .
It 's not clear how her housing nightmare will end .
She said she 's on a payment plan with the county treasurer 's office for the back taxes and would like to donate the property to a land bank -- but said she was told that can't happen as long as the $ 48,000 mortgage lien remains on the now - vacant property .
" I was totally devastated with all of this being dumped on me , " she said .
There is perhaps no country more feared and less understood in India than China .
In recent weeks Delhi newspapers and television have been awash with stories about the People 's Liberation Army crossing the Himalayas to daub rocks with Chinese characters , making daredevil helicopter raids to drop ( stale ) tinned food on hapless farmers and trading fire with Indian soldiers .
India 's Kashmir state government , apparently , said its territory was being taken " inch by inch " through such incursions .
Ominously , authorities last week in Kolkata impounded a plane carrying arms from the Middle East to China .
While the foreign ministries in both countries play down the reports , there are concerns that left unchecked , things could spiral out of control .
The spat began in June .
Chinese bloggers vented their fury when India abruptly announced that it would be sending 60,000 troops to bolster tens of thousands of soldiers to Arunachal Pradesh – an Indian state that Beijing claims as its own .
One online poll in China claimed that 90 % of respondents thought Delhi 's actions posed a " threat " .
At the heart of this dispute lies the Tibetan question .
Historically , China says Arunachal Pradesh 's 35,000 square miles was part of " outer Tibet " .
In a short bloody war , Chinese troops overran Indian positions in the Himalayas in 1962 before retreating .
Since then the two sides have tried to discuss their way out of a problem .
More than dozen rounds of talks have yielded little .
For years the dispute has rumbled on , attracting little international attention .
However , that changed this summer with the arrival of fresh troops – and an Indian airforce squadron of advanced fighters – which analysts say were needed to cope with China 's rising military might , especially in Tibet .
The Indian defence magazine Force points out that the PLA could mobilise four divisions – about 50,000 men – in 24 hours to the Sino - Indian border .
" Awesome military projection capability by any standards , " says the magazine in its latest edition .
To get a taste of how difficult things might be for India , in a diplomatic first , China " internationalised " the issue of Arunachal Pradesh , highlighting its disputed status in July .
Beijing formally objected to a $ 60 m loan for India because it would fund irrigation projects in Arunachal Pradesh .
Although the loan was later approved , Chinese experts say there is still " room to change " the project .
Arunachal Pradesh has been slowly integrated into the Indian state since Delhi sent troops in 1950 carrying papers signed by the Tibetan government in Lhasa , which transferred 35,000 square miles of the Himalayas to India .
Beijing rejects
Delhi's claim , saying the region was subject to a crafty piece of real estate theft by British imperialists in 1914 when China was in chaos .
A solution has always been in sight : Beijing relinquishes its claim to Arunachal Pradesh and Delhi gives up its demand for 15,000 square miles of stragetically important Chinese - held mountainous land bordering Kashmir .
But Arunachal Pradesh for China is not just a territorial issue but an existential one .
The state is home to the town of Tawang , birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama , where Tibetan Buddhism 's biggest monastery , after the Potala palace in Lhasa , sits .
Tawang is also the repository of perhaps the last vestige of a Tibet submerged by China 's rise – sustaining the idea of religious freedom for the diaspora and keeping alive a centuries - old culture and language .
In conversation , the Monpa people who dominate the local area will tell visitors that Tawang could be Tibetan Buddhism 's new Rome , a base from where to spread the faith .
China is alarmed by such talk .
Beijing sees
Tawang not as a place of serenity but as a spiritual spy camp – ultimately challenging the ruling Communist party 's control in Tibet .
These feelings were heightened when the Indian government said this week it would allow the Dalai Lama to travel to Tawang , adding he was " free to go anywhere in India " .
The present Tibetan leader has not been a regular visitor to the town .
He passed through when he fled Tibet in 1959 but he has only been allowed back twice since : once in 1982 and then again 2003 .
This time around he will open a hospital he funded .
The Indian backing to the Dalai Lama comes at a critical time .
The Obama administration said this week that the president would not meet the Tibetan leader during his upcoming trip to Washington – a break with tradition .
George Bush and Bill Clinton met the Dalai Lama when he arrived in the American capital .
Afraid that the White House was now kowtowing to Beijing before the president 's visit this November to China , Tibet 's government in exile openly said even the US was now " appeasing " China .
This is a breakthrough for China – which is unafraid of criticising any head of state for meeting the Dalai Lama , who they see as a man determined to " split the motherland " .
So far 170 countries out of 193 in the United Nations have acceded to China 's demands .
This leaves India in a difficult , lonely position .
It already sees Chinese ports and military bases strung across the Indian Ocean – the so called " string of pearls " strategy designed to check Indian influence in its backyard .
Delhi has been outbid for vital oil and gas resources by its bigger , richer neighbour .
On most measures of hard power – number of nuclear weapons , economic size , population – India lags behind .
China is not afraid to flex its muscles : it blocked India 's bid for a UN security council place and tried to shoot down a groundbreaking US - India nuclear deal .
Delhi says it is in the nature of development for the two large Asian nations to compete and co-operate for resources , cash and technology .
China is India 's largest trading partner , with two - way trade volumes crossing $ 50bn in 2008 .
The two countries , which are both home to millions of poor people , have worked together in trade and climate change – fending off advances from the advanced nations .
For both , Tibet makes it easier to be antagonists rather than collaborators .
Unless both manage to work together to resolve their differences there is a chance the two populations will get bogged down in adversarial nationalism .
The media war could then explode into bloodier conflict on the roof of the world .
Two Self editors have announced their magazine was right to give Kelly Clarkson a slimmer body on their September issue , explaining that covers should n't reflect reality , but " inspire women to want to be their best " .
Unbelievable .

Self 's Editor - in - Chief Lucy Danziger , who admitted last week that this month 's Kelly Clarkson cover was altered - " of course we do post - production correction on our images " - put up a post on her Self.com blog yesterday titled " Pictures That Please Us . "
She wrote that though the program the magazine uses is " technically not Photoshop , " they " correct color and other aspects of the digital pictures we take and then publish the best version we can . "
Yes , every magazine cover is altered in some way , but the Kelly Clarkson is n't controversial just because it was color corrected or even because a few more locks of hair were added to her head : it 's because the editors of Self constructed a new body that bears no resemblance to what Clarkson currently looks like .
Below is the behind the scenes video Danziger posted , which makes it even more obvious that the cover shot was drastically altered .

But my hips looked big in some of the photos ( I was heavier then ) , so when I wanted to put one of them on the editor 's letter in SELF , I asked the art department to shave off a little .
I am confident in my body , proud of what it can accomplish , but it just did n't look the way I wanted in every picture ...
The same is true of vacation .
I keep the pix that show us all happy and glowing and laughing and playing , not the ones where we are scowling or hungry or tired .
The ones that make the Christmas card are the best of the best .
Everyone has left an unflattering picture out of a photo album , but that would be analogous to not running a photo of Kelly Clarkson with her eyes closed , not completely reshaping her body .
Danziger may have altered her body in her marathon picture , but that just means that she was actually so insecure about her body that she drew herself a new one .
Oh , but Danziger goes on to claim that cover portraits are supposed to be idealized artists renderings of what the model could look like , especially since when she walks in to a photo shoot she may look as hideous as a real live person :
Portraits like the one we take each month for the cover of SELF are not supposed to be unedited or a true - to - life snapshot ( more on that in a moment ) .
When the cover girl arrives at the shoot , she is usually unmade up and casually dressed , and could be mistaken for a member of the crew or the editorial team in many cases .
Once we do her makeup and hair , and dress her in beautifully styled outfits and then light her , we then set the best portrait photographer we can on a road to finding a pose and capturing a moment that shows her at her best .

Except they 're not actually " capturing a moment " since the moment never existed !
She continues :
Then we allow the postproduction process to happen , where we mark up the photograph to correct any awkward wrinkles in the blouse , flyaway hair and other things that might detract from the beauty of the shot .
This is art , creativity and collaboration .
It 's not , as in a news photograph , journalism .
It is , however , meant to inspire women to want to be their best .
That is the point ...
Did we alter her appearance ?
Only to make her look her personal best .
Did we publish an act of fiction ?
No .
Not unless you think all photos are that .
But in the sense that Kelly is the picture of confidence , and she truly is , then I think this photo is the truest we have ever put out there on the newsstand .

So even though Kelly Clarkson has said she 's confident at any size and Danziger points out that Clarkson works out and is " as fit as anyone else we have featured in Self , " the magazine 's staffers decided having her instantly shed a few pounds would make her look even more confident and healthy .
Oh - kay , then .
In another blog post , Ashley Mateo , the editorial assistant for Self 's entertainment team , writes :
The truth is , we have absolutely no reason to get worked up over PhotoShop .
Magazines do n't hide the fact that they 're always trying to sell issues — and to sell copies , you need to appeal to readers with the best writing and the best images possible .
We all know celebrities are human ( at least , we all should know ) , so why do we get bent out of shape when a magazine alters an image to portray a celebrity in their best light ?
No one wants to see a giant picture of some star 's cellulite on the cover of a monthly mag — that 's what we have tabloids for !

Right , because if magazines actually ran unaltered photos of celebrities , women may stop hating their arms because they look fat compared to Kelly Clarkson's .
If we saw a few dimples on a healthy woman 's thigh in a magazine , then tabloids might stop running photos with giant arrows pointing to the tell tale signs that celebrities are nothing more than normal human women .
Danziger was right : the point is that magazine covers " inspire women to want to be their best . "
And the best way to keep women reading Self 's workout recommendations and buying the useless beauty products advertised on its pages is to inspire them to keep chasing after a version of themselves that Doesn't .
Really .
Exist .

Geoengineering may not be a last resort to fight global warming any longer – that is , if us humans can't get our act together to reduce the carbon dioxide we 're pumping into the atmosphere .
That 's the warning that emerged from a Royal Society report published Tuesday .
Grand , expensive and uncertain engineering projects – think installing carbon - scrubbing devices across continents or shooting aerosols into the atmosphere to block sunlight – may be humankind 's only shot at slowing man-made global warming , the report 's authors warn .
That 's because current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are n't going far enough , the report 's authors contend .
The world needs to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to half of what they were in 1990 by 2050 , but right now , " Global efforts to reduce emissions have not yet been sufficiently successful to provide conﬁdence that the reductions needed to avoid dangerous climate change will be achieved , " the report states .
" It is hoped that post - 2012 emission reduction targets will stimulate greater action through more effective mechanisms , " the report went on , referring to the upcoming United Nations talks in Copenhagen to craft a carbon - reduction agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol ( see The Copenhagen Call : Biz Leaders Back GHG Reduction Efforts ) .
" But there is a serious risk that sufficient mitigation actions will not be introduced in time , despite the fact that the technologies required are both available and affordable , " the report stated .
So , while working toward a huge reduction in emissions , the world 's governments should be planning for ways to handle geoengineering projects , the report states .
Those fall into two camps .
The first , carbon dioxide removal , involves everything from planting lots of trees to fertilizing the ocean to boost the growth of carbon dioxide - absorbing plankton ( see Carbon Capture Firm Could Use the Ocean to Combat Global Warming ) .
That would get at the root of the problem of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide , but is likely to be massively expensive and complicated , the report noted .
Of the available choices , ocean fertilization held some of the greatest potential for negative side effects , the report noted .
The second technique , solar - radiation management , could be cheaper and faster , the report states .
Solar - radiation management includes such schemes as pumping sulfur into the stratosphere to force the same kind of global cooling that has occurred after massive volcanic eruptions ( see Green Light post ) .
It could also include projects like painting lots of building roofs white to reflect more sunlight back into space – an idea that 's gotten the backing of Energy Secretary Steven Chu , among others .
But such sunlight - blocking schemes do n't deal directly with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and carry the risks of unknown and possible catastrophic side effects , the report warns .
Thus , they should only be used if absolutely necessary , the report stated .
Given the challenge facing the globe , geoengineering concepts of all stripes have been getting more serious attention from important parties , including the Obama administration , the Wall Street Journal reports .
Geoengineering will certainly require an unprecedented level of international cooperation , first on researching which ones will work the best and then on spending the billions of dollars needed to implement them , the report found .
But then , so will reducing manmade greenhouse - gas emissions , as the debate over carbon cap - and - trade legislation in Congress has highlighted ( see Energy - Climate Bill Could Boost Electricity Costs 20 % by 2030 ) .
What 's covered in Taiwan 's universal health care system
Why Taiwan 's universal care works
What 's NOT included in Taiwan 's universal health care system
( Natural News )
When people ask why I oppose Obama 's health care reform proposals , I point out what a consumer ( and employer ) rip - off the current system of pharmaceutical medicine really is .
Americans are victims in a monopoly medical scam that 's enforced by the FDA and FTC with lots of propaganda support from the mainstream media and Big Pharma .
This fraudulent monopoly system causes Americans to pay the highest prices in the world for pharmaceuticals and health care , even while receiving remarkably poor results in their own health status .
Sadly , even Obama 's health reform plan does little to change this situation :
It still traps Americans in a system of overpriced , over - hyped and aggressively marketed pharmaceuticals that harm far more people than they help .
The average American family is right now paying over $ 1,000 a month for insurance coverage .
It 's bankrupting families and driving the American people into an economic wasteland .
Meanwhile , other nations are providing superior health care for a whole lot less money .
How much less ?
Get this : who is unemployed .
A typical family of four where both parents work is paying roughly $ 75 / month which includes full coverage for both the parents and their two children .
A person who is self - employed pays roughly $ 45 / month .
Someone who is employed at an average income level pays just $ 10 / month ( the employer pays the rest ) .
The out - of - pocket fee for a typical visit to the doctor is roughly five dollars .
Taiwan is n't some third - world country .
This is an advanced , first - world nation with state - of - the - art western medical care .
They have high - end technology , world - class physicians trained in western medical schools ( I mean , if you believe in western medicine as being useful ) , and some of the most modern hospitals in Asia .
I was actually in a Taiwan hospital just a few months ago , and I got to witness a simple outpatient surgical procedure conducted quickly , efficiently and with amazing medical expertise .
Spouses of veterans get 70 % of their insurance paid by the government .
Allonly have to pay 30 % of their insurance , too , because the other 70 % is paid by the government .
This means the average Taiwan farmer pays just a few dollars a month for health insurance .
Low - income individuals receiveand pay nothing for full coverage .
( http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?me...
Taiwan 's universal health care system covers : ( http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?me... •
All doctor checkups and routine medical procedures •
All pharmaceuticals •
All dental care other than cosmetic •
All vision and eye care • Emergency medicine , including ambulance costs ( covers 80 % , you pay 20 % ) •
Physical therapy and rehabilitation services •
All prenatal care and birthing care• Traditional Chinese Medicine , including acupuncture , herbs and medical massage ( Tui - Na ) •
At - home care ( covers 90 % , you pay 10 % ) •
Long - term chronic care in the hospital ( you pay 5 % for the first 30 days , then increasingly more the longer you stay , with a maximum of roughly $ 875 out of pocket per stay , no matter how long ) •
All mental health care , including psychiatric medicineIf you 're an American reading this , you might be astonished at what has just been presented here .
How can Taiwan provide all this universal coverage so affordably ?
The answer to this is crucial to understand .
It explains why Obama 's health care reform plan is a complete rip - off .
One of the main reasons is because Taiwan does n't pay monopoly prices for pharmaceuticals ( it buys mostly generics ) .
Taiwan does n't have an insane system of health insurance companies that deny coverage to patients and deny payments to health care providers .
Private insurance companies barely have any role in the system at all , eliminating armies of paper pushers who contribute nothing useful to the health outcome of citizens .
Taiwan also does n't have out - of - control medical malpractice lawsuits .
This greatly reduces the cost for medical professionals to practice medicine , thereby drastically lowering the end costs to consumers at the same time .
There are no " ambulance chasers " in Taiwan , and doctors do n't have to operate out of the constant fear of being sued by some disgruntled patient .
Perhaps most importantly , Taiwan coversand many forms ofwhich help keep people healthy at a much lower cost than western medicine .
If you need acupuncture or Chinese medicine herbs , just visit an accredited practitioner and your universal health care plan covers most of the cost .
The Taiwan plan is n't perfect -- too many people are using it to hoard prescription drugs that they mail to relatives in China -- but it 's so amazingly affordable and efficient that it puts America 's health care system to shame .
In fact , if you happen to know any Taiwanese living in America , you already know that .
The costs are so much more affordable there that the difference in price pays for a round - trip air ticket with cash to spare !
So if America supposedly offers " the best health care in the world , " why do people flee the country to get health care services somewhere else ?
Why do Mexican - Americans go back to Mexico for their dental work and health care ?
Why do Canadian - Americans cross the border back into Canada for their health care ?
Why do American corporations send employees to the Philippines onto have heart surgery or knee replacements ?
The answer is because , and Obama 's health care reform does nothing to resolve that .
It just continues the rip - off and in some ways makes it even worse by forcing everyone to participate in that rip - off .
It does n't end the health insurance sham or the pharmaceutical cartel .
It does n't provide nutritional therapies for the people , and it does n't meaningfully bring down the cost of health care for the unemployed or self - employed .
It just forces everyone to participate in a system that 's ripping off the American people and American businesses .
And in doing so , it will put even more American employers out of business , ultimately causing a huge loss of American jobs .
The broken system of health care in America can't be fixed by fiddling with the details of who pays for monopoly - priced pharmaceuticals .
It needs to be discarded and rebuilt from the ground up , with a focus on keeping people healthy rather than fattening the profits of drug companies .
Until such a reform proposal comes along that accomplishes that , it does n't deserve my support , nor yours .
If Taiwan can provide full , universal health care coverage for $ 21 / month , why ca n't the U.S. figure out a way to make its own health care somewhat affordable ?
Even getting it down to $ 75 / month would be a huge achievement , making it affordable for almost everyone .
At that price , mandatory participation requirements would n't be so objectionable .
Even a minimum - wage worker could afford it .
Taiwan 's universal health care system does n't cover everything .
Here 's some of what 's not included : • Cosmetic surgery , including breast enlargement , facial surgery and purely cosmetic dental procedures .
If cosmetic reconstruction is necessary due to an accident or injury , then it is covered . •
Vaccinations •
Sex change surgeries •
Infertility procedures or birth control surgeries •
Over - the - counter medications •
Blood ( for transfusions ) ( You have to buy your own blood , or bring a relative who has some to spare ) •
Experimental medicine •
Eye glasses and artificial eyes •
Wheel chairs , walking canes •
Hearing aids• Substance abuse addiction recoveryThose are the big exclusions .
Nearly everything else is covered , including dental , prenatal , emergency medicine and medications .
The reason I 'm printing all this here is because during this debate about U.S. health care reform , it 's useful to see .
This indicates that an affordable , quality health care system is possible if only our politicians would find the backbone to create one .
If Taiwan can do it , why ca n't we ?
The differences between Taiwan 's health care philosophy and America 's philosophy is revealingly found in a web - based ad appearing at the Bureau of National Health Insurance for Taiwan ( http://www.nhi.gov.tw/ ) .
It offers the following advice : • Exercise• Drink Water• Eat a Healthy Diet• Enjoy Nature• Be HappyIn the U.S. , a similar ad on a U.S. government website would instead say something like : • Get vaccinated •
Get irradiated with a mammogram •
Take more medications •
Avoid sunlight •
Avoid nutritional supplements and healing herbs
Is it any wonder that the U.S. health care system is failing ?
The U.S. system pushes pharmaceuticals , surgery and truly bad health advice that just keeps people trapped in a cycle of disease .
The Taiwan system , on the other hand , actually encourages people to adopt healthy lifestyle changes and prevent disease .
Is it any wonder that Taiwan gets better results ?
Of course , even Taiwan 's system is heading for its own troubles , thanks mostly to the influx of pharmaceutical advertising .
Big Pharma 's brainwashing ads are convincing more and more Taiwanese that they need pharmaceutical intervention to be healthy , and the increased demand for pharmaceuticals is starting to take a heavy financial toll on the Taiwan system of universal care .
To save their health care systems , both Taiwan and the United States will need to end the domination of Big Pharma over modern medicine and re-emphasize the importance of nutrition and disease prevention in supporting the health of any nation .
In the following , I will describe what is needed to get Debian running on your NSLU2 .
Please note that this page only provides information on running a full - blown Debian system on the NSLU2 on an external USB drive .
If you 're looking for a firmware to be put in the flash of the NSLU2 ( such as Unslung or OpenSlug ) or other information on this device , please go to the NSLU2 - Linux project ( in particular , check out the firmware matrix ) .
Finally , please note that the NSLU2 is a very low - end device by today 's standards .
In particular , the NSLU2 has only 32 MB of RAM , which is not much to run a modern operating system .
The easy - to - use Debian installer is no longer available for the NSLU2 because the device does not have enough RAM .
While it 's still possible to install Debian on the NSLU2 using the manual method described on this page , I suggest you upgrade to a more modern device .
Support for the Linksys NSLU2 was dropped in Debian 9 ( stretch ) .

Earlier this week , I offered some suggestions for adding more organics to your grocery cart .
But if you 're a budget conscious shopper , you might still be having trouble looking beyond the price .
Organics are definitely more expensive than conventional products , so first I want to offer some strategies for saving money on organics , and then I 'll touch briefly on why organics are more expensive .
12 Strategies to Save Money on Organics
Strategy # 1 : Be a smart shopper .
I 've already listed some ways you can save money on your grocery bill by not following my example .
Other smart shopping strategies include keeping a price book , making a list , stocking up when items are on sale , using coupons , and buying store brands .
Strategy # 2 : Waste not , want not .
Avoid letting food go to waste before you use it , and eat up leftovers .
Strategy # 3 : Find amazing deals with bulk bins , the bins of grains , nuts , and dried fruit at Whole Foods and other natural food stores .
I wish I could buy everything from a bulk bin !
Strategy # 4 : Buy in bulk .
If you can't find it in a bulk bin , buy the largest size you can find .
But remember to keep your eye on the unit price !
Sometimes , the bigger package has an inflated price .
Strategy # 5 : Choose less expensive fruits and vegetables .
Around here , greens and sweet potatoes have the biggest nutritional bang for your buck .
Strategy # 6 : Eat less meat ( especially cow ) .
A serving of organic beans from a can is about $ 0.30 .
An organic egg costs about a quarter .
A serving of the cheapest organic ground beef I 've seen is $ 0.75 .
Strategy # 7 : Buy a share of a cow .
If you 're not keen on going completely vegetarian , you can save money on your meat products by buying a share of a cow directly from a farmer .
Search for local farms at www.eatwild.com.
I 've also heard of cow - shares for dairy products .
Strategy # 8 : Join a CSA ( Community Supported Agriculture ) .
Pay a fee at the beginning of the year and get a share of the farm 's produce .
Two years ago , my family paid $ 400 to participate in a CSA for roughly 20 weeks .
So for $ 20 a week we got a cooler full of fresh , organic fruits and vegetables and a dozen farm - fresh eggs .
You cannot match those prices at the grocery store !
Strategy # 9 : Join a buying club , a group of people who place huge orders directly with food distributers , saving costs by buying in bulk and cutting out the middlemen .
The biggest supplier of natural and organic foods to buying clubs is United National Foods .
I do n't have any experience with them , but I have successfully found some savings on organic grains and legumes through a buying club with members of my church .
They order from Walton Feed .
Strategy # 10 : Pick your own fruits and vegetables .
If you do the harvesting work yourself , you can typically save a lot of money .
Find an organic pick - your - own - farm near you by visiting www.pickyourown.org.
Strategy # 11 : Plant a garden .
Go beyond harvesting and do all the work yourself .
If you have limited space , use the square foot gardening method , and focus on those varieties that will give you the greatest yield with the least work .
Save even more money by growing from seed .
And make sure you use sustainable gardening techniques !
Strategy # 12 : Raise your own chickens or bees .
With a little work , you can have your own fresh eggs and honey .
And if you 're really committed , you could also save money by raising your own goats , pigs , or even a cow .
3 Reasons Organics Cost More
Scale .
Growing crops without pesticides and chemical fertilizer is more time - consuming and labor intensive and generally has to be done on a smaller scale .
All of these factors increase costs .
Niche Market .
So far , the organics industry has been catering to a niche market made up of people who are willing to pay more .
In some cases , organic foods are priced higher to match the expectation of it as a " luxury " item .
Subsidies .
Conventional industrial ag receives massive subsidies from the government .
Organic farmers do not .
Marion Nestle , author of What to Eat , explains :
Until the latest farm bill , which has a small provision for promotion of organic agriculture , organic farmers received not one break from the federal government .
In contrast , the producers of corn , soybeans , wheat and cotton continue to get $ 20 billion or so a year in farm subsidies .
Industrial agriculture also benefits from federally administered marketing programs and from cozy relationships with congressional committees and the USDA .
In contrast , the USDA considers fruits and vegetables " specialty crops . "
This kind of food politics shows up as higher prices in the grocery store .
If more people buy organics , the prices will drop .

The first reason is an integral part of organic farming , but the other two reasons can be changed .
And this is the point I want to emphasize most : I truly believe that .
Every time you go to the grocery store and every time you eat , you are casting your vote about the nature of our agricultural system .
If you want to see changes in the price of organics , find a way to afford at least some of them now .
Save money by using energy wisely , choosing better transportation , and buying less , and shift your savings to your grocery budget .
Dead Rising 2 Fact Sheet
Release Date : TBD
Genre : Zombie Action
Platform : Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC
Rating : TBC
Developer : Blue Castle Games
When a zombie outbreak hits America ’s new capital of entertainment , Fortune City , it is every man and woman for themselves .
But some adapt better than others to survival on Fortune City ’s zombie infested strip .
Spurned on by the paternal instinct to protect his daughter , Chuck Greene is one such man .
Dead Rising 2 builds on the combat system of Dead Rising where anything picked up is a potential weapon , by considerably increasing the number of items Chuck will find in Fortune City ’s casinos , bars and shops .
Just like the original , Chuck will be able to make use of items that range from ‘ traditional ’ weapons like guns and swords to the more improvised such as roulette wheels , croupier sticks , wheelchairs , stuffed marlins and more !
But Dead Rising 2 takes combat one stage further with a set of truly unique weapons including the paddle - saw ( two chain - saws attached to either end of a canoe paddle ) and the self - explanatory drill bucket .
Like millions of Americans , Chuck is gripped by the TV sensation that is Terror is Reality .
Hosted by the flamboyant Tyrone King and ably assisted by his two glamorous co-hosts , Terror is Reality pits ordinary members of the public against an arena full of zombies with a simple challenge – kill more zombies than your opponents and stay alive .
The lucky winner will collect big money and the chance to come back and secure even greater prizes .
Like a modern day gladiatorial contest , those lucky enough to get a grandstand seat urge the contestants to spill more zombie blood , with over the top takedowns greeted by rapturous applause and the promise of slow motion replays on the arena ’s jumbotron .
So , what is it that has forced Chuck to risk his life , is he trying to recapture the fame of his motocross days , does he have a reason to hate zombies , or is it simply the lure of big money ?
Dead Rising 2 allows players to experience the carnage of Terror is Reality with a series of multiplayer challenges for up to four players via online play .
Whether you ’re jumping into giant hamster balls and mowing down the undead ; seeing who can place the most drill buckets on zombies ’ heads , or taking to the arena on a motorbike with chainsaws for handlebars , the challenges will feature exactly the kind of over - the - top action and humor that Dead Rising is known for .
Adding to the competitive nature of these events is the ability to prevent your opponents from scoring , ensuring fierce rivalries as competitors fight dirty to claim victory .
Dead Rising 2 is being developed by Canadian developer Blue Castle Games in close collaboration with Capcom .
A number of members from the original Dead Rising team will be working alongside Blue Castle Games throughout the development process , including Capcom ’s global head of research and development , Keiji Inafune , who as the game ’s Producer , will play an active role in the project .
Playable versions ( single and multiplayer ) of Dead Rising 2 were debuted to media from around the world , exclusively on Xbox 360 at a dedicated event hosted by Capcom , in conjunction with Microsoft , in Shibuya , Tokyo on September 25th , 2009 .
( CNN ) -- Google
Wave , a product that promises to revolutionize online communication , will go out to about 100,000 beta testers Wednesday .
Google
Wave hopes to replace e-mail as the main way people communicate online .
The Web application from Google Inc. combines elements of e-mail , chat , Wiki documents , blogs and photo - sharing sites to create a form of Internet communication called a " hosted conversation , " or a " wave . "
Google demonstrated Wave at the Google I/O developer conference in San Francisco , California , in May .
The closed group of beta testers will help Google fish bugs out of the application before a public release by the end of the year , according to the Google Wave Web site .
The app was created by Jens and Lars Rasmussen , the brothers who developed Google Maps .
The Rasmussen brothers said they hope Google Wave will eventually replace e-mail as the main way people converse on the Internet .
" This should be something everybody uses and something everybody knows , " Jens Rasmussen said .
In Wave , e-mail - like communications can be edited by several users simultaneously .
And users can chat about certain sections of Wave documents in real time , where all users see what a person is typing as it is typed .
If a person comes to the conversation late , they can replay everything they 've missed .
The Rasmussens hope these functions will make online communication more efficient and collaborative .
Jens Rasmussen said e-mail is a computer version of snail mail .
Wave will be something new , a real - time communication system designed specifically for today 's faster - paced , multitasking Internet , he said .
" We really have a much too strong tendency to just take things we know and just adapt them to the digital world , " he said .
Tech bloggers have largely cheered the release of the product .
But there are some concerns that the app may be too complicated for mainstream Web users .
In a video demonstration , the Rasmussens spend an hour and 20 minutes explaining Wave .
Initial reviews of Wave also noted a number of glitches in the application .
Ben Parr of the social - media blog Mashable writes that Wave still has bugs but that the product is improving over time .
" As an initial user of Wave , I have to tell you : things have gotten much more stable .
It still has a slow response time in certain situations and it can still crash , but these things happen far less often than they used to , " he writes .
The blog TechCrunch wrote that Wave " drips with ambition " and will be " a new communication platform for a new Web . "
" Wave offers a very sleek and easy way to navigate and participate in communication on the Web that makes both email and instant messaging look stale , " TechCrunch 's MG Siegler wrote .

Foxtons has lost its second legal case in two years .
High profile estate agency Foxtons has been told by the High Court that some of the charges it imposes on landlords are unfair .
The Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) had asked the court to uphold the regulator 's decision from 2008 that the charges broke consumer regulations .
The OFT said clauses in the small print of Foxtons ' agreements for managing tenanted properties were a " trap " .
It said the court ruling sent out a " clear and unambiguous message " .
' Not hidden away '
The clauses which Mr Justice Mann agreed were unfair said that Foxtons could : • continue to demand " renewal " commission from a landlord if a tenant stayed on past the initial tenancy period - even if the agency had played no further part in arranging or managing the extended tenancy • force the landlord to continue paying commission to the agency , even after Foxtons had sold the property • be paid full commission for selling the property to the tenant , regardless of whether or not it had had a hand in the sale " This ruling sends out a clear and unambiguous message that businesses offering services need to ensure unexpected or surprising terms are not hidden away in small print , " said OFT chief executive , John Fingleton .
" Contracts need to be written in clear and straightforward language with important provisions , particularly those which may disadvantage consumers as in this case , given prominence and actively brought to people 's attention , " he added .
Complaints upheld
The OFT started its legal action early last year , after investigating complaints from landlords , to uphold its powers under the 1999 Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract regulations .
The agency 's contracts had demanded an 11 % renewal commission if a tenant stayed beyond the initial one - year tenancy , and charged 2.5 % of the value of the property if the tenant went on to buy it .
During the hearing in April 2009 , the regulator described the charging of renewal commission as a " time bomb " .
Mr Justice Mann agreed that the terms had been buried in the small print of the estate agency 's standard terms and conditions , which were unlikely to be read thoroughly by clients .
They were also not written in " plain and intelligible " language .
The judge said landlords would be " astonished " to find they had to pay Foxtons commission for the sale of a property , even if the agency had played no part in the deal .
Foxtons " pleased "
After the ruling , London - based Foxtons claimed that the ruling was partly a victory for itself because the ruling meant that renewal commission was not always unfair .
But in response to the judgement it has now reduced the level of its renewal commission , and is now changing its literature and contracts , so that the commission is " spelt out prominently , clearly and in straightforward language " .
The agency said it had already dropped the other contentious contract terms - its third party renewal commissions , and sales commissions contained in lettings agreements .
" We are extremely pleased that this matter has finally been clarified in a way which is to the benefit of consumers and the industry , " said Michael Brown , chief executive of Foxtons .
In a separate case last year , the Court of Appeal ruled that Foxtons was not entitled to commission for selling a house merely for showing the buyer around it .

The odd year election cycle of 2009 is fast approaching with two gubernatorial races entering the national scene .
New Jersey and Virginia will steal the '09 spotlight , but several large cities will conduct mayoral elections and at least one House Seat will be up for grabs .
The depth of public polling is however limited to the two Gubernatorial elections for the moment , and I do n't suspect this will change .
I 've compiled gubernatorial election polling released so far in 2009 and applied our projection methodology .
The resulting conclusions , along with each poll , is depicted in the graphs below .
The graphs are dynamically updated upon the inclusion of a new poll , and embeddable .
The complete list of polling data is available on our Polls and Graphs page with the gubernatorial elections prefixed with " 2009 " on the Race drop down list .

I 've got two quick pieces of analysis , one for each state and I 'll preface my comments by stating that I know very little about each state and next to nothing about the candidates .
I can however provide demographic and historical perspectives .
Let 's begin with New Jersey ; Democratic Incumbent Jon Corzine currently trails by about 8 percent .
A back - analysis of our 2008 Senate projections reveals that just two candidates overcame an 8 percent deficit in mid-July and they were both the challenger rather than the incumbent ; Hagan ( D ) in North Carolina and Merkley ( D ) in Oregon .
A Corzine victory would not be unprecedented , but given the political environment of an odd year election , where nobody cares , it seems unlikely .
Our model currently gives Corzine just a 1.05 % chance of victory .
Virginia features a much more competitive , incumbent - less field in a state trending heavily blue .
The Republican Candidate , Bob McDonnell currently has the upper hand as Creigh Deeds ' primary bounce seems to be subsiding ; but with that being said , neither candidate has obtained inevitability .
The biggest wild card in this election will be the contribution of the Democratic National Committee which is currently chaired by the present Governor of Virginia , Tim Kaine .
If Deeds and Kaine can effectively leverage the Democratic base in Virginia , they should easily win .
McDonnell 's strategy is simple , stay ahead and hope election fatigue sets in , thus diminishing Democratic turnout .
In either case , the victor of the next month will likely be the victor at the end of three months .
I 'll post a polling update every Monday from now until November 3rd with the latest polls and analysis pertaining to the two gubernatorial elections of 2009 .
If another race produces fluid polling data , I 'll incorporate that data as well , but I just do n't see it happening .
As we yawn and open our eyes in the morning , the brain stem sends little puffs of nitric oxide to another part of the brain , the thalamus , which then directs it elsewhere .
Like a computer booting up its operating system before running more complicated programs , the nitric oxide triggers certain functions that set the stage for more complex brain operations , according to a new study .
In these first moments of the day , sensory information floods the system — the bright sunlight coming through the curtains , the time on the screeching alarm clock — and all of it needs to be processed and organized , so the brain can understand its surroundings and begin to perform more complex tasks .
" The thinking part of the brain is applying a sort of stencil to the information coming in and what the nitric oxide is doing is allowing more refinement of that stencil , " says Dwayne Godwin , an associate professor at Wake Forest University and lead author of the study , which was funded by the National Eye Institute .
The little two - atom molecule , it seems , is partly responsible for our ability to perceive whatever it is we 're sensing .
The thalamus sits atop the brain stem .

The finding , published last week in the journal Neuroscience , changes the way scientists understand nitric oxide 's role in the brain , and it also has them rethinking the function of the thalamus , where it is released .
The thalamus was thought to be a fairly primitive structure , sort of a gate that could either open and allow sensory information to stream into the cortex , the higher functioning part of the brain , or cut off the flow entirely .
Godwin says the new research shows it 's more accurate to think of the thalamus not as a gate but as a club bouncer , who does n't simply allow a huge rush of people to go in or no one at all , but picks and chooses whom to let in and out .
" Instead of vision being a process going straight from eye to cortex , it 's more of a loop , " Godwin explained .
" This constitutes a new role for the thalamus in directing , not just modulating . "
While this study is the first to identify nitric oxide 's role in the thalamus , elsewhere in the body it was already known to have an important , if somewhat different function .
The molecule is actually integral to controlling blood flow and is , in fact , the molecule Viagra targets in order to increase blood flow to the penis .
The teeny molecule might have other medical uses .
" This study shows a unique role for nitric oxide .
It may help us to someday understand what goes wrong in diseases that affect cognitive processing , such as attention deficit disorder or schizophrenia , and it adds to our fundamental understanding of how we perceive the world around us , " Godwin said .
