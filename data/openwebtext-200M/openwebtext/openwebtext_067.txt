Next to email , search is Internet users ' primary activity .
But most people do n't realize that there 's a LOT more search engines out there than just the Big Four : Google , Yahoo , AOL , or MSN .
In fact , there are literally hundreds of really great niche , or vertical , search engines that focus on all kinds of topics : images , jobs , Bit Torrents , blogs , etc .
You can find all sorts of great stuff using these alternative search engines that you might not be able to find on the more general , Big Box - type of search engines ; plus , most of these niche search engines have really interesting features that are fun to play with .

Clusty is a metasearch engine , meaning it combines results from a variety of different sources .
However , Clusty adds a bit of extra search engine goodness in the mix by giving you clustered results .
Basically , clustered results are extra search suggestions arranged by category
for example , if you type in " coffee " , Clusty responds with clustered results to the left such as Tea , Espresso , History of Coffee , etc .
Indeed.com is a job search engine .
It is not a list of message boards , or a place where you can actually submit your resume .
Indeed is extremely simple to use , and covers all the major job boards , newspaper classified sites , niche industry sites and corporate job sites .
I found more jobs in five minutes on here than I did searching on other job boards .
You have to go to the individual websites in order to apply ( which is kind of a pain ) but this is a great way to generate job leads .
Indeed also offers a nice toolset for the job searcher , including a JobRoll , " a customized , dynamically - updating list of jobs that may be placed on your blog or website . "

Blinkx TV is basically a search engine that allows you to search for audio , video , and podcasts using not only keywords and phrases , but also content in the actual clips that you 're looking for .
For example , if you wanted to find Kermit the Frog 's " It 's Not Easy Being Green " , you could type in " having to spend each day the color of the leaves " , and Blinkx would be able to fetch your data using not only your content , but the concept behind your content - the spoken word ( or in this case , the lyrics ) .
It 's also another search engine that 's just beautifully designed
you 're going to want to make sure you have relatively high - speed access in order to view the site the way it was intended .
This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as Internet search engines ; over at About Web Search I 've been profiling a new search engine every day this fall - 100 Search Engines in 100 Days - and I have n't run out of material yet .
The Web is just so massively ginormous that one search engine could not ever possibly hope to index all that information in one place .
Alternative search engines are an excellent way to get different snapshots of the Web than what you may be used to .

Wendy Boswell edits About.com 's Web Search section .
Useit.com , the website where I published Alertbox articles from 1995 to 2012 , was famous ( or infamous ) within the web design community for its minimalist approach to visual design .
The real reason was explained in an interview with The Guardian : " The web design guru that web designers love to hate . "
My scaled - back design had a strong effect on the reflective level of Don Norman 's theory for emotional design .
Screenshot of the www.useit.com homepage .
My original reasons , when I designed the site in 1995 , were as follows :
Download times rule the Web , and since many users still do n't have broadband , Web pages can be no more than 6 KB if they are to download in one second which is the required response time for hypertext navigation .
Users do not keep their attention on the page if downloading exceeds 10 seconds , corresponding to 60 KB at modem speed .
Keeping below these size limits rules out most graphics .
I am not a visual designer , so my graphics would look crummy anyway .
Since this website is created by myself ( and not by a multidisciplinary team as I always recommend for large sites ) I did n't want to spend money to hire an artist .
These arguments are still relevant , even though most users now have broadband access and can accommodate a few images .
Indeed , I have started using screenshot and charts in my articles from time to time .
For more info about the need for sub - second response times , see my book Multimedia and Hypertext : The Internet and Beyond or my short essay on the three main response time limits .
I did have to add a small glyph to the navigation bar to emphasize the meaning of the hierarchy nesting .
My original design used a simple colon to separate the levels , but some users thought that the colons indicated alternative choices on the same level ( and not a progressively deeper nesting of options , as intended ) .
The arrows seem to be slightly easier to understand as an indication of moving deeper and deeper into the site .
Before : use of a colon as hierarchy separator
After : use of an arrow as hierarchy separator
( Update 2007 : note that the current recommendation for the breadcrumb separator is to simply use a > [ greater - than sign ] .
Users are now so accustomed to breadcrumbs that there 's no need for the added symbolism provided by an arrow . )

The Onkalo entrance is set in low woods near Finland 's coast
While British authorities agonise over what to do with the legacy of half a century of nuclear power , Finland is one of a handful of countries which has embarked on the journey towards a " final " waste solution .
Enter the 6.5 m - high , 5 m - wide ( 20 ft - high , 16 ft - wide ) Onkalo tunnel , and you would drive down a spiralling track which will eventually stretch 5 km ( 3 miles ) through solid rock , reaching a depth of 500 m ( 1,600ft ) .
The first travellers to go down the tunnel will be investigators aiming to demonstrate that the rock is structurally sound enough to proceed with the disposal of spent fuel rods containing plutonium and other unpleasant materials .
If they were to turn up a positive result , and if government agencies grant the necessary licences , the first canisters of spent fuel would begin rolling down the tunnel about 15 years from now .
As things stand , Finland is on course to become the first country in the world to entomb its most troublesome nuclear waste in a designated final resting place .
' Multiple barriers '
The Onkalo facility is run by the company Posiva , and the system it uses is a Swedish concept called KBS3 , which Sweden 's proposed repository would also implement .
The Onkalo tunnel will spiral to a depth of 500m
" The safety concept is based on so - called ' multiple barriers ' , " says Timo Aikas , Posiva 's vice - president in charge of engineering .
" One barrier is of course the solid stable crystalline rock .
The remaining barriers are engineered barriers , the most important of which is long corrosion - resistant copper canisters , inside which we put the actual fuel rods . "
In this vision , the bottom of the Onkalo tunnel would sprout a grid of horizontal shafts .
Canisters containing the spent fuel rods would be deposited into holes in the bottom of each shaft .
The canisters would nest in a bed of bentonite clay , which swells when it absorbs water .
This comes with twin benefits ; cushioning the cargo from geological movement , and ensuring there are no voids where substantial quantities of water can penetrate , corroding the canisters and carrying away their radioactive contents .
As each canister goes in , the tunnels would be filled up again with yet more clay and rock .
I would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not
Kaisa Kosonen , Greenpeace
A granite curtain would have descended on the first civilian nuclear epoch .
Through the ice age
Some of the radionuclides - atoms with unstable nuclei that undergo radioactive decay - in spent fuel rods remain radioactive for more than 100,000 years .
In that time , could not even the tiny quantities of water which the bentonite allows through penetrate the copper canister shells , allowing dangerously active isotopes to escape ?
Timo Aikas believes not .
" We have seen that the copper canister will not be corroded away , " he says .
" We have native copper in the Finnish and Swedish bedrock , which means we have good conditions for such things .
We know from corrosion testing that 1.5 cm [ thickness ] of copper would be enough from the corrosion standpoint for times longer than 100,000 years , but we have 5 cm ( two inches ) copper . "
The time period is so mind - bendingly long that it will almost certainly take the world through another ice age ; which , if history is a guide , would bury Finland and Sweden under 2 - 3 km of ice .
Fuel rods are placed inside a steel cylinder cased in copper
So concerned have European authorities been about this that the European Commission 's Institute for Energy in the Netherlands commissioned pressure tests on the steel cylinders .
" The maximum [ ice ] thickness is 3 km , which equates to a pressure of 30 megapascals ( MPa ) , " says the engineer in charge , Kalle Nielsson .
Combined with pressure from groundwater and the tight embrace of bentonite clay , the cylinders would experience a total pressure of 45 MPa , which corresponds to the pressure you would have 4,500 m ( 15,000 ft ) down in the ocean .
In tests , the cylinders stood up to a pressure three times that value before failing .
" I would say that it 's safe , " is Kalle Nielsson 's conclusion .
" And we have made a probabilistic calculation - ' what is the probability that it would fail at this 45 MPa ? ' - and it is less than one out of a million canisters that would fail .
So I would say as a concept that it 's safe . "
Far - sighted funds
Technology is only one part of the Finnish solution ; the other vital component is finance .
" Our current cost estimate for this ' funeral ' is about 3bn euros , " says Timo Aikas .
When you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , you have to have trust
Timo Aikas
The signs point in a different direction .
The advent of commercial nuclear power to Finland in the late 1970s saw the establishment of a fund to pay for the eventual clean - up .
" Every year , we have re-calculated the fund based on the amount of spent fuel accumulated , " says Timo Aikas , " and at the moment the fund is approximately 1.4bn euros . "
The money has come from generating companies through a small levy on the price of nuclear electricity .
It is , perhaps , the sort of measure which current British leaders looking at a waste disposal facility bill in the region of £ 10bn ( 14bn euros ) would wish their predecessors had chosen to implement .
Rocky site
Even if the KBS3 concept is sound , even if Finland has the money to implement it , there is a question over whether Eurajoki is the best place to put it into action .
Greenpeace , which has been spearheading a campaign against the new Olkiluoto - 3 nuclear reactor taking shape just a kilometre from the Onkalo site , is concerned that the local geology may not be the soundest available .
Construction work on Finland 's new reactor proceeds nearby
" And , eventually , they chose the site on sociological reasons , because eventually Eurajoki was the first municipality to say 'ok , we can take it ' , and there was n't an active nuclear opposition in this area . "
That lack of local opposition may be down to the fact that nuclear reactors have stood in the area for three decades , gaining acceptance for an industry which has maintained a good local safety record and brought employment .
" It boils down basically to trust , " comments Timo Aikas .
" When you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , which takes us to 2100 when the final sealing takes place , there will always be uncertainty .
So you have to have trust . "
Kaisa Kosonen urges caution ; the case for Onkalo , she says , is not proven .
" I would like to see much more research done and not having this hasty process , " she says .
" And I would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not . "
But Timo
Aikas believes his system and his team deserve the trust they have found in Eurajoki , and that Onkalo will prove as safe a resting place for highly active radionuclides as can be found , barring any surprises with the local geology .
And he urges other countries , Britain included , to take a decision and find a solution .
" Nuclear waste does n't go away , " he reflects .
" And if we just keep it in stores above ground we just push the problem to the next generation .
It 's much more responsible now to develop solutions on how to take care of it . "

Link goes to Gothamist
On January 30 , 1937 , a letter to the New Statesman and Nation announced that Darwin , Marx , and Freud had a successor — or , more accurately , successors .
“ Mass - Observation develops out of anthropology , psychology , and the sciences which study man , ” the letter read , “ but it plans to work with a mass of observers . ”
The movement already had fifty volunteers , and it aspired to have five thousand , ready to study such aspects of contemporary life as :
**{ : .break one} ** Behaviour of people at war memorials .
Shouts and gestures of motorists .
The aspidistra cult .
Anthropology of football pools .
Bathroom behaviour .
Beards , armpits , eyebrows .
Anti-semitism .
Distribution , diffusion and significance of the dirty joke .
Funerals and undertakers .
Female taboos about eating .
The private lives of midwives . **
The data collected would enable the organizers to plot “ weather - maps of public feeling . ”
As a matter of principle , Mass - Observers did not distinguish themselves from the people they studied .
They intended merely to expose facts “ in simple terms to all observers , so that their environment may be understood , and thus constantly transformed . ”
The letter was the first of several manifestos , none of which made Mass - Observation easy to categorize .
In February , the group declared , in the journal New Verse , that it would establish a new standard for literary realism and liberate poetry from the grasp of professionals : “ In taking up the role of observer , each person becomes like Courbet at his easel , Cuvier with his cadaver , and Humboldt with his continent . ”
The inventors of the new science were Charles Madge , a poet , journalist , and card - carrying Communist ; Humphrey Jennings , a Surrealist painter and documentary filmmaker ; and Tom Harrisson , a renegade anthropologist more at home with cannibals than with academics .
They were a fractious triumvirate from the outset , never even agreeing whether their group ’s name meant observation of the masses or by them , but between 1937 and 1945 hundreds of people mailed in regular reports of their daily lives .
They came from all backgrounds , though young unmarried clerks and schoolteachers were especially well represented .
No detail was too trivial .
Mass - Observation studied which end of a cigarette people tap before lighting it ( fifty - two per cent tap the end they put in their mouths ) , the nature of women ’s revenge fantasies in wartime ( cut Hitler into slices for pie ; saw off his ankles , sharpen his shins into stakes , and pound him into the earth with a big saucepan ) , and the number of outdoor copulations on a typical night in the working - class vacation town of Blackpool ( four , including one in which an observer participated ) .
The group released a series of quirky books , and during the Second World War its reports influenced the British government ’s approach to civilian morale and even tax policy .
Young , confused , and vigorous , Mass - Observation sought to understand something that anthropology and sociology still took largely for granted : the everyday life of ordinary people .
The first to daydream about an “ anthropology of ourselves ” was Madge , a young man with a long face , slender fingers , beautiful manners , and a steely will .
At Cambridge , he had studied English with I. A. Richards , best known for giving his students unsigned poems to get their unprejudiced responses , and had joined the Communist Party .
After Madge left school , Yeats put two of his poems in the “ Oxford Book of Modern Verse , ” and Eliot arranged a day job for him as a reporter for the Daily Mirror .
On the night of November 30 , 1936 , London ’s Crystal Palace — the iron - and - glass home of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and a triumph of Victorian capitalism — burned down .
Madge , then twenty - four , had been mixing with England ’s Surrealists , who , following Freud , saw significance in accidents , and he started to wonder if there could be a meaning in the destruction of such an iconic building .
Perhaps , by documenting events that shook public consciousness , one could make society aware of its unexamined myths and fantasies , and thus free to change them .
For this kind of liberation , the French Surrealist André Breton had explained , “ poetry must be created by everyone . ”
So Madge had started to plan a movement that he called “ Popular Poetry , ” to be spread by “ Coincidence Clubs ” throughout Great Britain .
The fire provided a perfect opportunity , particularly since , soon afterward , the news broke that Edward VIII was being forced to choose between his crown and his not yet divorced lover , Wallis Simpson .
Coincidence ?
Now a double omen hung over Britain .
The press had delayed reporting the abdication crisis until the last minute — exactly the kind of society - wide repression that the Surrealists wanted to break .
Madge ’s chief collaborator was Jennings , a close friend since Cambridge days .
Jennings had a nervous habit of eating paper and a mannered way of sucking on sugar cubes .
Peggy Guggenheim , one of his lovers , claimed that he “ looked like Donald Duck ” — she dumped him and took up with Samuel Beckett — but in a 1944 photograph that Lee Miller shot for Vogue Jennings appears glamorous and confident .
For all his peculiarities , he succeeded at almost everything he put his hand to .
In college and after , he designed theatre costumes and sets , and in 1931 , at the age of twenty - four , he went to Paris to design in silk .
“ My balls feel as quiet & rich as the paintings of Poussin in exile , ” he wrote home to his young wife , yearningly .
As the simile suggests , his first and greatest love was painting , and he painted until his money — and his wife ’s patience — ran out .
In 1934 , he at last settled down to steady work , making films .
For Britain ’s General Post Office he edited a half - hour history of the British mail , and for Shell Oil he helped out on a commercial about a robot thrilled into life by lubrication .
In 1936 , he helped to organize the International Surrealist Exhibition , in London , and his connections with the movement made him a natural partner for Madge ’s new venture .
In a letter to the New Statesman published on January 2 , 1937 , Madge announced that he and his friends intended to crack “ the Crystal Palace - Abdication symbolic situation , ” and asked for help with the collection of evidence .
“ Only mass observations can create mass science , ” he wrote , and gave his address .
In Bolton , an industrial town in northern England so bleak that even the riverbed was paved , Madge ’s letter caught the eye of twenty - five - year - old Tom Harrisson , who was reading the New Statesman in the public library because he could n’t afford to buy it .
He saw it because the next item on the page was a poem of his , “ Coconut Moon , ” written some three years earlier , in the New Hebrides ( the South Pacific archipelago today known as Vanuatu ) , where he had gone on a zoological expedition .
He had ended up staying for two years , studying the natives and establishing himself as a “ booze - artist of first rank ” with kava , the native drink .
He let a chief ’s wife scarify his chest , and later insinuated that he had participated in a cannibal feast .
Judith M. Heimann , in her lively and scrupulously researched biography , “ The Most Offending Soul Alive ” ( 1998 ) , writes that this claim was disingenuous , but she does believe that he ate a rotting wood grub offered to him by a leper .
Back in Britain , Harrisson lectured about his experiences , wrote them up in a book , and then found himself at loose ends .
Alienated from his peers and about to be disinherited by his father , he decided to go down and out and become a participant - observer of his own country , then mired in the Great Depression .
In much the same spirit in which George Orwell went to Wigan , and James Agee to Alabama , Harrisson chose Bolton .
He worked there as a mill hand , truck driver , shop assistant , and ice - cream man .
You can easyly use this trick at partyes , or to entertain your friends , or maybe your girlfriend .
Is fun , and easy to perform .
While sitting at your desk , lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles .
Now , while doing this , draw the number " 6 " in the air with your right hand .
Your foot will change direction and there 's nothing you can do about it .
Work restarted at Isfahan this week
He said he was working on a diplomatic solution , but was sceptical that one could be found .
The UN 's atomic watchdog has called on Iran to halt nuclear fuel development .
Iran , which denies it is secretly trying to develop nuclear arms , restarted work at its uranium conversion plant at Isfahan on Monday .
" All options are on the table , " said Mr Bush , when asked about the possible use of force during an interview for Israeli TV .
" The use of force is the last option for any president .
You know we have used force in the recent past to secure our country , " he said .
NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE
Mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake Yellowcake is converted into a gas by heating it to about 64C ( 147 F )
Gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and process is repeated until uranium is enriched Low - level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle Iran 's press defiant
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says the president wants to send a clear warning to Tehran , although in reality the US already has its hands full in neighbouring Iraq .
' Cost them dearly '
The former Iranian President , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , has expressed surprise at Thursday 's call by the UN nuclear agency , the IAEA , for Iran to suspend its nuclear activities .
The IAEA asked its chief , Mohamed ElBaradei , to report on Iran 's compliance by 3 September .
Speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran , Mr Rafsanjani said western opposition to Iran 's decision to resume its nuclear programme would , as he put it , cost them dearly .
" Our people are not going to allow their nuclear rights to be seized , " Mr Rafsanjani said .
He said he was astonished that no country opposed the European Union - sponsored resolution , adopted by the IAEA , that urged Iran to stop any work on processing uranium for enrichment .
He emphasised that Iran 's decision to resume its nuclear programme was irreversible , and said his country could not be treated like Iraq or Libya .
The IAEA 's 35 - member governing body met in emergency session this week after Iran ended a nine - month suspension of work at Isfahan .
Iran insists it needs nuclear power as an alternative energy source , but Western nations fear it has plans to produce nuclear weapons .

Blair announces plans to withdraw 1,600 troops from Iraq " in coming months "
• British PM says troops to remain " as long as we are wanted and have a job to do "

• Remaining British troops to play support and training role for Iraqi security forces
Adjust font size :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday announced plans for the imminent withdrawal of around 1,600 of his country 's troops from Iraq .
In a statement to lawmakers in the House of Commons , Blair said the UK 's coalition contingent based in Basra would be reduced in the coming months -- but only if Iraqi security forces could secure the southern part of the country .
" The actual reduction in forces will be from the present 7,100 -- itself down from over 9,000 two years ago and 40,000 at the time of the conflict -- to roughly 5,500 , " Blair said .
He said the withdrawal reflected the relative stability in Basra , where the sectarian rifts that have turned Baghdad and northern Iraq into a powderkeg are less of a problem .
( Map )
" The next chapter in Basra 's history will be written by Iraqis , " Blair said .
Britain 's plans prompted U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , speaking at a news conference in Berlin with German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , to reject suggestions the American - led coalition in Iraq was crumbling .
" The British have done what is really the plan for the country as a whole , which is to be able to transfer security responsibilities to the Iraqis as conditions permit , " she said .
Rice said that " the coalition remains intact and in fact the British will have thousands of soldiers deployed in Iraq in the south . "
Blair said British troops would increasingly play a support and training role with Iraqi forces assuming responsibility for security operations .
( Watch Blair announce troop withdrawal . )
He said there would be no diminution in British combat resources and said a military presence would remain into 2008 " for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do . "
" The speed at which this happens depends , of course , in part on what we do , what the Iraqi authorities themselves do , but also on the attitude of those we are together fighting . "
More than 130 British troops have been killed in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Meanwhile Denmark on Wednesday announced it would withdraw its contingent of coalition forces by August .
Lithuania also said it was considering withdrawing its 53 troops .
Denmark 's 460 soldiers serve under British command in Basra .
( Full Story )
U.S. Secretary of State Rice said the moves were in line with long term plans for Iraq and would not compromise security or the strenght of the coalition .
" The coalition remains intact and in fact the British will have thousands of soldiers deployed in Iraq in the south , " she said at a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , Reuters reported .
" It is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibility to the Iraqis , that coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances , " she added .
Blair 's statement followed a weekend television interview in which he declared that the British mission in Basra -- codenamed " Sinbad " -- had been " completed " and " successful . "
" The issue is the operation that we have been conducting in Basra is now complete ...
And it has been successful as an operation and as a result there has been reconstruction that has come in behind it and we have been able to make real progress . "
( Watch what may be the factors behind the decision )
On Wednesday the Sun newspaper reported that the first British troops would return home " within weeks " and said that 3,000 will follow by the end of the year .
The Guardian and The Sun reported that all British forces would leave Iraq by the end of 2008 .
The Guardian , quoting defense sources , said British troops would continue carrying out long range patrols in Maysan province along the border with Iran from a single base in Basra .
Defence officials have been encouraged by a campaign to root out criminals and Shia militia supporters from the Basra police force , the paper reported .
CNN 's Nic Robertson said British forces had adopted a " softly - softly approach " to policing Basra in comparison with their American allies in Baghdad .
" The assessment has clearly been made for political reasons or because the situation is much better now in Basra that this is a safe operating status that can be put in place there , " said Robertson .
" They would go out with berets on their heads instead of helmets , they would patrol the streets more frequently than U.S. troops typically would and try to engage the local population .
But in the last year that has not been as successful a tactic as it was in the first year or so . "
The British announcement came one day after the Iraqi Army division based in Basra transferred from coalition command to Iraqi command .
That Iraqi unit " is now -- for the first time -- taking its orders direct from an Iraqi headquarters in Baghdad , " according to a statement on Britain 's Ministry of Defense Web site .
In Basra many Iraqis greeted the news with relief , while others voiced fears the British withdrawal was premature amid fears over tensions between Shia parties bubbling beneath the surface .
Salam al - Maliki , a senior official in the bloc loyal to radical young cleric Moqtada al - Sadr which has long opposed a foreign presence in Iraq , said any violence in the city would cease once the foreign troops have left .
" The militias and militant groups in these areas only fired their weapons at the occupier and when they go , all of the violence here will end , " he said .

U.S. sends more troops to Iraq
In Washington , the White House welcomed the British move , even as the U.S. sends more troops into Iraq in an effort to put down a wave of sectarian violence in Baghdad and pacify Anbar province , the heart of the Sunni insurgency .
" The president views this as a success , " National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" The president wants to do the same thing , to bring our troops home as soon as possible .
" The president is grateful for the support of the British forces in the past and into the future .
While the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust force in southern Iraq , we 're pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis . "
" The United States shares the same goal of turning over to the Iraqi security forces and reducing the number of American troops in Iraq , " the statement added .
Johndroe said Blair briefed President Bush about the plan during one of their " routine " calls Tuesday morning .
But Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy called Blair 's announcement a " stunning rejection of President Bush 's high risk Iraq policy . "
" No matter how the White House tries to spin it , the British government has decided to split with President Bush and begin to move their troops out of Iraq .
This should be a wake up call to the administration , " Kennedy said in a statement .
" Eighteen other countries have already withdrawn or dramatically reduced their troop presence in Iraq .
A majority of the American people voted last November for a changed policy in Iraq .
A majority of the House and the Senate , a unanimous Baker - Hamilton Commission and numerous generals have rejected the Administration 's policy in Iraq .
And now our country 's strongest ally has rejected it . "
Political damage
Opposition to the war has hurt Blair politically , with his ruling Labor Party losing seats in Parliament and in local elections in the past two years .
The prime minister announced in September that he would leave office within a year .
CNN 's Robin Oakley said the announcement of plans to withdraw troops from Iraq would be seen as a " turning point " by Blair as he prepares for his exit from government .
" Tony Blair wants to show he got things moving in the right direction before he goes , " said Oakley .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague of the opposition Conservative Party said British forces in Iraq were overstretched and had probably reached the limit of what they could " usefully achieve . "
Anti-war protester Lindsey German of the UK's Stop the War Coalition said the move was an admission that the troops were not doing any good : " [ Blair ] needs to come clean on what a mistake , and what a disaster , the war has actually been . "
Britain contributed about 46,000 soldiers , sailors and air force personnel to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
More than half those troops were withdrawn within two months of the invasion , leaving the remaining contingent in Basra .
News of the withdrawal comes three days after it was reported that Prince Harry would deploy with his unit to Iraq in April or May .

How to make something amazing , right now »
Reducing fear is the killer app
The high - pitched screech of the drill .
The sickly smell of antiseptic and fear .
The long nervous wait for the attendant to call your name and take you ... back there .
We assume that people are afraid of the dentist , but we do n't usually think of software as scary .
Maybe we should rethink that .
Our users might be more afraid of us and our products than we think .
And those who can reduce or eliminate that fear have a huge advantage .
Not to mention a passionately loyal following .
Something extraordinary happened to me yesterday , but before I tell that story I want you to look at these pictures :
One , a drab but typical medical office .
The other , a warm , inviting , spa-like environment .
The spa -like place is actually my dentist 's office .
And I would drive 100 miles to go there , because the people there work their a** off to reduce my fear .
And the pictures do n't do it justice because you 're missing the smell ( freshly ground coffee beans and warm cookies ) and the sounds ( jazz , not drills ) .
Here 's another picture , of the Boulder Community Foothills Hospital , the first hospital in the US to earn the LEED certification for being " green . "
It does n't look like a hospital .
It does n't feel like a hospital .
And it does n't smell like a hospital .
I 'm not sure how they do it , but no matter when you go , it smells like fresh popped popcorn .
Think about that ... almost nobody has a bad association with the smell of popcorn .
I instantly think movies and theme parks .
( And the live piano music reminds me of shopping in Nordstrom's . )
In a medical scenario , reducing fear means a lot .
But think about all the ways our users ( or potential users ) might be afraid .
Not in mortal terror , but afraid nonetheless .
The fear of not being smart enough to learn a new product , programming language , or procedure .
The fear of being taken advantage of by an unscrupulous company and / or sales person .
The fear of making the wrong purchasing decision .
The fear of looking stupid or slow in front of our co-workers .
I 've often said that reducing guilt is the killer app , but now I 'd put reducing fear way up there too .
He who reduces fear better than the competition can , potentially , stop competing on price , convenience , or just about anything else .
Reduce my fear , and I 'll be grateful forever .
So here 's my story :
Y'all have probably seen a lot of pink lately , inspired by the fight against breast cancer .
Yesterday , I went to the Boulder Foothills Hospital ( in the picture ) where I was scheduled for a mammogram .
I was terrified .
I 'm not exaggerating .
As many of you know , my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age , younger than I am now .
She did not survive .
The most tragic part was that she probably would have , if it had been detected earlier .
But she was too afraid to have the exam ... afraid of hearing the results she ultimately got .
Cancer has been on my mind a lot this year .
Less than a year ago both myself and my daughter were diagnosed with a form of cancer that had not yet become invasive , but that could have killed both of us had we not been tested .
But worst of all , I have -- quite irrationally - - not had a mammogram in 10 years .
A monumentally stupid choice , given that I 'm at very high risk for breast cancer .
But ...
I am more terrified of that test than anything I 've ever done , and I 've spent the last few years convinced that it was already too late .
Thinking about it sends me straight to the childhood moment when I learned the results of my mother 's mammogram ( and the awful period that followed ) .
It was selfish of me , as a mother myself , to not do everything I can to stay healthy and alive , but fear does bizarre , irrational things to the brain .
Finally , though , all the pink - awareness and a visit to this extraordinary hospital convinced me .
When I arrived , I told the technician my story , and literally begged her to rush the results .
" 7 - 10 days is how long it takes for the doctor to review it and get the results to your doctor , " she said .
" There 's nothing I can do to speed that up . "
I could barely breathe or walk , but I managed to get through the exam .
But now the worst part begins ...
The Wait .
The first wait is for the ten minutes it takes for the tech to review the film to make sure the pictures are n't too dark , light , or blurred .
Once they 've checked the film , they either walk you back to repeat the test , or send you home to start The Wait .
So there I sat , waiting for the tech .
Five minutes passed .
Ten minutes .
20 minutes I sat in that little room .
Finally she walked in and said , " The film is fine , you 're free to go . "
And then something happened that I 'll remember for the rest of my life .
She sat down next to me and said , " Oh , so how would you like to enjoy your weekend ? " I was confused .
" I convinced the doctor to break protocol .
He said everything 's perfect and we 'll see you in a year . "
We both cried .
Reducing fear does n't have to be about life or death or pain to be meaningful and powerful .
If you can help your users feel more confident and less stressed , you 've given them a wonderful gift .
Whether it's a policy change , better documentation and support , or more user - friendly design , anything you do to genuinely reduce my fear improves my life .
Why not ask customers about their needs before you agree to sell them something ?
( And be willing to " downsell " rather than trying to convince them to buy something more expensive than they need . )
Why not keep Consumer Report magazines in your dealership , or give potential customers a quote from your competitors , even if it means you lose that sale ?
Why not work harder to make sure new users ( or students ) realize that they really ARE going to be able to " get " this , and that you 'll be there every step of the way ?
Reduce my fear and I 'll love you forever . : )

a very close friend of mine is going through stage 4 breast cancer right now , so this is personally significant to me .
what you say about customer service is very insightful .
and , btw , when i started my practice , i had very similar thoughts in mind , not only for my physical practice but also for my web site .
a lot of therapist 's web sites look a little like dentists ' waiting rooms , and i tried to get a different look , too .

As an uninsured mother of three , living below the poverty line , I can't quite see the value of getting a mammogram .
If I am diagnosed with cancer , I can't afford to treat it , so what 's the point ?

Please , go again next year .
On the subject of reducing fear , and a tie in to the " Books I wish everyone would read " post .
There is a book called " Crucial Conversations " .
One of the first rules for having a difficult conversation is to reduce the fear .
Fear that you will be yelled at or can not share your ideas .
It should be read by every manager and most husbands .

Thank you for sharing .
And the next time you 're there , as incentive and explanation for the smell , if you go to the pharmacy on the first floor , they have a real , honest - to - goodness popcorn machine .

Posted by : Ted | Oct 15 , 2006 10:14:00 AM
Personally , I hate the smell of popcorn .
I makes me think of theme parks , which I loathe , and of cinemas full of people stuffing food in their mouths and not watching the movie !
I do take the point though .

The last time I bought a new car I explicitly went out of my way to give the sale to a salesman I 'd spent only 3 minutes talking to .
I walked into his dealership , told him what I wanted and asked him for the best price .
He flat out told me it , and said the only way they go lower is for rental companies .
Hours and hours of dickering with other salesmen at other dealerships only to get them down to the same price this guy quoted me on walking in off the street .
He was honest with me and did n't waste my time .
Even though I wasted my own time talking to other people I felt he deserved to be rewarded for his behaviour .

It is so important to understand your customers / clients / patients and how to make them feel safe , secure and smart .
' Make the user smart ' is a usability tenet , but it applies to anything you do .
I 'm one of those people who does n't feel safe during medical procedures unless I know exactly what is going on .
By telling my dentist this , he kept a running commentary going as he worked and the root canal I had earlier this year was much less stressful and actually kinda cool to observe ( who knew those roots went so far down into your jaw ? )
It made me feel calmer , more in control and helped me to manage the pain better .
Remember , we are always dealing with human beings .
They are afraid of so many things : looking stupid , feeling out of control , making bad decisions .
Deal with the person behind the issue , understand their fears , make them feel safe , secure and smart .
Do n't hide behind protocol and procedure .
This was an amazing ( and sobering ) example , Kathy .
Thanks for sharing .

I get my mammograms done at a clinic here in Seattle where the Doctor reads the films right there and tells you the results .
You walk into the darkroom and he has your current plus several old films .
He gives you the results immediately and then shows you how he read the films .
If he finds something you go downstairs for the ultrasound to followup immediately [ my sister had to have one once , fortunately it was a cyst ] .
I can't imagine having to wait over a week for results .

Thanks for beautifully articulating the feelings that surface related to surviving cancer ( yours , your daughter 's * and* your mother 's ) and anticipating our fate will follow that of our parents .

I love this post and the whole concept of pushing people to see the possibilities with boundaries .
As a therapist who started blogging to throw it all out there ( caution , mainly ) I see constraints as boundaries that can protect us but unnecessarily stifle creativity if taken too seriously .
If I have to introduce every story I tell with the words , " Of course I 've disguised the a ) identity , b ) gender , c ) biological sex , d ) context of everything and everyone in this annecdote , then FINE , I WILL .
Just do n't tell me not to blog .

You 've created one of the most moving posts I 've ever read .
Stunning insight as usual and you 've spurred me on to see my doctor as it's probably been 10 years myself .
Posted by : Brett Nordquist | Oct 16 , 2006 10:26:11 PM
Wow ...
It 's a nasty time , when you think there 's a possibility you might have something awful like that .
Been there myself & had painful biopsies which in the end proved it was all OK , and I 've been there with a friend .
Jude :
At the very least , it'd give you time to deal with it mentally & go round saying goodbye to everyone or go do something you always wanted to do but were too afraid to try before - I mean , what the heck , if you know you 're dying , it may be a great time to take up speedway motorcycling , rap - jumping , etc , or tell your best friend you always fancied them , or go eat Fugu in a sushi restaurant .
Nothing ventured , right ?
Once you become symptomatic with cancer , by which I mean , once it gets painful & you collapse or lose the use of an organ etc , it 's pretty much too late for anything .
Without treatment it 'll usually be pretty fast .
Testing at least gives you the breathing space you need to put things in order .
Or the sure and certain knowledge that you 're okay .
Posted by : Matt Moran | Oct 17 , 2006 7:33:14 AM
On a more practical note , one usually does n't think to test children for cancer , so I was wondering what prompted her testing ?
Was it some symptoms , or more of a family history thing ?
What do people need to look for in their own children ?
Posted by : Richard Cook | Oct 17 , 2006 8:35:07 AM
Wow .
I teared up , too .
Very glad your test turned out as it did .

When my grandma went through heart surgery , my parents became completly terrified because of a wrong indication in the surgery information board .
The poor indication made it unclear that the surgery ended well and my parents had about 10 minutes of worrying sick before we found a doctor and clarified the situation ..

The comments to this entry are closed .
No matter what business you are in you have to stand out among the competition .
If you do n’t sell the absolutely exclusive product , you have « to fight » for the customer anyway .
While choosing the product in brick - n- mortar stores , customers can test the physical and ergonomic characteristics , colors , and eventually , the packaging .
But while choosing the product …
A package of concessions offered to the US by Iran in 2003 was very close to what the US is now asking from Tehran .
The BBC reports that Iran offered , among other things , to end support for Lebanese and Palestinian militant groups and to help stabilize Iraq following the US - led invasion .
But a former US senior official told BBC's Newsnight program that the package was rejected by Vice President Dick Cheney 's office .
One of the then Secretary of State Colin Powell 's top aides told the BBC the state department was keen on the plan – but was over - ruled .
" We thought it was a very propitious moment to do that , " Lawrence Wilkerson told Newsnight .
" But as soon as it got to the White House , and as soon as it got to the Vice - President 's office , the old mantra of ' We do n't talk to evil ' ... reasserted itself . "
The BBC reports that in exchange for the above concessions , along with making its nuclear program more transparent , Iran wanted the US to " end its hostility , to end sanctions , " as well as to disband an Iranian rebel group based in Iraq and repatriate its members .
The Washington Post reported in October of 2005 that Col. Wilkerson , who had been Mr. Powell 's right - hand man at the State Department , made some serious charges against the Bush administration .
Wilkerson , a 31 - year military veteran and former director of the Marine Corps War College , has been described as " the man who would say what Colin Powell was thinking . "
" What I saw was a cabal between the vice president of the United States , Richard Cheney , and [ the then - secretary of defense ] Donald Rumsfeld , " he said .
By cutting out the bureaucracy that had to carry out those decisions , " we have courted disaster in Iraq , in North Korea , in Iran , and generally with regard to domestic crises like Katrina . "
If there is a nuclear terrorist attack or a major pandemic , Wilkerson continued , " you are going to see the ineptitude of this government in a way that 'll take you back to the Declaration of Independence . "
In a news analysis , ABC News reports that " provocative words by President Bush and a fresh American military buildup in the Persian Gulf seem to mark a new focus on Iran that could signal another Cold War or even a deadly confrontation . "
Last week President Bush set a tough tone with Iran when he basically dismissed the Iraq Study Group 's recommendation of dialogue with Iran and Syria .
The same day the US raided an Iranian consulate in northern Iraq and arrested six Iranian diplomats who the US military said were connected to a group that funds insurgents in Iraq .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice later said that " The United States is simply responding to Iranian activities that have been going on for a while now that threaten not just to destabilize the chance for Iraq to proceed to stability but also that endanger our forces . "
But Jon Soltz , an Iraqi war vet who heads the VoteVets Action Fund , says tough measures against Iran wo n't work .
[ Soltz ] said the move could signal a forthcoming strike against Iran or be an attempt to create enough leverage to force Tehran back into talks on its nuclear ambitions .
" There 's no question it 's a chicken game with Iran , " he said .
" By us playing more war games with them , it only gives them more reasons to tie us down in Iraq . "
Meanwhile , the Associated Press reports that one of the six Iranian diplomats arrested by the US last week has been released , and Iran 's envoy to Iraq has said that the other five will be released " within days . "
The Guardian reports that a senior Iraqi official Tuesday criticized the raid and the US position on Iran , which experts are describing as another sign of a growing rift between Iraq and the US about how to deal with Iran .
Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al - Jaafari told reporters that he does not believe that Iran is a threat to Iraq .
Other politicians also criticized the US actions in Mosul .
Abdul - Aziz al - Hakim , the leader of the 130 - member Shiite bloc in parliament and one of Iraq 's most powerful politicians , [ Tuesday ] criticized the raid and condemned the detention of the Iranians as an attack on Iraq 's sovereignty .
" Regardless of the Iranian position , we consider these actions as incorrect , " Mr Hakim , leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , said in an interview with the BBC .
" They represent a kind of attack on Iraq 's sovereignty , and we hope such things are not repeated . "
AP also reports that Mohamed El - Baradei , the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency , said he was concerned that US sanctions on Iran " could escalate the standoff with Western powers over its suspected weapons program . "
Mohamed ElBaradei called for a resumption of negotiations .
Only applying pressure , he suggested , could prompt the Islamic republic to follow the path of North Korea , which kicked out U.N. inspectors , pulled out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003 and then conducted its first - ever nuclear test last October .
" My priority is to keep Iran inside the system , " said the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize winner , speaking in Paris .
" My worry right now is that each side is sticking to its guns , " he said .
" The international community is saying ' sanctions or bust . '

France is considering sending an envoy to Iran to talk about regional issues other than the nuclear issue .
Mr. El - Baradei , who was meeting with France 's foreign minister on Thursday , said , " Any effort by anybody to get the Iranians and the Europeans – and the Americans in particular – engaged would be something I welcome . "
Most of the hard core C++ programmers I know hate user interface programming .
This surprises me , because I find UI programming to be quintessentially easy , straightforward , and fun .
It ’s easy because you usually do n’t need algorithms more sophisticated than how to center one rectangle in another .
It ’s straightforward because when you make a mistake , you immediately see it and can correct it .
It ’s fun , because the results of your work are immediately visible .
You feel like you are sculpting the program directly .
I think most programmers ’ fear of UI programming comes from their fear of doing UI design .
They think that UI design is like graphics design : the mysterious process by which creative , latte - drinking , all - dressed - in - black people with interesting piercings produce cool looking artistic stuff .
Programmers see themselves as analytic , logical thinkers : strong at reasoning , weak on artistic judgment .
So they think they ca n’t do UI design .
Actually , I ’ve found UI design to be quite easy and quite rational .
It ’s not a mysterious matter that requires a degree from an art school and a penchant for neon - purple hair .
There is a rational way to think about user interfaces with some simple , logical rules that you can apply anywhere to improve the interfaces of the programs you work on .
I ’m not going to give you “ Zen and the Art of UI Design ” .
It ’s not art , it ’s not Buddhism , it ’s just a set of rules .
A way of thinking rationally and methodically .
This book is designed for programmers .
I assume you do n’t need instructions for how to make a menu bar ; rather , you need to think about what to put in your menu bar ( or whether to have one at all ) .
There is one primary axiom I ’ll teach you which guides all good UI design , and it ’s not hard to understand at all .
My first real job was in a big , industrial bakery .
The bakery was designed to have six bread production lines .
For every two production lines , there was a dough mixer , which produced 180 kg lumps of dough that could be dumped to the left or the right :
Well , this was the design .
In reality , Mixer C had n’t been built yet , nor had lines 3 or 5 .
So the arrangement was :
Alert readers will be wondering , “ how did the dough get from Mixer B to production line 6 ? ” Well , that ’s where Wee Joel came in .
My job , if you can believe this , was to stand on the left of Mixer B , then catch the giant 180 kg lumps of dough as they flew out of the mixer in a big bathtub - with - wheels , then roll the bathtub over to production line 6 , and , using a winch - like device , heave the dough onto line 6 .
I had to do this once every ten minutes , from about 10 PM until 4 AM .
There were other complications .
Line 6 could n’t really handle 180 kg of dough all at once , so I had to slice it with a giant knife into about 10 pieces .
I do n’t even want to go into how absurdly difficult that was .
The first few days , of course , I was terrible at this job .
It seemed nearly impossible .
Every bone in my body ached .
My blisters had blisters .
I had aches in places where I did n’t know I had places .
At first I just could n’t keep line 6 supplied with dough .
Every time they had an interruption in the dough , this caused a big gap on the assembly line .
When the gap rolled into the oven , the oven ( expending a constant amount of energy over a reduced amount of dough ) started to heat up more , which burnt the bread .
Sometimes , line 6 would get gummed up and stop production , but the mixer went right on ahead producing dough for me , and I would run the risk of running out of bathtubs - with - wheels to store the dough in .
When this happened , I actually had to clean and oil the floor and dump the dough on the floor to be scraped up later .
Not that this would work very well , because if the dough got older than about 30 minutes it would ferment and would n’t make good bread .
If this happened , you had to chop it up into 5 kg pieces and put one piece into the mixture for each future batch .
After a week or so , I got good enough at the routine that I actually had , if I remember correctly , 2 minutes free for every 10 minute dough - cycle to rest .
I figured out a precise schedule and learned how to tell the mixer to skip a batch when the production line stopped .
And I started to think about why , as the beer commercial asks , some days are better than others .
One day , thinking about this problem , I noticed that one of the bathtubs - with - wheels had pretty lousy wheels that would n’t turn well .
Sometimes this bathtub did not go where I pushed it , and bumped into things .
This was a small frustration .
Sometimes , as I was pulling the chain to winch up the bathtub , I scraped myself — just a little bit — on a splinter of metal on the chain .
Another small frustration .
Sometimes , as I ran with an empty bathtub to catch a dough emission about to fly out of the mixer , I slipped on a little bit of oil on the floor .
Not enough to fall , mind you , just a tiny , small frustration .
Other times , I would have tiny victories .
I learned to time the dough production perfectly so that fresh dough would arrive just seconds before the previous batch ran out .
This guaranteed the freshest dough and made the best bread .
Some of the victories were even tinier : I would spot a tiny blob of dough that had flung off of the mixer and attached itself to the wall , and I would scrape it off with a paint scraper I carried in my back pocket and throw it in the trash .
YES !
When slicing the dough into pieces , sometimes it just sliced really nicely and easily .
Tiny moments of satisfaction , when I managed to control the world around me , even in the smallest way .
So that ’s what days were like .
A bunch of tiny frustrations , and a bunch of tiny successes .
But they added up .
Even something which seems like a tiny , inconsequential frustration affects your mood .
Your emotions do n’t seem to care about the magnitude of the event , only the quality .
And I started to learn that the days when I was happiest were the days with lots of small successes and few small frustrations .
Years later , when I got to college , I learned about an important theory of psychology called Learned Helplessness , developed by Dr. Martin E. P. Seligman .
This theory , backed up by years of research , is that a great deal of depression grows out of a feeling of helplessness : the feeling that you cannot control your environment .
The more you feel that you can control your environment , and that the things you do are actually working , the happier you are .
When you find yourself frustrated , angry , and upset , it ’s probably because of something that happened that you could not control : even something small .
The space bar on your keyboard is not working well .
When you type , some of the words are stuck together .
This gets frustrating , because you are pressing the space bar and nothing is happening .
The key to your front door does n’t work very well .
When you try to turn it , it sticks .
Another tiny frustration .
These things add up ; these are the things that make us unhappy on a day - to - day basis .
Even though they seem too petty to dwell on ( I mean , there are people starving in Africa , for heaven ’s sake , I ca n’t get upset about space bars ) , nonetheless they change our moods .
Let ’s pause for a minute and go back to computers .
We ’re going to invent a typical Windows power user named Pete .
When you ’re thinking about user interfaces , it helps to keep imaginary users in mind .
The more realistic the imaginary user is , the better you ’ll do thinking about how they use your product .
Pete is an accountant for a technical publisher who has used Windows for six years at the office and a bit at home .
He is fairly competent and technical .
He installs his own software ; he reads PC Magazine , and he has even programmed some simple Word macros to help the secretaries in his office send invoices .
He ’s getting a cable modem at home .
Pete has never used a Macintosh .
“ They ’re too expensive , ” he ’ll tell you .
“ You can get a 700 Mhz PC with 128 Meg RAM for the price of … ” OK , Pete .
We get it .
One day Pete ’s friend Gena asks him for some computer help .
Now , Gena has a Macintosh iBook , because she loves the translucent boxes .
When Pete sits down and tries to use the Macintosh , he quickly gets frustrated .
“ I hate these things , ” he says .
He is , finally , able to help Gena , but he ’s grumpy and unhappy .
“ The Macintosh has such a clunky user interface . ”
Clunky ?
What ’s he talking about ?
Everybody knows that the Macintosh has an elegant user interface , right ?
The very paradigm of ease - of - use ?
Here ’s my analysis of this mystery .
On the Macintosh , when you want to move a window , you can grab any edge with the mouse and move it .
On Windows , you must grab the title bar .
If you try to grab an edge , the window will be reshaped .
When Pete was helping Gena , he tried to widen a window by dragging the right edge .
Frustratingly , the whole window moved , rather than resizing as he expected .
On Windows , when a message box pops up , you can hit enter or the space bar to dismiss the message box .
On the Mac , space does n’t work .
You usually need to click with the mouse .
When Pete got alerts , he tried to dismiss them using the space bar , like he ’s been doing subconsciously for the last six years .
The first time , nothing happened .
Without even being aware of it , Pete banged the space bar harder , since he thought that the problem must be that the Mac did not register his tapping the space bar .
Actually , it did — but it did n’t care !
Eventually he used the mouse .
Another tiny frustration .
Pete has also learned to use Alt + F4 to close windows .
On the Mac , this actually changes the volume .
At one point , Pete wanted to click on the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop , which was partially covered by another window .
So he hit Alt + F4 to close the window and immediately double - clicked where the icon would have been .
The Alt +F4 raised the volume on the computer and did n’t close the window , so his double click actually hit the Help button in the toolbar on the window which he wanted closed anyway , which immediately started bringing up a help window , so now , he ’s got two windows open which he has to close .
Another small frustration .
But , boy , does it add up .
At the end of the day , Pete is grumpy and angry .
When he tries to control things , they do n’t respond .
The space bar and the Alt + F4 key “ do n’t work ” — for all intents and purposes , it ’s as if those keys were broken .
The window disobeys him when he tries to make it wider , playing a little prank where it just moves over instead of widening .
Bad window .
Even if the whole thing is subconscious , the subtle feeling of being out of control translates into helplessness , which translates into unhappiness .
“ I like my computer , ” Pete says .
“ I have it all set up so that it works exactly the way I like it .
But these Macs are clunky and hard to use .
It ’s an exercise in frustration .
If Apple had been working on MacOS all these years instead of messing around with Newtons , their operating system would n’t be such a mess . ”
Right , Pete .
We know better .
His feelings come despite the fact that the Macintosh really is quite easy to use — for Mac users .
It ’s totally arbitrary which key you press to close a window .
The Microsoft programmers , who were , presumably , copying the Mac interface , probably thought that they were adding a cool new feature by letting you resize windows by dragging any edge .
The MacOS 8.0 programmers probably thought they were adding a cool new feature when they let you move windows by dragging any edge .
Most flame wars you read about user interface issues focus on the wrong thing .
Windows is better because it gives you more ways to resize the window .
So what ?
That ’s missing the point .
The point is , does the UI respond to the user in the way in which the user expected it to respond ?
If it did n’t , the user is going to feel helpless and out of control , the same way I felt when the wheels of the dough bathtub did n’t turn the way I pushed them , and I bumped into a wall .
Bonk .
UI is important because it affects the feelings , the emotions , and the mood of your users .
If the UI is wrong and the user feels like they can’t control your software , they literally wo n’t be happy and they ’ll blame it on your software .
If the UI is smart and things work the way the user expected them to work , they will be cheerful as they manage to accomplish small goals .
Hey !
I ripped a CD !
It just worked !
Nice software !
Wooooooooooo !
To make people happy , you have to let them feel like they are in control of their environment .
To do this , you need to correctly interpret their actions .
The interface needs to behave in the way they are expecting it to behave .
Thus , the cardinal axiom of all user interface design :
A user interface is well - designed when the program behaves exactly how the user thought it would .
As Hillel said , everything else is commentary .
All the other rules of good UI design are just corollaries .

“ Good things come to those who wait ”
This old proverb was one that I heard a lot of growing up – it was a favorite saying around our house and one that I think has had a fairly significant impact upon me in numerous aspects of my life – not the least of which is my photography .
While digital photography is sometimes known for it ’s spontaneity I ’ve found that most successful photographers also have the ability to sit with a scene or subject for a considerable amount of time until the situation is right to get things just as they should be to get the picture perfect .
Patience comes into play in many forms of photography :
Landscape – there are many aspects of landscape photography that takes patience ranging from scoping out the perfect place to shoot from to waiting to get the light just right before shooting .

Sports – last year when I was at the Australian Open ( tennis ) I went along expecting that the skill I would need the most was to be spontaneous as a photographer but I came away realizing that the only reason I came away with any decent shots was that I ’d really persisted and taken my time in thinking through my shots .
It was only because I continued to shoot over a longer period of time that I honed my framing and exposure to get things just right .

Portraits – studio portraits can be a little more predictable than candid portrait shots but in both cases people are unpredictable beings and getting a pose just right or capturing an interaction between two subjects can take considerable time to get right .

Wildlife – taking photos of animals is even more unpredictable than photographing people and as a result there can be long waits to both find them in the wild but also to get capture them in a the right position , light and framing .

Macro – similarly taking macro shots is generally not an overly spontaneous thing to do , especially when your subject is a moving one ( insects for example ) and when you ’re shooting in a natural environment when the light changes and wind blows .
The list could go on….
I find that the actual moment that you take an image is often a very spontaneous one but that to get to those moments you often need real patience .
Of course patience is not something you can really teach in an article like this – except to say that it ’s a skill to work on and that great photographers generally set aside time to hone their craft .
Geek activism has not taken off yet , but it should .
With the gamers recognizing the need for a louder voice , EFF gaining momentum and Linux taking on the mainstream on the one hand and recent severe losses in privacy , freedom of speech and intellectual property rights on the other , now seems to be the best time to rally around the cause .
Geeks are not known to be political or highly vocal ( outside of our own circles ) - this must change if we want things to improve .
So here is my list of things people of all shapes , sizes and sides of the debate need to know .
Some of these are obvious , others may not be meant for you .
But hopefully , some of these will inspire you to do the right thing and others will help you frame the next discussion , debate or argument you have on these topics .

UPDATE # 2 : And now digg - pwnd too ( just discovered that word ) .
The site is dying under the weight of a thousand blog links , but we shall overcome .
Some day .
Expect a follow - up on the numerous comments below ( thanks ! ) , the numerous comments on Digg and the many dozen blogs around the Internet who have commented on this story .
So far I have been told that I have inspired people to start blogs , to revive their blogs , to donate to the EFF , to write open letters and much more .
This is all fantastic news , but it can not stop here .
It will not - stick around and we will make things happen .
UPDATE # 3 : This story was later picked up by Wired Magazine for the December ’ 06 issue ( the one with lonelygirl 15 on the cover ) .
It also made its way in to many online editions of offline publications as well .
I am about to start ( July ’ 07 ) a series expanding on many of the thoughts from this original article and clarifying / amending things that have been questioned since .
( updated below )
As President Bush marched the country to war with Iraq , even some voices on the Right warned that this was a fool 's errand .
I dismissed them angrily .
I thought them unpatriotic .
But almost four years later , I see that I was the fool .
In Iraq , this Republican President for whom I voted twice has shamed our country with weakness and incompetence , and the consequences of his failure will be far , far worse than anything Carter did .
The fraud , the mendacity , the utter haplessness of our government 's conduct of the Iraq war have been shattering to me .
It was n't supposed to turn out like this .
Not under a Republican President .
I turn 40 next month -- middle aged at last -- a time of discovering limits , finitude .
I expected that .
But what I did not expect was to see the limits of finitude of American power revealed so painfully .
I did not expect Vietnam .
As I sat in my office last night watching President Bush deliver his big speech , I seethed over the waste , the folly , the stupidity of this war .
I had a heretical thought for a conservative - that I have got to teach my kids that they must never , ever take Presidents and Generals at their word - that their government will send them to kill and die for noble - sounding rot - that they have to question authority .
On the walk to the parking garage , it hit me .
Had n't the hippies tried to tell my generation that ?
Why had we scorned them so blithely ?
Will my children , too small now to understand Iraq , take me seriously when I tell them one day what powerful men , whom their father once believed in , did to this country ?
Heavy thoughts for someone who is still a conservative despite it all .
It was a long drive home .
UPDATE
Rod Dreher is as conservative as it gets -- a contributor to National Review and the Corner , a current columnist for , a self - described " practicing Christian and political conservative .
" Today , Dreher has an extraordinary ( oral ) essay at NPR in which he recounts how the conduct of President Bush ( for whom he voted twice ) in the Iraq War ( which he supported ) is causing him to question , really to abandon , the core political beliefs he has held since childhood .
Dreher , 40 , recounts that his " first real political memory " was the 1979 failed rescue effort of the U.S. hostages in Iran .
He says he " hated " Jimmy Carter for " shaming America before our enemies with weakness and incompetence . "
When Reagan was elected , he believed " America was saved . "
Reagan was " strong and confident . "
Democrats were " weak and depressed .
" In particular , Dreher recounts how much , during the 1980s , he " disliked hippies - the blame America first liberals who were so hung up on Vietnam , who surrendered to Communists back then just like they want to do now . "
In short , Republicans were " winners . "
Democrats were " defeatists .
"
On 9/11 , Dreher 's first thought was : " Thank God we have a Republican in the White House . "
The rest of his essay : Dreher 's essay is extreme and intense but also increasingly commonplace and illustrative .
The disaster of unparalleled magnitude that President Bush and his integrity - free and bloodthirsty administration and followers wrought on this country will have a profound impact not only on American strength and credibility for a long , long time to come , but also on the views of Americans towards their political leaders and , almost certainly , towards the Republican Party .
One of the very few potential benefits of the Iraq tragedy is that it may raise the level of doubt and cynicism with which Americans evaluate the claims of the Government when it tries -- as Dreher put it -- " to send them to kill and die for noble - sounding rot . " ( h/t to a distraught , disoriented Jonah Goldberg , struggling lamely to dismiss and belittle the insights of his fellow Cornerite ) : Barbara O'Brien has some interesting observations about Dreher 's confessional , as well as some thoughts about the process by which Dreher was molded by his childhood perceptions into a modern - day " conservative .

vim7 から追加された text - object は大変便利で、今や手放せなくなっています。その text - object をより便利に使えるプラグイン、surround.vim が便利すぎるので紹介します。
いままで、text - object では ( 以下では、コードの『*』の位置に現在カーソルがあると考えてください。)
foo ' b * ar ' baz
の位置にカーソルがあるとき、i' でシングルクオーテーションの中身を選択できたり、a' でシングルクオート含む部分を選択できました。しかし『'』そのものを削除したり、置換したりはできなく、ちょっと不便でした。しかし、surround.vim では
ds
cs
ys
vs
それぞれにコマンドを割り当てて、様々なことができるようになってます。たとえば
foo ' b * ar ' baz
で『'』を削除したければ、ds ' でできます。『 '』を 『" 』に置換したければ、cs ' " で、『 '』を ( ) に置換したければ cs ' ) でできます。ruby 使ってると文字列リテラルを『'』を『 "
』に変える必要が結構出てくるんですが、この機能のおかげで簡単にできるようになりました。
ys を使うと、様々な位置から『'』や『( ) 』などで囲むことができます。
a = Array.new * foo , bar
上記カーソル位置の時に、ys $ ) ( 『 $ ) 』で行末まで( ) で囲えと命令 ) すると、
a = Array.new *( foo , bar )
となって、後からでも『() 』や『'』ですぐ囲うことができてかなり便利です。yss
を使った場合、行全体がターゲットになるため、
foo b*ar baz
で yss ' を押す と
' foo bar baz '
と行が『 '』で囲われます 。
また Visual Mode 時の選択範囲の外側を囲うことができるため、
my $ foo = $ self -> method ; $ foo - > bar ;
を選択して S{ で( 大文字の S だとインデントも有効 )
{ my $ foo = $ self -> method ; $ foo - > bar ; }
となります 。
XML タグの追加、削除 text - object には t でタグの選択機能がありますが、やはりこれもタグの内側のみ選択、などの機能でした。
しかし、surround.vim を使うと現在囲っているタグの削除ができます。 < div ><p class= " comment " >< strong > f*oo</ strong > bar</p></div>
の時に、dst を押すと < div >< p class= " comment " >* foo bar</p></div>
となります。ここでもう一度 dst を押すと < div>* foo bar</div > となります。もちろん外側のタグの置換もできて、ここで cst<p> と押すと < p >* foo bar </p> となります。またタグの追加簡単で、v で foo を範囲選択して、st < strong > で < p>*< strong>foo</strong > bar </p> になりますし、ys を利用して、ysst< div class= " foo " > と押すと < div class= " foo " >< p>< strong > foo</ strong > bar</p></div>
と割と自在にタグで囲むことができるようになります。
insert - mode で使う insert - mode でも <C - G> S を押すと surround.vim を使うことができるため、たとえば
<C - G>S<html ><C - G>S< head > と入力すれば < html > < head >
* </head > </html > ときちんと閉じタグが自動で入力され、されてさくさく書き始めることができます。
rhtml や php のタグの入力 surround .vim を拡張することで、簡単に rhtml でよく使うタグや php タグの入力ができるようになります。rails.vim を入れると勝手に rhtml 編集時に拡張してくれて、たとえば link_to '/' , *' top ' な時に yss= で < %= link_to '/' , ' top ' %> になったり、insert-mode で Se で <% * -%> <% end -%>
と非常によく使うひな形をすぐ入力できたりして便利です。php のタグの場合、~/.vimrc に autocmd FileType php let b:surround_45 = " <? php \r ? > " とか書いておくと、php の編集時に、たとえば foo echo $ bar baz の echo $ bar を範囲選択して s- で foo <? php echo $ bar ; ? > baz とすることができます 。
surround.vim を拡張する ( gettext篇 ) それでは、自分がよく使う入力を、surround.vim
に登録してみましょう。上の rhtml や php の入力も拡張して行ってます 。
surround.vim を拡張するには、グローバル変数 g:surround_アスキーコード にテンプレートを書き込めばOKです。vim
でアスキーコードを調べるには、調べたい文字の上にカーソルをあわせて :ascii と押すと調べられます。
最近 gettext を使う機会が増えてきて、 ' foo ' を _ ( ' foo ' ) に、 " foo " を _ ( " foo " ) に変更したいことがよくあるので、早速そのような動作をするように拡張してみましょう。
~/.vimrc に let g:surround_103 = " _( '\r ' ) " " 103 = g let g:surround_71 = " _( \" \r\ " ) " " 71 = G これだけで完了です。これで、 foo ' b * ar ' baz が cs'g で foo *_ ( ' bar ' ) baz などと簡単に gettext な syntax に置き換えることができます。それでもどばーと gettext に置換したいときは面倒なので利用してない g " , g ' * 1 を nmap で定義しちゃいます。 nmap g' cs'g nmap g " cs " G これで、g ' や g " で簡単に文字列リテラルを gettext な形式に置き換えることが可能になりました 。
What do you do when you have regular traffic spike ?
Say , for once a month , traffic increases 3 fold for 12 hours after your company sent out the monthly news letter ?
Your current web server barely copes with regular load .
Do you go out to buy 2 more dedicated servers just for that 12 hours in a month ?
That would n’t be too economical paying 2 extra servers sitting there idling most of the time , would n’t it ?
Judd Vinet of ArchLinux ( one of my favourite , btw ) has recently written an article to solve this very issue , Web clustering with Amazon EC2 , where extra servers are hired from Amazon EC2 on part - time basis to serve surge in traffic .
A semi-automated system has been built to make the task of “ summoning new servers ” much easier , and has been discussed in the article .
It ’s quite a detailed write up with a lot of good information .
Basically it is what Judd is trying to achieve .
2 existing web server cluster using LVS .
Use Pound for web balancer .
Start EC2 instances , and upon start up each instance will phone home to register itself .
Master server ( where Pound is ) will add new EC2 instances , and grant database permission to allow connection from EC2 .
Seems to be quite a solid approach to scale up your web site instantly .
Fire up a few EC2 instances before expected traffic surge , and shot them down after the storm — you are only paying for the time and bandwidth you have used !
At the end of the article Judd mentioned that a fully - automated system will be their next step , so they do n’t need to manually activate / deactivate EC2 instances — they should just start / stop whenever the traffic builds up / slows down .
Nice for unexpected traffic like Slashdotting or Digging .
Who said the dedicated server vendors should n’t be worried ?
However , a few problems are also encountered during this exercise — web traffic load balancing and database access .
Pound has been used in the example but I think other “ web fronts ” like Nginx should have no problem either .
I have never used Pound but from the example given , a 2 second delay is needed to cleanly stop the old process before new one can be started .
I guess it would be unnecessary if Nginx or Lighttpd is used , where you can gracefully reload the server without causing any delay .
However the biggest problem I have with the proxy approach is — which is actually an issue with EC2 itself — that you are effectively paying double the data transfer .
You are paying Amazon for data transfer coming in or going out from EC2 at $ 0.20 / Gb .
At the same time you are paying whoever is hosting your reverse - proxy servers for traffic going out to your customers .
Problem would n’t exist if you can run your reverse proxy right inside EC2 , as traffic between EC2 instances are free .
Except it is not trivial .
Not until persistency and static IP are implemented anyway .
Database access over public Internet is also not something trivial to get it right .
For a busy website , even 20 ms latency between the web server and DB server can cause quite a noticeable degrading in performance .
A locally replicated DB will definitely be much better .
But somehow “ part - time ” “ on - demand ” “ MySQL replication ” all sounds oxymoron to me .
Conclusion ?
I guess that ’s why EC2 is still in beta , and is still pretty much “ developers only ” .
But no doubt it is full of potential .

PS5 and Xbox Series X : Why you should n't go next - gen until 2021
Commentary : November will be exciting for gamers , but that does n't mean you should drop hundreds on a new console just yet .
Three groups , the Consumer Federation of America , Consumers Union ( responsible for Consumer Reports magazine ) , and media policy group Free Press , have released a joint report ( PDF ) called " Broadband Reality Check II . "
A follow up to a similar report issued last , the year , the picture it paints of the broadband landscape in the United States is not a flattering one .
Divided into sections covering broadband penetration , speed and price , market structure , new technologies , the digital divide , FCC metrics , and policy recommendations , the report touches on just about every aspect of the US broadband market , mostly in a very critical fashion .
Looking at the statistics contained in the report , we discover that the US is 16th in the world in terms of broadband penetration and 15th in rate of growth .
As of December 2005 , the US had approximately 16 broadband subscribers for every 100 inhabitants .
In contrast , Iceland had almost 27 , while South Korea , the Netherlands , and Denmark were right around 25 per 100 .
US residents lag in speed as well , but pay more for their slower connections .
In Japan , symmetrical 100 M bps connections are available for less than $ 35 per month , while residents of South Korea can get similarly speedy fiber optic connections for around $ 32 .
Those speeds are unheard of for consumer broadband in the US , and prices for much slower hookups are significantly higher Comcast charges $ 69 for 10 M bps / 768 Kbps service where I live , by way of example .
The litany of bad news about US broadband goes on , with the report highlighting the lack of competition in the US market .
" Consumers across the nation have relatively little choice in broadband services .
The top two cable companies and the top two DSL companies together controlled over half of the entire U.S. broadband market , " according to the report .
The conclusion ?
" The U.S. broadband market is essentially a series of regional duopolies .
The largest non-incumbent provider is Sprint , accounting for less than 2 percent of the entire market . "
Is the situation as dire as the report claims ?
While some US consumers are seeing the benefit of high - speed fiber deployments in limited areas served by Verizon and AT&T , most folks are faced with just one or two relatively slow and expensive ( compared to other developed nations ) choices .
At least there 's hope on the horizon from the likes of WiMAX , BPL ( broadband over power lines ) , satellite , and other upcoming technologies , right ?
Not really .
Market share for technologies other than DSL and cable have actually declined in recent years , although that may change in years to come as WiMAX becomes more commonplace .
Even then , breaking into the duopolies present in most markets will be difficult in the years ahead , especially with 15 states having laws on the books that bar municipalities from creating broadband networks of their own .
There are a handful of policy recommendations in the report that are worth taking a look at .
One of the most logical is to allow local governments to get into the broadband business .
That would require repealing the state laws current barring such activities or the passage of federal legislation and the most recent massive telecommunications bill that appears to be dead in the water would have done just that .
Actions such as the FCC 's recent decision to open up some analog TV spectrum to unlicensed devices are another step in the right direction .
Lurking in the background of the topic are the steps taken by the US government to deregulate broadband over the past several years .
Those steps include classifying cable Internet as an information service , which means cable ISPs do n't have to lease their lines , and telling DSL providers they do n't need to share either .
If the FCC had decided to mandate line sharing , not only for cable and DSL , but for new fiber deployments , consumers would arguably have a lot more choice in broadband providers , and the more competitive market would likely result in better service and faster connections .
Instead , Americans are stuck with high prices , limited choice , and lower speeds .

その中で，アシストは 「使用料を払う必要のない」（代表取締役社長 ビル・トッテン氏）OpenOffice.orgへの移行を行う方針を決める。「利益を独占するための知的所有権の行使には以前から私は反対だった。そして世の中が大きく変化し，従来一つの企業または個人が独占的に所有してきた知的財産そのものが公開され，共有化されることによりその価値が薄れていく。ソフトウェアの世界においてもそれがオープンソースという形態で将来起きうる」（トッテン氏）とする，同氏の決断だった。
OpenOffice.orgへの移行は，2段階で実施した。第一段階は2006年10月，テスト的に東京の営業部門に導入した。
ここで判明したのが，3つの課題だった。
第一段階の導入で浮かんだ3つの課題
ひとつは，社外とのデータ交換の問題。レイアウトの崩れなどの発生である。
２つめは，既存業務との連携。アシストでは販売管理や顧客管理システムでMicrosoft
Accessをクライアントとし，ダウンロードしたデータをAccessからExcelを呼び出しオープンしていた。
３つめは，マクロである。アシストでは経理業務などでExcelマクロを利用していたがOpenOffice.orgではそのまま動作しない。
Last Windows 3.1 Computer Located
Posted by Michael on 8 May 2005 , 07:59 GMT
Several days ago , members of the ticalc.org staff were perusing through the web server statistics as is frequently done .
That 's when we noticed the line in the Operating System Report : " Windows 3.1 " .
At first glance , this seemed incredulous ; no one uses Windows 3.1 anymore .
Further research into the actual server logs revealed that indeed , in the past seven days a combination of Internet Explorer 5.0 and Windows 3.1 has requested 90 files from ticalc.org .
Magnus Hagander immediately set out on the long and perilous quest to locate this machine .
Saturday morning , Magnus interviewed no less than one hundred and thirty - seven system administrators of various companies , based upon the IP address found in our logs .
As of right now , eighty - five of them have been admitted to the hospital for coronary - related ailments .
Through the global - spanning resources of the Swedish Mafia , the computer was traced to an " A. Nakranistik " , a German hermit .
Mr. Nakranistik refused to answer any of the mafia 's questions or to explain why he had visited ticalc.org .
By means of a time - tested social ritual involving patellas and kinetic energy , he then changed his mind and consented to the photograph which you can find at the top of this article .
From the timestamp on ticalc.org in the photo and the reddish tint of artificial lighting , it is apparent that Adolf Nakranistik is a distressed individual who checks ticalc.org at ungodly hours of the night .
Also note the Paint Shop Pro icon in the corner of the screen .
Mr. Nakranistik is believed to have used Paint Shop Pro to create his illicit photo collection - graphing calculators posing without wearing slide cases .
He has since been taken to an undisclosed location for corrective therapy involving the forced consumption of surstr�mming and lutfisk .
As for the rest of the world , it can breathe easy as the Swedish Mafia has since turned the laptop over to Magnus .
When asked what he planned to do with it , Magnus replied that he had already formatted the hard drive and installed the latest version of Slackware .
Jonathan Katz also had comments about the situation : " Why did n't he just upgrade to Windows XP ?
It would have been far more sane and he would have spared all of this trouble . "
Joey Gannon , always the voice of diametrical viewpoints , said , " This would n't have happened if he was an MSDN Universal subscriber !
I just bought my fifth copy of Windows Server 2003 the other day .
He should have been continuously upgrading with every Microsoft release . "
Meanwhile , the usually effervescent Nick D merely screamed , " He should have used OS / 2 ! OS / 2 Warp I tell you ! "
In any case , this historic rediscovery of a 16 - bit operating system is now behind us and ticalc.org looks forward to many years of 32 - bit and 64 - bit serving to come .

It might not sound like much , but built - in associative arrays and dynamic arrays .
I have never found a more powerful combination of containers .
I can do so much with just these two types .

Andrei I 'd have to say the # 1 thing that makes D great is the combination native code speed with the ease of development offered by built - in garbage collection .
After that come niceties like nested functions and class delegates .
And if you 're into templates then D's templates are very nice and enable a lot of nifty things that are difficult to do in C++ -- ( static if ! variadic templates & tuples ! ) .
The lack of need for header files is another plus .
It gets very tiring having to type every function signature twice in C ++.
There are lots of other little minor things that make D nicer to use than C/C++ and other alternatives ( I put built - in arrays in this category ) , but to me those are n't the biggies .
The ability to call C code without a lot of messy JNI - like boilerplate code is also a big deal .
I wholeheartedly agree with Waldemar , though , that the things that are going to sway C/C++ folks are different from what 's going to sway Java / C# folks .
D's library and development tools are still rather anemic , so most likely that would send most Java / C# folks running .
On the other hand , if they find they need to deliver an app that works stand - alone , independent of a 100 MB runtime environment , or one which runs at native speed , then D is probably the closest thing they 're going to find to their beloved Java / C# that can do the job .

Being a long time Java programmer , I strongly disagree with you and Waldemar both .
Speed is only an issue for people who do n't use Java , or for those who do n't really know how to properly write software with it .
Most Java programmers
I know , myself included , call the " Java is slow " mantra a myth .
Java *used to * be slow , true .
Today , it 's possible to code a clunky app in Java if you do n't know what you are doing .
But the reality is that it 's plenty fast in the general case .
Plus , Java programmers swear by runtime compilation .
And each release of Sun's Hotspot compiler , coupled with bug fixes and enhancements in the standard APIs , ups performance .
So if you want to woo them , focusing on speed is not the way to do it .
That would be more likely to turn them off , if not make them outright perturbed ( oh , here we go again , another " Java is slow " moron ) .

I have n't worked with Java for over 10 years now .
But in March I attended " Java Performance Myths " by Brian Goetz , who is very knowledgeable about getting the most out of Java .
He indicated that Java needed another 10 years before it would be able to consistently match C toe to toe .
And this is happening despite years of massive investment in Java by lot of very smart people , just to approach what relatively simple C compilers can do .
This to me indicates there 's a fundamental problem with Java .
I think the problem is that Java is just lacking in some needed features - like a full set of basic types , simple aggregates , out parameters , etc .
The alternatives are computationally expensive , and so the optimizer has a lot of work to do to reverse engineer them and figure out that all the programmer was doing was a workaround for a POD stack aggregate .
Java also has a few millstones that make things difficult for optimizers - the required array bounds checking , the VM , etc. C++ , much promoted for its efficiency , has a subtle problem with efficiency .
We all know that the biggest gains in efficiency come from algorithmic improvements .
But C++'s strength is in optimizing not the algorithms , but the micro-optimization details of implementing them .
C++ code tends to get so complex that once we get it to work , we dare not go tinkering with the overall algorithm , but just concentrate on twiddling with the micro-optimizations .
I discovered this when working on DMDScript .
I had spent a great deal of time tinkering with the details of the C++ version trying to make it go faster .
Then I translated it to D , and found myself instead of tinkering with the low level details , I was tinkering with the algorithms .
With a few changes there , that would have been hard to retrofit into the C++ code , I had it running faster than the C++ one .
And that may be D's efficiency trump card over C++ - it 's much easier to modify existing , working code in ways that are too risky to do with C ++.

This to me indicates there 's a fundamental problem with Java .
I 've never heard Brian Goetz speak , but he 's a prolific writer .
One of his articles , Urban Performance Legends ( http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp04223.html ) , is one I often direct people to in Java performance discussions .
But the question one must ask when evaluating any language is , what is this language suitable for ?
When you look at everything Java gives you , the trade - off of not matching performance of C is acceptable for a wide range of applications , but not everything under the sun ( no pun intended ) .
Books like Code Complete and Writing Secure Code exist because languages like C and C++ have no built - in mechanisms to prevent severe errors like buffer overruns .
How many times does this happen in server applications or even non-networking libraries ?
libpng had a patch recently , last year I believe , to fix a buffer overrun .
That just should n't be happening itn modern software .
Java 's answer to those issues is certainly extreme , but a lot of people find that beneficial -- particularly for network software .
I 've written a lot of C code and a lot of Java code .
It 's much more pleasant to write Java because I can write a lot less of it .
I do n't mind a bit that it 's not going to beat C in the performance arena because I do n't need it to for what I use it for .
One of the things I like about D is that it incorporates some of the same mechanisms , but in a more flexible way ( i.e. array bounds checking can be turned off ) .
One of the things I miss about Java when I use D is the ability to instantiate any class by name .
I 've made heavy use of that for some component - based designs in Java .
Designing D applications requires me to think differently , much as Java required a new way of thinking when coming from C. I think the problem is that Java is just lacking in some needed features - like a full set of basic types , simple aggregates , out parameters , etc .
The alternatives are computationally expensive , and so the optimizer has a lot of work to do to reverse engineer them and figure out that all the programmer was doing was a workaround for a POD stack aggregate .
Java also has a few millstones that make things difficult for optimizers - the required array bounds checking , the VM , etc .
I have no background at all in language design , or optimizers , but I 'm guessing it 's more than just a language feature issue .
Most of Java 's critical optimizations happen at runtime during the runtime analysis and compilation phases .
Runtime compilation is still a comparatively young technology in practice .
There are still a lot of kinks to be worked out in the process , a lot of progress to be made .
I assume when Goetz said Java 's performance would match C in 10 years , he was specifically referring to the Hotspot VM , or runtime compilation in general .
There are two VMs that ship with the SDK , referred to as the client and server VMs .
The client VM has a shorter runtime analysis period than the server VM , so the server VM can make more aggressive optimizations after longer periods of analysis .
I 've read that it can eliminate array bounds checks in certain cases .
Whatever it does , Java 's runtime optimizations are built around the language 's features .
For example , in the latest 1.6 release they just laid the groundwork for escape analysis , which will eliminate some object allocations on the heap and move them to the stack .
The full implementation should be available in 1.7 .
I 've even heard rumors that a JSR for a struct type will make it into a future release , which could open the door for more optimizations and , possibly , features like out parameters .
C++ , much promoted for its efficiency , has a subtle problem with efficiency .
We all know that the biggest gains in efficiency come from algorithmic improvements .
But C++'s strength is in optimizing not the algorithms , but the micro-optimization details of implementing them .
C++ code tends to get so complex that once we get it to work , we dare not go tinkering with the overall algorithm , but just concentrate on twiddling with the micro-optimizations .

And that may be D's efficiency trump card over C++ - it 's much easier to modify existing , working code in ways that are too risky to do with C++.
But that 's a completely different world .
When trying to win over C++ programmers , words like efficiency , optimization , and performance carry a great deal of weight .
Speed is king .
Not so in the Java community .
It 's a different mindset with different goals .
If Java programmers were overly concerned about performance , they would n't be using Java .
Sure , they want their software to be performant and a good Java programmer knows how to squeeze every ounce of performance out of his code , but performance alone is n't going to sway them .
I think that overall D is going to be an easier sell to C++ programmers than to Java types .
They are two very different markets that will require very different strategies .

D has no chance against java / C# . Unless , and I am aware of the diminishing freqency of these cases , performance forces the use of another language .
D would be a candidate for that other language .
It is the only situation where pitching D to java / C# people is not a waste of time .
D is a low level language competing with C/C++/ ASM .
It has a chance but I do n't know how long the window of opportunity will last .

Also in cases needing ASM access or where use of a VM is not an option .
The first case wo n't go away and the second could come into play when , for an example , it takes longer to load the VM than it does to run the app , or when size is a BIG issue .
I 'll admit that D does n't yet excel in either of these last two cases , but it will ( I hope ) , I do n't think Java / C# ever will .

I 'm not Walter , but I can answer most of these :
What basic types are missing ?
The unsigned ones , Does a " simple aggregate " refer to structs / tuples ?
Structs , probably .
What does POD stand for , Plain Old Data , e.g. ints , chars , floats , C - style structs ( that contain only POD members ) .
Classes are n't POD types ( in D and Java ) because they have virtual functions which requires a vtable , disqualifying them .
and what is a POD stack aggregate ?
A POD aggregate stored on the stack if possible , i.e. a C or D struct ( with only POD members ) .
Could you show a code example in D that performs badly in Java ?
Pardon my ignorance .
Sorry , can't help there .
I have n't used Java in a couple of years ...

POD = Plain Old Data .
In D , a struct is a POD stack aggregate .
And I 'm not sure what Walter meant about basic types , but I 've been occasionally annoyed at the lack of unsigned primitives in Java .
The out parameter issue ( or a lack of tuples ) is another one .
It 's really not uncommon to want to return / alter two values in a function call , particularly in the case of recursion .
That said , it 's obviously possible to re-engineer a design to account for this , but the elegant approach often seems to sacrifice some degree of efficiency .

In the past it 's been mentioned that DMD ( and DMC by extension , I assume ) produces somewhat sub - optimal code for floating - point ops , and there may be one or two other scenarios as well .
So any test that uses these features heavily may present a somewhat skewed display of language performance .

What do you compare , and why do you compare it ?

That makes it sound like DMC is 1.5 slower than your average C. Your average C? No .
It might be 1.5 slower than the specific C compiler the benchmarker used for that specific application .
Performance for particular applications varies all over the map for different C compilers .
That may be but this specific C compiler is most likely gcc on Linux or VS C++ on Windows .
The D compiler is probably dmd .
If he 's using gcc , he should do benchmark comparisons with gdc .
It 's a bit shocking to see a 50 % difference .
Is there information which compilers were used ?
And is there any reason to believe the specifics of the benchmark could produce such a wide difference ?
There 's every reason to believe it .
Often , people who write benchmarks never check to see exactly what they are actually benchmarking .
I 've seen all of the following : 1 ) using the wrong compiler switches 2 ) assuming one is testing string handling speed , when actually the benchmark was extremely sensitive to how the compiler handled the / operation on integers 3 ) assuming one is benchmarking some calculation speed , when one is actually benchmarking some innocuous looking C library function call 4 ) etc. etc .
In other words , you do n't know what you 're benchmarking until you run a profiler on it .
And nobody runs profilers < g > .
The old adage that 90 % of your code execution time is in 10 % of the code applies to benchmarks , too .
Unless you actually dig in and measure it , sure as heck that 10 % will not be where you think it is .

But the reality is that it 's plenty fast in the general case .
Plus , Java Actually , the reality is Java is plenty slow in many applications .
There is JNI for a reason .

But you can feel it 's just one more step , so watch out .
programmers swear by runtime compilation .
And each release of Sun's Hotspot compiler , coupled with bug fixes and enhancements in the standard APIs , ups performance .
So if you want to woo them , focusing on speed is not the way to do it .
That would be more likely to turn them off , if not make them outright perturbed ( oh , here we go again , another " Java is slow " moron ) .

If a Java program has to do the same work as " the same " program in C++ , and _additionally_ run a VM , do JIT compiling -- I can't see how it 's even theoretically possible to " reach C/C++ speed " .

writes Mike Parker Waldemar wrote : Actually , the reality is Java is plenty slow in many applications .
I do n't know about that .
I have seen some nasty , klunky Java programs , but my experience is that they are the exception rather than the rule .
Netbeans and Eclipse both started out as klunkers , but neither is today .
There is JNI for a reason .
JNI was developed for compatibility with legacy code .
It was used in the early days as a performance optimization tool , but these days not so much .
Even for Java games , JNI is used only to access native APIs like OpenGL , OpenAL , or DirectInput .
The old Dirty Java article at Gamasutra lost its relevance with the release of Java 1.4 .

As soon as Java reaches C/C++ speed , C++ will disappear .

I do n't expect people to write device drivers or any other performance critical code in Java :)
That 's not what Java is intended for .
It * is* quite prevalent in embedded systems -- your cell phone is most likely equipped with JME , and you may even have some form of Java in your DVD player .
The PS3 is equipped with a limited version of Java .
Java is n't a bare - metal systems language , but it is n't * slow * .
The reality is somewhere in the middle .
It 's slower than C++ in most cases , yes .
But there are plenty of applications that can be written in Java where a 5 % , 10 % or even 20 % performance difference is n't going to matter .
With my interest in games , I love to point out Java games like Tribal Trouble , Puzzle Pirates , and Bang !
Howdy , all of which are 3D games , or the shooters developed by Puppy Games which are 2D on OpenGL .
Since the JVM is bundled with each of them , most people do n't know or do n't care that they are written in Java .
Performance is just fine in each of them .
The preceding paragraph is the typical response you are going to get from a Java programmer when you say Java is slow .
There 's a lot going on behind the scenes in the JVM , as Walter mentioned , and Java programmers understand that .
There 's a trade - off between safety / security and speed .
They accept that .
Do you think anyone at all would choose Java if it truly was a snail at everything ?
They like the ease of writing concurrent applications in Java compared to other languages .
They like Java 's inherent networking capabilities .
They like the advanced development tools available for the language , such as the free profilers , full - featured IDEs , and the ability to choose between and fine - tune for several different GC implementations to get the best performance possible .
Some hardcore Java programmers might be willing to write a video or audio codec in Java , but most are more grounded and understand that Java is n't suited for that .
So my point is that Java programmers use Java for a reason .
Ask any of them and they will surely point out faults they find in the language ( Generics being a popular one ) .
But very few who choose to use Java will cite performance as a negative for * their purposes * .
So to entice a Java programmer to come to D , the speed argument just is n't going to fly .
To court Java programmers , you have to convince them that D's features are shinier than Java's .
You have to show them an advanced tool chain that lets them monitor every aspect of an application 's performance .
They want to be able to dynamically instantiate objects via a class name string .
They want easy use of web services , support for web applications , and not to worry about porting issues across different platforms .
No matter your opinion of Java , or Walter 's , people who use it on a regular basis see it in an entirely different light .

Agreed .
Programmers who are really serious about performance over other considerations will likely not be using Java , so this is n't a convincing argument here .
My personal problem with Java is that I hate the syntax .
Although it 's fairly similar to C++ and even D , I find the nuances that are different to make it tremendously unwieldy .
And the deal - breaker is that Generics are complete garbage -- I simply refuse to go without a decent way to express algorithms in a generic manner after having used C++ for so long .

If I were to use Java , these would be the reasons .
And I think D has a long way to go here .
There is some library work that seems quite promising re : dynamic libraries ( DDL ) , and Mango is fairly capable for server / web programming , but D is extremely weak in the toolchain department .
Windbg may work with D in Win32 , but it 's complete crap .
I have yet to use it without my debug session ending because windbg crashed .
The situation is so bad that I 've considered developing exclusively on Linux in hopes that GDB support is better .
But fortunately , the times I want to use a debugger are so few and far between that this remains an idle fantasy .
And as for performance , DMD has profiling and code coverage tools built - in , which is a huge bonus in that regard .

Last year , I developed a pretty sophisticated machine learning algorithm for my company .
The training phase of the algorithm needs to read 5 or 6 gigabytes of data , create incremental indices of commonly occurring features in many different categories , conduct a statistical analysis of all categorical feature histograms , and then plot each of the indices in n-dimensional vector space to create agglomerative category clusters .
There 's lots of I/O , and plenty of math involved .
I wrote the code in Java .
Thanks to the language 's consistent , orthogonal semantics , the code is very easy to read and understand .
With only a little profiling and a few tiny optimization tweaks , I was very satisfied with performance .
Then , because this algorithm needed to be deployed to heterogeneous environments , a colleague of mine ported my code to C ++.
He did a straight transliteration of the code , preserving the same semantics from the Java to C ++.
When we timed both implementations , we discovered that mine was 40 percent faster .
Several of the C++ developers on my team were completely incredulous , and they made it their personal quest to optimize the C++ version so that it was the performance winner .
They eventually caught up to , and surpassed , the performance of the Java code .
But only after introducing a bunch of ugly optimizations , making the code much more difficult to follow .
Of course , the types of optimizations that they performed are unavailable in Java .
The moral of the story is that the JVM is fast .
Very fast .
And straightforward implementations of algorithms are often faster in Java than in C ++.
But C++ provides a broader suite of possible micro-optimizations , so it 's possible to bend over backwards in order to write * really * fast code .
But , when writing equivalent code in C++ and Java , it 's tough to say which will have better performance characteristics .
To echo what others have said before me , you will * never * win over any Java programmers to D by emphasizing performance .
The lack of a VM requirement , on the other hand , is very compelling .

Probably not , if we 're talking about someone who has Java Programmer with a capital P embossed on their business card .

If that 's true , then it seems reasonable that there is a category of people using Java simply because it's what they were taught , and they might be interested in a language with syntax not too far from Java which at least in benchmarks significantly outperforms java : http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=dlang&lang2=java

D is a great all - around language , but in order to get the benefits of a language like D ( " low level Java " ) , you have to trade some safety and ' hand - holding ' .
The typical Sun and MS customer is not interested in paying Sun or MS for Java / .NET tools and support only to turn around and have to pay for tools / support for another ' lower level ' language with a ' buggy ' ( because it 's newer ) port of the same library written for a native compiler .
I seriously doubt Sun or MS would invest in something like that when the market has been moving the other way for so long .
For one thing there 's the bottom line -- Sun makes it 's profit from hardware and services [ like tuning Java applications ] and MS makes much of it's profit from new licenses for bloated software sold to run on newer , ever faster hardware .
Neither would really stand to ' profit ' from an easy to use , high performance , natively compiled language when there 's C /++ for those jobs already .
MS has recently went to great expense to " retrofit " C++ for .NET , not the other way around .
For a large company to produce a new language , go through the growing pains of developing a new language like D , and then retrofit the Java or .NET libs .
to take advantage of the new language would be an enormous cost .
Even with a huge amount of support , C# for example did n't take off overnight .
I forget the name of it , but Sun came up with a language / runtime intended for numerics .
It is anything but small , lightweight and single - CPU efficient .
It looked like more of a resource pig than even Hotspot .
It 's purpose was really to sell Sun hardware and services , no doubt .
I see it more likely that once D takes off , MS , Sun and others may then develop their own compilers / runtimes / libs .
for D because they need the bundle to make their systems and tools the most appealing to a wide range of customers .

---
To somebody without a prior language , I 'd say do n't , because there are n't any good books out yet .
To a university I 'd say : ( I 've spent 5 years teaching programming in a university )
This is the language you 've been waiting for ever since Pascal went out the door .
With this language you can teach both the standard C - family imperative programming concepts , as well as an exceptional selection of the more modern concepts .
The language is both clear enough to be used as a first language , and powerful and real - world usable enough to be used for post graduate work , as well as for professional programming .
As such it offers an excellent " mother tongue " from which forays into other Algol family languages as well as non-Algol family ones can be made with a minimum of friction .
It can also be argued that if a student ultimately needs to be fluent in C++ , he should take programming intro in D , intermediate in D , and only then jump ( directly ) to advanced C++.
Since most of the concepts are common between these languages , the student saves much time and gains a more solid understanding of those concepts with D , where most of his attention does n't go to ambiguities , exceptions , caveats , or the compiler drowning him or sending him of to wild goose chases in the night .
To a C/C++ programmer
I 'd say : Automatic memory management in a compiled language , you do n't know what you 're missing until you actually try it out !
Compile a 5 minute compilation in 15 seconds !
What if you could skip using lint altogether ?
How about never again needing to spend hours explaining to the younger colleagues all about pointer dereferencing and double indirection ?
Learning curve for C/C++ users : next to nothing !!
To a C++ guru :
Check out the metaprogramming stuff , and what folks have done with it !
Double your productivity , honest !
And the extra bonus : when 's the last time you actually enjoyed programming ?
To a C# or Java guy : Run without the VM !!!!!
And get access to the metal , be in real control of the computer !!
And you have n't seen this kind of speed since the barrio pushers got busted !
To a code shop boss : Bounds checking , pre- and post - conditions , unit tests , no header files !
And syntax is straightforward enough that you actually can write your own tools for analysis , manipulation , rules enforcement , and code generation !
And finally : you wo n't believe the increase in overall productivity !

Andrei I 've tried introducing D to people , and response varies .
For people that see C++ as having no advantages over C , it 's probably an impossible sell .
For people that like C++ but have been working with it long enough to be annoyed at the syntax , the cleaner syntax ( especially for template metaprogramming ) have made an impression .
The real selling point for me is that it has basically all of the safety and simplicity of use of something like Java , but does not have the handcuff and straight jacket feeling .
The " we are all in this boat and we will all follow the rules " approach of Java , along with some of the more arbitrary missing features ( i.e. unsigned types ) causes the language to drag when working with high - performance and high - requirement ( i.e. number crunching and hardware oriented ) fields .
The starting point I use is that it has almost all the features and power of Java and C++ but is cleaner and more usable than Java .
If they are still interested I point them here ( http://www.digitalmars.com/d/comparison.html), since I think it 's a good jumping off point for a C++ or Java programmer .
There was something about a web server that does n't need to allocate memory to process requests - I can't find a link for this , but I use it to describe the power of array slicing .

For me , it 's hard to pinpoint any particular feature or two .
It 's the combination of features that makes the cake , not the sugar , flour or baking powder .
So , 1 ) My programs come together faster and have fewer bugs .

I do harp on D's arrays ( which I love ) , but the real benefit comes from all of the little bits coming together to make the whole .
As an example in miniature ( and since people love specifics ) , static if , static foreach , tuples , and other little features all come together to make D's templates much more powerful and flexible than those of C++ , or Java 's crappy Generics .

Andrei I might ask her out for dinner , so that I could describe many of D's cool features .
^^
Seriously now , to hook a friend in , it would depend on the friend : its background , the languages the friend knows and likes , etc. .
What I can say is that what has drawn me to D in the first place was that D is a speed language without the obnoxiously obsolete C++ crap : structured module system instead of # includes &headers files , no need for function prototypes before use , methods are defined inside the aggregates , basic types with well defined sizes ( no more SDL's UInt8 , UInt16 , etc. , or OpenGL's GLint , GLfloat , etc. ) , uniform declarations ( like the non-C array declaration syntax , or struct declaration in the same namespace as everything else ) , overall cleaner syntax , etc. .
The advanced features ( dyn- arrays , GC , D's templates , etc. ) are also very nice , but for me the most important was really getting the basics right .

When D comes up in conversation , I usually bring up the following points in order : - Java / C# like syntax - * No VM or Interpreter * - Garbage - Collected - Portable - Built - in Array types ( No need for STL ) - Template features that mop the floor with Java and .
NET .
- Type Inference ( auto ) - Relatively open front - end , core library and GC .
The rest is really just icing on the cake .

Andrei Mostly it is the fact that a programing can be made more reliable and maintainable .
Simple consistent syntax is one part of this .
The " It 's easy to program in " also is part .
My favorite thing right now is this :
Things can be made " intent - ional " ( think " funct- ional " ) sort of a # define on steroids .
This comes from use of const and templates .
The after doing things like parser generation and ASM - stype bignum with template code I could actually stand reading really makes me think there is something here .
After showing the template parser generator to a prof of mine , he said " Quit tempting me " to start learning D , this from a guy that likes Prolog ( nothing wrong with that BTW ) .

Those mostly for c / c++ guys : - builtin arrays ( with bound - checks inserted by compiler ) - array slicing - delegates - lambdas - RAII - DBC - stdlib and compiler - generted code uses exceptions - string switches - modules - foreach - can use c-libs - can provide c-interface

What I find most humorous about PHP is that it * needs * good documentation because the " API " is so horribly fragmented - they kept the import names and call signatures from all those C libs , rather than normalize them .
The doc-comments feature was also a must - have since the documentation provided was ( and in places , still is ) anything but adequate on it's own .
The only major fault in the PHP doc web is that the documentation is n't ever really updated * from * the user provided comments .
You'd think an editor would gather up all the corrections and examples and fold them in , rather than let them hang out there for years on end ?
I 've seen some threads where the oldest posts are mis-information of the worst kind due to them dating back to PHP 3.0 .
Another example : the ColdFusion docs do have editors that upgrade / update the system regularly .
However , they like to wipe out * everything * between language versions on their website - they 're separate webs after all .
The result is the CF5 , CFMX6 and CFMX7 doc webs all have different user content .

The 1.5 mile section of the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail ( W&OD ) that runs through the City of Falls Church is well on its way to adding dedicated cycling and pedestrian lanes by next summer , and is seen as all the more crucial given how the novel coronavirus is transmitted .
In an e-mail to his constituents in Minnesota ’s 5th District , Freshman Congressman Keith Ellison ( D - Minneapolis ) explained why he voted yes on the U.S. Troop Readiness , Veterans ’ Health and Iraq Accountability supplemental funding request .
Ellison ’s statement :
“ This vote , plain and simple , comes down to ending the war – or not .
I believe this bill is a vote to end this war .
It is not the bill I would have written .
From the beginning of my campaign , my position was out of Iraq – now .
But let us not confuse our goals with our methods .
This is the first piece of legislation that actually puts timetables on ending this senseless involvement in Iraq .
It is the best vehicle we have before us to end the war .
Voting for benchmarks and deadlines is a vote to end the war .
Voting against the deadlines is a vote to support war without end .
The startling irony is that the people who hate the war the most could be forced into a coalition that will strengthen President George Bush ’s hand to continue the war unabated .
It is painful and difficult to do anything other than to cast a no vote for any further funding of this war .
But I will not strengthen this President ’s position by voting against imperfect timelines .
Make no mistake about it .
this President wants this vote on timelines to fail .
I know with each month that this civil war deepens , we lose another 100 young American men and women ; 100 Iraqi civilians die every day , and we spend another $ 8 billion dollars a month in Iraq that is sorely needed here at home .
This loss of life is tragic and unacceptable .
But we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good .
The alternative to this proposal is more of the same – with no leverage whatsoever on the President ’s disastrous war .
To me , that is the larger issue : allowing this President ’s policies to go unchecked one single day more .
I ’m simply not willing to ask any more American families to jeopardize the safety , well - being and future of their sons or daughters ad - infinitum for an ill - conceived and ineptly executed war that had nothing to do with 9/11 or the war on terrorism .
I also see this bill as a beginning – one I intend to firmly hold the Democratic Leadership and the President to .
For many of my colleagues , the Democratic timetable for troop withdrawal is the first positive sign in four years since the Iraq War began .
They are right .
For me , and the Minnesotans I represent , troop withdrawal is not some position paper ; it is linked to time – and time is measured in lives .
My conscience tells me the time is now – and this legislation is the best vehicle we have before us to end this debacle . ”
The latest curative leap to heal professional athletes and weekend warriors alike may sound like science fiction , but it could transform sports medicine .
Some doctors and researchers say that in a few years the use of primitive stem cells from infants ’ umbilical cord blood could grow new knee ligaments or elbow tendons creating a therapy that becomes the vanguard of sports injury repair .
Already , some sports agents are preparing to advise clients about banking stem cells from their offspring or from tissue taken from their own bodies as an insurance policy against a career - ending infirmity .
Stem cell blood banks are promoting the benefits of stem cell therapies for the practical healing and rehabilitation of tendons , ligaments , muscle and cartilage .
There are skeptics in the medical community who wonder how soon the technology will be viable , but enthusiastic advocates of the therapies say the time is near .
“ It ’s not a pie in the sky notion , ” said Dr. Scott Rodeo , an orthopedist and award - winning research scientist at Manhattan ’s Hospital for Special Surgery .
“ Maybe it ’s not going to happen next year , but a three - to - five - year horizon is not unreasonable . ”
Dr. Rodeo has already practiced these technologies in laboratory surgeries on rats , methods that will be especially useful when reconstructing the knee ’s anterior cruciate ligament and the shoulder ’s rotator cuff .
Both are common sports maladies that can be particularly daunting to surgeons because the body generally does not mend or restore the damaged tissue after these injuries .
In the corner , weighing in at 17lb : " giant baby " Ademilton dos Santos
Ademilton dos Santos is the heaviest boy ever born in Brazil , says the Brazilian Gynaecological Association .
Ademilton was born by Caesarean section on Wednesday at a hospital in Salvador in north - eastern Brazil .
He is Francisca Ramos dos Santos ' fifth child and doctors said his unusual size was probably due to his mother 's diabetes condition .
Paediatrician Luiz Sena Azul said Ademilton " could truly be considered a giant baby , for he was born weighing what a six - month - old - baby normally weighs " .
' Surprise '
Mrs Santos , 38 , has four other children - aged nine , 12 , 14 , and 15 - who were all of normal weight when they were born .
" She knew Ademilton would be a big baby , but not this big , " Ms Leal said .
" She , her husband and the hospital staff were caught by surprise . "
Ademilton is being given glucose solution intravenously , to maintain a safe level of blood sugar , because of his mother 's diabetes .
He is also receiving oxygen because of breathing problems .
But his general state of health is good , according to the hospital director .
" Both mother and baby are doing just fine , " said Rita Leal , director of the Albert Sabin Maternity Hospital .
For Alfredo de Jesus dos Santos , his wife 's diabetes was also a problem during previous pregnancies .
" Yes , I got very worried , " he said .
" I got very worried because diabetes is a disease that never gets better . "
The Guinness Book of World Records says the heaviest baby ever was born to Anna Bates of Canada in 1879 .
It weighed 23.12lb ( 10.8 kg ) and died 11 hours after birth .
Industrial agriculture faces painful challenges : the end of cheap energy , depleted water resources , impaired ecosystem services , and unstable climates .
Scientists searching for alternatives to the highly specialized , energy intensive industrial system might profitably look to the biological synergies inherent in multi-species systems , according to an article in the March - April 2007 issue of Agronomy Journal .
The paper 's author , Fred Kirschenmann , Distinguished Fellow for Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture , Iowa State University , states that industrial agriculture assumes :
Production efficiency can be best achieved through specialization , simplification and concentration
Therapeutic intervention is the most effective way to control undesirable events
Technological innovation will always be able to overcome production challenges
Control management is the most effective way to achieve production results
Cheap energy will always be available
As we enter the 21st century most , if not all , of these assumptions must be questioned .
The degraded condition of ecosystem services was detailed in the UN " Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Synthesis Report " ( 2005 ) .
The report also anticipates that during the next 50 years demand for food crops will grow by 70 to 85 % and demand for water by between 30 and 85 % .
Volatile weather conditions predicted to be part of emerging climate change will make it difficult to sustain highly specialized cropping systems which require relatively stable climates .
To keep agriculture productive , farmers likely will need to adjust quickly .
If we can design farming systems that are less energy intensive , more resilient in the face of unstable climates , and that begin to out - produce monocultures by virtue of their multi-species output , the economic advantages of such complex farming operations might be an incentive to change .
A few farmers already operate successful , complex farming systems based on biological synergies and adaptive management .
One is Takao Furuno 's duck / fish / rice / fruit farm in Japan .
He produces duck meat , duck eggs , fish meat , fruit , and rice without any purchased outside inputs , using a highly synergistic system of production on the same acreage where he previously only produced rice .
And , in this new system , his rice yields have increased up to 50 % over previous yields from an energy - intensive rice monoculture .
Joel Salatin , of Polyface Farms near Swoope , VA , has developed a rotational grazing production system featuring pastures containing at least 40 varieties of plants and numerous animal species .
Salatin 's farm uses little fossil fuel , yet the farm is highly productive .
The 57 - hectare farm annually produces 30,000 dozen eggs , 10,000 to 12,000 broilers , 100 beef animals , 250 hogs , 800 turkeys , and 600 rabbits .
A study by George Boody and colleagues has calculated , on a watershed basis , that diverse , synergistic farms can be profitable and simultaneously benefit the environment .
They showed that when farms are converted from corn / soybean monocultures to more diverse operations , net farm income can increase by as much as 108 % while generating significant environmental and social benefits .
Principles that might guide postmodern farms are almost diametrically opposed to those supporting industrial agriculture .

The swearing in of Justice Rana Bhagwandas as the Acting Chief Justice ( ACJ ) of Pakistan is not a ‘ historical ’ event in and of itself .
However , Justice Bhagwandas now has a historical opportunity before him to influence the both the history of the institution he represents ( the Judiciary ) as well as the history of the country .
First some points of context :
This is NOT the first time that Justice Bhagwandas has been the Acting Chief Justice .
Indeed , as the next most senior judge on the Supreme Court , he has been called on to take this role before .
Regular readers of ATP would remember seeing his picture here back in January in relation to a decision on Basant that he had then given , also as ACJ .
the first time that Justice Bhagwandas has been the Acting Chief Justice .
Indeed , as the next most senior judge on the Supreme Court , he has been called on to take this role before .
Regular readers of ATP would remember seeing his picture here back in January in relation to a decision on Basant that he had then given , also as ACJ .
Remember that he is the ‘ Acting ’ Chief Justice ; the assumption and the point of fact being that Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is still the Chief Justice .
Even if he were to be appointed the Chief Justice eventually , he would not be the first non-Muslim Chief Justice of Pakistan .
In fact , Justice Alvin Robert ( A.R. ) Cornelius served on the Supreme Court of Pakistan for 17 years , nearly 8 years of those as Chief Justice .
Indeed , he is widely regarded as amongst the most respected and well - known Pakistanis to have held that office .
Indeed , it is a little disconcerting that his taking over this office – which was the procedurally appropriate thing to be done – is raising such attention .
It is doing so , partly , on the assumption that the appointment of Justice Javed Iqbal as ACJ before him had some sinister purpose .
Largely , it is because most Pakistanis have only just realized that Justice Bhagwandas is a practicing Hindu , and there are clearly those who want to make this an issue , even questioning his appropriateness for that reason .
It is also , I think , that people ’s faith in the judicial process is so low that they assume that he will soon , necessarily , assume the office of the Chief Justice .
( It should be added that he is slated to retire at the age of 65 , which happens this December ; Justcie Iftikhar , on the other hand , does not retire till 2013 ) .
Justice Rana Bhagwandas is – as , in fact , was Justice Javed Iqbal before him – considered to be a highly respected judge of high intellectual caliber and personal integrity .
Born in 1942 , Justce Bhagwandas became a lawyer like many other educated Sindhi Hindus and also has a post - graduate degree in Islamic studies and is considered an expert on constitutional law .
He was a practising lawyer for about two years before being appointed to the bench in July 1967 ; he became a judge of the Sindh High Court in 1994 ; and of the Supreme Court in 2000 .
A challenge to his appointment to the higher judiciary on the grounds that he was a non-Muslim was dismissed by the Sindh High Court in 2002 .
It is ( a ) because the prescribed procedure was followed here in his appointment , and ( b ) because he is a highly respected judge and a constitutional expert , that one should focus on this appointment .
He is obviously aware of the historical decisions ahead of him .
His first statement after taking his oath could be misconstrued as over - enthusiastic but one would like to believe that there is no hidden message in this statement and he is merely being diplomatic .
According to The News :
Acting Chief Justice of Pakistan ( ACJP ) , Rana Bhagwan Das has said that the presidential reference against Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry would be dealt with adequately .
Talking to the media after taking oath as ACJP , Justice Bhagwan Das told that the Supreme Judicial Council would be taking a decision on the issue of holding the hearing of the reference in open or in camera .
He said that the judiciary would not disappoint the people and the nation would soon hear the good news .
The history of the Pakistan Supreme Court and of Justices in this situation is a ‘ busy ’ one .
Too busy , in my opinion .
But it is not an even one .
There have been shameful examples when the courts have allowed themselves to become tools in the hands of military and political leaders ; but there have also been times when the Justices have made the nation proud by standing up to all pressures and deciding solely on the merit of the cases .
Judges , of course , love to hear about precedent .
Here , the precedence lies in both direction .
The question is , which precedent will Justice Rana Bhagwandas follow ?
For anyone interested in the history of the Judiciary in such cases – both good and bad – do watch this very informative BBC report on the subject .

Disk image flaw found on Mac OS X
A vulnerability in the way Macs handle the disk image ( .dmg ) format could allow a system to be compromised by a remote attacker , according to the latest post by the Month of Kernel Bugs ( MoKB ) Project .
The flaw occurs in the function responsible for opening disk images and could be exploited remotely if an attacker crafts a malformed image , places it on a Web server , and then convinces a Mac user to click on a link , according to an advisory on the MoKB Web site .
The default configuration for Apple 's Safari Web browser allows " safe " files to be opened after downloading .
Apple has come under increasing scrutiny by vulnerability researchers .
The latest bug is the third issue disclosed by the MoKB Project , which included a significant vulnerability in older drivers for Apple 's wireless Airport network hardware .
A recent report by Symantec , the owner of SecurityFocus , noted an increased focus among researchers on developing exploits for Mac OS X flaws .
Safari users can protect themselves from the issue by deactivating the opening " safe " files after downloading preference setting .
He went on to blame illegal immigrants for the state ’s high property taxes , problems with uninsured drivers and violent crime .
He also hinted that illegal immigrants were more likely to become terrorists .
“ Our country is at war right now , and it ’s very important that we protect our kids , and one of the ways you can protect them is to not let undocumented immigrants into this country , ” he said .
This is not the pair ’s first foray into public eye - poking .
Two years ago , the Jersey Guys infuriated Gov. Richard J. Codey by making fun of his wife ’s bout with depression .
A few months later they made a few enemies in the state ’s sizable Asian - American community by mocking Chinese people and saying that foreigners should not be allowed to dictate the outcome of an “ American election . ”
They later apologized for their remarks about Asians , saying that they were just entertainers and that no one should take them seriously .
This time , however , the men say their campaign against illegal immigrants is anything but showmanship .
“ This operation is not a game , not a contest , ” Mr. Carton said .
“ Our goal is to make New Jersey and the United States of America safer places to live . ”
Judging from the cascade of congratulatory calls , the men have tapped into an angry vein in the state , where , according to 2005 census figures , 20 percent of all residents are foreign born , the third highest rate in the country .
“ This is an invasion , ” said one caller , Carmen Perez , who said she had come to this country as a 3 - year - old .
“ I would deport most of them . ”
Considering the Jersey Guys ’ lack of contrition and the anger among Latino advocates , “ La Cucha Gotcha ” is likely to spark an even larger backlash .
That may or may not be a bad thing for the station , which , like the entire broadcast radio industry , has been struggling to compete against the twin scourges of electronic music downloads and satellite radio .
Eric Johnson , the station ’s program director , declined to comment , saying he wanted to give the last word to the Jersey Guys .
But Jack Plunkett , an analyst who follows broadcast radio , said the station might want to check out recent marketing data indicating that Hispanics are the fastest - growing group in the country , with spending power of $ 700 billion a year , a figure that is expected to triple by 2010 .
“ These guys might not realize it , ” he said , “ but they could be shooting themselves in the foot . ”
Before sending the first human Yuri Gagarin to space , Russian scientists made a lot of experiments with animals .
The most well known are two dogs who were sent in Russian rocket just before the first human made his flight .
This launch of the first space pig is less known to public , and in this Year of the Pig according to Oriental calendar , we can commemorate this brave pioneer of Russian space science .
And look how this hero is treaded with humanity – they gave him some wine before the launch in order to bring it in relaxed state .

And as a side note , when you do n't really play online games , the Xbox 360 kind - of sucks .
Anyway . )
I 've done some soul searching to try to figure out why I fear the online .
And as best as I can figure it out , when I 've got a big ol ' stack of single - player , story - based videogames I want to play through sitting around the ol '
Sasserpartment , there 's simply no space in my brain for " play around , online " .
My gaming time is precious , and I like stories , accomplishment , and " endings " — both conquering a game in triumph , and getting to move on to a new one .
It 's a one - two punch of joy straight to the face .
Who can play online when there 's so much yet to do offline ?
Despite all of this , and all three mighty paragraphs of setup , I recently had a small epiphany .
I 've found myself totally enraptured by a new kind of online gaming experience , one that 's got excitement , thrilling rivalries , stats and achievements , mind - blowing graphics , and seriously perfect music .
And sweat .
Ridiculous amounts of sweat .
My online game of the year ?
Jogging on the streets of Portland with the Nike + iPod kit . ... zing !
Deprogramming Gym Class
I know , right ?
Jogging .
Does n't really sound like a good time , does it ?
Have I gone crazy ?
Let me explain .
The
In reality , Apple and Nike have invented a system that perfectly connects two sides of my brain that had previously only given each other occasional awkward glances across the fleshy halls of my skull : the nerdy , video gaming part of me , and the part of me that actually kind - of likes ( and feels good about ) exercise .
To date , I 'd never really remotely been interested in " running " — it seemed slow , exhausting , and probably painful .
It does n't help that I 'm not particularly an " athlete " , more of a small - man walkabout , although I do love a good bike ride .
I did n't really do sports in high school ( I was instead probably screwing around at some BBS meet at Round Table Pizza — lord that was hard to type ) , P.E. was a mixed bag ( although I loved " capture the flag " ) , and I used to honestly dread track and field day with every ounce of my body , for a horn - of - plentysworth of reasons .
To get into running , the first thing that had to go for me was the gym class barrier — all those track and field memories .
Surprisingly , I found that simply running down the streets of Portland was nothing like the well - remembered monotone of a dusty cinder track .
The city is always changing , dynamic , and fun .
Not only that , but I was pretty much by myself , in blissful musical solitude : soaking in the scenery without any competitive stress from , well , athletes .
It did n't take much time at all for me to realize that running — when you 're not being expected to do so — is really rather pleasant .
I was off .
Steady Progress
Not Me. It Is , However , Our Office ( 3rd Floor ) Not Me. It Is , However , Our Office ( 3rd Floor )
When the shoes arrived , my routine started in earnest , and I gradually increased my distance and started running regularly , every other day , for about 30 minutes a day .
The awesome thing about the human body — and I guess , the most inspiring part of this process for me — was that things change , the body improves , and you do n't really even notice .
All of the sudden , about two weeks later , I was able to run my standard route — 3 miles in NW Portland including two monstrous hills — without stopping to break .
I could hardly believe it once I realized it .
This is n't meant to be bragging , but rather be inspiring — it had nothing to do with me , rather it was the amazing capabilities we all share as owners of the ultimate in human interface design : humans .
Whoah .
Heavy .
The Game The second best part about the Nike + running — the cool , video - game like part — is that you not only run , but you also get points for running .
Your score ever - increases .
Better still , if you set goals for yourself , you even get awesome virtual trophies and ribbons , resplendent in their vector beauty .
Just like Pac - Man got to eat the occasional delicious ( albeit high - sodium ) pretzel treat in - between hundreds of dots , the Nike + runner gets the occasional trophy treat in between the miles .
As I understand it , a lot of people run for so - called " exercise " , but let me tell you : points are way cooler .
And the coolest part about Nike+ running ?
Like any good online game , you can challenge your friends .
First to 100 miles ?
Fastest 5 - mile time ?
Your call .
These challenges wind up being incredibly inspiring — running against good friend and athletic powerhouse J. John Afryl kept me on my toes ( maybe a bit too much as you 'll read later ) — and they 're also incredibly fun .
Logging in after a long run , uploading your data , and seeing where you are in the standings , is a pretty awesome way to wrap up your exercise .
And more importantly , sitting around the house , wondering what to do , thinking about jogging , and then realizing that if you do n't go jogging tonight you 're going to lose points and slip in the standings — now that 's true , videogame motivation .
Over the course of a couple of months , I 've developed a few personal " cheat codes " ( if you will , in a strained metaphor ) that I want to share with you , most of them obvious .
NIGHT_RIDER is a good one — basically , and I know this is going to surprise you , it 's running at night .
HAVE I GONE NUTS sure it 's probably not for everybody , but I love it .
It 's cooler , it 's mellow , it 's relaxing .
Of course , you need to be cautious and visible and careful .
But running at night is , for me , significantly easier than trying to go during the day , and with this cheat code you 'll do more for less !
RUN_WITH_NICOLE is also a really important performance booster code — make sure to replace " NICOLE " with the name of your own personal running partner / significant other / athletic ghost friend who haunts your gym shorts .
Having somebody to run along with — and talk to , or listen to music with , or keep pace with — takes the " u( gh ) " out of " run " .
Thanks , Nicole .
My favorite cheat code , though ?
STEALTH_MODE .
Powerful .
Deadly .
Herein lies my greatest Nike + triumph .
But beware : this cheat code is dangerous and cursed , and was also responsible for my greatest downfall .
So , I became obsessed with being the first runner to hit 100 miles .
Why ?
While we were at
I knew I had to do two things .
I had to run like crazy .
And I had to , somehow , not let on that I was running like crazy .
This would hopefully make John let his guard down thinking I was lounging about the veranda , maybe take one or two days off or not push himself knowing exactly how much to push , and allow me to make it happen , surprise style .
And thus , STEALTH_MODE was born .
Basically , do n't upload your data .
Ever .
Do n't even think about plugging your iPod into your computer after you run .
As you continue to run , the data will accumulate on your iPod , but you do n't want to tip your hand and post it for everyone to see .
Charge your iPod via a wall charger , or maybe plug - in to a random power - giving USB port on some other device — but do n't let the iPod mount and the dreaded iTunes launch and auto-upload .
( Pro Tip :
You 'll want to make sure you have enough music before attempting this cheat code . )
While engaged in STEALTH_MODE , everyone will think you 're a lazy pile , but you 're racking up another mile !
( TM © 2006 CS )
Finally , once you 've accomplished your goal , whatever it may be , plug your iPod in , sit back , and enjoy as a shocking number of miles get uploaded in one gigantic megablast of running ludicrosity .
This is how I uploaded 36 miles in one shot ...
... and became the first guy in our group to hit 100 miles .
Which , really , felt awesome .
A little tricky , but still awesome .
It was all downhill from there .
Critical Bug : My Controllers
Are Broken
Here 's the thing about not being a runner : I do n't know crap all about running .
To hit the 100 mile mark , I had to run a lot .
I mean , a lot — once , 3 times in one day .
At distances I had never even thought possible — well , for me — like 10 miles .
( Shut up , professionals . )
And it all felt great , until one fateful morning when I got out of bed , and my legs kind - of crumpled into themselves .
My legs were n't in pain per se , but it was clear they were unhappy .
Like teamsters at the Moscone center , they did n't really feel like doing their job and were n't afraid to say so .
My retardological conclusion was that my legs were just " tired " from the run and needed a little pep up .
So I ran again that night , about 6 miles .
And the next morning it was much worse .
So I gave it a couple of days rest .
And then ran 4 miles after that , despite it being one of the hardest things I 've ever tried to do .
And , way - hey ! , guess what ?
The next morning it was worse still .
Yeah , I 'm a total genius .
A limping , totally stupid looking genius .
And that 's the story of why I 'm currently taking a week ( or more ) off of running .
( And , in the meantime , John is sprinting past me , demolishing any hope of me winning this month 's distance trophy .
The price for my trickery has been duly paid . )
What did I do to myself ?
I do n't know .
Pull a muscle ?
What does that even mean ?
I have no idea .
The good news is that my legs have been getting better every day and I 'm not limping anymore .
I 'll probably be back in normal regular peppy form by Monday .
But it 's important to point out this potential cheat code bug — let this be a cautionary beginning runner tale .
You can break your controllers easily .
Do n't push it , mister .
Ramp it up , especially if you 're starting from zero .
You can beat your rival next month .
I promise .
Or , in my case , you probably can't .
But still , be good .
It Is The Future I can think of a million ideas that would add more video - game - like awesomeness to Nike + and , yes , by extension , exercise in general .
What if the iPod sensor , which works over a proprietary 802.11 protocol — could also detect other shoe sensors in the vicinity ?
I 'd really enjoy running along the Eastbank Esplanade , passing a runner , and , assuming they had the ( optional ) preference turned on , immediately hear their best time mile announced over my headphones and have them added as a " rival " that I could then track via the website .
Of course , adding additional technology to the iPod part — like a GPS receiver , dare I dream — could create even more amazing , city - wide games of running tag with my friends .
Now that 's a multiplayer game I 'd love to play every weekend .
That said , I guess my ultimate point of all of this is pretty simple .
This " game " surprised me , and that 's saying something .
Everyone can play this game .
You should play this game .
Run , walk , skip , who cares : you get points , you get exercise , you get to try to kick the ass of your stupid friends ( who you love ) or suffer bitter defeat , you get to explore your neighborhood and you get some fresh air and you see some funny things .
You get to overhear insane conversations in hilarious tiny fragments .
You get to buy weird new clothes , and hopefully even wear ridiculous headbands that , somehow , do n't bother you one bit .
And while you 'll wonder what you 're going to do when winter hits , or if you can keep it up forever , you 'll give it a shot .
Because you get to run into the world and accomplish something , however small , offline and online all at once .
And is n't everything better when it 's a game ?
I 've got a confession .
I do n't play online multiplayer games .
Sure , a few Nintendo DS matches of Tetris DS and Mario Kart here and there .
But even though I 've owned an Xbox 360 since technically - before - the - launch - date , and I have an Xbox Live Gold subscription , I 've not yet played a single game on Xbox Live .
Not one deathmatch , not one race , not even a game of good ol ' Uno .
( I have , however , sent a few Xbox Live voicemail messages to friends where I 'm all ' bluu bluu bluuuuu beep boop bleep bloop baaa - la - la - la kit kit kit ' for six minutes .
That 's pretty fun .
And as a side note , when you do n't really play online games , the Xbox 360 kind - of sucks .
Anyway . ) I 've done some soul searching to try to figure out why I fear the online .
And as best as I can figure it out , when I 've got a big ol ' stack of single - player , story - based videogames I want to play through sitting around the ol '
Sasserpartment , there 's simply no space in my brain for " play around , online " .
My gaming time is precious , and I like stories , accomplishment , and " endings " — both conquering a game in triumph , and getting to move on to a new one .
It 's a one - two punch of joy straight to the face .
Who can play online when there 's so much yet to do offline ?
Despite all of this , and all three mighty paragraphs of setup , I recently had a small epiphany .
I 've found myself totally enraptured by a new kind of online gaming experience , one that 's got excitement , thrilling rivalries , stats and achievements , mind - blowing graphics , and seriously perfect music .
And sweat .
Ridiculous amounts of sweat .
My online game of the year ?
Jogging on the streets of Portland with the Nike + iPod kit .
I know , right ?
Jogging .
Does n't really sound like a good time , does it ?
Have I gone crazy ?
Let me explain .
The Nike + running kit ( $ 29 ) uses a special shoe - based sensor , coupled with a special receiver for the iPod nano , to track your pace and distance as you run .
Once you 're done and you dock , it uploads all sorts of cool statistics to a very game - like Flash website , where you can track your progress , set goals , challenge your friends , and more .
In reality , Apple and Nike have invented a system that perfectly connects two sides of my brain that had previously only given each other occasional awkward glances across the fleshy halls of my skull : the nerdy , video gaming part of me , and the part of me that actually kind - of likes ( and feels good about ) exercise .
To date , I 'd never really remotely been interested in " running " — it seemed slow , exhausting , and probably painful .
It does n't help that I 'm not particularly an " athlete " , more of a small - man walkabout , although I do love a good bike ride .
I did n't really do sports in high school ( I was instead probably screwing around at some BBS meet at Round Table Pizza — lord that was hard to type ) , P.E. was a mixed bag ( although I loved " capture the flag " ) , and I used to honestly dread track and field day with every ounce of my body , for a horn - of - plentysworth of reasons .
To get into running , the first thing that had to go for me was the gym class barrier — all those track and field memories .
Surprisingly , I found that simply running down the streets of Portland was nothing like the well - remembered monotone of a dusty cinder track .
The city is always changing , dynamic , and fun .
Not only that , but I was pretty much by myself , in blissful musical solitude : soaking in the scenery without any competitive stress from , well , athletes .
It did n't take much time at all for me to realize that running — when you 're not being expected to do so — is really rather pleasant .
I was off .
My first few weeks of running ( pre- Nike + , getting ready ) were pretty shaky and slow going .
I started extremely mellow and , as per Google 's all - knowing jogging advice , I walked when I needed to , which was frequent .
Even 10 blocks or so of continuous running was enough to transform me into Sir Sweatington The Third .
But despite all of this , it still felt pretty good — because it felt like it would get easier .
When the shoes arrived , my routine started in earnest , and I gradually increased my distance and started running regularly , every other day , for about 30 minutes a day .
The awesome thing about the human body — and I guess , the most inspiring part of this process for me — was that things change , the body improves , and you do n't really even notice .

Herein lies my greatest Nike + triumph .
But beware : this cheat code is dangerous and cursed , and was also responsible for my greatest downfall .
So , I became obsessed with being the first runner to hit 100 miles .
Why ?
While we were at WWDC , I ran a few times around San Francisco , and John and I were literally neck - and - neck in the " Month One " distance standings .
On Thursday night , we were maybe .3 miles apart .
Then came Friday — a day filled with the Panic crew walking all around San Francisco , much time spent in airports , etc .
In short , I did n't have a single chance to run on Friday .
Little did I know that the " month one " challenge ended that Friday night , and John , who undoubtedly saw the stats and realized we were neck - and - neck , blazed ahead , putting in an impressive amount of miles and taking home the trophy .
I did n't stand a chance .
It was on .
I knew I had to do two things .
I had to run like crazy .
And I had to , somehow , not let on that I was running like crazy .
This would hopefully make John let his guard down thinking I was lounging about the veranda , maybe take one or two days off or not push himself knowing exactly how much to push , and allow me to make it happen , surprise style .

Rescuers had to use ladders and cranes to reach the train
The train , which floats on a monorail via a magnetic levitation system called maglev , was going at nearly 200 km /h ( 120 mph ) when it crashed near Lathen .
Damaged carriages were left balancing on track 5 m ( 16ft ) in the air , hampering rescue efforts .
" Today we are in mourning , " said Chancellor Angela Merkel at the scene .
The accident happened at about 1000 ( 0800 GMT ) , on a 31.8 km ( 20 miles ) test track from Lathen to Doerpenwhich is used for tourist trips and to demonstrate the technology .
It 's just unbelievable how human failure can cause so many fatalities so quickly
Martin , Neuss , Germany
Pictures from the crash scene
Emergency workers used fire ladders and cranes to reach the carriages .
Several metres below , the ground was strewn with wreckage .
Reports said up to 30 passengers on the train - mostly employees working on the system and staff from a local utility company , RWE .
' Human error '
The maintenance vehicle hit by the train had two crew members .
A spokesman for IABG , the company which operates the train , said the accident had been caused by human error , rather than a technical fault .
Ms Merkel arrived by helicopter near the scene .
Dressed in black , she extended condolences to the victims and their families : " I want to show that I am with them , " she said .
The Transrapid system , run by Siemens , is capable of speeds of up to 450 km /h ( 280 mph ) .
The only commercial example of a Transrapid system in operation is the high - speed shuttle to China 's Shanghai airport from the city centre .
It was developed by Transrapid International , a joint venture between Siemens AG and ThyssenKrupp .
German Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee , who is in China , has cancelled his trip and is now on his way back to Germany .
In August , a fire broke out on a Transrapid train in Shanghai , adding to concerns about the safety of the technology .
The German companies are keen to make Transrapid an export hit and negotiations are under way about building another link in China , and also in Munich , the BBC's Tristana Moore reports from Berlin .
HOW MAGLEV TRAINS WORK
Like poles on magnets keep train above track Train is propelled by electro - magnetic system in the sides of the " guideway " instead of onboard engine Top speed ( with passengers ) - 450 km/h ( 280 mph ) Developed by Transrapid Int in Germany Operating commercially in Shanghai Test facility in Emsland , northern Germany , is longest of its kind at 31.5 km ( 19.5 miles ) Source : Transrapid International

Here are a selection of comments received so far :
Having used the Maglev train in Shanghai , this should not be used as an excuse to delay further development of this fantastic , environmentally friendly piece of technology .
It 's apparent that the train hit a maintenence vehicle , thus human error is 100 % responsible .
This train could offer London - Brighton services in 7 minutes , and further development should continue .
Sam , London , UK
What an absolutely tragic and mournful day this has been .
Although I 'm living several kilometers away from the crash scene , this massive extent of devastation is so gruesome and frightening .
It 's just unbelievable how human failure can cause so many fatalities so quickly .
Martin , Neuss , Germany
I recently rode the Mag Lev train in Shanghai .
I 've travelled many forms of transit from the underground to Concorde .
I came off my round trip feeling very ill at ease - and I remember saying to my friend that if something were on the track at these speeds we would be finished ( which is one reason the tracks are elevated ) .
The feeling is very different from the Japan bullet trains or the French TGV .
My heart goes out to the family and friends of those killed and injured .
David , Santa Monica , USA
I was in the cab of the Transrapid train during a high - speed run at the test track in Lathen on August 18 in connection with my work as a transport journalist .
They showed me some of the maintenance vehicles and I can only imagine it would have been a terrible crash if the train hit one of them at speed .
It strikes me that the accident does show a weakness in the technology .
If a maintenance train were left on the track on a normal railway , it would be impossible to turn the signal behind it to green .
There clearly was n't any such system at Lathen .

It was getting time to stop futzing around with FogBugz 4.0 and start working on 5.0 .
We just shipped a big service pack , fixing a zillion tiny little bugs that nobody would ever come across ( and introducing a couple of new tiny little bugs that nobody will ever come across ) and it was time to start adding some gen - yoo - ine new features .
By the time we were ready to start development , we had enough ideas for improvement to occupy 1700 programmers for a few decades .
Unfortunately , all we have is three programmers , and we wanted to be shipping next fall , so there had to be some prioritization .
Before I tell you how we prioritized our list of features , let me tell you two ways not to do it .
Number one .
If you ever find yourself implementing a feature simply because it has been promised to one customer , RED DANGER LIGHTS should be going off in your head .
If you ’re doing things for one customer , you ’ve either got a loose cannon sales person , or you ’re slipping dangerously down the slope towards consultingware .
And there ’s nothing wrong with consultingware ; it ’s a very comfortable slope to slip down , but it ’s just not as profitable as shrinkwrap software .
Shrinkwrap is the take - it - or - leave it model of software development .
You develop software , wrap it in plastic , and customers either buy it , or they do n’t .
They do n’t offer to buy it if you implement just one more feature .
They do n’t call you up and negotiate features .
You ca n’t call up Microsoft and tell them , “ Hey , I love that BAHTTEXT function you have in Excel for spelling out numbers in Thai , but I could really use an equivalent function for English .
I ’ll buy Excel if you implement that function . ”
Because if you did call up Microsoft here is what they would say to you :
“ Thank you for calling Microsoft .
If you are calling with a designated 4 - digit advertisement code , press 1 .
For technical support on all Microsoft products , press 2 .
For Microsoft presales product licensing or program information , press 3 .
If you know the person at Microsoft you wish to speak to , press 4 .
To repeat , press Star . ”

None of the choices was , “ To negotiate what features need to be added to our products before you ’ll buy them , press 5 . ”
Custom development is that murky world where a customer tells you what to build , and you say , “ are you sure ? ” and they say yes , and you make an absolutely beautiful spec , and say , “ is this what you want ? ” and they say yes , and you make them sign the spec in indelible ink , nay , blood , and they do , and then you build that thing they signed off on , promptly , precisely and exactly , and they see it and they are horrified and shocked , and you spend the rest of the week reading up on whether your E&O insurance is going to cover the legal fees for the lawsuit you ’ve gotten yourself into or merely the settlement cost .
Or , if you ’re really lucky , the customer will smile wanly and put your code in a drawer and never use it again and never call you back .
Somewhere in the middle is consultingware , where you pretend to be doing shrinkwrap while really doing custom development .
Here ’s how consultingware works :
You ’re working as a wage - slave writing code for a shoe company , and the company needs shoe - shining software , so you develop shoe - shining software in VB 3.0 using bits and pieces of JavaScript , Franz Lisp , and a FileMaker database running on an old Mac connected over the network using AppleScript , then everyone thinks it ’s the cat ’s whiskers , so , always having dreamed of starting your own software company and maybe being Bill Gates or perhaps even just Larry Ellison you buy the rights to ShoeShiner 1.0 from your old company and get VC to start your own company , ShoeShiner LLC , marketing shoe - shining software , but none of your beta testers can get it to work because of the obscure dependencies on AppleScript and the hardcoded IP addresses in the source code , so it takes a month to install at each client site , and you have trouble getting clients , because your product is so expensive because of all the installation costs , including the vintage Macintosh IIci running System 7 which they have to buy on ebay from computer museums , so your VCs start to get really nervous , putting pressure on the sales guys , who find out that one of your potential customers does n’t need a shoe - shining thing but he could really use trousers - pressing software , and the sales guy , being a sales guy , sells him $ 100 K worth of trousers - pressing software , and now you spend 6 months writing a one - off “ trousers - pressing module ” for this client , which no other client will ever need , thus , effectively , for all intents and purposes you ’ve just spent a year raising VC so that you could work as a wage - slave writing code for a trouser company ; GOTO 1 .
Sparky , I ’m gonna have to strongly recommend clinging as strongly as possible to the shrinkwrap side of the equation .
That ’s because shrinkwrap has no marginal costs for each additional customer , so you can essentially sell the same thing over and over again and make a lot more profit .
Not only that , but you can lower the price , because you can spread your development costs out over a lot more customers , and lowering the price gets you more customers because more people will suddenly find your now - cheaper software worthwhile , and life is good and all is sweet .
Thus .
If you ever find yourself implementing a feature simply because it has been promised to a customer , you ’re drifting over to the land of consultingware and custom development , which is a fine world to operate in if that ’s what you like , but it just does n’t have the profit potential of off - the - shelf commercial software .
Now , I ’m not saying you should n’t listen to your customers .
I for one think that it ’s about time Microsoft actually implemented a version of the BAHTTEXT function for those of us who have n’t yet joined the global economy and learned Thai and who still write checks using other currencies .
And in fact if you want to tell yourself that the best way to allocate your development resources is effectively to let your biggest customers “ bid ” on features , well , you can do that too , although you ’ll soon find that the kind of features that big , rich customers want are not the same as the kind of features that the mass market wants , and that feature you put in to handle Baht currency is not really helping you sell Excel to health spas in Scottsdale , Arizona , and in fact what you ’re really doing is letting your sales force pimp out your developers with the sole goal of maximizing their personal commissions .
The path to being Bill Gates , this is not .
Now , let me tell you the second way not to decide what features to implement .
Do n’t do things just because they ’re inevitable .
Inevitability is not a high enough bar .
Let me explain .
Some time during the first year of Fog Creek ’s operations , I was filing away some papers , and realized that I was all out of blue folders .
Now , I have a system .
Blue folders are for clients .
Manila folders are for employees .
Red folders are receipts .
Everything else is yellow .
I needed a blue folder and had run out .
So I said to myself , “ What the heck , I ’m going to need a blue folder eventually anyway , I might as well go to Staples and buy some now . ”
Which was , of course , a waste of time .
In fact when I thought about this later , I realized that for a long time , I had been doing dumb shit ( that ’s a technical term ) simply because I figured that eventually it would have to get done , so I might as well do it now .
I used this excuse to weed the garden , patch holes in the walls , sort out MSDN disks ( by color , language , and number ) , etc. , etc. , when I should have been writing code or selling code , the only two things a startup really needs to do .
In other words , I found myself pretending that all non-optional tasks were equally important , and therefore , since they were inevitable anyway , they could be done in any order !
Tada !
But to be honest , I was just procrastinating .
What should I have done ?
Well , for starters , I could get over my fetish for having file folders all be the right color .
It just does n’t make any difference .
You do n’t have to color - code your files .
Oh , and those MSDN CD - ROMs ?
Toss them in a big box .
PER - fect .
More importantly , I should have realized that “ important ” is not a binary thing , it ’s an analog thing .
There are all kinds of different shades of important , and if you try to do everything , you ’ll never get anything done .
So if you want to get things done , you positively have to understand at any given point in time what is the most important thing to get done right now and if you ’re not doing it , you ’re not making progress at the fastest possible rate .
Slowly , I ’m weaning myself off of my tendency to procrastinate .
I ’m doing this by letting less - important things go undone .
There ’s some nice lady from the insurance company who has been pestering me for two months to get some data she needs to renew our policy , and I did n’t actually get her the data until she asked about the fiftieth time , along with a stern warning that our insurance is going to expire in three days .
And this is a good thing , I think .
I ’ve grown to think that keeping your desk clean is actually probably a sign that you ’re not being effective .
How ’s that for a mortifying thought !
So .
Do n’t do features based on what the sales force has inadvertently promised a single customer , and do n’t do unimportant - slash - fun features first because “ you ’re going to have to do them eventually anyway . ”
Anyway , back on the topic of choosing features for FogBugz 5.0 .
Here ’s how we got our initial prioritization .
First , I took a stack of 5×8 cards , and wrote a feature on each one .
Then I called the team together .
In my experience this works with up to about twenty people , and it ’s a good idea to get as many different perspectives in the room : programmers , designers , people who talk to customers , sales , management , documentation writers and testers , even (! ) customers .
I asked everyone to bring their own list of feature ideas to the meeting , too .
The first part of the meeting was going over each feature very , very quickly and making sure we had a very , very rough common understanding of what the feature was , and that each feature had a card .
At this stage , the idea was not to debate any feature on its merits , or to design the feature , or even to discuss the feature : just to have a vague , rough idea of what it was .
Some of the features for FogBugz 5.0 were things like
Personalizable Home Page
Painless Software Schedules
Track Billable Time
Fork a bug
( 46 others … )
Very vague stuff .
Remember we did n’t need to know at this point how each feature would be implemented , or what it involved , because our only goal was getting a rough prioritization that could be used as the basis to start development .
This got us a list of about 50 big features .
In part two , we went through all of the features and everybody voted on each feature : just a quick “ thumbs up ” or “ thumbs down . ”
No discussion , no nothing : just a real quick thumbs up or thumbs down on each feature .
This revealed that about 14 of the feature ideas did n’t have much support .
I threw out all the features that only got one or two votes , leaving us with 36 potential features .
Next we assigned costs for each of these features , on a scale of 1 to 10 , where 1 was a quicky feature and 10 was a big monster feature .
Here it ’s important to remember that the goal was not to schedule the features : just to separate the tiny features from the medium features from the huge features .
I just went through each of the features and asked the developers to call out “ small , ” “ medium , ” or “ large . ”
Even without knowing how long a feature is going to take , it ’s easy to see that forking a bug is a “ small ” feature while the big , vague “ Personalizable Home Page ” feature was large .
Based on the consensus estimate of costs and my own judgment , we put down prices on all the features :
Once again , it ’s really messy , it ’s not exact , and it does n’t matter .
You ’re not making a schedule today : you ’re just prioritizing .
The only thing that you have to get approximately right is the vague idea that you could do two medium features or one large feature or ten small features in about the same amount of time .
It does n’t have to be accurate .
The next step was making a menu of all thirty proposed features and their “ costs ” .
Everybody on the team got a copy of the menu and was given $ 50 to play with .
They could allocate their money any way they wanted , but they only had $ 50 to spend .
They could buy half - features , if they wanted , or buy double features .
Someone who really liked that Track Billable Time feature could spend $ 10 or $ 15 on it ; someone who liked it a little might only spend $ 1 and hope that enough other people funded it .
Next , we added up how much everyone spent on each feature :
Finally I divided the amount spent by the cost :
And then sorted by this number to find the most popular features :
Ta da !
A list of all the features you might want to do , in rough order of everyone ’s best idea of which features are the most important .
And now you can start to refine .
For example , you can clump together features that naturally belong together , for example , doing software schedules makes billable time easier , so maybe we should either do both or neither .
And sometimes looking down the prioritized list it ’s just real obvious that something is messed up .
So , you change it !
Nothing is carved in stone .
You can even change the prioritization as you go through development .
But what surprised me the most is that the final list we produced was really a very good prioritization for FogBugz 5.0 , and really did reflect our collective consensus about the relative priorities of various features .
Priority list in hand , we set out to more or less work down the list in order until about March , when we plan to stop adding new features and start the integration and testing phase .
We ’ll write specs for each ( nonobvious ) feature right before implementing that feature .
( The nattering scorekeepers of the BDUF / Agile beauty contest are now thoroughly confused .
“ Was that a vote for BDUF ?
Or Agile ?
What does he want ?
Ca n’t he just take sides for once ?! “ )
The whole planning process took three hours .
If you ’re lucky enough to have the ability to release software more frequently than we do , ( see Picking a Ship Date ) , you still need to work down the list in order , but you can just stop and do releases more often .
The good thing about frequent releases is that you can reprioritize the list regularly based on actual customer feedback , but not every product has this luxury .
Mike Conte taught me this system during the planning of Excel 5 , where it only took a couple of hours even with a couple of dozen people in a conference room .
The cool thing was that the roughly 50 % of the features that we did n’t have time to do were really stupid features , and Excel was better because it did n’t have them .
It ’s not perfect , but it ’s better than going to Staples to get blue folders , I ’ll tell ya that .
Women in Tech : 20 Trailblazers Share Their Journeys

Etelos , a provider of open source hosted Web 2.0 applications , has released a beta version of a CRM tool designed to work with Google Apps , a commercial suite of office applications Google introduced last week .
The Etelos product is integrated into Google 's platform .
The application , called " CRMforGoogle , " includes features to customize modules , automate client follow - up , manage tasks , share schedules and manage projects .
It also provides contact - and content - management functionality .
The professional and enterprise editions of CRMforGoogle , when they are launched , will include features to share tasks and contacts , customize the client database and incorporate a public blog or Web site .
Missing Pieces
Etelos is basically a bare - bones CRM application with little functionality around service , marketing or contact center operations .
In its favor , though , it does address the security issue .
" Enterprise customers will have the ability to select the hosting environment for their application and implement any security measures they see fit , " Eric Berto , a marketing specialist for Etelos , wrote in a blog posting .
" Personal and professional customers can rest assured as well .
The hosting environment their data is stored in is secure .
Since the application was built using the Etelos Development Environment and EASE , the English Application Scripting Engine , the data that is transferred is automatically encrypted , " he added .
' Consumerization ' of the Enterprise
Nevertheless , CRMforGoogle is a significant development -- albeit offered by a third - party vendor .
It is indicative of the interest in the market in integrating with Google .
The on - demand platform means that firms will be able to introduce , and subsequently upgrade , applications at a much faster pace than in previous years .
It took Microsoft years to add CRM functionality to its family of productivity applications .
Already , Avaya and Postini have announced partnerships with Google to develop such functionality as e-mail gateways , enhanced security , Google Calendar synchronization and third - party integration with Google Talk , using Google 's APIs ( application programming interfaces ) .
Avaya 's partnership with Google will focus at first on integrating its own IP Office product , which targets small and medium - sized businesses , to Google Apps Premiere Edition .
Given Google 's immense popularity and brand name , analysts expect to see more partnerships and third - party applications introduced in the coming months .
" Etelos has clearly recognized the benefits of integrating CRM with office applications , " Rebecca Wettemann , vice president of Nucleus Research , told CRM Buyer .
" We 'll continue to see offerings in this area both from CRM vendors and from others like Invisible CRM that ease user adoption by blurring the line between desktop applications and CRM , " she added .
Etelos has seized upon a trend that is impacting all sectors of the software industry , Yankee Group analyst Sheryl Kingstone told CRM Buyer : the consumerization of enterprise software .
Users now are driving software procurement and adoption , she said , adding , " and the users love Google . "
Who Loses ?
The addition of CRM to Google Apps heightens the risk to Microsoft 's dominance on the desktop .
Certainly this first iteration of Google Apps , or for that matter , CRMforGoogle , do not match Microsoft 's level of functionality .
Google Apps , for instance , is missing several important elements in a productivity suite , including presentation or PowerPoint - like capability .
A few more releases by Google Apps -- as well as a release by Google itself of a CRM application -- could change these dynamics especially if Microsoft does not continue to improve its own application .
" Microsoft CRM does have an intuitive user interface , but it will need to make further strides in the integration of Office and CRM -- as well as its on - demand offering -- to effectively compete in this space , " Wettemann stated .
There are other CRM providers at risk from a Google CRM offering , Kingstone said .
" The ACTs of the world -- single - user , instance - based applications -- and SugarCRM stand to lose market share at some point , " she added .
SEVEN years ago , a group of female scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology produced a piece of research showing that senior women professors in the institute 's school of science had lower salaries and received fewer resources for research than their male counterparts did .
Discrimination against female scientists has cropped up elsewhere .
One study — conducted in Sweden , of all places — showed that female medical - research scientists had to be twice as good as men to win research grants .
These pieces of work , though , were relatively small - scale .
Now , a much larger study has found that discrimination plays a role in the pay gap between male and female scientists at British universities .
Sara Connolly , a researcher at the University of East Anglia 's school of economics , has been analysing the results of a survey of over 7,000 scientists and she has just presented her findings at this year 's meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Norwich .
She found that the average pay gap between male and female academics working in science , engineering and technology is around £ 1,500 ( $ 2,850 ) a year .
That is not , of course , irrefutable proof of discrimination .
An alternative hypothesis is that the courses of men's and women 's lives mean the gap is caused by something else ; women taking “ career breaks ” to have children , for example , and thus rising more slowly through the hierarchy .
Unfortunately for that idea , Dr Connolly found that men are also likely to earn more within any given grade of the hierarchy .
Male professors , for example , earn over £ 4,000 a year more than female ones .
To prove the point beyond doubt , Dr Connolly worked out how much of the overall pay differential was explained by differences such as seniority , experience and age , and how much was unexplained , and therefore suggestive of discrimination .
Explicable differences amounted to 77 % of the overall pay gap between the sexes .
That still left a substantial 23 % gap in pay , which Dr Connolly attributes to discrimination .
Besides pay , her study also looked at the “ glass - ceiling ” effect — namely that at all stages of a woman 's career she is less likely than her male colleagues to be promoted .
Between postdoctoral and lecturer level , men are more likely to be promoted than women are , by a factor of between 1.04 and 2.45 .
Such differences are bigger at higher grades , with the hardest move of all being for a woman to settle into a professorial chair .
Of course , it might be that , at each grade , men do more work than women , to make themselves more eligible for promotion .
But that explanation , too , seems to be wrong .
Unlike the previous studies , Dr Connolly 's compared the experience of scientists in universities with that of those in other sorts of laboratory .
It turns out that female academic researchers face more barriers to promotion , and have a wider gap between their pay and that of their male counterparts , than do their sisters in industry or research institutes independent of universities .
Private enterprise , in other words , delivers more equality than the supposedly egalitarian world of academia does .

While footnoted .org does n’t typically spend a lot of time on small companies that are n’t quite publicly traded yet ( indeed , this may very well be the very first post about one ) , the consulting agreement filed by InferX yesterday was too yummy to pass up .
That ’s because the Virigina - based software company , whose site lists mostly government clients , including the Missile Defense Agency , has decided to hire Michael D. " Heckuva Job Brownie " Brown according to an 8 K filed late yesterday .
For his services , which the filing describes as " the development , marketing and presentation of our products to potential government and commercial customers " , Brownie will be paid $ 8 K a month and receive 75,000 options ( @ .50 a pop ) .
He ’ll also get an 8 % commission on any product sales and a 3 % commission on any consulting sales .
In fairness to Brown , he has repeatedly said that he was the fall - guy for the failed response to victims of Hurricane Katrina last year .
The InferX gig is also not Brown ’s first post - Katrina gig , as the NY Times reported back in late August .
Still , it ’s hard to imagine why a company like InferX would want to generate this kind of publicity by hiring such a high - profile guy .

On a separate note , if you did n’t catch Stephen Colbert ’s interview with former GE Chairman Jack Welch last night , you should ( it ’s a two parter and the funnier stuff is in Part 2 ) .
In it , Colbert asks Welch about why there ’s so much talk about CEO pay and Welch says , " There ’s not enough of it " meaning , we have to assume , that most CEOs are not paid enough money .
He then goes on to talk about supply and demand and rolls out the tired old chestnut that because a few high - profile sports stars like Red Sox pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka are paid a lot of money , CEOs should be too .
Then again , what else can you expect from a guy who thought it was OK for shareholders to pay for his dry cleaning and fresh flowers ?
Tomoaki Kurita presides over racks of cellphones lined up outside his shop on a busy sidewalk in Harajuku , Tokyo ’s catwalk of youth street culture where people attracted by the riot of phone options can stop to flip open and fondle the latest models of what the Japanese call keitai .
From behind his busy counter , Kurita giggles when asked about the excitement in America over the arrival of Apple ’s iPhone , which can also be used to download music and surf the Internet .
“ Sounds like business as usual , ” he says .
On the day when stock markets swooned and techies buzzed over Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs ’ long - awaited entry into the mobile - phone market , Japanese consumers could be excused for wondering :
Why the fuss ?
Advertisement
Yes , the iPhone seemed to reaffirm Apple ’s ability to wow with design .
Its finger - driven navigation might bring a new level of sophistication to the way cellphones operate .
But many Japanese had a harder time buying Jobs ’ line about “ reinventing ” the phone .
“ Every once in a while , a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything , ” Jobs said as he unveiled the iPhone on Tuesday at the Macworld Conference & Expo in San Francisco .
But the revolution is already well underway in Japan , where cellphones are used for everything .
Besides downloading music and surfing the Net , Japanese use their cellphones to navigate their way home by global positioning system , to buy movie tickets and to update personal blogs from wherever they are .
They have been a natural extension of daily life here for the last few years , spurred by Japan ’s decision to be the first country to upgrade to third - generation mobile - phone networks , or 3G , which increase broadband capabilities and allow for better transmission of voice and data .
Advertisement
Apple ’s iPhone , by comparison , will operate on a second - generation network .
It was 3G that sparked the boom in music downloads that makes it common for phones to be used as portable digital music players here .
And it is 3G that has led the Japanese into a world where they can watch live TV on their phones and use them as a charge card to ride trains or buy milk at the corner store or take a taxi .
Ticket Pia , Japan ’s major entertainment ticketing agency , has been selling e-mail tickets to cellphones since October 2003 .
The phones also can be used to conduct conference calls among as many as five people .
Another widely used 3G feature enables users to point cellphone cameras at bar codes and be directed to websites .
For example , every seat in the Chiba Lotte Marines baseball stadium has a bar code , which takes a cellphone to a special home page where users can subscribe to get “ inside ” information and columns not available on the regular team site .

Also , every Marine game can be watched , live , on a phone .
As with other Japanese baseball clubs , cellphones can be used to buy tickets .
Teams have examined the possibility of installing turnstiles that would allow ticket holders to enter stadiums by swiping their cellphones across the terminal .
That technology is already used at some movie theaters .
And cellphones can be loaded with prepaid credit and then be swiped at terminals to allow access to Japanese trains .
Most observers contend the U.S. has begun to close the gap on mobile - phone use with Japan , South Korea and Europe .
Music downloads by cellphone are rising in the U.S.
The long - term threat to iTunes ’ commanding lead in downloads was a major force behind Apple ’s entry into mobile phones .
Other functions are on the way .

“ We plan to introduce one - way videoconferencing in the U.S. this year , ” said spokeswoman Melissa Elkins of LG Electronics MobileCOMM .
The function would allow one person to be visible to another caller over a cellphone .
Two - way videoconferencing has already been available in South Korea for about 18 months , Elkins said .
But the biggest difference between the U.S. and countries like Japan is not the array of bells and whistles on cellphones but the cultural differences the keitai has created .
Keitai form a cyber social network in a highly mobile society .
To wait for a light on a Tokyo street corner or to ride a train is to see crowds of people with their heads down , thumbs pumping as they send photos , write text messages or play online games on their phones .
Increasingly , they are reading books and manga , or comic books , on their phones too .
The keitai has also become an extension of personality .
There is software to create a personalized home page for a cellphone .
Young men and women customize their phones by hanging tiny dolls off them and covering them with stickers and paints .

“ I like it because it ’s cute , ” says Mami Nawa , 23 , as she shows off the dial pad she has painted in purple and pink tones .
“ And with my long nails , the paint gives me a better feel for the phone . ”
Nawa spent about $ 170 on her sharp phone , and $ 25 more to decorate it , though she says some friends spend much more on decorations .
But neither she nor her friend Makiko Yamada , who are sampling the phones in Harajuku , would ever pay anything close to $ 500 for a cellphone .
A hundred dollars , tops , Yamada says .
Apple might find it hard to lead a revolution with iPhone priced as an elite gadget .
Like other Japanese consumers , Nawa and Yamada pick and choose the functions they want .
They do n’t use their phones as charge cards -- known here as the “ wallet function . ”
But they check train schedules and have made hotel reservations with their phones .
They keep their music on their phones and subscribe to daily e-mails that deliver news headlines and daily fortune telling .
They use their phones to shop on online sites and bid in online auctions .

It ’s a dynamic market .
After buying mobile company Vodafone ’s Japanese operations , the Internet company Softbank Corp. has made a splash with a campaign claiming to offer significant savings for customers who switch to its service .
That process has been made easier by industry changes allowing customers to take their phone numbers with them when they switch carriers .
Softbank ’s ad campaign features actress Cameron Diaz .
Across Japan , Diaz stares out from posters and billboards , a Softbank phone pressed to her ear .
In TV ads , she stumbles down a street , struggling to keep her phone to her ear .
Diaz is talking .
Not watching TV or shooting digital video or checking her horoscope .
Just talking .

According to TechCrunch , Apple is sending cease and desist letters out to bloggers for hosting a script that makes a Palm into a fake iPhone .
According to Paul Brien Apple ’s legal goons demanded he take down the screenshot and the link to the file .
I ’ve decided to go ahead and post both in hopes I get a fancy letter in my inbox .
I really doubt I will .
It ’s karma I never get picked on anymore .
FOUR DAYS before this month ’s special election in San Diego County to replace imprisoned former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham , Republican strategists back in Washington were worried .
In addition to voter discontent with GOP leadership and the looming shadow of scandal dominating the campaign , Democrats appeared to enjoy yet another advantage : More absentee ballots were being submitted by Democratic voters than by Republicans .
The advantage did not last long .
Jolted to life , the GOP machinery revved into high gear as activists poured into the district .
They scoured the party ’s computer database for sympathetic voters who had requested absentee ballots but had not yet submitted them , knocked on their doors and called them on the phone .
Suddenly , thousands of additional votes had been secured , and by election day , the GOP had turned around a costly deficit — with 10,000 more Republicans than Democrats voting absentee .
That final flurry of absentees , along with other forms of voter targeting , contributed to a surprising GOP victory that cut through the heart of the Democrats ’ broader 2006 election strategy .
Rather than using Cunningham ’s criminal role in a lobbying scandal to turn the special election into a preview of how they could translate a “ culture of corruption ” into a national revolution in November , Democrats watched in disappointment as a Republican lobbyist won the race — and as the Democratic candidate performed barely better than presidential nominee John Kerry had in that same district two years before .
The results in the 50th Congressional District did not merely illustrate the potential inadequacy of the Democratic strategy for the November elections ; they foreshadowed a much bigger and more startling story line :
That even in the face of Republican scandals , sour approval ratings , the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and growing public rejection of President Bush ’s policies in Iraq , the Republican Party still holds the lead in the art and science of obtaining power — and keeping it .
The fact is that over two or three decades , the GOP has painstakingly built up a series of structural advantages that make the party increasingly difficult to beat .
And in the last five years , it has strengthened its hold under President Bush and his political guru , Karl Rove .
Democrats need a net gain of 15 seats in the House and six in the Senate to take power .
And Republicans may well suffer some setbacks .
But if the GOP retains control of Congress despite such a gloomy political climate — or even if it keeps control of just one chamber and narrowly loses the other — party leaders can rightfully argue that their long - term goal of constructing a lasting political majority remains viable .
The Republican fortress has many underpinnings , such as gerrymandered congressional districts that favor the GOP , an intellectual infrastructure that churns ideas through conservative think tanks and media , an ever - stronger political and policy - based alliance with corporate America , and the most sophisticated vote - tracking technology around .
Some of the GOP advantages are recent developments , such as the database called Voter Vault , which was used to precision in the San Diego County special election .
The program allows ground - level party activists to track voters by personal hobbies , professional interests , geography — even by their favorite brands of toothpaste and soda and which gym they belong to .
Both parties can identify voters by precinct , address , party affiliation and , often , their views on hot - button issues .
Democrats also use marketing data , but Voter Vault includes far more information culled from marketing sources — including retailers , magazine subscription services , even auto dealers — giving Republicans a high - tech edge in the kind of grass - roots politics that has long been the touchstone of Democratic activists .
As a result , Republicans have moved well ahead of Democrats nationally in their ability to find previously unaffiliated voters or even wavering Democrats and to target them with specially tailored messages .
Voter Vault , although it is a closely guarded GOP trade secret , is nevertheless easily accessible to on - the - ground campaign workers and operatives should they need to mobilize votes in a hurry .
One suburban African American woman in Ohio , for example , told us that though she tends to vote Democratic , she was deluged in 2004 with calls , e-mail messages and other forms of communication by Republicans who somehow knew that she was a mother with children in private schools , an active church attendee , an abortion opponent and a golfer .
The database was honed and expanded after the 2000 election recount , when strategists such as Rove and Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman vowed that they would never again permit Democrats to outperform the GOP in a national campaign .
Mehlman , who worked in Bush ’s first term as White House political director , used the months following the recount to study the Democrats ’ get - out - the - vote efforts .
“ It was like they had all the planes and the bombers , and we had horses , ” Mehlman said , referring to the Democrats ’ once - superior ability to harness labor union activists and other liberal groups to reach voters and get them to the polls .
The new - and - improved GOP database helped Republicans begin to peel away select pieces of the old Democratic base , such as politically conservative and pro-Israel Jews , as well as socially conservative blacks , Latinos and blue - collar workers .
In Cleveland , Republicans in 2004 compiled a list of Russian - speaking Jewish immigrants who they knew backed Bush ’s stance against Islamic terrorism , then organized a rally entirely in Russian on the Sunday before the election .
Bush and other Republicans have also sought support from highly influential African American pastors , who are gaining power in swaying votes .
The courtship of the pastors has come in part through a special office in the White House devoted to funneling government money to church - based social service organizations — a program that has drawn enthusiastic support from black churches that have , in turn , provided GOP candidates entree into terrain long dominated by Democrats .
Although Bush ’s national performance among blacks did not increase by much between 2000 and 2004 , there were significant increases in key areas .
In Ohio , a 7 - percentage - point rise among black voters for Bush created the cushion he needed to carry that pivotal state and secure reelection .
Perhaps more than any other administration , the White House of George W. Bush has mastered the art of mixing politics and policy and keeping track of how federal government decisions can affect even obscure local elections .
Rove , with a broad portfolio and extraordinary influence , introduced a new political doctrine , effectively putting the federal bureaucracy and the bully pulpit of the White House in the service of GOP political ends .
All administrations are political , of course .
But never before has the White House inserted electoral priorities into Cabinet agencies with such regularity and deliberation .
Before the 2002 midterm elections , for instance , Rove or Mehlman visited with the managers of many federal agencies to share polling information and discuss how policy decisions might affect key races .
In 2002 , Rove told Interior Department officials of the importance of helping farmers in Oregon whose political support was crucial to Gordon Smith , a vulnerable Republican senator .
Within months , perhaps because of Rove ’s exhortations , the agency did just that , supporting the diversion of water from the environmentally important Klamath River for the sake of irrigating farmland .
Thousands of salmon eventually died in the newly shallow waters .
But the senator secured his reelection .
Other pieces of the plan preceded Bush and Rove .
The legendary political genius Lee Atwater masterminded a long - term campaign to redraw congressional district lines , which has given Republicans a long - term edge in House elections that is difficult to reverse .
Some Democrats unwittingly lent a helping hand to this strategy .
Incumbent Democratic members of Congress , along with African American and Latino politicians at the local level , put their party at risk by cooperating in the early 1990s with Republican efforts to redraw the boundaries of electoral districts across the country .
Individual Democrats and black and Latino politicians benefited by winning elections , but the overall result was a stronger Republican grip on legislative seats at all levels .
With Democratic voters packed into urban minority districts , adjacent suburban and exurban districts sent more white conservatives to Washington .
These changes , along with gerrymandering by both parties on the state level , were so pervasive that they left only about two dozen of the 435 seats in the House competitive in any typical election .
This year ’s elections are only one test of the Republicans ’ long - term plan to transform American politics .
Unless Democrats eliminate these structural and strategic deficits , the GOP will continue to govern what has become , in effect , a one - party country .
Author : Google 's Patents Reveal Strategy To Beat Microsoft
According to “ The Google Legacy , '' history is about to repeat itself .
Microsoft today is where IBM was years ago .
And Google is in a position to do to Bill Gates what he did to IBM .
The result could be a new industry kingpin .
Dig deeper into Google , dig into its software and engineering patents and you ’ll find a roadmap for its future , says an author and online systems specialist , who believes the patents also spell bad news for Microsoft if the tech world moves to a new Google - dominated network paradigm .
“ Google really does n’t hide things , ” said Stephen E. Arnold , who has written a book on his one - year odyssey studying the search firm .
“ Bill Gates is basically in the same spot he had IBM in .
IBM was challenged by Microsoft and IBM did n’t understand Microsoft ’s business model .
It ’s history repeating itself . ”
Arnold , author of “ The Google Legacy ” , said in an interview this week , that it appears that Microsoft does n’t understand Google in much the same way that IBM did n’t understand Microsoft 20 years ago .
“ It will be the Googleplex from 2004 to 2020 – a network paradigm , ” said Arnold .
“ It will be enabled by Google ’s approach to innovation . ”
In placing Google ’s patents under microscopic scrutiny , Arnold said he believes Google is not so much protecting its past technology innovation , but is positioning itself for the future with the first stop targeting Yahoo ! ’s Web advertising .
Microsoft will come into its gun sights later .
“ These patents suggest that Google is looking beyond search , possibly targeting such companies as Microsoft , as Google tries to become the leading info tech company of the 21st Century , ” he said .
Arnold has identified 72 patents with Google heritage that were filed during the first six months of 2005 .
That compares with the 47 Google patents he found from 2001 through 2004 .
In Arnold ’s analysis , he said some filings in the patent portfolio point to an accelerated use of high - speed fiber and wireless that could be used to deliver Google technology .
“ Google already has some number of data centers where it ’s good to have high - speed connections , ” he said .
With Wi-Fi currently working its way into communities across the world and with wide area WiMAX ready to be deployed in a big way next year , it could be a natural fit for Google to deliver its technology over these high - speed links , free of charge .
Noting that Google is moving to VoIP via its recently - announced Google Talk , the high - speed connections appear tailor - made for delivering streaming video , Arnold said .
Google is testing Google Wi-Fi in locations near its headquarters in Silicon Valley .
Arnold said China , India and Japan are attractive and ripe for Google to deliver its services over high - speed wireless links .
In a broader sense , Arnold believes Google is building a “ patent fence around search ” technology as the firm moves to codify its unique competitive advantage .
An ultimate goal of the firm is to deliver completely individualized ads to users .
While Google currently dominates Microsoft in search usage and technology , Arnold believes that even Microsoft ’s desktop software dominance is n’t safe from assault from Google .
He notes that Google ’s RTF ( the mechanism in Gmail to add fonts , bullets , colors , etc. to a Gmail message ) feature already implements some 70 percent of the functions of Microsoft Office ; Google Maps has underlying technology that could compete with Microsoft ’s PowerPoint .
Another industry observer , Joe Wilcox , senior analyst at JupiterResearch , believes that Google represents a “ version 2 ” challenge to Microsoft ’s Windows dominance .
“ Version 1 , ” according to Wilcox , was the earlier threat to Microsoft ’s dominance represented by Netscape ’s browser .
“ Windows is threatened again ( by Google ) and in some ways the threat is greater than before , ” said Wilcox .
“ Google is betting on search as the next platform . ”
Wilcox believes there are still some big “ ifs ” in the future of the Google rollout – whether the search firm can execute its business plan well and what Microsoft will do to respond .
Arnold calls the search company ’s universe “ Googleplex ” using the name the company has given to its Mountain View , Calif . headquarters .
Because of its massively parallelized distributed network tied together with very high speed links , the Googleplex as seen by Arnold can be expanded indefinitely .
As it evolves , users on the virtual network wo n’t need to backup , or setup or restore .
Arnold , author of six books and scores of articles on online technologies , has had hands - on online expertise as vice president of electronic business information for Ziff Communications and as a vice president in charge of electronic publishing at the Courier - Journal & Louisville Times Co .
He is head of Arnold Information Technology of Louisville , Ky .

Constantly Study Study best practices , design patterns , refactoring techniques .
Study the libraries and API 's used in your development environment .
Every other day I see re-implementations of methods provided in the java.util .
Collections and java.util .
Array classes .
When you know whats available , you spend less time reinventing off the shelf code .
Study anti-patterns , this helps avoid the most common mistakes .
Master Your IDE Learn every keyboard shortcut in your development environment .
One day , remove your mouse and hide it in your desk .
Learn to use your environment without a mouse .
Spend about 10 minutes every day learning to do something new with your development environment .
When you know it inside and out , you can work more efficiently .
Use your IDE for everything .
Need to write a word doc , write the text first with a text file in your IDE , copy paste ; email too .
Some people even post lists of shortcuts .
Most IDE 's have them in the help pages .
If not there , a quick google can reveal much .
Extend and Customize Your IDE
About every development environment in existence allows you to write extensions and plugins .
You are constantly saying , I wish my IDE could do ... anyway .
Write an extension to it .
If you find yourself writing boring code , write a plugin to do it for you .
" If it 's worth doing once , write a program to do it . "
This is once of the least followed recommendations .
C' , mon , this is your tool , customize it to allow you to work better and faster .
Master Your Environment Much like your IDE , spend some time learning your other tools , your operating system , anything that eats up your time during the day .
If you use ANT for builds , try to learn something new about it .

Learn New Programming Languages
In the " Pragmatic Programmer " , Dave Thomas recommends learning a new programming language every year .
Each language is invented with a different goal in mind .
Each provides a different way of approaching and thinking about a problem .
Next time you are faced with a difficult programming problem , ask yourself how you would solve it using something other than your primary language .
Change the way you think .
Learn New Human Languages
This is an extension of the point above .
Different cultures have different ways of looking at the world .
Learning a language can give a small insight into the culture .
Learning about the culture can help you with the language .
Gaining new ways of looking at the world can give you new insights into approaching problems and developing solutions .
Being a good developer essentially means being good at solving problems .
There are many useful problem solving techniques outside of the realm of programming .
Re-Study Your Basic CompSci
You do n't need to do this constantly but , review this stuff every once and a while .
Sure you know how to write a linked list , b- tree , finite state machine , etc .
When was the last time you did ?
When was the last time you converted an array to a b - tree and back again ?
You might be surprised how quickly you can become rusty .
Refactor Some Old Code Maybe your management wo n't let you refactor old code or check in the refactoring .
Do n't worry about it .
Make a copy and refactor some code from an old project .
By spending time thinking about how to make the code better , you will be more likely to do it right the next time you write new code .
This makes a great programming exercise , its even better if you have some unit tests to verify changes as well .
Learn about refactoring .
I highly recommend Martin Fowler 's book on the subject , " Refactoring " .
Write About Your Code I 'm not just talking about documentation .
Think about if you were trying to explain the code to a novice programmer .
Even though what you write may be considered ' lame ' by some , do n't worry about it .
The process of trying to explain what you 've done will help you to understand it better .
This is really a progression of the ask the duck technique .
If you work in an environment where you can't publish such information publicly , then write it anyway , call it documentation , and pass it around to your fellow programmers .
One key thing is to develop a thick skin about feedback .
You may receive scathing remarks .
Do n't weat it , and do n't respond .
Do n't let your emotions get ahold of you .
Just try to remove the meat of the remark and try to use it constructively .

With the return of the supermodel , one of the hottest models in the 90s , Shalom Harlow is back as the face of Lancomeâ€™s newest fragrance , Miracle Forever .
The Daily reports that the television and print campaign was recently shot in Buenos Aires with photographer and film director Vincent Peters , in collaboration with Ed Lachman , best - known as director of photography for Sofia Coppola ’s Virgin Suicides .
Miracle Forever is a a “ foody oriental ” meant to attract a younger consumer to the Miracle line ( where Uma Thurman was the face ) with three predominant notes : almond flower nectar , blackcurrant and star anis , all not frequently used in women ’s fragrance .
Joining Daria Werbowy as a Lancome face , Shalom seems to be returning to the modeling fold after dabbling in acting and scoring a part in the Kate Hudson hit , How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days .
Miracle Forever will launch in Europe in September and then hitting America in 2007 .

Lieberman was on with Imus this morning and sounded like a man who does n't have a clue about the situation in Walter Reed even though he supports sending more troops over to Iraq .
He then thinks Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley was a fine replacement for Weightman after it was reported that he is part of the urine problem .
Then Joe backs down on that fact .
Simply disgusting .
Holy Joe has the audacity to weasel out of it by using the phrase " mea culpas . "

via Imus Blog --( thanks for the audio )
Lieberman :
We all have responsibilities and I take it very personally because I have supported the war and I continue to believe we have to do everything we can to have it end successfully .
I have a special responsibility and we should all be doing mea culpas .
Battlefield medicine , I ’ve been to battlefield hospitals when I ’ve been over in Iraq , Walter Reed in the main building unbelievable .
Unbelievable heroism by soldiers who have lost limbs and are just devoted to coming back as close to normalcy as they can .
But the other stuff , just crazy and unacceptable and I think you ’re going to see a change now .
Imus :
It would occur to me Senator Lieberman .
Particularly if you were somebody who thought this war was such a wonderful idea as you did .
And continue to support this idiotic exercise and you sit on some of these committees .
That you would have a special responsibility to know what the hell is happening to these kids .
It ’s not enough to say you did n’t know or did n’t ask the right questions .
I mean that ’s why we elected you .
LIEBERMAN : " Well , I think the first thing is to hold people accountable .
And , you know , General Weightman going is a good first step .
The Armed Services Committee ... "
IMUS : " Well , it 's an absurd first step .
He did n't have anything to do with this .
He 's been in charge -- that 's a big scapegoat deal and you know that . "
LIEBERMAN : " Your questions about General Kiley are very good questions , and I 'm going to ask him .
Because this , after all , is the guy that was in charge for a couple years . "
IMUS : " Well , he 's a lying skunk .
He ought to be forced to resign today , Senator . "
LIEBERMAN : " Of course , I do n't have that exact authority .
" ( LAUGHTER )
" But I will tell you that -- I 'm on the Armed Services Committee .
The Armed Services Committee oversees the medical hospitals .
And a group of us on the committee are going out there this afternoon .
And I am going to ask some of the tough questions that you and a lot of
others ... "
IMUS : " See if they 'll let you , Senator Joe Lieberman , walk around without being escorted by four or five of these generals who 've known about this for years . "
LIEBERMAN : " Yes . "
IMUS : " I mean , did you read Dana Priest and Anne Hull story in The Washington Post yesterday , that General Kiley 's been up there testifying before your committee and lying to you , Senator ... "
( CROSSTALK )
IMUS : " ... lying to you and these other people .
He 's lying to you . "
LIEBERMAN : " A lot of that was housekeeping .
I agree .
Look , this is the guy that was on top of the institution .
It is not -- it 's a good sized hospital , but it 's not a city .
And this was
a building that was an important part of that .
So , look , he should have known .
And I believe as this goes on , he 's going to be held accountable .
But I want to figure out what we can do next on this .
Part of this , Don , was that the whole response never lived up to the increasing demand on the Army medical system or the military medical system after Iraq . "
IMUS : " Well , that 's not a good excuse . "
LIEBERMAN : " Well , no , it 's not an excuse .
It 's an explanation that we never put enough money in .
Look , at Walter Reed , there used to be 100 , 150 patients .
They are now up to over 600 and have gone as high as over 800 .
And they have , beyond the paint and the mold and the rodents , which you can fix -- they do n't have enough medical and , particularly , mental health personnel there .
And I would say that on a supplemental appropriations bill , which
is the bill that will come up by the end of this month to fund a lot , including military needs , we ought to put together a rapid emergency program , not just to fix up the buildings , but to fix up the whole darn system .
And that means hiring more people , and particularly means giving more money to the Veterans Administration . "
IMUS : " You know what they ought to do ?

TV news reports in America that showed President George Bush getting a standing ovation from potential voters have been exposed as fake , it has emerged .
The US government admitted it paid actors to pose as journalists in video news releases sent to TV stations intending to convey support for new laws about health benefits .
Investigators are examining the film segments , in which actors pretending to be journalists praise the benefits of the new law passed last year by President Bush , to see if they could be construed as propaganda .
Two of the films are signed off by " Karen Ryan " , who was an actor hired to read a script prepared by the government , according to production company Home Front Communications .
Another video , intended for Hispanic viewers , shows a government official being interviewed in Spanish by a actor posing as a reporter with the name " Alberto Garcia " .
One segment shows a pharmacist telling an elderly customer the new law " helps you better afford your medications " .
" It sounds like a good idea , " the customer says , to which the pharmacist replies , " A very good idea . "
And in some scenes President Bush is shown receiving a standing ovation from a crowd cheering him as he signed the Medicare law , which is designed to help elderly people with prescriptions .
The government also prepared scripts to be used by news anchors .
" In December , President Bush signed into law the first - ever prescription drug benefit for people with Medicare , " the script reads .
" Since then , there have been a lot of questions about how the law will help older Americans and people with disabilities .
Reporter Karen Ryan helps sort through the details . "
The " reporter " then explains the benefits of the new law .
Lawyers from the investigative arm of Congress discovered the tapes as part of an investigation into federal money that was used to publicise the new law .
They will be keen to ascertain whether the government might have misled viewers by failing to reveal the source of the videos , which were broadcast in Oklahoma , Louisiana and other states .
" Video news releases " of this sort have been used in the US since the 1980s , but the way they blur the lines between news and advertising troubles many media experts and campaigners .
The government defended the videos , which Democrats described as " disturbing " .
" The use of video news releases is a common , routine practice in government and the private sector , " a health department spokesman told the New York Times .
VNRs are also used in Europe but a furore surrounding a Greenpeace video package about its campaign to prevent the dumping of Shell 's Brent Spar oil platform sent to British broadcasters some years ago led to new rules clamping down on their use .
Greenpeace 's sophisticated media offensive - including the provision of emotive film footage of its occupation of the platform - resulted in one - dimensional coverage by BBC and ITN , news chiefs admitted at the time .
Guidelines were subsequently drawn up to label video news releases as such - a category which the regular Osama bin Laden videos now fall .

Matthew Garrett expressed frustration with Debian recently , in a blog post that ’s become rather famous .
I ’m of the opinion that Ubuntu could not exist without Debian .
So it ’s absolutely my intention to see that Ubuntu is a constructive part of the broader Debian landscape .
It ’s vital that Ubuntu help to sustain and grow Debian , because it ’s the breadth and strength of Debian which make up the “ shoulders of greatness ” on which we in the Ubuntu community stand when we reach for the stars .
That does n’t mean I ’m naive enough to think this relationship will ever be an easy one , but I would hope that the discussion does n’t turn into one of “ Ubuntu versus Debian ” .
Because it is n’t the case that one of them will succeed and the other fail .
You could only perceive that as an outcome if you assumed that the two have exactly the same goals .
And that ’s where I think a lot of tension is created : it ’s hard to know what Debian ’s goals are .
Those goals are technically articulated in some founding documents but I do n’t believe the specific , detailed nature of those goals is actually matched by the personal goals of many members of the community , or users .
Debian , in many senses , is at that dangerous stage where it ’s a victim of its own success .
Its infrastructure and developer recruitment model are for many people what define Debian , and they have been so successful that a community has been created of people who , drawn together by the same things , nonetheless have subtly different personal agendas and goals .
Those differences are a cause of tremendous stress .
When a flamewar erupts , the notional topic of the flameage is often less relevant than the underlying tension between people ’s true goals .
It ’s hard to come to agreement on how to address a specific issue , if there ’s no agreement on the very high - level goals that everyone is working towards .
Arguments go on forever because one person REALLY wants to see Debian get even more stable on the server , and another person wants to see it get even more cutting edge on the desktop .
One person wants more translation of stable versions of applications , another wants newer versions which are by definition not as well translated .
One person wants fewer architectures , another wants the full power of Debian on a small embedded architecture .
And all of them have every right to BE RIGHT .
All of them , ARE right .
The problem comes if anybody believes that one institution , one product , one single leadership team can synthesise all of that into something which is optimal for EVERYBODY .
It ’s just not possible to deliver one thing which is optimal for two sets of conflicting requirements , let alone those of a thousand or so of the smartest , most passionate , and lets face it most eclectic of the world ’s free software developers .
Debian has almost unlimited capacity for some things , by virtue of its openness and democratic governance .
That is a wonderful thing .
At a time when we all must play to our strengths , many organisations out there would love to have a strength as potent as that .
But openness and democracy come at a price if you have narrow goals .
No one person or institution can bend that democratic forum to its own specific goals , whether they be desktop , server , embedded , global , local or whatever .
Debian , like any institution or product , cannot be all things to all people .
It can also not be perfect for one group at the expense of another .
To me , this is the real joy of Debian – it can provide a forum for almost every part of the free software world to come together to hammer out differences and find common ground to the extent that common ground exists .
It ’s a level playing field – independent of company agendas or technical historical baggage .
Debian is the Tibetan Plateau of the free software landscape – elevated through the grinding efforts of conflicting passions to the point of forcing those who visit to get along in a somewhat rarified atmosphere .
It can be difficult to breathe up there , sometimes :-) .
It ’s a bit like the Linux kernel itself : show up , with code , and take your place at the table .
And the results are spectacular – Debian as a community creates what I believe is one of the great digital artistic works of the era , and frankly comes as close as I can think possible to actually delivering something that does meet all those conflicting agendas and goals .
Consider Sid .
Yes , it breaks your toys now and then , but by and large it represents an extraordinary achievement – pretty much the latest releases of the upstream communities , packaged and categorised .
Nothing else , from Ubuntu or Red Hat or Novell ( or Microsoft ) comes anywhere close .
Debian Developers are at their happiest running and working on Sid – a recent survey found that something like 76 % of Debian users run Sid , while only something like 6 % of Ubuntu users run the equivalent beta code .
And remember , Ubuntu only has an Edgy or an Edgy + 1 because of Sid .
When I look at the ebb and flow of discussions on the Debian mailing lists , I see that Sid is in fact where the very best of Debian comes forth .
It ’s forward looking , it ’s focused on the next generation , it requires exceptional skill and up to date technical knowledge to participate , and it ’s not subject to the same political tradeoffs that are inevitable when dealing with releases , architectures , dates , deliverables , translation , documentation and so on .
There are very few flamewars about Sid .
If Debian were a business , now would be the time for a careful review of strengths and weaknesses , and perhaps for a plan to focus the resources of the organisation on the things it does best .
There ’s nothing wrong with cutting goals .
Jane , the COO at Canonical , keeps me on the straight and narrow with a fairly regular pruning of Canonical ’s focus points too :-) .
Every conflicting goal sucks resources from the overall cohesiveness and strength of the group .
If there is no consensus in the community , and the leadership do n’t think they can get consensus , then it might be better to cut out those conflicting goals altogether .
To my mind , the two things that Debian developers absolutely agree on are first , the uncompromising emphasis on free software , and second , the joy of Sid .
If I was to try to resolve the bickering and frustration that I see evident in the community , that ’s where I would direct the focus of my efforts .
Of course , that ’s a tough approach , and leaves many other goals for other people and other communities .
But it ’s where I think Debian , and DD ’s , would be most productive and ultimately happiest .
There are many things that Debian does brilliantly – celebrate that , focus on it , and trust that others will fill in the gaps .
By contrast with Debian ’s Plateau , Ubuntu is a cluster of peaks .
By narrowing the focus and allowing the KDE , Gnome and server communities to leverage the base of Debian without treading on one another ’s toes , we can create a K2 , and a Kangchenjunga and a Lhotse .
Ubuntu ’s peaks depend on the plateau for their initial start , and their strong base .
Ubuntu needs to be humble about its achievements , because much of its elevation comes from Debian .
At the same time , Ubuntu can be proud of the way it has lifted beyond the plateau , drawing together people with specific goals to raise the bar and deliver specific releases that meet ambitious , but narrow , goals .
Many people have asked why I decided to build Ubuntu alongside , or on top of , Debian , rather than trying to get Debian to turn into a peak in its own right .
The reason is simple – I believe that Debian ’s breadth is too precious to compromise just because one person with resources cares a lot about a few specific use cases .
We should not narrow the scope of Debian .
The breadth of Debian , its diversity of packages and architectures , together with the social equality of all DD ’s , is its greatest asset .
So , what ’s to be done about the current furore ?
A little introspection is healthy , and Debian will benefit from the discussion .
Matt is to be credited for his open commentary – a lesser person would simply have disengaged , quietly .
I hope that Matt will in fact stay involved in Debian , either directly or through Ubuntu , because his talent and humour are both of enormous benefit to the project .
I also hope that Debian developers will make better use of the work we do in Ubuntu , integrating relevant bits of it back into Debian so as to help uplift some of those other peaks – Xandros , Linspire , Maemo , Skolelinux and of course Etch .
And most of all , I hope that Debian will start to appreciate its strengths even more , and to play to them , rather than dividing itself along the lines of its weaknesses .
Debian / rules , remember ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Two Presbyterian ministers were among 71 people arrested during a series of peaceful protests against the Iraq war Tuesday , said a spokeswoman for a group participating in the protests .
Demonstrators held sit-ins , prayer services and sing - alongs at four locations in the Capitol complex , including the central atrium of the Senate Hart Office Building .
The demonstrations were reminiscent of the Vietnam era , with protesters strumming guitars , singing peace songs , holding flowers and wearing hats made of balloons .
( Watch war protesters face the music -- 1:28 )
Senate staffers watched the demonstrators from their offices .
Protesters said that several workers gave them a thumbs - up or other signs of approval .
( Watch how the protests are part of a highly charged day in Washington -- 2:23 )
" We are trying to protest a lack of civil liberties and to try and end a war culture , " said protester Alex Bryan of New York .
Thirty - three of those arrested were charged with unlawful conduct inside the Hart Building , said Sgt. Kimberly Schneider of the Capitol Police .
Thirty - eight more demonstrators were arrested at separate protests near the Capitol , she said .
Of those , 23 were charged with crossing a police line and 15 were charged with demonstrating without a permit .
All of those arrested were cooperative with police , Schneider said .
The National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance , which has organized dozens of anti-war protests around the country , coordinated Tuesday 's effort , which included several religious and secular groups .
Among those arrested during the demonstrations were two Presbyterian ministers , a Catholic activist and a member of a Quaker group , said Jennifer Kuiper , spokeswoman for The Declaration of Peace , one of the groups participating in the protests .
Both groups apparently expected participants to be arrested .
On a notice posted at The Declaration of Peace Web site , the protests are described as an " interfaith religious procession around the Capitol , followed by peace presence and nonviolent resistance , including risking arrest at the U.S. Senate . "
The National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance Web site adds , " Those willing to engage in nonviolent acts of civil resistance against the war and occupation are encouraged to join us .
We also enthusiastically call upon those who cannot risk arrest , but who are willing to support those who do . "
Despite a rising tide of war opposition , the protesters said they represent no party or political movement .
Baptist minister Jamie Washam of Wisconsin , who led an interfaith service during the protests , said she is adamantly opposed to the war .
" My congregation wants peace , " she said .
" And I think it 's an offense to God . "
Tuesday 's events in Washington were part of 375 protests and other activities being held around the country this week in opposition to the war , according to The Declaration of Peace .
There were hundreds of arrests in a protest organized by the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance a year ago .
On September 26 , 2005 , 371 people were arrested during the " Resist and Remember " protest in Washington , one of the organization 's founders , Gordon Clark , wrote in an online article .
Of those , 104 were arrested at the White House for refusing to leave after being denied an audience with President Bush , Clark wrote .
The changes at Degania , which was founded where the Sea of Galilee meets the river Jordan , were agreed by a vote and come after a one - year trial in which residents for the first time received private salaries .
In the past the 320 members of the kibbutz saw their salaries paid into a communal account and then received free services and an allowance based on need , usually determined by the size of their families .
In future they will be paid varied salaries based on ability not need and , most importantly , they will be allowed to keep them .
In return they will have to pay for services such as electricity and water and they will have to pay a progressive income tax into the kibbutz which will be used to support the least well off .
Although some have objected to the changes , the vote was carried by 85 % and represents a trend throughout Israel 's kibbutz movement .
Around two - thirds of the country 's 230 or so kibbutzim have adopted similar privatisation plans in recent years , an attempt to hold on to their community lifestyle in the face of the influence of the outside world .
" I feel sad and in a way I am nostalgic for the traditional kibbutz , but I have to realise that I am nostalgic for my dream of a community that I had before I came , " said Allan Shapiro , 79 , a retired university lecturer in law and political science and a long - time resident of Degania .
" We depended on loyalty to the community and ideology to take the place of the market , " he said .
" The socialist part was really sort of minor here .
The important thing was that there were Jews working the land with their own hands and if there was a search for anything it was a search for community . "
Mr Shapiro moved to Degania from New York in 1955 and married the daughter of one of the founders of the kibbutz .
A year ago he and his wife were opposed to the changes , but they voted in favour of the new system on Saturday .
In the past few decades there has been a gradual relaxation of the original communal ideals .
Residents have paid for their own electricity for some years , since it was a way to cut costs .
Not all members of the kibbutz still work the land , and many are employed outside in industry and business , until now contributing their high salaries back into the coffers of the kibbutz .
The communal dining room now serves only lunch and only a small number regularly attend .
Mr Shapiro 's son , who is now a judge in Haifa , has left the community .
" What we have done is to allow the market to take the place of the idealism , " Mr Shapiro said .
" I think the search for community still exists .
It is still the basic concept . "
He said the test for the future would be holding that community together .
Degania was established as a commune in 1910 by 10 men and two women on land that had been bought for the Jewish National Fund .
The pioneers wrote of their project : " We came to establish an independent settlement of Hebrew labourers , on national land , a collective settlement with neither exploiters nor exploited - a commune . "
Soon they invited to live with them Aharon David Gordon , a Zionist ideologue who promoted an idea known as " religion of labour " and Degania began to acquire a fabled position in the kibbutz movement .
The first child born into the kibbutz was Moshe Dayan , the Israeli general who lost an eye in the second world war , led the Israeli forces during the Suez Crisis and became defence minister during the 1967 war .
On the kibbutz they farmed avocado , bananas and dates , and ran a dairy farm and a small industrial tools factory .
The movement is by no means finished .
There are around two dozen new kibbutzim , usually established by young Israelis and often not agricultural but based in urban areas .
" In order to recreate a Jewish character you had to reshape Jewish society and the kibbutz was going to do this , " said Henry Near , 77 , who left London in 1955 to join a kibbutz near Nahariya and went on to write a history of the kibbutz movement .
His kibbutz , Beit Haemek , began to privatise itself several years ago .
" It works for those who want it to work .
But people have become disillusioned or affected by the general zeitgeist .
It is not easy to live on a kibbutz any more . "
Backstory
The Hebrew word kibbutz means " collective " or " gathering " .
A kibbutz is a collective settlement in which all members own a share of the wealth .
After living costs are disbursed and health and welfare provided , any profits are reinvested into the settlement .
Today there are around 268 kibbutzim in Israel , where more than 117,000 people live .
Most were founded before Israel was created in 1948 .
Where once they were largely agricultural , increasingly their residents work in industry and business , often employed off - site .
Hired labourers , frequently
Thai workers , carry out menial tasks .
Degania , the first kibbutz , founded in 1910 , has become the latest to start paying salaries and charging for services .
A report published last week by the British Medical Association suggests that there has been a steady increase in mental health disorders among children between five and 16 years old .
Today , 9.6 % of them - very nearly one in 10 - suffer from psychological problems that are " persistent , severe and affect functioning on a day - to - day basis " .
Roughly " 1.1 million children under the age of 18 ... would benefit from specialist services " .
I do n't think it would be an exaggeration to describe this as a social catastrophe .
What is going on ?
The BMA is n't sure .
It suggests that diet may be a factor , in particular a possible deficiency of Omega 3 fatty acids ( an issue I discussed in last week 's column ) .
It notes that while there has been no increase in the number of 11 - to 15 - year - olds who drink alcohol , consumption among those who do has doubled in 14 years .
It found that children living in poverty were much more likely to develop disorders than those with richer parents .
But as child poverty is falling , you would expect this to mean that psychological problems were declining .
The BMA also points to changing family lives .
But another report on the same issue , published by the Nuffield Foundation in 2004 , found that " marked changes in family type ... were not the main reason for rising trends in behaviour problems " .
The same study contains one of the most arresting statements I have ever read : " Rises in mental health problems seem to be associated with improvements in economic conditions . "
As our GDP increases , we become more disturbed .
Among other possible causes , it blames rising pressures at school , changing relationships with other children , and a decline in the limits and rules set by parents .
But all these , it admits , are " untested hypotheses " .
As anyone 's guess is as good as anyone else 's , I feel justified in hazarding one of my own .
I accept that this a complex problem , and that there are doubtless many causes .
But I propose that one of them is Willy Loman syndrome .
Willy Loman is the hero of Arthur Miller 's play Death of a Salesman .
He is torn apart by the gulf between his expectations - the promise held out to everyone of fame and fortune - and reality .
Even as his modest powers decline and his career falls apart , he believes that he can still be No 1 .
This used to be called the American dream .
Now it is everyone 's nightmare .
A survey published in April by the economist Tom Hertz showed that the United States has one of the lowest levels of intergenerational mobility in the rich world .
A child born into a poor family has a 1 % chance of growing up to become one of the richest 5 % , while a child born into a wealthy family has a 22 % chance .
Another study , published by Business Week , found that in 1978 23 % of adult men whose fathers were in the bottom quartile made it into the top quartile .
In 2004 the figure was 10 % .
But reality and public perceptions are travelling in opposite directions .
A poll for the New York Times published in 2005 showed that 80 % of respondents thought it was possible for poor people to become wealthy by working hard .
In 1983 the figure was only 60 % .
Hertz noted that " among high - income countries for which comparable estimates are available , only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States " .
In April the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published a study showing that UK citizens in their 30s today are twice as likely to be stuck in the same economic class as their parents than people born 10 years earlier .
Here too , declining mobility is accompanied by rising expectations .
In January the Learning and Skills Council found that 16 % of the teenagers it interviewed believed they would become famous , probably by appearing on a show like Big Brother .
Many of them saw this as a better prospect than obtaining qualifications ; 11 % of them , it found , were " sitting around ' waiting to be discovered ' " .
The council claimed that the probability of being chosen by Big Brother and of becoming rich and famous as a result is 30 million to one .
But the promise held out to us is that it can happen to anyone .
The teenagers seemed to believe it can happen to everyone .
And this is surely how much of our economy now works .
A vast industry is devoted to selling people images of themselves that bear no relation to reality .
The most obvious of these ( this is hardly an original point ) is the celebration of extreme thinness just as childhood obesity becomes an epidemic .
The headline on this month 's edition of the girls ' magazine Sugar is " Get this Bikini Body with no effort " .
Most pages are devoted to either bodies or celebrities .
A feature on Theo Walcott 's partner , Melanie Slade , shows how she is about to exchange her modest life for mansions , sports cars , health spas and shopping in Bond Street .
Its drawing of a typical " celeb wedding " contains an enclosure for " ugly relatives " .
A fat woman is being hosed with fake tan by a makeup artist , who is " trying to make the uglies photogenic " .
A couple of readers seek to rebel against these impossible dreams , but they are slapped down .
" After reading ' How to be sexy by Christina Aguilera ' " , one girl writes , " I realised : how can a girl say she 's individual , but look plastic ? "
The letters editor replies : " She has an individual approach to fashion , image and attitude - which is why we think she 's fab . "
Another letter asks : " Why is a celeb always on the cover of Sugar ?
People who are n't celebrities are people , too , and readers would respond better to seeing their mate 's older sister than a star who they wish they were ! "
She 's told : " We 've done our research and most of you 'd prefer to see a celeb on the cover . "
One of the conditions that is growing fastest , the British Medical Association says , is self - harm : cutting or burning yourself , pulling out your hair , swallowing poisons .
It is commoner in girls than in boys : one survey found that 11.2 % of girls had committed an act of this kind .
If girls are attacking or seeking to erase their bodies , it is surely because they have been taught to hate them .
The gulf between what we are told we should be and what we are is growing .
As children 's expectations lose contact with reality , they are torn between their inner lives of fame and fortune and the humdrum reality their minds no longer inhabit .
Advertising ( and the businesses supported by it ) is not the clattering of the stick in the swill bucket that Orwell perceived as much as the carrot that keeps the donkey moving .
You are never allowed to come close enough to eat , however hard you pull .
An economy driven by dissatisfaction could scarcely fail to cultivate mental illness .

Plants and animals living in warm , tropical climates evolve faster than those living in more temperate zones , a new study suggests .
The finding , detailed in the May 2 issue of the journal for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could help explain why rainforests have such rich biodiversity compared to other parts of the planet .
A census of all the plants and animals around the world would reveal that species richness is uneven : it is highest in the tropics , the regions of Earth near the equator , and lower the closer one goes toward the planet 's poles .
What 's going on
To investigate the reasons for this trend , Shane Wright of the University of Auckland , New Zealand , and colleagues looked at the rate of molecular evolution for 45 tropical plants and compared it to that of related species living at more temperate latitudes .
The researchers examined the rate at which DNA bases in the plants ' genetic code are substituted .
Like characters in a four - letter alphabet , bases are DNA molecules arranged to spell out instructions for building proteins .
If one of the letters — A , T , G or C — become substituted with another , the instructions can change and a dysfunctional or entirely new and useful protein can be produced .
The researchers found that tropical plants had more than twice the rate of base substitution compared to their temperate cousins .
How it works
The finding supports a theory put forth by biologist Klaus Rohde in 1992 that climate can have a powerful effect on how fast organisms evolve and branch off into new species .
Scientists think it works like this :
Warmer temperatures speed up metabolism by allowing chemical reactions to occur at a faster rate , but this increased efficiency comes at a price : it produces higher quantities of charged atoms or molecules called " free radicals , " which can damage biological molecules like proteins and so - called " nucleic acids " such as DNA .
Higher metabolism also speeds up DNA replication , which is just another chemical reaction , and this can increase the number of copying mistakes that can occur .
Together , damage to DNA by free radicals and replication mistakes could result in mutations that , over time and through natural selection pressures , can form new species .

Introduction to the Photoshop Curves Command
originally written for the GurusNetwork.com
Fundamentals of a powerful tool for improving the color and contrast of digitized photos .
( Covers RGB and Grayscale ; CMYK and detailed print - related issues are beyond the scope of this piece )
[ This is a long one .
For your own comfort and safety , please insure an adaquate quantity of nourishment and caffinated beverages ; please designate a trusted loved one to force quit the computer if you ’re not out by tomorrow …]
I ’m going to start this essay with a provocative statement :
Anyone who is , or wants to be doing image editing at a professional level needs to be as comfortable with Curves as they are with breathing .
Is that bold enough ?
Do I have your attention now ?
If I were forced to give up all but one image adjustment tool , the one I would keep would be Curves .
Think of Curves as your one –stop–shopping source for improving images the way the pros do .
Let ’s clear up some misconceptions right away :
Curves are not a filter
Curves are not hard to understand
Mastering Curves will make you dramatically more productive
Curves will not make you more attractive to the opposite sex
There is a proliferation of photographs now such as the world has never seen before .
If you get an image from an experienced digital photographer or a reputable service bureau , chances are you can confidently use it as is .
But many images you will run across have poor contrast or an objectional color cast .
If it came from a PhotoCD , or the HR secretary ’s consumer level digital camera or scanner , or from the local one –hour minilab or from your well –meaning Uncle Bud , or from one of the many free graphics sites on the internet — well , chances are very good you are going to have to improve it before you can use it .
Even a “ good ” photo often needs to be adjusted to work in a collage , or to intensify a mood .
This essay shows a bias towards Photoshop ( especially the illustrations ) , but a Curves adjustment function is an integral part of every professional image editing package I know of , and is included in the interface of every quality scanner , so even if you do n’t use Photoshop you can still get something useful here .
This essay also does not address using Curves for special effects !!
Although it certainly has its place in the special effects toolbox , this essay is geared towards the folks who do image editing every day , getting photos to look their best .
I ’m a commercial photographer .
Not a day goes by that I do n’t call up the Curves command , and I have yet to do a snazzy metallic over–the–edge logo for pay !
I promise you : Curves will become part of your tool box just like the hammer is in a carpenter’s .
One of the true joys of Photoshop is the many different ways the software offers you for dealing with a problem .
Curves is related to all of the other options in the Image > Adjust menu .
Just because I use Curves the most does n’t mean I have stopped using Levels , or even sometimes Variations ( although I never use Brightness / Contrast or Color Balance anymore ) .
You have tools and you use the appropriate one .
I like curves the most because in one pass you are able to :
Adjust the over - all contrast or tonal range
or tonal range Adjust the LOCAL contrast or tonal range
or tonal range Adjust the COLOR
These changes can be made with with great precision , and can dramatically improve even photos that appear unusable .
So let ’s get on with it !
Where do you find the Curves command ?
Slow way : from the menus at the top of the screen , select Image > Adjust > Curves .
Fast way : command / control+m .
And there you have it .
We ’ll go over the individual components of this dialog as the need arises , but first a few preliminaries .
If your Curves dialog does not have as many grid increments as those shown , try this trick : option / alt click in the grid area .
This does not affect the functionality of the curves in any way , but does help in visualizing the tonal steps .
Also note the two triangles in the middle of the bottom gray scale .
The convention in RGB is to display black at the left and white at the right .
Oddly , the convention for CMYK is exactly the opposite !
To avoid confusion , I recommend you set yours to the way I have it - the example curves will make much more sense .
So what ’s the first , most obvious thing you notice ?
There 's NO CURVE !!
What 's up with this ?
The idea behind Curves is all about re–mapping brightness values .
Does that make sense ?
A pixel starts out at a certain brightness , and you change it to be brighter or darker .
Have a look at these simplified versions :
Think of the gray ramp at the bottom as the image ’s tonal values before any changes ; think of the vertical gray ramp as representing what the image ’s tonal values will be changed to .
I hope it ’s clear that the Curves dialog opens as a straight line because you have n’t made any changes yet .
That means that the brightness values before and after are the same .
You will effect a change by changing the shape of the curve !
You accomplish this by clicking once somewhere on the line .
This will establish a “ point ” ; this point can now be dragged to a different place within the grid , which causes that tonal value to change , either lighter or darker depending on whether you drag it up or down .
The reason it ’s a curve is so that the change blends smoothly throught the image .
An abrupt change in value can be very noticeable .
The increasingly gradual change of the brightness values on either side of the change permit a very smooth and believable adjustment .
These next illustrations demonstrate how a certain value is affected by a curve , and how you can start to visualize how the shape of the curve affects tonality .
( Note : I have drawn pretty exaggerated curves for illustration purposes .
Sometimes you need curves this strong , but for many images the curves will be much more gentle .
A little bit goes a long way ! )
Enough already - let ’s get to some pictures !

Critics say the images the station shows incite violence
The United States has privately asked the Egyptian authorities to stop al - Zawraa which is carried on Nilesat - a government - owned TV satellite .
Al - Zawraa broadcasts from a secret location .
Its owner is a former Iraqi MP who now lives in Syria .
Nilesat says it was taken off air because it broadcast on frequencies which interfered with other channels .
Not so , says Mishan al - Jaburi , the owner of al - Zawraa .
He says political reasons were behind the Egyptian decision .
He accused Egypt of bowing to American pressure to stop carrying al - Zawraa .
The channel shows footage of attacks by Sunni groups against US and Iraqi forces .
It also shows images of bloody and mutilated bodies of women and children which it identifies as Sunnis killed by US soldiers and Shia militiamen .
The Iraqi authorities shut down al - Zawraa 's offices in Baghdad last November , accusing it of inciting hatred and instigating violence , but Mr Jaburi said his channel condemned equally all attacks against civilians .
He accused Iraqi government channels of promoting sectarianism .
Al - Zawraa is still being carried by Arab Sat , which is jointly owned by all Arab countries .
Mr Jaburi said he believed his channel was safe there because he said certain Arab countries would resist attempts to silence it .
Proof # 13 - Take a look at slavery
Here are ten passages from the Bible that clearly demonstrate God 's position on slavery : Genesis chapter 17 , verse 12 :
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
He that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised .
In this passage God understands that people buy other people and , quite obviously , is comfortable with the concept .
God wants slaves circumcised in the same way as non-slaves .
Exodus chapter 12 verse 43 : The Lord said to Moses and Aaron , " These are the regulations for the Passover : No foreigner is to eat of it .
Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him , but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it .
God again shows that he is completely comfortable with the concept of slavery and singles out slaves for special treatment .
Exodus Chapter 21 , verse 1 : Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them .
When you buy a Hebrew slave , he shall serve six years , and in the seventh he shall go out free , for nothing .
If he comes in single , he shall go out single ; if he comes in married , then his wife shall go out with him .
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master 's and he shall go out alone .
But if the slave plainly says , ' I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free , ' then his master shall bring him to God , and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl ; and he shall serve him for life .
Here God describes how to become a slave for life , and shows that it is completely acceptable to separate slaves from their families .
God also shows that he completely endorses the branding of slaves through mutilation .
Exodus Chapter 21 , verse 20 : If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result , he must be punished , but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two , since the slave is his property .
Not only does
God condone slavery , but he is also completely comfortable with the concept of beating your slaves , as long as you do n't kill them .
Exodus Chapter 21 , verse 32 : If the bull gores a male or female slave , the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave , and the bull must be stoned .
Not only does God condone slavery , but here God places a value on slaves -- 30 shekels of silver .
Note that God is not sophisticated enough to understand the concept of inflation .
It is now 3,000 years later , and a gored slave is still worth 30 shekels of silver according to God 's word .
Leviticus Chapter 22 , verse 10 : No one outside a priest 's family may eat the sacred offering , nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it .
But if a priest buys a slave with money , or if a slave is born in his household , that slave may eat his food .
Here God shows that the children of slaves are slaves themselves , and that he is completely happy with that concept .
Leviticus Chapter 25 , verse 44 : Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves .
You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country , and they will become your property .
You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life , but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly .
Here God states where you may purchase your slaves , and clearly specifies that slaves are property to be bought , sold and handed down .
Luke , Chapter 7 , verse 2 : Now a centurion had a slave who was dear to him , who was sick and at the point of death .
When he heard of Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and heal his slave .
And when they came to Jesus , they besought him earnestly , saying , " He is worthy to have you do this for him , for he loves our nation , and he built us our synagogue . "
And Jesus went with them .
When he was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying to him , " Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof ; therefore I did not presume to come to you .
But say the word , and let my servant be healed .
For I am a man set under authority , with soldiers under me : and I say to one , ' Go , ' and he goes ; and to another , ' Come , ' and he comes ; and to my slave , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
When Jesus heard this he marveled at him , and turned and said to the multitude that followed him , " I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such faith . "
And when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the slave well .
Here Jesus shows that he is completely comfortable with the concept of slavery .
Jesus heals the slave without any thought of freeing the slave or admonishing the slave 's owner .
Colossians , chapter 3 , verse 22 : Slaves , obey in everything those who are your earthly masters , not with eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing the Lord .
Whatever your task , work heartily ...
Here God shows that he is in complete acceptance of a slave 's position , and encourages slaves to work hard .
This sentiment is repeated in Titus , chapter 2 verse 9 : Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect ; they are not to be refractory , nor to pilfer , but to show entire and true fidelity .
Once again
God shows that he is quite enamored of slavery .
God loves slavery
If the Bible is written by God , and these are the words of the Lord , then you can come to only one possible conclusion :
God is an impressive advocate of slavery and is fully supportive of the concept .
As you can see , these slavery passages present us with an immense contradiction :
On the one hand , we all know that slavery is an outrage and a moral abomination .
As a result , slavery is now completely illegal throughout the developed world .
On the other hand , most Christians claim that the Bible came from God .
In God 's Word , the " creator of the universe " states that slavery is perfectly acceptable .
Beating your slaves is fine .
Enslaving children is fine .
Separating slave families is fine .
According to the Bible , we should all be practicing slavery today .
The intensity of this contradiction is remarkable .
It shows us quite clearly that God is imaginary .
If God were to exist , and if he were playing any role whatsoever on our planet , he would eliminate this connection between himself and slavery .
There is no way that a loving God would allow himself to be perceived as condoning and encouraging slavery like this .
Here is the thing that I would like to help you understand :
You , as a rational human being , know that slavery is wrong .
You know it .
That is why every single developed nation in the world has made slavery completely illegal .
Human beings make slavery illegal , in direct defiance of God 's word , because we all know with complete certainty that slavery is an abomination .
What does your common sense now tell you about a Bible that supports slavery in both the Old and the New Testaments ?
Given the fact that the Bible clearly condones slavery , your common sense should be telling you that God is imaginary .
<<< Proof # 12 | Home | Go to Proof # 14 >>>
Understanding the Rationalizations
Many believers will argue that God had to talk this way in the Old Testament in order to " fit in " with the dominant culture .
This , of course , is silly .
In Christian mythology , God is the one who created humans and human culture .
In addition , a God that condones the beating of slaves and the enslavement of children at any time is an abomination .
A believer might say , " Well , all of those verses are from the Old Testament and no longer apply because of Jesus . "
This line of rationalization prompts several obvious questions .
Why would the Old Testament still be printed in the Bible if Jesus overturned it ?
Why would God EVER tell us to beat slaves ?
The most important thing that this line of rationalization misses is that Jesus specifically states that the laws of the Old Testament still stand .
In Matthew 5:18 Jesus says :
For truly I tell you , until heaven and earth pass away , not one letter , not one stroke of a letter , will pass from the law until all is accomplished .
Then he goes on to say :
Therefore , whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments , and teaches others to do the same , will be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
For I tell you , unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
According to Jesus , the Old Testament is alive and well .
According to Isaiah 40:8 , " the word of our God stands forever . "
The notion that these old testament verses no longer apply is completely untrue according to the Bible .
Christians imagine that they " no longer apply " as a way of rationalizing their religion .
Other believers rationalize that God did not write these slavery passages in the Bible .
The Bible was somehow corrupted by slave - loving men .
In that case , the obvious question to ask yourself is this :
If the Bible has been corrupted , how can we possibly know which parts of the Bible came from God and which parts were inserted by primitive men ?
You have absolutely no way to know .
It is when you start thinking about the Bible in this way that you understand something very important about the Bible .
Either the entire Bible really is God 's Word , or the entire Bible was written by primitive men with absolutely no input from God .
Here is the reason for this very strong dividing line :
If part of the Bible came from God and part came from primitive men , you do not know which is which .
You dod not know if Jesus really is resurrected , or if that 's just a make - believe story inserted by primitive men .
How do you know if God wrote the Ten Commandments or not ?
If any part of the Bible has been polluted by primitive men , you have to reject the whole thing .
There is no way to know who wrote what , so the entire book is invalid .
There really is no middle ground and the Bible has to be an all - or - nothing book .
Either the entire Bible came from God , or none of it did .
With this all - or - nothing reality about the Bible now understood , you can see that there are only two possible explanations for the slavery passages in the Bible : The Bible is right , and God loves slavery .
The entire Bible is God 's word , so these slavery passages must be God 's word too .
The laws in the United States and other modern nations that make slavery illegal defy God 's word .
Justice Scalia would have been promoting slavery in exactly the same way that he promoted the Ten Commandments .
The Bible condones slavery because the Bible was written by slave - owning men , not by God .
God is imaginary .
Chances are that you have a problem with the first explanation .
God would not champion the abomination that is slavery .
We all know that .
Therefore , what you are left with is the second explanation .

3. VIZR by FIXD – Navigate Safely from Your Phone
We ’re all guilty of driving while distracted , and that distraction may be legitimate if you ’re using your phone to navigate .
Fortunately , the days of giant , bulky GPS devices blocking half your windshield are over .
Unfortunately , we replaced them with our phone ’s navigation software and the phone was n’t designed to sit on a car dashboard .
VIZR by FIXD is the perfect solution for this .
Coming from the same company that launched the wildly successful car diagnostic scanner , FIXD , it is a device that turns your phone into a heads - up display without any additional work .
It almost sounds like a sci - fi movie , but the technology is actually quite simple .
The VIZR uses a translucent , reflective glass surface to mirror your phone ’s screen onto an easily viewable display .
All you have to do is attach the mounting plate onto your dashboard , which is held by a strong adhesive .
Then , snap the VIZR into the mount and you ’re good to go .
Once your navigation route is set , simply place your mobile device into the VIZR cradle .
It works on your car right out of the box .
The simple design makes the VIZR completely universal .
Use it in any vehicle and with any smartphone without making adjustments .
Distracted driving is the main cause of accidents , and this type of HUD has the potential to reduce that number significantly .
4. ClearView – Drive Glare - Free With a Flick of the Wrist
Having vision problems , especially while driving , can have a dangerous impact on you or someone else on the road .
However , most people wear contact lenses or glasses , but these can be uncomfortable to wear at times .
And sometimes it can be difficult to see properly at night .
ClearView is a driving aid which includes anti-glare technology and night vision .
This helps drivers to see the road at night or in foggy conditions .
The advanced polarized photochromic lenses enhance contrast and reduce glare , therefore improving your visibility .
You can either wear it on its own or you can wear it over your prescription glasses or contact lenses .
The lenses are also coated with anti-blue ray layers which block out any light from the headlights of other cars on the road .
5. FIXD App – Never Wonder About the Check Engine Light Again
How many times have you taken your car to a mechanic over a ‘ check engine ’ light , and had it turn out to be a simple fix you could have done yourself ?
Worse yet is when you get a ‘ check engine ’ light for a problem that does n’t really affect your car ’s functioning .
You could end up worrying for weeks over nothing .
That kind of thing wo n’t happen again when you get the FIXD app and code reader .
The result of a successful Kickstarter campaign , this little gadget is a godsend for car owners .
It ’s a code reader for your car ’s on - board diagnostics computer .
Professional scanners like this can cost hundreds of dollars , but you can get FIXD for a fraction of that .
Just about any car made after 1996 is compatible with this device .
It ’s a matter of plugging the reader into your diagnostic port ( usually under the steering wheel to the left ) and turn on your car .
Then you download the app to your iOS or Android device and let it link up via Bluetooth with the reader .
The app will detect any error codes and translate them into a brief explanation of the problem .
You can even read about potential causes and solutions in the app , as well as how they can affect your car .
There ’s also a glossary of car light indicators that you might be unfamiliar with .
If there ’s a problem that needs to be addressed quickly , the app can find mechanics in the area and suggest mileage before which you should service the car .
The app keeps a logbook of codes scanned that you can show your mechanic when you take it in for service .
You can even set up maintenance reminders and see the mileage left on wear items such as tires and oil filters .
If a problem needs a certain part , the app will recommend the best fit for your vehicle .
It ’s truly one of the best gadgets out there for peace of mind when you ’re on the road .
6. Type S App – It 's Like Having Eyes In The Back of Your Car
Whether you ’re attempting to parallel park , pulling in or backing up , it ’s now possible to get visual and audio alerts in real - time .
Easily get notified on your smartphone phone when your car approaches an object like other cars , kids , poles , or bikers .
It can detect objects up to four feet away by sending an alert to your smartphone via the Type S app which can be used on all Android and iOS devices .
It has a long battery life and is powered by solar power or can be charged via a USB cable .

The Arabic - language al - Hayat daily newspaper has reported there were " several indications of a plot to copy the Spanish scenario in France " , a reference to the explosions that rocked Madrid in March 2004 .
The London - based daily quoted mainly " messages posted on internet sites close to al - Qaeda carrying threats against France , accompanied by pictures from the campaigns for the presidential elections " , which are slated for April and May .
The Library Vacation ™
By Nick Corcodilos Part 1
People often make the mistake of asking a headhunter , " What new career should I pursue ? "
It 's important to understand why that question will lead a headhunter to hang up the phone .
Headhunters rarely recruit people from one career to another .
Headhunters ' clients would never stand for it .
A headhunter 's clients want the best people who are already doing a particular kind of work to come do it for them .
Consequently , headhunters usually move people within a career domain , not outside it .
Nonetheless , when I offer to let people " ask the headhunter " , this question comes up all the time .
( Too often , people ask it after they 've spent thousands of dollars on career counseling . )
Pack a suitcase for one .
I believe the choice of a new career is a very personal decision .
The best career counselors might give you some food for thought , but I believe that the motivation a person needs to tackle such an enormous , life - altering challenge lies -- almost by definition -- within himself .
The search has to be self - directed .
In other words , you 'll never find what you 're looking for if you let someone else point you toward what he thinks you 're looking for .
If you want to make a profound change in your career , you 've got to buck up , put on a sturdy pair of boots , and go searching on your own .
There 's lots of philosophizing to do on this subject , but I 'd like to suggest one idea that might help you find your own way to the future .
I call this approach to career change The Library Vacation™ .
It 's a little corny , it 's very simple ( though not easy ) , and it 's so obvious that few people ever think to do it .
It 's also incredibly powerful because it is rooted in who you are .
Destination : Off the path .
Take at least three days off and spend them at the library .
( A week is better . )
Go into the periodical stacks .
Forget about job hunting or careers .
( This is the vacation part . )
Read whatever you feel like .
At first , you 'll start with magazines like People , Newsweek , Rolling Stone , foreign newspapers and so on .
Then , you 'll start checking out various specialty and industry - related periodicals .
Just read stuff that attracts you .
The best way to find a new path is to let your motivation lead you .
Leave your skills , your college degree , your experience and your credentials behind .
You can haul them out later , when you need them .
For now , they 're irrelevant .
As you follow your gut , you 'll start to see trends in the sorts of industries and product areas you 're reading about .
That will tell you something : this might be your path ...

Consulting Google Earth can help people work out routes to avoid
As the communal bloodshed has worsened , some Iraqis have set up advice websites to help others avoid the death squads .
One tip - on the Iraq League site , one of the best known - is for people to draw up maps of their local area using Google Earth 's detailed imagery of Baghdad so they can work out escape routes and routes to block .
It 's another example of the central role technology plays in the conflict - with the widespread use of mobile phones , satellite television as well as the internet - by all sides and for many purposes .
For some time now , vigilante - style guard forces have been operating in many neighbourhoods , especially in Sunni areas targeted by Shia militias .
Many Sunnis see the Shia - dominated police forces as just as much of a threat , because of evidence of their involvement in kidnappings .
So part of the job of the local guards is keeping them out .
With Google Earth , the Iraq League website suggests , people can also work out the most likely approach of their attackers .
It 's thought that insurgents have also used the map site , examining the detailed images to pick out potential targets .
' Killed or tortured '
The advice on the Iraq League site - which is actually run from the UK - begins with a warning to avoid being taken in the first place .
" If they arrest you , you will be killed or tortured . "
The key thing is not to fall into the wrong hands
" If they tell you we just have a few questions and you will be back in an hour , do n't believe them .
You will be dead in an hour or disappear for months , " the warning continues .
Who " they " are is rarely spelled out , apart from the occasional mention of Ministry of Interior patrols .
To avoid arrest , people should give security training to relatives , says the site .
If they see any suspicious activity , they should ring the local guard force .
How to blend in
People must change their routes all the time .
" You must get another ID , " the site continues , with non-Sunni names .
Certain names , such as Abu Bakr or Omar are common among Sunnis - but can spell instant death in the hands of Shia death squads .
Anything to distinguish sectarian affiliation should be masked .
Long beards , traditionally associated with devout Sunnis , are out .
Shia men keep beards much shorter .
Sunnis wanting to blend in should do the same , says the survival guide .
Other sites tell Sunnis how they can make people think they are Shia .
They are advised to hang images of well - known Shia figures in their homes and shops , such as Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , Iraq 's most senior Shia cleric , or Imam Hussein , grandson of the prophet Muhammad , whose death at Karbala in the 7th Century Shias mourn every year .
Appeals for help
The Iraq League website has another section displaying calls from relatives for information on missing loved ones .
This is used by both Sunnis and Shias .
" Please help me to find my husband who was kidnapped travelling from Baghdad to Amman , " says one message .
" Gunmen seized him because he is a Shia , but they left my brother and his family because they are Sunni .
Please help me . "
But it happened more than six months ago .
There was also an offer of help to a girl injured in the eye by a mortar attack on her school in Baghdad in late January , an incident widely covered by the media .
" We can provide medical treatment outside Iraq , " the writer said .
Perhaps initiatives like this could also begin the process of restoring peace .
But right now , these sites are focused on survival .
At the end of each school year , when she says goodbye and wishes her students success in high school , Martha Mohulo can't help but worry .
A veteran primary school teacher in Soweto , she knows the dangers lurking in this sprawling , struggling township – perils such as violence , AIDS , and teenage pregnancy .
So when Oprah Winfrey picked eight of Ms. Mahulo 's students to attend her lavish new girls ' academy south of Johannesburg , the teacher was thrilled .
" Those girls who went to Oprah , they are going to be safe , " Mohulo says .
" They are much better off . "
Ms. Winfrey 's school , a $ 40 million project that opened Tuesday , is one of the most recent and high - profile projects in a growing worldwide campaign to improve girls ' education .
Such female - focused aid yields perhaps the highest dividends for developing nations , say experts , though they are quick to point out that boys face challenges as well .
" I think it 's very important for people to recognize that the lack of education for both boys and girls is a crisis in Africa , " says Gene Sperling , director of the Center for Universal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" But the benefits of girls ' education , in terms of improving health , women 's empowerment , and family well - being , probably does make girls ' education the highest - returning social investment in the world . "
The World Bank has found that when a country improves education for girls , its overall per capita income increases and its fertility rate drops .
Other studies show that improved female education is linked to higher crop yields , lower HIV infection rates , and reduced infant mortality .
UNICEF 's annual " State of the World 's Children Report " calls gender equity – particularly in education – a " double dividend " for developing countries .
" With education , the girl child will grow up and be a better mother – she will be better able to understand the importance of her own children being educated , and will be better able to provide for her children , " says Sarah Crowe , a spokesperson for UNICEF in Johannesburg .
" Men and boys are often out of the home , " she notes , so that fathers are less able to teach their children what they have learned .
Why African girls do n't stay in school
Less than half of southern Africa 's girls complete primary school ( 46 percent , compared with 56 percent for boys ) , while 26 percent enroll in secondary school ( 33 percent for boys ) .
Though the statistics for boys are hardly uplifting – 44 million aged six to 11 are denied an education , compared with 60 million girls – girls have long faced more barriers to education than boys .
The reasons are myriad .
In urban areas , pregnancy and poverty limit educational access .
In rural regions , poor families need girls to help in the fields .
When a financially strapped family must chose between sending a son or daughter to school , cultural norms favor the boy .
And across southern Africa , when relatives fall ill from AIDS , girls are the ones who stay home to give care .
Governments and international agencies have recognized this , and are working towards solutions .
The UN Millennium Development Goals call for both gender equity and universal primary education by 2015 .
Many African governments have recently eliminated primary school fees , which have hampered girls ' enrollment .
Now , the challenge is to secure long - term funding , to hire and train enough teachers to manage millions of new students , and to make sure educational quality goes along with access , researchers and aid groups say .
Advocates are also pushing for free secondary education , which they say will further increase girls ' literacy .
David Archer , the head of international education for ActionAid , a nonprofit development group , says he is seeing a new interest in global education from private philanthropies , as well .
Over the past year or so , he says , some two dozen American philanthropies have started international education projects .
Last month , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation announced a $ 60 million effort to improve education in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa .
Winfrey school : Vanity project or shining light ?
The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls , set on 52 manicured acres in the village of Henley - on - Klip , has state - of - the - art classrooms and laboratories , a 600 - seat theater , a library , beauty salon , yoga studio , and Oprah - decorated dorm rooms .
This year , 152 seventh and eighth graders will attend the school ; next year , Winfrey says , it will hold 450 students in Grades 7 to 12 .
Some education advocates have criticized Winfrey 's academy as a " vanity project , " and say her $ 40 million could have been more widely and smartly distributed , while others say that she 's managed to raise more popular attention than has any NGO .
" This school is ... shining a spotlight on girls ' education in Africa , " says Mr. Sperling , who also served as national economic adviser to President Clinton .
" Five years from now , when people see some of these young women on her show just blowing you away , it is going to be a powerful symbol of what the potential of the poorest girls in Africa really is with the same type of educational opportunities that so many of us were lucky enough to be born into . "
Mr. Archer , however , cringes at Winfrey 's project .
" I felt very uncomfortable about it , " he says .
" It 's something where she can have direct control and direct engagement , rather than doing the more important and less personalized work .
That same amount of money could improve the quality of schools no end throughout entire districts and provinces . "
But Winfrey and her supporters defend her targeted largess .
" I think the government has to be very focused on spreading resources evenly , " says Sperling .
" But I think there 's nothing wrong , and a lot right , with a private individual saying , ' I want to do something terrific to give some of the most underprivileged girls in the world the opportunity to be leaders . '
You need both . "
The girls who attend her academy , Winfrey says , will become Africa 's next leaders .
" I know that this Academy will change the trajectory of these girls ' lives , " Winfrey said in a statement this week .
" They will excel and pass their excellence on to their families , their nation , and our world . "
I was thrilled to find out about Pancito today , a simple - to - use Haskell library for functional image manipulation .
In Pancito , images are functions from a Point datatype to a Colour type .
Slow , but fun .
As a quick showcase , this is a simple color filter in Pancito :
module Main where
import Pancito2
import Colour
import Common
import Point
import Reprocess
import System
MainPancito2ColourCommonPointReprocessSystem jamma j c = rgba ( ( r c ) / j ) ( ( g c ) * j ) ( ( b c ) * * j ) ( a c ) get Img fn = readPpm fn square01 white ;
writeImg fno func ws im = ppm square01 ws fno ( func . im ) ; main = do { [ fn , fno , j ] <- getArgs ; y<- getImg fn ; write Img fno ( jamma ( read j ) ) ( snd y ) ( fst y ) ; putStr $ " Applied " ++ j ++ " - level Jamma filter to " ++fn++ " ; written to " ++ fno;}
For convenience , I also wrote a quick shell script that handles conversion from JPEG to PNM and back with NetPBM , and opens original and altered image on OS X’s Preview .
echo " 1. Converting JPG to PNM … "
jpegtopnm $ 1 > t1.pnm
pnmtoplainpnm t1.pnm > t2.pnm
echo " 2. Running Jamma plugin . . "
./ jamma t2.pnm t3.pnm $ 3
echo
echo " 3 . Converting back to JPG .. "
ppmtojpeg t3.pnm > $ 2 && open $ 2 && open $ 1
This is all a horrible hack , but I ’ve only worked in this for half an hour and I ’m excited enough to want to share immediately .
Here ’s a picture of my hand :
original after jamma
Here ’s a NSFW classic in original.jpg and jammaed version .
Sure , from a Haskell viewpoint this is n’t really * that * exciting — it ’s all rather simple — but I ’m very fond of image manipulation , and wrote 30 % of a Pancito - type library before dropping it .
I might just be excited that someone went through the end of it .
It ’s at the very least a good framework for image processing research .

Bowers throws fuel on a fire that was simmering down and lists his argument against impeachment .
I 'll add further fuel with one more argument --
We have one year to make our case for 2008 to the American people .
We need to show not just that we deserve to hold on the Congress , but that we should be given the White House as well .
2008 wo n't work , since as an election year , all meaningful legislative work will grind to a halt and the press will be focused on the horse race ( as will we ) .
So 2007 is it .
We can spend 2007 either pushing impeachment ( which is n't as popular as Zogby claims , see Bowers ' piece ) , or we can use it educating the American people about what a Democratic government would look like -- passing meaningful legislation that would improve their lives like the minimum wage , health care reform , ethics reform , stem cell research funding , policies that help families and the middle class .
Impeachment does none of that .
In a perfect world , we could do all of the above .
But we do n't live in a perfect world .
And the second we start impeachment proceedings , the media will focus on that .
Heck WE'LL focus on that , and the Democratic legislative agenda will fade into the background , ignored .
A perfect opportunity to brand the Democratic Party in a positive light will be forever squandered .
So what is more important , proving that we can govern and making the case for future Democratic majorities ?
Or a high - profile vendetta campaign against Bush ?
It really is just one or the other .
It 's an easy call .
Do n't worry about Bush and company .
Congress will pursue its oversight duties .
Waxman and Slaughter and Conyers and the rest of those guys are n't about to take the next two years off .
People will be held accountable .
Impeachment is n't the old path to accountability .
And Bush ?
He 's going down as the nation 's Worst President Ever .
We do n't need " impeachment " to make that case , Bush has done a great job of it all by himself .
若い世代から蓄積されてきたお肌の疲労は、30代ころから少しずつ現れ始め、40代以降になると、急激に加齢を感じ始めます。
目尻のこじわ、目下のたるみ、しみ、肌荒れ、ほうれい線などが目立つようになる世代でもあります。
このころになって、ようやくアンチエイジングを意識始める人が多いのですが、本来は、もっと早いうちに予防をはっておくべきなのです。
若い世代では、活力に溢れているために自力でなんとか乗り越えられるものの、お肌の疲労は確実に細胞のレベルで蓄積されているのです。
お肌が最も目にとまりやすいので、多くの人はお肌から対策を始めますが、実際女性でもメタボ体形になっている人も多いのではないですか。
これは、若返り成分を生成するホルモンがほとんど生成されなくなるためです。
直接的には紫外線からの刺激を容赦なく浴びていた事が強く影響しているためですが、他にも、暴飲暴食、不規則な生活、ストレスにまみれた生活など、様様な要因が複雑にからまって老け顔を形成していきます。
40代以降のアンチエイジング対策は、予防というよりは、まさに若返り、または修復を意識したものになります。
エステでは、最新機器を活用した施術を利用できます。
加齢現象がかなり進行してしまって、もはやエステでは追いつかないケースなら、むしろ皮膚科や美容外科などの専門クリニックを活用すべきでしょう。
現在外科テクニックが急速に進歩しているので、かつてほど怖い事はありません。
即効性を期待するなら、クリニックにまさるものはありまぜん。
近年はプチ整形といって、買い物帰りや会社帰りに気軽に利用できるケアがポピュラーになっています。
自宅でできるアンチエイジングとしては、毎朝野菜ジュースを一杯飲む、薬用美肌化粧水を使ってみる、正しい洗顔法を試してみる、生きがいを持つことで、早めにストレスを解消するといった事を可能な範囲で試してみるというだけでも、即効性はないものの、かなり違ってきます。
食生活のアンバランスをカバーする意味で、サプリメントを利用してみるのもオススメです。

England visit Berlin in 1938
Enlarge Image
For a country which has shouldered a weight of footballing shame in its time , it ranks as one of England 's darkest moments in the sport .
The venue : Berlin's Olympic Stadium ; the date : 14 May 1938 .
As the English players lined up alongside their German counterparts for pre-match ceremonies captain Eddie Hapgood and his men issued a Nazi salute to the crowd .
The gesture provoked outrage in the British press , and was seen as all the more galling since Hitler was not even present at the time .
But England 's presence in Germany on that day was less about sport than politics .
[ Mussolini ] needed popular support , and popular support in Italy was there in football
Pierre Lanfranchi
It was a Foreign Office order that the England team , which included the legendary Stanley Matthews , perform the salute .
The underlying message was calculated to be that Germany , which two months earlier had annexed Austria , was not a pariah state .
The friendly game effectively helped clear the way for Chamberlain 's " Peace in our Time " deal with Hitler , which , in turn , led to Germany 's invasion of Czechoslovakia .
That England won the game 6 - 3 , was something of a footnote , says Ulrich Linder , author of Strikers for Hitler .
The Germans had a weak team in the mid 1930s
While the Fuhrer 's casting of the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a showcase for Nazism is well documented , the lesser known ties between fascism and football in the same era are highlighted in a new BBC documentary .
Fascism and Football looks at how Europe 's right - wing dictatorships pounced on the working man 's sport as a means of drumming up support for their politics .
Ironically , one thing Hitler , Mussolini in Italy and Franco in Spain all shared before reaching the top was an indifference to the sport .
But their rise to power in the 20s was mirrored by football 's ascent at the same time as an international sport .
Clear victory
By the time of the first World Cup in 1930 , football was recognised as a sport around which national identities could be moulded and manipulated .
The 1934 World Cup was a showcase for Mussolini 's regime
First off the blocks was Mussolini , who colonised the game as a means of shoring up support for his fascist regime .
He seized on Italy 's hosting of the 1934 World Cup as a showcase for the re-birth of Italian power , drawing on the athletic imagery of the Roman Empire .
But although Italy was a strong team at the time , its victory in the World Cup could not be assured .
So it seems Mussolini , who dubbed himself Il Duce - the leader - set about fixing the tournament .
At times , Italy appeared to have more sway than the official organiser , Fifa .
Mussolini dictated which referees would oversee each match , and once on the field their behaviour immediately led to talk of corruption .
Uncorruptible player
The referees of two Italy matches were suspended by their home countries because of the poor standard of their officiating .
In Italy 's semi-final against Austria , the referee actually headed the ball to an Italian player .
The same referee was drafted for the final and invited alone to meet Il Duce before the match .
During the game the Italians ' aggressive style of play went unpunished and the home team eventually won 2 - 1 .
The cause of Sindelar 's death remains a mystery
Not only that but in the two teams ' final match before integration , Sindelar humiliated the Nazis by scoring one of two winning goals against Germany .
Within a year , Sindelar was dead , aged 35 .
A Gestapo file marked him out as pro-Jewish and a social democrat .
There has always been suspicion about the nature of his death - Sindelar , who had become a symbol of Austrian patriotism , died in his girlfriends ' apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning .
Some believed he had been killed , others assumed he committed suicide .
His death was recorded as an " accident " , but the reason for this has remained a mystery until now .
Egon Ulbrich , a lifelong friend of the forward , revealed to the BBC documentary makers how a local official was bribed to record his death as an accident , thereby ensuring he would receive a state funeral .
" According to the Nazi rules , a person who had been murdered or who has committed suicide cannot be given a grave of honour .
So we had to do something to ensure that the criminal element involved in his death was removed , " says Mr Ulbrich .
Within a year , Europe 's rivalries switched from the football field to the battlefield .

How male or female is your brain ?
The following tests were developed by Simon Baron - Cohen , director of the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge .
Take the interactive empathy quotient test .
Take the interactive systemising quotient test .
Baron - Cohen 's theory is that the female brain is predominantly hard - wired for empathy , and that the male brain is predominantly hard - wired for understanding and building systems .
He calls it the empathising - systemising ( E - S ) theory .
Empathising is the drive to identify another person 's emotions and thoughts , and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion .
The empathiser intuitively figures out how people are feeling , and how to treat people with care and sensitivity .
Systemising is the drive to analyse and explore a system , to extract underlying rules that govern the behaviour of a system ; and the drive to construct systems .
Read the full article here .
The tests work out your empathising quotient ( EQ ) and systemising quotient ( SQ ) .
The interactive version , which will calculate your results for you , requires Flash ( version 5 ) .
Alternatively , the plain HTML version allows you to print off the questionnaire and calculate your own scores .
In either case , do both the SQ and EQ questionnaires then click on the link at the end for " your brain type " .
This will tell you whether you have a male brain , a female brain or if you 're perfectly balanced .
You can post your results or comments on the tests on the Essential Difference talkboard .
Or you can send us an email at life@guardian.co.uk Disclaimer
Please note that psychological test scores are not diagnostic .
If you score in the low E range , this is by no means an indicator that you have any kind of problem .
Although research indicates that some people with a diagnosis ( eg of autism or Asperger Syndrome ) may score in the low E range , it is NOT the case that a low E score is indicative of a problem .
A diagnosis is the result of an extensive assessment , not the result of a test score .
And a diagnosis it typically only relevant for individuals who are seeking help because they are suffering in some way .
If you are concerned about yourself , NOT as a result of this test but for other long - standing reasons , you should consult your GP .

What is it ?
Shake is a defragmenter that runs in userspace , without the need of patching the kernel and while the system is used ( for now , on GNU / Linux only ) .
There is nothing magic in that : it just works by rewriting fragmented files .
But it has some heuristics that could make it more efficient than other tools , including defrag and , maybe , xfs_fsr .
As an example , it allows you to write :
find - iname '*.mp3 ' | sort | shake
to defrag all mp3 in a directory , puting together on the disk those close in lexical order .

Britney Spears is reportedly so worried about her parenting skills she is moving back in with her mother .
The singer is said to be " nervous " around nine - month - old Sean Preston after the tot had a string of accidents and feels her mother Lynne - who lives in Kentwood , Louisiana - will be able to help her look after her son as she prepares to give birth to her second child in September .
It is believed Britney intends to bring husband Kevin Federline back home with her , and is allegedly renovating her mothers property to make room for their stay .
Earlier this year , Sean Preston was rushed to hospital with a fractured skull after accidentally falling out of his highchair .
After the incident , Britney was visited by child welfare officers who decided the young mother was not to blame for the accident .
Shortly his fall , the 24 - year - old pop star came close to dropping Sean as she tried to evade the paparazzi as she left her car .
The ' Toxic ' singer has also come under fire for driving with her son on her lap instead of securing him in a car seat .

An article in the New York Times of September 20 by Louise Story , entitled " Many Women at Elite Colleges Set Career Path to Motherhood , " reports the results of surveys and interviews concerning career plans of women at the nation 's most prestigious colleges , law schools , and business schools .
Although not rigorously empirical , the article confirms -- what everyone associated with such institutions has long known -- that a vastly higher percentage of female than of male students will drop out of the work force to take care of their children .
Some will resume full - time work at some point in the children 's maturation ; some will work part time ; some will not work at all after their children are born , instead devoting their time to family and to civic activities .
One survey of Yale alumni found that 90 percent of the male alumni in their 40s were still working , but only 56 percent of the female .
A survey of Harvard Business School alumni found that 31 percent of the women who had graduated between 10 and 20 years earlier were no longer working at all , and another 31 percent were working part time .
What appears to be new is that these earlier vintages did not expect to drop out of the workforce at such a high rate ( though they did ) , whereas current students do expect this .
That is not surprising , since the current students observe the career paths of their predecessors .
So , contrary to the implication of the article , there is no evidence that the drop - out rate will rise .
The article does not discuss the interesting policy issues presented by the disproportionate rate of exit of elite women from the workforce .
Nor does it have much to say about why women drop out at the rate they do .
The answer to the latter question seems pretty straightforward , however .
Since like tend to marry like ( " assortative mating " ) , women who attend elite educational institutions tend to marry men who attend such institutions ( and for the further reason that marital search costs are at their minimum when the search is conducted within the same , coeducational institution ) .
Those men have on average high expected incomes , probably higher than the expected incomes even of equally able women who have a full working career .
Given diminishing marginal utility of income , a second , smaller income will often increase the welfare of a couple less than will the added household production if the person with the smaller income allocates all or most of her time to household production , freeing up more time for her spouse to work in the market .
The reason that in most cases it is indeed the wife ( hence my choice of pronoun ) rather than the husband who gives up full - time work in favor of household production is not only that the husband is likely to have the higher expected earnings ; it is also because , for reasons probably both biological and social , women on average have a greater taste and aptitude for taking care of children , and indeed for nonmarket activities generally , than men do .
But it is at this point that policy questions arise .
Even at the current very high tuition rates , there is excess demand for places at the elite colleges and professional schools , as shown by the high ratio of applications to acceptances at those schools .
Demand is excess -- supply and demand are not in balance -- because the colleges and professional schools do not raise tuition to the market - clearing level but instead ration places in their entering classes on the basis ( largely ) of ability , as proxied by grades , performance on standardized tests , and extracurricular activities .
Since women do as well on these measures as men , the student body of an elite educational institution is usually about 50 percent female .
Suppose for simplicity that in an entering class at an elite law school of 100 students , split evenly among men and women , 45 of the men but only 30 of the women will have full - time careers in law .
Then 5 of the men and 20 of the women will be taking places that would otherwise be occupied by men ( and a few women ) who would have more productive careers , assuming realistically that the difference in ability between those admitted and those just below the cut off for admission is small .
While well - educated mothers contribute more to the human capital of their offspring than mothers who are not well educated , it is doubtful that a woman who graduates from Harvard College and goes on to get a law degree from Yale will be a better mother than one who stopped after graduating from Harvard .
But I have to try to be precise about the meaning of " more productive " in this context .
I mean only that if a man and woman of similar ability were competing for a place in the entering class of an elite professional school , the man would ( on average ) pay more for the place than the woman would ; admission would create more " value added " for him than for her .
The principal effect of professional education of women who are not going to have full working careers is to reduce the contribution of professional schools to the output of professional services .
Not that the professional education the women who drop out of the workforce receive is worthless ; if it were , such women would not enroll .
Whether the benefit these women derive consists of satisfying their intellectual curiosity , reducing marital search costs , obtaining an expected income from part - time work , or obtaining a hedge against divorce or other economic misfortune , it will be on average a smaller benefit than the person ( usually a man ) whose place she took who would have a full working career would obtain from the same education .
The professional schools worry about this phenomenon because the lower the aggregate lifetime incomes of their graduates , the lower the level of alumni donations the schools can expect to receive .
( This is one reason medical schools are reluctant to admit applicants who are in their 40s or 50s . )
The colleges worry for the same reason .
But these particular worries have no significance for the welfare of society as a whole .
In contrast , the fact that a significant percentage of places in the best professional schools are being occupied by individuals who are not going to obtain the maximum possible value from such an education is troubling from an overall economic standpoint .
Education tends to confer external benefits , that is , benefits that the recipient of the education cannot fully capture in the higher income that the education enables him to obtain after graduation .
This is true even of professional education , for while successful lawyers and businessmen command high incomes , those incomes often fall short of the contribution to economic welfare that such professionals make .
This is clearest when the lawyer or businessman is an innovator , because producers of intellectual property are rarely able to appropriate the entire social gain from their production .
Yet even noninnovative lawyers and businessmen , if successful -- perhaps by virtue of the education they received at a top - flight professional school -- do not capture their full social product in their income , at least if the income taxes they pay exceed the benefits they receive from government .
Suppose a professional school wanted to correct the labor - market distortion that I have been discussing .
( For I am not suggesting that the distortion is so serious as to warrant government intervention . )
It would be unlawful discrimination to refuse admission to these schools to all women , for many women will have full working careers and some men will not .
It would be rational but impracticable to impose a monetary penalty on the drop - outs ( regardless of gender ) -- making them pay , say , additional tuition retroactively at the very moment that they were giving up a market income .
It would also be infeasible to base admission on an individualized determination of whether the applicant was likely to have a full working career .
A better idea , though counterintuitive , might be to raise tuition to all students but couple the raise with a program of rebates for graduates who work full time .
For example , they might be rebated 1 percent of their tuition for each year they worked full time .
Probably the graduates working full time at good jobs would not take the rebate but instead would convert it into a donation .
The real significance of the plan would be the higher tuition , which would discourage applicants who were not planning to have full working careers ( including applicants of advanced age and professional graduate students ) .
This would open up places to applicants who will use their professional education more productively ; they are the more deserving applicants .
Although women continue to complain about discrimination , sometimes quite justly , the gender - neutral policies that govern admission to the elite professional schools illustrate discrimination in favor of women .
Were admission to such schools based on a prediction of the social value of the education offered , fewer women would be admitted .

Nature , Bloody in Tooth and Claw ?
Vernor Vinge Department of Mathematical Sciences San Diego State University ( c ) 1996 by Vernor Vinge
( This article may be reproduced for noncommercial purposes if it is copied in its entirety , including this notice . )
The original version of this article was prepared for the 1996 British National Science Fiction Convention ( Evolution ) .
The notion of evolution has frightening undertones .
The benevolent view of Mother Nature in many children 's nature films often seems a thin facade over an unending story of pain and death and betrayal .
For many , the basic idea behind evolution is that one creature succeeds at the expense of another , and that death without offspring is the price of failure .
In the human realm , this is often the explanation for the most egregious personal and national behavior .
This view percolates even into our humor .
When someone commits an extreme folly and is fatally thumped for it , we sometimes say , " Hey , just think of it as evolution in action . "
In fact , these views of evolution are very limited ones .
At best they capture one small aspect of the enormous field of emergent phenomena .
They miss a paradigm for evolution that predates Lord Tennyson 's " bloody in tooth and claw " by thousands of million years .
And they miss a paradigm that has appeared in just the last three centuries , one that may become spectacularly central to our world .
Long before humankind , before the higher animals and even the lower ones , there were humbler creatures ... the bacteria .
These are far too small to see , smaller than even the single - celled eukaryotes like amoebas and paramecia .
When most people think of bacteria at all , they think of rot and disease .
More dispassionately , people think of bacteria as utterly primitive : " they do n't have sex " , " they do n't have external organization " , " they do n't have cellular nuclei " .
Certainly , I am happy to be a human and not a bacterium !
And yet , in the bacteria we have a novelty and a power that are awesome .
At the same time most folk proclaim the bacteria 's primitive nature , they also complain of the bacteria 's ability to evolve around our antibiotics .
( And alas , this ability is so effective that what was in the 1950s and 1960s a medical inconvenience is becoming an intense struggle to sustain our antibiotic advantage , to avoid what _Science_ magazine has called the " post anti-microbial era " . )
The bacteria have a different paradigm for evolution than the one we naively see in the murderous behavior of metazoans .
The bacteria do not have sex as we know it , but they do have something much more efficient : the ability to exchange genetic material among themselves -- across an immensely broad range of bacterial types .
Bacteria compete and consume one another , but just as often both losers and winners contribute genetic information to later solutions .
Though bacteria are correctly called a Kingdom of Life , the boundary between their " species " is nearly invisible .
One might better regard their Kingdom as a library , containing some 4000 million years of solutions .
Some of the solutions have not been dominant for a very long time .
The strictly anaerobic bacteria were driven from the open surface almost 2000 million years ago , when free oxygen poisoned their atmosphere .
The thermophilic bacteria survive in near - boiling water .
Millions of less successful ( or currently unsuccessful ) solutions hide in niches around the planet .
The Kingdom 's Library has some very musty , unlit corners , but the lore is not forgotten : the Kingdom is a vast search and retrieval engine , creating new solutions from the bacteria 's ability for direct transfer of genetic information .
This is the engine which we with our tiny computers and laboratories are up against when we talk airily of " acquired antibiotic resistance " .
For the bacteria , evolution is a competition in which little is ever lost , and yet solutions are found .
( I recommend the books of Lynn Margulis for a knowledgeable discussion of this point of view .
Margulis is a world - class microbiologist whose writing is both clear and eloquent . )
For the most part , we metazoans have a strong sense of self .
More , we have a very strong sense of boundary -- where our Self ends and the Otherness begins .
It is this sense of self and of boundary that makes the process of evolution so unpleasant to many .
The bacterial Kingdom continues today .
It has been stable for a very long time , and will probably be so for a long time to come .
It has its limits , ones it seems unlikely ever to transcend .
Nevertheless , I find some comfort in it as an alternative to the conflict and pain and death we see in evolution among the metazoans .
And many of of the bacteria 's good features I see reflected in a second paradigm , one that has risen only in the last few centuries : the paradigm of the human business corporation .
Corporations do compete .
Some win and some lose ( not always for reasons that any sensible person would relate to quality ! ) , and eventually things change , often in a very big way .
Unlike bacteria , corporations exist across an immense range of sizes and can be hierachical .
As such , they have a capacity for complexity that does not exist in the bacterial model .
And yet , like bacteria , their competition is mainly a matter of knowledge , and knowledge need never be lost .
Very few participants actually die in their competition : the knowledge and insight of the losers can often continue .
As with the bacterial paradigm , the corporate model maintains only low thresholds between Selves .
Very much unlike the bacterial paradigm , the corporate one admits of constant change ( up and down ) in the size of the Self .
At present , the notion of corporations as living creatures is a whimsy or a legal contrivance ( or a grim , Hobbesian excuse for tyranny ) , but we are entering an era where the model may be one to look at in a very practical sense .
Our computers are becoming more and more powerful .
I have argued elsewhere that computers will probably attain superhuman power within the next thirty years .
At the same time , we are networking computers into a worldwide system .
We humans are part of that system , the dominant and most important feature in its success .
But what will the world be like when the machines move beyond our grasp and we enter the Post - Human era ?
In a sense that is beyond human knowing , since the major players will be as gods compared to us .
Yet we see hints of what might come by considering our past , and that is why many people are frightened of the Post - Human era : they reason by analogy with our human treatment of the dumb animals -- and from that they have much to fear .
Instead , I think the other paradigms for competition and evolution will be much more appropriate in the Post - Human era .
Imagine a worldwide , distributed reasoning system in which there are thousands of millions of nodes , many of superhuman power .
Some will have knowable identity -- say the ones that are currently separated by low bandwidth links from the rest -- but these separations are constantly changing , as are the identities themselves .
With lower thresholds between Self and Others , the bacterial paradigm returns .
Competition is not for life and death , but is more a sharing in which the losers continue to participate .
And as with the corporate paradigm , this new situation is one in which very large organisms can come into existence , can work for a time at some extremely complex problem -- and then may find it more efficient to break down into smaller souls ( perhaps of merely human size ) to work on tasks involving greater mobility or more restricted communication resources .
This is a world that is fightening still , since its nature undermines what is for most of us the bedrock of our existence , the notion of persistent self .
But it need not be a cruel world , and it need not be one of cold extinction .
It may in fact be the transcendent nature dreamed of by many brands of philosopher throughout history .
Last weekend , Hillary told me that I should look elsewhere for a candidate to vote for .
“ If the most important thing to any of you is choosing someone who did not cast that vote or has said his vote was a mistake , then there are others to choose from , ” Mrs. Clinton told an audience in Dover , N.H. , in a veiled reference to two rivals for the nomination , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina .
That was nice of her , and I promptly took her up on her generous offer .
But , alas , it does n't end there .
The war in Iraq is of such import , that it 's important we continue to swat aside efforts from pro-war Democrats to pretend that unsavory episode never happened .
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers have been split for some time about whether she would be better off if she apologized for the vote .
Mark Penn , her chief strategist , who was also Mr. Clinton ’s pollster , carries considerable influence within the campaign , and he agrees with her that she should keep the “ mistake ” onus on Mr. Bush and turn her attention to finding “ the right end ” to the war , as she says .
Foreign policy advisers say they have made similar arguments : look to the future , not the past , and stand by a vote that was based on military intelligence that was widely accepted at the time .
The " mistake " onus is obviously on Bush , but also on everyone that helped make it happen .
And Hillary 's vote ( along with every other Democrat who went along to look " tough " ) did n't just enable Bush , but it also fueled efforts to marginalize and mock those of us fighting Bush 's war .
If even the liberal Hillary Clinton supported Bush 's war , then those of us opposing it had to be real wackos way outside the mainstream !
We might not be talking about finding the " right end " to the war if she had n't helped make it a reality in the first place .
Over the next year many of us will try to determine who can best lead us in this time of great strife .
And part of being a good leader is 1 ) exhibiting good judgment on issues of great import , and 2 ) being able to acknowledge mistakes and adjust accordingly to minimize the damage .
And on this , Hillary has come up far short .
While 23 Senators and lots more House Reps saw through the administration 's smokescreen and refused to authorize Bush 's war ( and anyone who voted for Bush 's authorization knew damn well it was a carte blanche for him to invade , no matter how many promises he gave about the UN yadda yadda yadda ) , Hillary was one of those who did .
Now many who voted for the war authorization , most Democrats and even some Republicans ( including Walter " Freedom Fries " Jones ) have acknowledged the mistake .
But Hillary refuses to do so .
So we have a top - tier Democratic candidate for the presidency who showed abysmal judgment on the biggest issue to face our nation in decades , and then has refused to acknowledged her role in helping to make it happen .
That 's straight from the " George Bush " style of leadership .
And if there 's one thing this country had learned , it 's that we can't afford another one of those .
Today 's True Feminists
As we marked another International Women 's Day this month , commemorations took place around the world .
In the West , the feminist movement held its own events to honor the occasion .
Here in San Francisco , a group called the Radical Women honored International Women 's Day with a March 11 " Tribute to Sister Resisters . "
These included a " playwright , actor , and model for ' Women en Large : Images of Fat Nudes , ' " an " abortion advocate , " a " labor and anti-war feminist poet " and a " retired socialist feminist educator and revolutionary writer . "
In other words , the same old tired ' 60s model ad nauseam .
Meanwhile , the real radical women in the world go largely unremarked by the feminist movement .
Today 's true heroines are those who do battle with the gender apartheid , violence and oppression practiced against women in the Muslim world .
There , women face not just phantom infringements to their civil rights and perceived slights to their sensitivities , but threats to their lives .
With the call for reform in the Muslim world come the inevitable requirements of round - the - clock security .
Arab American psychologist Dr. Wafa Sultan is the latest to enter such dangerous waters .
Ever since Sultan took part in a debate on Al - Jazeera with Algerian Islamist cleric Ahmad bin Muhammad in February , the world has been riveted .
The two debated Islamic teachings and terrorism .
But instead of the usual excuses , Sultan offered moral clarity .
She blasted the Muslim world for being mired in a " medieval " mentality and she dubbed the war on terror not simply a clash of civilizations but " a clash between civilization and backwardness between barbarity and rationality between human rights on the one hand and the violation of these rights on the other , between those who treat women like beasts and those who treat them like human beings . "
Debate a Hit on Web
Sultan exhorted fellow Muslims to reject this mind - set and join modernity .
She also urged Muslims to free themselves from the shackles of anti-Semitism .
Perhaps most stunningly , she compared the behavior of Jews and Muslims in the face of oppression .
She said , " The Jews have come from tragedy and forced the world to respect them with their knowledge , not with their terror . "
Thanks to the Middle East Media Research Institute , which makes Arab media available for a wider audience at its
Web site MEMRI.org , the Al - Jazeera debate received over 3 million hits .
Sultan went on to do an interview with Rabbi Tovia Singer on Israel National Radio and eventually became the subject of extensive media attention , including from CNN and the New York Times .
Her frank appraisal of the problems in Islam has had a huge impact on audiences starving for such voices of sanity .
But along with the acclaim have come numerous death threats and the need for additional security .
Sultan was denounced as a " heretic " by the cleric with whom she debated on Al - Jazeera , and he later dubbed her " more dangerous to Islam than the Danish cartoons , " thereby unwittingly providing a glimpse into the very mind - set Sultan criticized .
Unfortunately , the New York Times article did not help matters by tipping off Sultan 's potential enemies to the Los Angeles suburb in which she and her husband reside , as well as other personal information .
A blog called Neocon Express has since started a campaign to get a number of private security firms to donate equipment and services for Sultan 's protection .
Religious Beliefs Re-Examined
Born in Syria to a middle - class family and raised a Muslim , Wafa Sultan began to reexamine her religious beliefs after a traumatic incident .
A respected medical school professor was murdered before her eyes by two Muslim Brotherhood members shouting " Allahu akbar ! " ( God is great ! ) .
Eventually , she became a secularist and started writing for the Arab American Web site Anneqed.com .
She became a strong critic of the intolerance and violence increasingly associated with the Muslim world .
She also tackled the taboo subject of Muslim anti-Semitism , rejecting the hatred with which she had been indoctrinated as a child .
Sultan is now working on a book that she says " is going to turn the Islamic world upside down . "
Indeed , such upheaval is needed now more than ever .
If one woman can have such a great impact , think what hundreds , thousands or even millions could do .
But Wafa Sultan is by no means the first Arab woman to tackle Islamic intolerance .
Lebanese Christian journalist Brigitte Gabriel has traveled the world sharing her experiences of persecution at the hands of Islamists in Lebanon .
She and her family eventually found refuge in Israel , where she underwent an epiphany and , like Wafa Sultan , rejected the anti-Semitism she had grown up with .
Gabriel has since become a staunch defender of Israel on American college campuses and a powerful voice for restoring Arab - Jewish relations .
Now living in the United States , Gabriel founded the American Congress for Truth , an organization devoted to providing information about the Middle East conflict and the dangers of " Islamic totalitarianism . "
Nonie Darwish is another Arab woman who has sought to bridge the gap with Israel as well as defend America 's battle against Islamic terrorism .
A former Muslim born and raised in Cairo and the Gaza Strip who later converted to Christianity , Darwish has lived in the United States for more than 25 years .
In addition to writing articles and speaking in public , Darwish set up the Web site ArabsforIsrael.com .
Darwish routinely calls upon her own background to tackle the problems associated with the Muslim world .
As she put it in a recent article , " Hundreds of millions of other Muslims also have been raised with the same hatred of the West and Israel as a way to distract from the failings of their leaders . "
Irshad Manji is also a woman worth recognizing .
A refugee of Pakistani descent from Uganda , Muslim journalist and activist Manji grew up in Vancouver , British Columbia .
She went on to pursue an impressive career , which now includes being a visiting fellow with the International Security Studies program at Yale University .
Double Dose of Intolerance
But it is her forays into critiquing Islam that have garnered Manji the most attention .
As a lesbian , she faces a double dose of intolerance within Muslim culture , but she has never backed down .
Instead , she founded the Web site Muslim - Refusenik.com and authored the groundbreaking book " The Trouble With Islam Today : A Muslim 's Call for Reform in Her Faith . "
More recently , Manji joined Salman Rushdie and 10 other journalists , writers and public intellectuals in signing the " Manifesto of 12 : Together Facing a New Totalitarianism , " a " call for resistance to religious totalitarianism . "
This show of solidarity came in response to a specific death threat from an Islamic Web site in Britain frequented by radicals .
Another signatory to the manifesto and one of the bravest of the bunch is Ayan Hirsi Ali .
Born in Somalia and raised a Muslim , Hirsi Ali escaped from an arranged marriage and made her way to Holland .
Embodying the immigrant success story , she eventually became a member of Parliament .
From the very beginning , Hirsi Ali set out to expose the oppression of women in Muslim culture in a society that tended to look the other way due to the self - censorship of multiculturalism .
A longtime critic of the practice of genital mutilation in Muslim North Africa , Hirsi Ali also collaborated with the late Theo Van Gogh on the taboo - shattering film " Submission . "
For daring to address the oppression of Muslim women , Van Gogh was murdered by an Islamist and Hirsi Ali was threatened in note left attached to his body .
She was forced to temporarily go into hiding and has employed round - the - clock bodyguards ever since .
But far from being cowed by those who would seek to silence her , Hirsi Ali has continued her quest to bring Muslim women 's rights into the spotlight .
Fallaci Recognized Dangers
Lest it be thought that only Middle Eastern women have tackled Islam , Western women have also chosen to speak out .
One of them is Oriana Fallaci , an Italian journalist , war correspondent and author who now resides in New York .
Although fiercely independent , Fallaci leaned leftward in the early days of her journalistic career .
Yet she recognized the dangers of Islamic aggression early on .
Her epic novel " Inshallah , " which told the bloody story of the Lebanese civil war , opened with the 1983 Hezbollah suicide bombing that killed 400 American and French marines .
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on her adopted home , Fallaci , shaken to the core , penned " The Rage and the Pride , " a blistering statement on the collision between the West and the Muslim world .
The second book in what promises to be a trilogy , " The Force and the Reason " expounds on the Islamic demographic and cultural takeover of Europe .
For daring to express such opinions , Fallaci has received death threats and is currently being sued in Italy for " defaming Islam . "
Instead of coming to her defense , the left has largely rejected Fallaci for her criticism of Muslim culture .
Her opponents are fond of dismissing her work by labeling her a " racist . "
Indeed , if one is searching for Fallaci 's books in one of San Francisco 's venerable institutions of leftist intellectualism , City Lights Bookstore , one is likely to be disappointed .
It seems City Lights has banned Fallaci 's books because , in the words of a bookstore clerk , they " do n't carry books by fascists . "
For a career spent fighting fascism , Fallaci has now been labeled a fascist .
Perhaps City Lights , once a bastion of Beats and banned books , should look in the mirror .
Chesler 's Break With Movement
Another woman who broke from the crowd to take on Muslim culture is professor , author and activist Phyllis Chesler .
Chesler was a prominent figure in the American feminist movement , but when she began to reject the anti-Americanism and anti-Israel sentiment that had subsumed her colleagues , she was cast out of the garden .
Chesler has since become one of the feminist movement 's strongest critics and her latest book , " The Death of Feminism : What 's Next in the Struggle for Women 's Freedom , " is a searing indictment of her former cohorts .
Chesler also provides a powerful voice in the battle against Islamic sexism .
As described in her latest book in a chapter titled " My Afghan Captivity , " Chesler learned through personal experience that all was not well for women in the Muslim world .
Having married her college sweetheart , a young Muslim man originally from Afghanistan whom she believed to be moderate , she received a rude awakening .
When they visited his family in Afghanistan , she was suddenly shrouded in a veil , had her passport confiscated and was turned into a virtual prisoner .
Only with outside help was she able to escape and get back to the United States .
She has since devoted herself to exposing such uncomfortable truths , even if the feminist movement does n't want to hear them .
In addition to the brave women referenced above , there is another group that deserves mention .
While some merely talk the talk , it is the women warriors of the U.S. military who are on the front lines bringing justice to the Muslim world .
They face challenges in Afghanistan , Iraq and beyond , but this does not diminish their accomplishments .
If just one girls ' school is reopened , one woman goes back to work , one burka is discarded or one stoning is prevented , we have made a concrete difference in the lives of Muslim women .
Restoring freedoms and providing medical care , humanitarian aid and protection , women in the military are the true feminists .
So are the valiant men who work and fight alongside them .
Unfortunately , one will rarely catch a self - proclaimed feminist willing to admit as much .
To do so would be to acknowledge that the United States can be a force for good , and this must be avoided at all costs , even at the expense of women 's rights .
What they do n't seem to realize is that the war they oppose is a battle against the very forces of fascism they routinely decry .
The oppression of women in Muslim culture and the threat it poses to women 's rights all over the world is clearly the next frontier for the feminist movement .
Either feminists will rise to the occasion or be rendered meaningless by their hypocrisy .
" We 've had a huge run-up in the price of housing , and that does n't show up in the C.P.I. , " he said .
So while the index shows that inflation is elevated but still under control — up 3.5 percent from April 2005 to April 2006 — many Americans find themselves paying sharply higher prices for essential goods and services .
In addition , aggregates generally are averages , which are of declining utility in an economy characterized by greater inequality of income and assets .
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March , Mr. Snow took pains to point out that there had been substantial gains in per-capita income ( 8.2 percent , after inflation ) and net worth ( 24 percent , before inflation ) from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2005 .
The data he cited were averages , or means , and that can be misleading .
" The average wage is a useful indicator if you want to know what 's happening to the tax base , but it might not tell you what 's going on for the individual worker , " said Alan B. Krueger , an economics professor at Princeton and a former chief economist at the Labor Department .
Consider a hypothetical country with 300 million workers .
Say the chief executive of an investment bank gets a $ 300 million raise this year , while the other 299,999,999 workers do n't get a raise .
In the aggregate , the average per-capita salary has risen by $ 1 , but only one person has more money in his pocket .
To see how typical workers are doing , it 's better to look at median wages and incomes — the midpoint that separates the top 50 percent from the lower 50 percent .
And median income , which was stagnant during President Bush 's first term , is struggling to keep pace with inflation .
" Median household income has gone nowhere since the turn of the decade , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com .
Mr. Zandi puts the problem with averages another way .
" If you put one foot in a tub of hot water and the other in a tub of cold water and take the average , everything is fine . "
THIS dichotomy accurately describes the economy .
From 2001 to 2004 , the average net worth of an American family rose 6.3 percent , according to the Federal Reserve 's Survey of Consumer Finances .
But not everybody grew richer .
For the bottom 40 percent of families by income , the median net worth fell .
" It just does n't resonate with people when the Treasury secretary says everything is fine , " Mr. Zandi said .
" It 's fine for half the population , and it 's clearly not for the other half . "
There 's a final reason that the aggregates may not accurately capture the public mood .
Aggregates shed light on the performance of the economy in the last month , or in the last quarter .
By contrast , measures of sentiments and polls gauge feelings about the present and expectations for the future .
" Consumers tend to view current conditions as quite favorable , but their expectations for six months down the road are rather pessimistic , " said Ms. Franco of the Conference Board .
" It could be that we 're nearing a peak , and this is as good as it gets . "
< a href = " foo.html " target = " _blank " > foo </a>
を使えば新しいウィンドウでリンクが開きますが，これは
XHTML 1.1 や XHTML Basic では採用されていません ．
ではどうするかというと，スクリプトを使うわけですが，
< a href= " javascript:void(0 ) " onclick =" window.open ( ' foo.html ' ) ; " > foo </a>
こうすると，一見解決したようですが ，JavaScript が off の場合はリンク先に飛べません ．
しかも，ステータスバーにリンク先が出ないので不安になります．これを
< a href = " foo.html " onclick =" window.open ( ' foo.html ' ) ; return false ; " > foo < / a>
とすれば，ステータスバーにリンク先が表示されるし，JavaScript が off でもリンク先に飛ぶことができます．
ここまでは ，AllAbout の受け売りなんですが，いちいちリンク先全部に onclick をつけるのは面倒です ．
しかも，onclick だけではなく onkeypress もつける必要があります ．
これを解決するのが以下のスクリプト．prototype.js 必須．
var PopupWindow = Class.create ( ) ;
PopupWindow.prototype = {
initialize : function ( className , parentElement ) {
var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(className , parentElement ) ;
for ( var i = 0 , len = elements .
length ; i < len ; i++ ) {
Event.observe(elements[i ] , ' click ' , this.addPopupEvent.bindAsEventListener( this ) ) ;
Event.observe(elements[i ] , ' keypress ' , this.addPopupEvent.bindAsEventListener( this ) ) ;
}
} ,
addPopupEvent : function ( event ) {
var element = Event.element ( event ) ;
var link = element.getAttribute ( ' href ' ) ;
window.open( link ) ;
Event.stop( event ) ;
}
} ;
まず，getElementsByClassName( ) で指定した class を持つ要素を列挙します．それぞれの要素に対し て
click イベントと keypress イベントをバインドしています ．
イベントが発生すると，発生した要素の href 属性を取得して window.open ( ) に渡してあげます ．
本来のイベントは止める必要があるので，Event.stop( ) しています．
使い方
Event.observe ( window , ' load ' , function ( ) {
new PopupWindow ( ' popup ' ) ;
} ) ;
< a class= " popup " href= " foo.html " > foo </a>
この場合は class に popup を指定した a タグが全て別ウィンドウで開きます．class 名は自由に設定できますし ，
親エレメントを指定したければ，prototype.js の document.getElementsByClassName( ) に引数を渡しているだけなので
Event.observe ( window , ' load ' , function ( ) {
new PopupWindow ( ' popup ' , 'p ' ) ;
} ) ;
のように指定することも可能です．
以上で ，JavaScript が off の場合も同じウィンドウですがリンク先は開けますし，on の場合は別ウィンドウで開くことができます ．
また，いちいち onclick や onkeypress を html 内に記述する必要もありませんので，お手軽に利用することができます．
そして，ステータスバーにリンク先が表示されるので利用者に不安を与えません．

New Law To Require DRM On Streaming Music
from the all - about - choice , - huh ?
dept

One of the other common themes at this morning 's Cato event from the folks supporting stronger IP protections was that it was all about " choice . "
They kept saying that the point of having laws to protect DRM is to give people the " choice " of whether or not to protect their works .
Those of us who were arguing on the other side wondered why this " choice " needed to be codified by law -- when they already have the " choice " to use DRM or not without needing a law making things more difficult .
However , it 's really hard to square the idea that this is all about giving the content creators a " choice " when new laws come out that do things likethe use of copy protection technologies .
The latest is the so - called PERFORM Act , which Gary Shapiro ( of the Consumer Electronics Association ) pointed out was problematic in his discussion this morning .
The bill tries to add new license fees to satellite radio -- even though these broadcasters already pay for the content they broadcast .
The specific issue is that since the broadcast is also streamable and recordable on computers , the industry wants a second license beyond the broadcast one .
The second one is to cover thefor someone to record the stream and keep a version of the content .
It 's basically a way to double dip from the satellite radio providers .
That 's not all the bill does , however .
The EFF is pointing out that among the provisions of the bill there 's one that would effectively require any streaming music provider to use copy protection .
While some do so already , many others stream ( legally ) using MP3 streaming .
These are n't downloads of MP3s , but streams .
These streams are basically just as recordable as traditional terrestrial radio -- which has n't been much of a problem in the past .
However , this bill would require anyone who uses the standard SoundExchange licenses to pay for the rights to stream music would then be required to ditch MP3 streams and replace them with proprietary DRM - encrusted streams to make it more difficult to record the stream ( which , last we checked was still perfectly legal fair use ) .
In other words , the " choice " aspect goes away and the DRM is effectively required by law .
Once again , it 's looking like this is less about " choice " and much more about protecting one industry 's increasingly obsolete business model .
The useless shells of tiny ocean animals -- foraminifera -- drift silently down through the depths of the equatorial Pacific Ocean , coming to rest more than three miles ( five kilometers ) below the surface .
Slowly , over time , this coating of microscopic shells and other detritus builds up .
" In the central Pacific , the sedimentation rate adds between one and two centimeters every 1,000 years , " explains Heiko Plike , a geologist at the National Oceanography Center in Southampton , England .
" If you go down in the sediment one inch , you go back in time 2,500 years . "
Plike and his colleagues went considerably further than that , pulling a sediment core from the depths of the Pacific that stretched back 42 million years .
Limiting their analysis to the Oligocene - - a glacial time period that lasted between roughly 34 million and 23 million years ago -- the researchers found that global climate responds to slight changes in the amount of sunlight hitting Earth during shifts in its orbit between elliptical and circular .
" Of all the records so far , this is both the longest and , also , the clearest that most of the climatic variations between glacial and interglacial at that time [ were ] most likely related to orbital cycles , " Plike says .
The researchers pulled specific foraminifera samples from the core and then dissolved the shells in acid .
They pumped the resultant carbon dioxide gas into a mass spectrometer and determined exactly what elements comprised the shells .
This allowed them to distinguish between shells composed of the relatively lightweight isotopes of carbon and oxygen versus those made with a higher proportion of heavier isotopes .
The isotopes , in turn , reveal a picture of the climate eons ago .
Oxygen ( O ) with an atomic weight of 16 evaporates more readily than its heavier counterpart 18O .
Thus , when ice caps form , ocean water bears a higher ratio of the heavier isotope .
Because the tiny creatures build their shells from materials in seawater , their calcium carbonate homes reflect the ratio of the two isotopes in the seas of that time .
" They are a recorder of how much ice is present on the earth at any given time , " Plike notes .
The same is true for the various isotopes of carbon , 12C and 13C .
Because plants preferentially use the lighter isotope , its scarcity is a record of how much life the oceans supported .
By matching these isotope ratios to the astronomical cycle -- Earth 's orbit oscillates between an elliptical and circular path on a roughly 400,000 - year cycle -- the researchers found that patterns of glaciation and ice retreat followed the eccentricity of our planet 's orbitthey report in the December 22 Science .
But the eccentricity of Earth 's orbit does not cause that much of a flux in the amount of sunlight the planet receives ; that energy budget is much more strongly impacted by variances in the degree of Earth 's tilt toward or away from the sun , which would lead one to expect glaciation to occur on a shorter cycle .
Instead , the long times required to move carbon through the oceans apparently acts as a buffer .
" Each carbon atom that you put in the ocean stays there for about 100,000 years , " Plike explains .
" The climate system accentuates very long periodic variations and dampens shorter term variations . "
Earth is currently nearly circular in its orbit and , if this Oligocene pattern were to be followed , would next be headed into another ice age in about 50,000 years .
But the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached levels not seen for millions of years prior to the Oligocene .
Thus , to get an accurate picture of what the climate might be like in coming years , scientists will have to continue back even farther in history to a period known as the Eocene .
Linux distributor Novell has announced the official release of Mono 1.2 .
The latest version of Novell 's increasingly popular open source .NET implementation features performance and stability improvements , improved Java functionality , and support for Microsoft 's WinForms API .
An important milestone leading up to Novell 's goal of .NET 2.0 support , the inclusion of the WinForms API in Mono 1.2 significantly simplifies the process of porting .NET applications from Windows to Linux and other supported platforms .
Developers can now use WinForms to produce cross-platform compatible user interfaces for .NET applications .
Mono 1.2 could potentially facilitate broader deployment of existing .NET applications , and reduce development overhead associated with cross-platform compatible desktop software .
Here at Ars , we have been watching the progress of Mono WinForms development for several months .
Mono has come a long way since some of the first GDI examples where demonstrated early this year .
Relatively high memory consumption and performance bottlenecks are commonly perceived as being amongst Mono 's most significant weaknesses .
Some critics frequently refer to various performance issues to support arguments against broader adoption of Mono technology in open source projects , most notably within the GNOME community .
The performance improvements in Mono 1.2 could potentially address such criticisms , but it is likely that a lot more work will be required before the problems are completely resolved .
Mono — which is used in a number of high - profile open source desktop applications like Beagle , F - Spot , and Banshee — is rapidly becoming an integral part of the Linux desktop .
Mono is also being adopted by some proprietary software vendors that wish to incorporate integrated .NET scripting support into cross-platform desktop applications .
Developers of Second Life , for instance , have considered using Mono to provide a more sophisticated scripting system for the popular virtual world software .
Although Mono technology has been adopted with great enthusiasm by many users and developers , Novell 's recent agreement with Microsoft has created some uncertainty within the open source community , and some fear that the software infringes on Microsoft 's intellectual property , creating the risk of potential litigation .
In response to concerns voiced by the community , Mono developer Miguel de Icaza wrote a blog entry to clarify several issues .
According to de Icaza , Mono currently does not infringe on any of Microsoft 's patents , and infringing code will not be added in the future .
He added in an interview that such efforts distracted from the basic , undisputed findings , saying that those point to trends that are very disturbing .
He noted recent disclosures that there is still uncertainty about the pace at which seas will rise because of warming and the melting of terrestrial ice over the next 100 years .
That span , he said , is just the start of a rise in sea levels that will almost certainly continue for 1,000 years or so .
Many economists and energy experts long ago abandoned any expectation that it would be possible to avoid a doubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide concentrations , given the growth of human populations , use of fossil fuels , particularly coal , and destruction of forests in the tropics .
The report is likely to highlight the hazardous consequences of that shift by finding that reaching twice the preindustrial concentration of carbon dioxide will probably warm climate between 3.5 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit and by highlighting that there is a small but significant risk that such a buildup can produce even more warming .
One major point of debate in early drafts of the report is the projection of a smaller rise in sea level than the last report as scientists relying on computer models and field observations struggle to find a consensus .
Some scientists say that the figures used in the coming report are not recent enough because they leave out recent observations of instability in some ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland .
Another possible point of contention during the four days of closed sessions in Paris this week may be assertions in early drafts of the report that the recent warming rate was blunted by particle pollution and volcanic eruptions .
Some scientists say the final report should reflect the assumption that the rate of warming in coming years is likely to be more pronounced than that of previous decades .
No one noticed .
Or if they did , no one complained .
The government did n't even bother to issue a press release .
Last week the Ministry of Defence quietly secured a £ 1.7bn increase in its budget .
The spending for 2006 - 7 was allocated months ago , which means that another fund must have been raided to find the extra money .
It 's the equivalent of half the annual budget for the Department for International Development .
But another billion or two does n't make much difference when we are already sloshing out £ 32bn a year on a programme whose purpose is a mystery .
On Friday , the National Audit Office published a report which appeared to congratulate the MoD for going only 11 % over budget on 30 acquisitions , such as attack submarines , destroyers , Euro - fighter aircraft and anti-tank weapons .
This overspending - a mere £ 3bn or so - is a heroic improvement on the ministry 's usual efforts .
The story was spoilt a little when we discovered that it would have looked much worse were it not for some creative manoeuvres by the 1st armoured accounts division , confounding the enemy by shifting money between different parts of the budget .
But what the audit report failed to answer , or even to ask , was why we need attack submarines , destroyers , Eurofighters and anti-tank weapons .
Are the Russians coming ?
Is Angela Merkel preparing to mobilise a few Panzer divisions ?
It is preposterous to suggest that we face the threat of invasion , now or in the foreseeable future .
Even the MoD acknowledges this .
In the white paper it published at the end of 2003 , it admits that " there are currently no major conventional military threats to the UK or Nato ... it is now clear that we no longer need to retain a capability against the re-emergence of a direct conventional strategic threat " .
Nato agrees .
The leaked policy document it will discuss at its summit this week concedes that " large - scale conventional aggression against the alliance will be highly unlikely " .
No country that is capable of attacking Nato countries is willing to do so .
No country that is willing is capable .
Submarines , destroyers , Eurofighters and anti-tank rounds are of precious little use against people who plant bombs on trains .
Instead , the ministry redefines the purpose of the armed forces as " meeting a wider range of expeditionary tasks , at greater range from the UK and with ever - increasing strategic , operational and tactical tempo " .
It wants to be able to fight either three small foreign wars at the same time or one large one , which " could only conceivably be undertaken alongside the US " .
In other words , our " defence " capability is now retained for the purpose of offence .
Our armed forces no longer exist to protect us .
They exist to go abroad and cause trouble .
But even such wars of choice can no longer be fought .
The disaster in Iraq destroyed every pretence of benign or necessary intervention .
It is hard to see how any British government , however powerful its case appears to be , could claim the moral authority to launch another adventure for at least a generation .
Iraq disqualifies us from the role the ministry envisages as surely as Suez did .
We can kiss goodbye to the idea of going into battle alongside the US as well .
This , then , grants us a marvellous opportunity : to pay ourselves a war dividend .
If the war in Iraq means that the current era of invasion is over , there is no point in maintaining armed forces designed for this purpose .
If we were to cut the military budget by 80 or 90 % , we would do ourselves nothing but good .
But the danger and paradox of military spending is that the bigger the budget , the more powerful the lobby becomes which can fight for its own survival .
As the Guardian 's revelations about the corrupt relationships they have cultivated with Saudi princes show , the civil servants in the MoD write their own rules .
Much of the time they seem to be defending not the realm but the arms companies .
So does the prime minister .
In his book Blair 's Wars , John Kampfner records that " from his first day in office Blair was eager not to antagonise British arms companies , and BAE Systems in particular , which developed extremely close relationships with senior figures in Downing Street . "
A Downing Street aide reported that whenever the head of BAE encountered a problem , " he'd be straight on the phone to No 10 and it would get sorted " .
Having obtained its stupendous budget - in cash terms , the second biggest defence allocation in the world - our military - industrial complex must justify it .
It does so by producing ever more paranoid assessments of the capabilities of terrorists .
Bin Laden might possess no submarines , but we must retain our anti-submarine aircraft in case he - or someone like him - acquires some .
We do n't know what Blair 's proposed new nuclear missiles are for , but after the money has been spent a justification is bound to emerge .
In the ministry 's defence vision paper , I found this gobsmacking contradiction .
" We face new challenges and unpredictable new conditions .
Our strategy must evolve to reflect these new realities .
For the future this means [ among other positions ] ... holding fast , in the face of change , to our underpinning military traditions . "
Was there ever a clearer sign that the tail is wagging the dog ?
A report published by the Oxford Research Group this summer argues that our defence policies are self - defeating .
They concentrate on the wrong threats and respond to them in a manner which is more likely to exacerbate than to defuse them .
The real challenges , it contends , are presented by climate change , competition over resources , the marginalisation of the poor and our own military deployments .
By displacing people from their homes and exacerbating food shortages , climate change will cause social breakdown and mass migration .
Competition for resources means that the regions which possess them - particularly the Middle East - will remain the focus of conflict .
As improved education is not matched by better prospects for many of the world 's poor , the resulting sense of marginalisation provides a more hospitable environment for insurrection .
Aids leaves a generation of orphaned children vulnerable to recruitment by paramilitary groups and criminal gangs .
The war on terror has created the threats it was supposed to defeat , by driving people to avenge the civilians it has killed .
By developing new weapons of mass destruction , the rich nations challenge others to try to match them .
Military spending enhances all these threats .
The jets and ships and tanks it buys make a large ( though so far unquantified ) contribution to climate change and the competition for resources .
It diverts money from helping the poor ; it generates a self - justifying momentum which stimulates conflict .
The budget would contribute far more to our security , the report says , if it were spent on energy efficiency , foreign aid and arms control .
So what role remains for our armed forces ?
A small one .
A shrunken army should concentrate on helping the civil authorities to catch terrorists and deal with epidemics , floods and power cuts ; the navy should be deployed to protect fisheries and catch drugs smugglers ; the airforce is largely redundant .
Now that foreign adventures are no longer an option , it is time we turned our war spending into what it claims to be : a budget for our defence .

Apple dominates the market for players and downloadable music
Almost two - thirds of music industry executives think removing digital locks from downloadable music would make more people buy the tracks , finds a survey .
The Jupiter Research study looked at attitudes to Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) systems in Europe music firms .
Many of those responding said current DRM systems were " not fit for purpose " and got in the way of what consumers wanted to do .
Despite this few respondents said DRM would disappear in the near future .
Lock off
Analyst Mark Mulligan , one of the authors of the report , said the survey was carried out between December and January .
This was before Apple boss Steve Jobs published his thoughts on music DRM and galvanised the debate about these protection systems .
Mr Mulligan said he was " surprised " at the strength of the responses which came from large and small record labels , rights bodies , digital stores and technology providers .
The study revealed that about 54 % of those executives questioned thought that current DRM systems were too restrictive .
Also , 62 % believed that dropping DRM and releasing music files that can be enjoyed on any MP3 player would boost the take - up of digital music generally .
However , Mr Mulligan pointed out that this percentage changed depending on which sector of the industry was answering .
EMI is said to be considering using less DRM
Among all those questioned , 70 % believed that the future of downloadable music lay in making tracks play on as many different players as possible .
But 40 % believed it would take concerted government or consumer action to bring this about .
Despite these feelings , said Mr Mulligan , record labels are committed to using DRM because their digital music strategies revolve around these technologies .
" Despite everything that has been happening the record labels are not about to drop DRM , " said Mr Mulligan .
" Even though all they are doing is making themselves look even less compelling by using it . "
Currently , he said , labels were sticking with DRM because they saw it as a tool for protecting their rights .
However , he added that he could foresee a day when DRM was used to manage these rights and monitor what people did with music rather than stop them .
Mr Mulligan also pointed out that so far few consumers were troubled by DRM - though this was down to the fact that Apple 's iPod dominated the market .
He said the record industry realised that it had to do more to win over some sections of the music buying public - in particular the huge group of people aged 15 - 24 who prefer to download music for free from file - sharing sites .

Abwoye is a family nurse practitioner and a member of the Board of Directors of Our Bodies Ourselves who translated and adapted “ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” into Luganda .
Covid -19 has affected all aspects of our lives .
It has exposed how much the United States is an unequal place for people of color .
I will speak here from my own experience .
It may not be a reflection of all people of color , but I hope it will help us get the conversation going .
I was born in Kampala , Uganda .
The difference between me and other people of color born in the U.S. is that I made a choice as a young woman to immigrate from my home .
I did so in an effort to support my family , and in a pursuit to find democracy , justice , education , and equity .
Those born in the U.S. did not have this choice ; their ancestors did not have a choice .
I once lived in a country where almost everyone was black and the only thing we sorted by color was laundry , but here in the United States , I am constantly reminded of how much skin color matters .
For the longest time after I arrived , I did n’t pay much attention to racial differences .
I held on to my sense of belonging to a culture I left behind .
Today , as a mother of two Black girls , I am constantly worried about how I am going to raise them in this new place I call home .
A place where I constantly have to worry about them fitting into a neighborhood , a school , a doctor ’s office .
I worry about raising my girls in a society that will stereotype them , limit their opportunities , challenge their confidence and make them feel like outsiders .
I fear for my black husband and worry about his safety very often .
During my Family Nurse Practitioner training , I learned that African Americans have the highest risk for many chronic health conditions , including heart disease and diabetes , and that African American women are more likely to die during childbirth and from breast and ovarian cancers .
The textbooks we used documented this , but they did n’t explain why these people were at greater risk .
Once , during a lecture , I asked why African Americans were at risk for a certain condition , but I did n’t get a response .
Later , a classmate commended me for my question but also added , “ Have you seen the stuff those people eat ?
It can clog your arteries . ”
Following this conversation , I thought about the shallow , white - centered teaching about race and health disparities , and the necessity of educating students about cultures and lifestyles .
I thought about why certain ethnicities make the choices they make and about how , far too often , they do n’t have access to the resources they need .
Many people do n’t understand why people eat what they eat , why they can not afford organically grown foods or are sometimes unable to stay home and make a healthy home cooked meal for their family .
In order for us to address health equity , we need to focus on solving the underlying social , economic and systemic racial structures that predispose these people to such lifestyle choices .
My work as a Covid - 19 case investigator talking to people in the state of Massachusetts has made me think about where the United States is today .
It is a reflection of the past , a past that was built with uneven distribution of resources , a past that was set to privilege only a few in the nation .
This matters because after so many years we are still facing systemic racism , racial bias , uneven distribution of resources and social injustice .
As I spoke to people with Covid - 19 , I could hear on the other end of the phone their frustration , their fear , and their exhaustion .
While I worried about them going out of their homes and spreading the disease , they worried about getting enough food for their families , finding space to isolate , being evicted from their apartments , losing their jobs and / or getting deported .
Amidst all this , George Floyd ’s murder occurred , sparking protests around the world .
Black people have called for equality for so long .
How many lives should be lost before we put an end to it ?
My takeaway from all this is that we as a society need to continue having these conversations ; it is long overdue for all white people to listen and take part in them .
I challenge all of us to do what we can do about racial disparities and inequity .
Ask yourself : how have I used my privilege to support those who are less privileged ?
How can I set the stage for a better world for the next generation ?
Those of us who have children need to ask ourselves questions about how we are raising them .
We need to set the stage now and raise our children to accept that it is okay for people to be different and it does not matter how they look ; all that counts is the fact that they are human and deserve to be treated and regarded as humans .
I challenge white people to not just be our white allies but to be our white accomplices .
White people need to use this moment to decide who they are and who they will continue to be in this world we are all sharing .
I challenge organizations not to just post equal opportunity statements and protest signs for publicity , but to get these conversations started in their organizations and create suitable environments for a diverse workforce .
Diversity does not come from hiring people of color ; it comes through diverse mindsets , an inclusive culture and practice .
Schools and colleges should focus on an equitable fundamental education that challenges the status quo of institutional racism and creates opportunities for those who are not privileged .
Such environments call for continued conversations about whiteness among students and faculty , in addition to a safe space for them to express themselves .
Together we can change history and create a better nation for all our citizens .
2 Army units will forgo desert training
WASHINGTON  Rushed by President Bush 's decision to reinforce Baghdad with thousands more U.S. troops , two Army combat brigades are skipping their usual session at the Army 's premier training range in California and instead are making final preparations at their home bases .
Some in Congress and others outside the Army are beginning to question the switch , which is not widely known .
They wonder whether it means the Army is cutting corners in preparing soldiers for combat , since they are forgoing training in a desert setting that was designed specially to prepare them for the challenges of Iraq .
Army officials say the two brigades will be as ready as any others that deploy to Iraq , even though they will not have the benefit of training in counterinsurgency tactics at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin , Calif. , which has been outfitted to simulate conditions in Iraq for units that are heading there on year - long tours .
Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash . , said Monday she is concerned about the " less - than - ideal training situation " for the 4th Stryker Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division , which is based in her state and is one of the two brigades that did its final training at home .
That brigade is to go to Iraq in April , one month earlier than planned .
The other is the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division , based at Fort Stewart , Ga. , which is due to go in May for its third combat tour since the war began in 2003 .
Instead of going to the National Training Center first , it imported personnel and equipment — even Toyota pickups like those used by Iraqi insurgents — from the training center at Fort Irwin for two weeks of final rehearsals that begin Wednesday .
A spokesman for the brigade , Lt. Col.
Randy Martin , said the soldiers lose nothing by the switch , while shaving about two weeks off their pre-deployment training schedule .
" It 's realistic training , " he said .
" I do n't think that anyone would say readiness is affected " negatively .
He noted that another brigade from his division underwent similar home - station training before it deployed in January .
" The preferred method is to have them come here , " a spokesman at the National Training Center , John Wagstaffe , said in a telephone interview Monday .
The main things that cannot be replicated in a home station exercise are the vast spaces of the National Training Center , which is located in the Mojave Desert , and the weather and other environmental conditions that so closely resemble much of Iraq , Wagstaffe said .
" Your weapon wo n't jam from sand at Fort Stewart , " he said .
Murray said she does not doubt the ability of soldiers to adapt .
" They have done everything we have asked of them , " she said .
" However , I am deeply troubled by the president 's escalation plan and am committed to questioning the new demands it places on service members . "
On a visit to the brigade 's home station at Fort Lewis last week , Murray asked the top commander there , Lt. Gen. James Dubik , whether the soldiers ' preparation for Iraq was adequate without going to the National Training Center , according to a Fort Lewis spokesman , Lt. Col .
Dan Williams , who said he attended Dubik 's meeting with Murray .
Dubik assured her it was , William said .
The general told her he was confident " that they were ready to go " to Iraq even if they had not had 1,300 soldiers imported from the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk to play the role of Iraqi insurgents and civilians and to observe and control the mission rehearsal exercise .
" They went through all the things they know they 're going to do in Iraq , " Williams said .
Some outside observers say it was inevitable that , in a pinch , the Army would tinker with training .
" It tracks with what we should expect when we hurry the units up in their last three months " before a deployment , said Kevin Ryan , a retired brigadier general and former Army planner who is now at Harvard University 's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs .
Army commanders are compelled to make " economies , " he added , when an accelerated deployment plan forces them to compress some aspects of training .
Ryan said he doubts this approach will significantly detract from the soldiers ' degree of preparation for Iraq .
" ' Adequate ' is probably a good description of what that training is , " he said .
" It 's not the premier kind of situation that commanders would prefer , but it is adequate . "
Daniel Goure , a military analyst at the Lexington Institute , a think tank , said , " This should n't have a decisive impact , although it carries a modicum of risk . "
The two units that are skipping their National Training Center sessions are among five Army brigades that are being dispatched to Baghdad on a sped - up schedule as the centerpiece of Bush 's new approach to stabilizing Iraq .
The first to go , in January , was an 82nd Airborne brigade specially designated for short - notice deployments ; it did no full - scale final exercise before deploying to Kuwait and then into Iraq .
The next two , from Fort Benning , Ga. , and Fort Riley , Kan. , did their final training sessions at the National Training Center .
The unit from Fort Riley is entering Iraq now and the other is due to arrive in March .

February 1st 2006 — Topic : — Topic : Design
I just finished reading Lea ’s great three part series on the Art of Self Branding ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
I thought I would share a bit about how my own thought process works .
Specifically , I will talk about the influences and factors that went into branding the Godbit Project .
At first , I was n’t sure how well recieved the Godbit website would be , wondering if it would be percieved as just another cheezy Christian endeavor .
However , since it seems to be getting a lot of attention from various design galleries , I figured I ’d talk a more about it .
Initial Attempt
I must admit , that when I started planning for this site , I had two words in the back of my head , “ Christian Stylegala . ”
I had initially toyed with the idea of having a logo done in a script font , not unlike that of Stylegala or the now defunct Screenspire .
I even considered juxtaposing one shape , to create a lowercase g and b .
You can see the result of that failed attempt below .
While this design is visually appealing , after asking around ( without saying what it was for ) , I found that it conjured up two things in people ’s minds .
The first was of yin yang , a symbol for the balance of complimentary opposites in Eastern cultures .
Secondarily , people associated this inversion of similar text with the numbers 96 and 69 .
I decided this was not going to work .
I also had a gut feeling that curisve was not the best choice for a site about coding .
So , I started visiting other design sites , and began thinking about it purposfully .
Branding Influences
It ’s been said that art does not exist in a vacuum , and we are all influenced by what we have seen .
Nowhere is this more true than on the web .
So , before I talk about the actual process of designing Godbit , I need to give due credit for where I drew my branding inspiration .
When I first started out , I knew I wanted this site to appeal to geeks , a demographic in which I include myself .
If you ’re from my generation ( or older ) , you ’ll no doubt remember computers such as the Apple II .
Cutting edge for their time , these dream machines had only a two - color monitor .
Well , it was really more like one color : green , with the rest of the screen black .
It was this type retro look I was considering , because I wanted the site to be about getting back to basics , past the snazzy designs and back to the foundations of good machine language : code .
This is also a reoccuring theme in the Matrix , which also drew its inspiration from the old console input of light text on black background .
To the younger crowd , I knew the color scheme of Godbit would remind them more of this movie .
I really liked the underlying theme of those films : Fighting the status quo .
That is something that I also wanted to represent with Godbit , to raise the bar of coding standards beyond where the Church is at today .
“ We wrestle not against flesh and blood , ” but against apathy , bureaucracy and mediocrity .
Paying Homage
—› Jonathan Snook
In my opinion , one of the better web coders out there is Jonathan Snook , and I have always been fond of the way he uses dark grey and neon green on his blog .
He is a wizard of CSS , JavaScript , PHP and probably a myriad of other languages .
I figured , if my design was reminiscent of his , then all the better .
—› Design by Fire
Another thing I wanted to take into account was an article written awhile back on Design by Fire , entitled Rebranding the W3C .
While it was just a simple example exercise , I knew I wanted to revisit some of the concepts covered there .
The reason for this was twofold .
First , the author Andrei Herasimchuk is a great designer , so when he talks about branding , I listen .
Second , it is the very standards of the W3C that Godbit is trying to promote for the church .
In his design , he emphasizes the < > bracket symbols .
I wanted to revisit this .
—› Pixelgrazer
Lastly , I love the logo for the design group Pixelgrazer .
At first glance , it might not appear like much , but I assure you that it is genius .
While I have n’t dialoged with them specifically about it , I will give my best guess as to the design process that went on behind the scenes .
I think they wanted to represent the word pixel as simply as possible , in a pixel font , no doubt .
From there , they needed to add in the second word in their combo , grazer .
Drawn with as few pixels as possible , that gives you a lowercase p and g , with a 3× 5 pixel shape to work with for each letter .
What I think happened next is that they overlapped the two letters ( accidentally ? ) , and thought : ahah !
This resulted in a blocky , pixel - esque logo that also hints at an exclamation point .
Deity +
Data
To recap , I now knew I wanted to have a site that was primarily dark , with lighter font , preferrably with green for accentuation .
I knew I wanted to highlight a “ bit ” of data , the best visual representation of which is a single pixel .
I also knew that I wanted to emphasize the importance of standards , and revisit the concept of using code .
So , I thought , what if I put a dot to represent a bit , inside brackets ?
That of course looks like this : < •> .
I shelved that idea for a bit while I re-thought the actual lettering .
I really liked the Pixelgrazer approach , but knew that God ’s name deserves to be capitalized , so a straight overlap was ruled out because a capitalized pixel - font G has greater dimensions than a lowercase b.
I decided to just draw the letters as small as possible , and then it hit me .
By turning the G - 45 degrees to the left , and leaning the b 45 degrees to the right , I had a perfect overlap .
Plus , it also cut out a perfect square to represent a bit of data !
Not only that , but it retained the diamond shape formed by two code brackets .
Besides being a really nice site I think Godbit has the most awesome logo I ’ve seen in a long time .
The idea is just brilliant !

Well , I hope you found this article informative .
If anything , it should help you realize that usually nothing works out on the first try .
So , if you ’re getting discouraged on a project , seek some objective outside input , take a break to clear your mind , and then come back to it later with a fresh perspective .
Michael Jordan said it best : “ To learn to succeed , you must first learn to fail . ”
“ Are humans still evolving ?
In the vernacular sense of improving morally and intellectually – by cultural changes – I think so , ” says Steven Pinker .
“ In the biological sense of changes in the gene pool , it ’s impossible to say . ”
If pressed to come off the fence , however , the Harvard - based evolutionary biologist knows where he stands .
“ People , including me , would rather believe that significant human biological evolution stopped between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago , before the races diverged , which would ensure that racial and ethnic groups are biologically equivalent , ” he says .
It ’s an understandable position given the political implications of being wrong .
And in one important sense Pinker is absolutely spot on : it ’s very difficult , if not impossible , to observe human evolution in action .
But saying it is n’t happening is an increasingly difficult position to defend scientifically .
Recent discoveries show that we must reject the idea that human evolution stopped dead 50,000 years ago or more .
In fact , there is every reason to believe that it is going on right now .
Take the discovery last year by Bruce Lahn of the University of Chicago of two genes involved in brain development that emerged in recent human history and swept quickly through the population .
One , a version of a gene called microcephalin , arose between 14,000 and 60,000 years ago and is now carried by 70 per cent of people .
The other , a variant of the ASPM gene , is as recent as 500 to 14,000 years old and is now carried by about a quarter of the global population .
No one yet knows the function of these genes , but Lahn ’s …
French police said initial tests showed the contents were non-toxic and that the alert was now over .
Officers wearing decontamination suits had evacuated the building in the centre of the French capital and closed off the Avenue Montaigne .
The package contained a piece of tissue soaked in an unknown fluid .
" We do n't know what it was but it 's not a toxic substance , " said Florent Hivert , a spokesman for the Paris fire bridge .
He said the scare , which triggered an alert for possible radiological , bacteriological and chemical danger , was now over .
Reporters said the area surrounding the building , on one of the city 's smartest streets , was blocked off and fire engines and police officers were present .
Stingrays have been found dead on two Queensland beaches
Mr Irwin , a TV personality known as the " Crocodile Hunter " , was killed while diving in Queensland when a stingray 's barb stabbed him in the chest .
Since then , 10 stingrays have been found mutilated on Queensland beaches .
Government officials said they were investigating the deaths and there could be prosecutions .
Two stingrays were found at a beach north of Brisbane with their tails cut off , while eight were found on another beach on Monday , The Australian reported .
Wayne Sumpton of the state fisheries department said it was not clear if the incidents were connected to Mr Irwin 's death .
He said fishermen who inadvertently caught stingrays sometimes cut off their tails to avoid being stung , but such a practice was uncommon .
' Protect wildlife '
Mr Irwin was well - known for his work with Australian wildlife
Michael Hornby , a friend of the late naturalist and executive director of Mr Irwin 's Wildlife Warrior fund , condemned any revenge killings .
" We just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who 's taken a form of retribution .
That 's the last thing Steve would want , " he said .
" I hope everyone understands we have to protect wildlife now more than ever .
This is what Steve was all about . "
Stingrays are normally placid , but when they feel under threat , a sharp , poisonous spine in their tail flicks up .
A public memorial service for Mr Irwin will be held next week .

Assume you were the president of a company that made a lot of money selling the electronic voting machines used by 10 % of U.S. voters .
Assume also that a Princeton professor and two young grad students ran their own security analysis of your voting machines and determined the following :
The physical lock of your voting machines can be picked in 10 seconds .
Your voting machines can then easily be infected with a computer virus , since they are general - purpose computers running specialized election software .
It only takes about one minute to infect one of your machines using a single memory card .
The virus can easily be spread among numerous voting machines by innocent users updating the software with a memory card .
Virus software can easily make all of the diagnostic and double - checking software in your machines illusory and meaningless , therefore dangerous .
The infected machine can be made to spit out ( electronically or on paper ) any faked election result , regardless of the voting conducted on the machines .
Your machine , which is already in use in some jurisdictions , thus has serious design flaws .
If you want to see a video showing how incredibly easy it is to infect a Diebold machine , click here .
Warning : Do n’t watch this video just before going to bed .
You ’ll be too angry and it will keep you up .
Since many states are relying on your machine for the integrity of upcoming elections , you ( as president of Diebold ) would doubtless write something like this to the three guys at Princeton :
Dear three Princeton guys :
Thank you so much for bringing the design flaws of the Diebold ’s AccuVote - TS Voting Machine to our attention .
We at Diebold are shocked and embarrassed to have manufactured such a flawed machine .
We are taking immediate steps to make sure that this machine is redesigned from the ground up .
We would like to start submitting other models and modifications of our products to you guys at Princeton ( and to other disinterested third parties ) to make sure that our machines count votes properly .
In the meantime , we are now sending warnings to all government officials to cease using these machines , because paper ballots have far more integrity .
Our democracy is safer , thanks to your skillful work .
The President of Diebold
The problem is that Diebold , upon learning how dangerous their machines are , did not show any such gratitude .
Instead , check this link to see Diebold ’s incredibly petty , vindictive , evasive and ad hominem attack on the Princeton team .
The bottom line is that Diebold fails to give any assurance that anyone should rely on its machines for accurate election results .
Diebold ’s attitude is clearly that of a money - driven bully that truly does n’t give a rat ’s ass about the integrity of elections .
How could that be ( I ask rhetorically ) ?
Here ’s a few other things to consider .
Check out this 9/26/06 post on bradblog.com ( the site feature this quote in its header : “ Either every vote is sacred , or democracy is a sham . ”- David Cobb , Green Party presidential candidate , 12/2/04 ) :
Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) and Senator Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) introduced emergency legislation to amend the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) this afternoon to offer funding to states and counties who make ‘ contingency paper ballots ’ available to voters to be used at the voter ’s option instead of electronic voting systems .
The so - called contingency paper ballots are intended to be counted as normal ballots , as opposed to Provisional Ballots which must be vetted first to determine the integrity of the voter ’s registration .
Provisional ballots are frequently counted only several days after Election Day , and often , not at all .
The Senate legislation as filed , however , does not spell out the intended difference between “ contingency ” and “ provisional ” ballots specifically .
The BRAD BLOG has learned from a source currently working on similar legislation in the House , said to be filed there shortly , that the House version will include such specific language if possible to ensure such contingency ballots are counted as normal ballots on Election Night .
Several Capitol
Hill sources have confirmed that such legislation is currently in the works .
We hope to have more details on the House version later today .
Note that the Princeton site provides links to other studies also finding that the Diebold machines are unreliable .
Robert F. Kennedy has also weighed in with this article published in Rolling Stone :
In October 2005 , the government Accountability Office issued a damning report on electronic voting machines .
Citing widespread irregularities and malfunctions , the government ’s top watchdog agency concluded that a host of weaknesses with touch - screen and optical - scan technology “ could damage the integrity of ballots , votes and voting - system software by allowing unauthorized modifications . ”
Some electronic systems used passwords that were “ easily guessed ” or employed identical passwords for numerous systems .
Software could be handled and transported with no clear chain of custody , and locks protecting computer hardware were easy to pick .
Unsecured memory cards could enable individuals to “ vote multiple times , change vote totals and produce false election reports . ”
An even more comprehensive report released in June by the Brennan Center for Justice , a nonpartisan think tank at the New York University School of Law , echoed the GAO ’s findings .
The report – conducted by a task force of computer scientists and security experts from the government , universities and the private sector – was peer - reviewed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
Electronic voting machines widely adopted since 2000 , the report concluded , “ pose a real danger to the integrity of national , state and local elections . ”
While no instances of hacking have yet been documented , the report identified 120 security threats to three widely used machines – the easiest method of attack being to utilize corrupt software that shifts votes from one candidate to another .
As one immediate need , Kennedy recommends that all electronic machines should produce a paper record “ that can be recounted when equipment malfunctions – an omission that practically invites malicious tampering . ”
Open voting foundation calls the design flaw of the Diebold machines the worst security flaw we have seen in touch screen voting machines .
Even conservative sites like Insight on the News are indicting the Diebold machines .
Here ’s a video of the problems with the machine on FOX .
Just how cozy things are between Diebold and the Republicans ?
because it took place back in April !!?
yea Stanford !

What seemed most important was loyalty to the Bush administration .
What did Democrats know about Bush ’s signing statements .
Were Democrats aware at any time that Bush could use signing statements to avoid enforcing legislation passed by Congress or violate terms of treaties to which the United States is a signatory of .
What did Democrats know about Bush ’s insistence that he has the right to spy on any American any time he wants without a warrant in violation of FISA law and the 4th amendment ?
What did Democrats know about George W. Bush and Richard Cheney ’s avoiding the draft and shrieking off combat duty in Vietnam ?
What did Democrats know about the tax cuts that benefited mostly well off Americans and has created a monstrous national debt and what did they know about the oppressive communist country of China floating that debt ?
What did Democrats know about the Bush Appointee Kenneth Tomlinson , Taxpayer Monies , Horse Racing Operations and Betrayal of the Public Trust
What did Democrats know about Republican Senator George Allen ’s rascism and when did they know it ?
What did Democrats know about the Bush and Republican backed ironically named Clear Skies Initiative , Dirty Skies : The Bush Administration ’s Air Pollution Plan
What did Democrats know about the Bush administration ’s reclassification of fast food jobs as manufacturing jobs to make the the administration ’s jobs record look better then it really is ?
Recently , a White House economic report suggested that fast - food restaurant jobs should be reclassified as manufacturing jobs .
In the eyes of the Administration , an 18 - year - old serving french fries at a burger joint is now on par with someone with 25 years of experience wiring nuclear submarines for Electric Boat .
This reclassification , of course , would not help a single American find work .
But it would conveniently hide the 2.7 million manufacturing jobs lost since President Bush took office .
What did the Democrats know about George W. Bush taking away the right of millions of American workers right to organize ?
8 Million American Workers Just Lost the Right to Organize
Each year thousands of workers in the United States are spied on , harassed , pressured , threatened , suspended , fired , deported or otherwise victimized by employers in reprisal for their exercise of the right to freedom of association .
In the 1950 ’s , victims numbered in the hundreds each year .
In 1969 , the number was more than 6,000 .
By the 1990 ’s , more than 20,000 workers each year were dismissed or otherwise victims of discrimination serious enough for the government - appointed National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to issue a reinstatement and “ back - pay ” or other remedial order …
Loophole - ridden laws , paralyzing delays , and feeble enforcement have created a culture of impunity in many areas of U.S. labor law and practice .
Employers intent on resisting workers ’ self - organization can drag out legal proceedings for years , fearing little more than an order to post a written notice in the workplace promising not to repeat unlawful conduct .
What did Democrats know about the warnings that were received by Rumsfeld , Ashcroft , and Rice before 9 - 11 and why those warnings were not acted on by conservatives who consider themselves infallible indisputable authorities on national security ?
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Attorney General John Ashcroft received the same CIA briefing about an imminent al - Qaida strike on an American target that was given to the White House two months before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The State Department ’s disclosure Monday that the pair was briefed within a week after then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice was told about the threat on July 10 , 2001 , raised new questions about what the Bush administration did in response , and about why so many officials have claimed they never received or do n’t remember the warning .
What Did Democrats know and when did they know that Republicans and the Bush administration was manufacturing news , Manufactured journalism
We all want to know what Democrats knew about Republicans and when they knew it because Republicans have no mind of their own .
Republicans in fact have no free will .
If you ’ll look closely at Republicans on television you will see some micro - thin wires that are controlled by their Democratic puppet masters .
Republicans are thus never responsible , never to be held to account .
Everything Republicans do , say , or think is controlled by Democrats or at least that is what Republicans have been claiming for years and has reached a fever pitch in the last week .
So instead of holding Republicans responsible for their lawlessness , corruption , ineptitude , disregard for the constitution , the nation ’s fiscal state , the national security disasters , their negligence on handling natural disasters , and countless other offences to democracy , let ’s just investigate how Democrats are responsible for Republicans .
Digby has part of the transcript from a recent Keith Olbermann editorial about Bush ’s pathological fabrications , Divided Families
And lastly tonight , a Special Comment , about — lying .
…
The President of the United States — unbowed , undeterred , and unconnected to reality — has continued his extraordinary trek through our country rooting out the enemies of freedom : The Democrats .
…
Yesterday at a fundraiser for an Arizona Congressman , Mr. Bush claimed , quote , “ 177 of the opposition party said ‘ You know , we do n’t think we ought to be listening to the conversations of terrorists . ”
The hell they did .
177 Democrats opposed the President ’s seizure of another part of the Constitution .
…
Tuesday , at another fundraiser in California , he had said “ Democrats take a law enforcement approach to terrorism .
That means America will wait until we ’re attacked again before we respond . ”
Mr. Bush fabricated that , too .
And evidently he has begun to fancy himself as a mind - reader .
“ If you listen closely to some of the leaders of the Democratic Party , ” the President said at another fundraiser Monday in Nevada , “ it sounds like they think the best way to protect the American people is — wait until we ’re attacked again . ”
…
It defies belief that this President and his administration could continue to find new unexplored political gutters into which they could wallow .
Yet they do .
There has been speculation over the years about Bush ’s intelligence and what role that might play in his utter inability to govern .
While we ’re investigationg what Democrats knew about whatever we might also want to take a serious look at Bush ’s mental competence .
Those passages that Olbermann sited from Bush are the rabid rantings of the insane .

In the last few weeks a large number of bugs have been fixed in our Windows .
Forms implementation which finally has allowed us to get larger applications running with Mono .
As time goes by we are able to run more complicated applications with Mono .
In October I imported a version of Paint .
Net , a paint application built with .NET into our repository .
I made some changes to it to get it working on Linux , this is a screenshot as of this afternoon :
Paint.NET running on Linux
Paint.NET has been a fantastic test case , it is made up of about 70,000 lines of C# code .
Update :
The port runs in Mono , without any external dependencies ( no Wine for instance ) .
Compiling Paint.NET on Mono : the first steps
To get the code building on Linux , I had to remove all the references to a third party library that was used by the Paint.
NET back in October ( DotNetWidgets ) .
This is the last release of Paint.
NET that targeted .
NET 1.x ; Newer versions of Paint.NET have replaced DotNetWidgets for the Strip controls in Windows .
Forms .
The port is not as clean as I would like to , as I switched strategies in the middle of the port , let me explain .
First I used prj2make to turn the Visual Studio solution into a Makefile ;
Then I had to rename some of the files , as the actual filenames were spelled differently ( filename casing ) than the files distributed .
This was easy .
A rather large and obnoxious task was replacing all the calls to DotNetWidgets ( which provided Paint. NET with a spiced up UI experience ) with the more simple widgets that ship as part of the standard API .
This was done by removing the reference to the library and then changing the code to use the simpler widgets in a loop .
And this was my first mistake in the port .
Instead of planning the port , I kind of brute forced the port on my spare time .
About one third of the way in manually replacing the code in my favorite editor , I realized that I should just have implemented the DotNetWidgets interface and be done with it .
The result was a 129 line source file that in one hour gave me everything I needed to get Paint.
NET building without this dependency .
Exercise for the reader : describe the morale of the story .
Making it Run
This Paint application despite its young age is quite sophisticated and calls into a number of Win32 libraries to use features not exposed directly by the .NET libraries .
For example , it determines the number of CPUs to adjust its thread pool , it uses low - level heap routines from the OS and other things like that .
Luckily all this OS - specific code is neatly split into the SystemLayer directory of Paint .
Net and wrapped in a handful of classes .
Since most of these routines are very simple to provide in Unix I initially decided that it would be a good idea to implement these functions in a way that other future Windows .
Forms applications would benefit , so I started implementing a number of routines that are now part of our " supporw " library .
Also , supportw is useful in showing how we can map unmanaged calls back into managed calls , so it was a useful example to have around for anyone which might need to " bounce " unmanaged calls into the managed world .
At this point in November , Paint .
NET started running into missing functionality in Mono 's System .
Drawing and Mono's Windows .
Forms ;
I would take a break of a few months before coming back to it a couple of weeks ago .
System .
Drawing
One of the early road blocks that I ran into with Paint.NET was the incomplete support for Regions in our System .
Drawing implementation .
We supported rectangular regions , but not the GraphicsPath - based regions .
Implementing this was not an easy task .
Around the same time we started working with a third party control vendor that uses System .
Drawing extensively for his commercial product and we also ran into ZedGraph which is a popular library for generating plots which was running into some gradient issues with our implementation .
Sebastien was kind enough to take on the challenge of implementing these hard tasks .
ZedGraph in Mono , April 2006 ;
The original .
Sebastien blogged extensively about his work on GDI + , some screenshots :
Blogging about this attracted Bill Holmes , which helped refine the finer points of the gradient brushes .
With GraphicsPath - based Regions implemented , gradients in place it is now possible to get most of the basic operations in Paint.
NET going without a crash .
We are still missing support for " GraphicsPath .
WidenPath " ( used by Paint .
NET to paint ellipses and rectangles , but really , who uses that these days ?
Are n't bezier paths all people need ? ) .
Another missing feature are PathGradientBrushes .
We do not believe that this can be implemented with Cairo , but we would love to be proved wrong .
Cairo is the underlying engine that we use to implement GDI +.
Some of the us secretly wish that the Xara Xtreme library was already open sourced ( they are planning on releasing it ) but to use it , we would need it to be licensed under the LGPL or the MPL license .
System .
Windows .
Forms
Once the graphics issues were sorted out , Paint.NET turned out to be a QA engineer dream come true .
After a while , we got to the point where we can actually draw with the program and we have fixed the most critical performance problems ( initially it was not even possible to draw , due to a trigger - happy redraw routine ) .
Midways through the port , I changed direction .
Instead of continuing to work on supporting the emulation of unmanaged APIs by emulation or by bouncing the API to managed code , I started to do a more regular " port " .
So I started to replace calls to SystemLayer with proper Unix calls or other Mono libraries .
This has proved to be much simpler .
We might still implement a few emulation routines for some P / Invokes , depending on the popularity of the technique , but in general we will advocate that folks use OS - specific calls depending on their needs .
Paint.NET has exposed a lot of bugs in our Windows .
Forms implementation ( current bug list ) .
Sadly , in addition to the bugs reported , we need to fix also the minor details , and the cosmetic aspects of Windows .
Forms before we can ship it .
At Novell , Jackson , Peter and Mike are now being joined by Atsushi , Gonzalo and Chris ( who were up to this point working on ASP.
NET 2.0 ) to assist in fixing bugs in Windows .
Forms .
And of course lots of people in the community are helping out , specially Alexander Olk , Jordi Mas and Jonathan Chambers .
QA
Carlos is now working in collecting applications from the CodeProject and SourceForge and repeat the process that I described above for Paint .
NET : we will be gathering applications as test cases and Carlos will be routinely testing them for potential regressions .
In addition , although we had a NUnit test case for Windows .
Forms we were not really using it , so many failures went unnoticed for a while .
So our immediate next step is to make sure that our NUnit tests pass on Unix ( Atsushi just recently fixed them on Windows , as we had some incorrect tests or tests that depended on a specific release of the framework ) .
Atsushi has a great call for contributors that includes some background information on those which migh be interesting in helping :
So I have started to look around existing bug list and work on it .
At first I thought that it is highly difficult task : to extract simple reproducible code from problematic sources , and of course , to fix bugs .
Turned out that it is not that difficult .
Actually , it is very easy to find MWF bugs .
If you run your MWF program , it will immediately show you some problems .
What I do n't want you to do at this stage is just to report it as is .
We kinda know that your code does not work on Mono .
It 's almost not a bug report .
Please try to create good bug report .
Here I want to share my ideas on how you can try creating good MWF bug reports and bugfixes .
Followed by some easy - to - follow steps on how to squash the bugs .
Other Mono Events
There are a number of exciting new developments in the Mono Universe that I hope to write about next week in more detail ( news on our compacting GC , a new IR representation for Mono , a few touch - ups for our inliner ) .
The summer of code has some great proposals , and hopefully next week we will have the definite list of projects that we will be mentoring , but the one am most excited about is a VB.

David Bradley , 41 , was originally charged with the murders of his uncle Peter Purcell , aunt Josie , both 70 , and their sons Keith , 44 , and Glen , 41 .
But those charges were dropped when it was found he was mentally ill .
The judge at Newcastle Crown Court ruled psychiatric reports be prepared and he remanded Bradley in custody .
Newcastle Crown Court heard how the bodies were found in Benwell Grove on 9 July 2006 .
Bradley admitted the manslaughter charges on the grounds of diminished responsibility after two psychiatrists agreed he was mentally ill at the time of the killings .
Other medical experts , appearing for the prosecution and defence , also told the court the defendant was a heavy user of cannabis , which may have contributed to the deterioration in his mental health .
Detectives said the massacre happened because Bradley " flipped " , began smashing up the house and then fought with his cousin Keith .
It resulted in Bradley killing his family over a five - hour period , on the night of 8 and 9 July , at their home in the West End of Newcastle .
Almost four hours after the killing spree , Bradley was caught on CCTV calmly walking the short distance to West Road Police Station carrying an arsenal of weapons in a rucksack .
The footage shows him pausing to stub out a cigarette before going into the station to give himself up .
The former Royal Artillery private , who served in the first Gulf War , Bosnia and Northern Ireland , shot father - of - six Peter and Keith immediately , before lying in wait for his aunt Josie and cousin Glen .
' Lifelong difficulties '
The court was told Bradley would need to be assessed by psychiatrists at Rampton secure hospital in Nottinghamshire .
Toby Hedworth QC , prosecuting , said two medical experts , for the Crown and the defence , agreed Bradley had suffered mental illness .
" Both of these eminent doctors are of the view that the defendant has suffered lifelong behavioural and emotional difficulties , which worsened following his 1995 discharge from the Army , he said .
The bodies of the family were found in their home
" His mental state deteriorated more acutely in 1997 .
" They both agree at the time of the killings that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder which constitutes an abnormality of the mind . "
Mr Hedworth said the defence 's expert believed Bradley was suffering post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) after serving with the Army in Northern Ireland .
But both experts agreed that he did not suffer from Gulf War Syndrome , contrary to reports which appeared in the aftermath of the killings .
The court also heard that Bradley did not see any active service during his deployment to the Gulf .
' Jaded and weird '
Det Supt Steve Wade , who led the inquiry , spoke after the hearing about Bradley 's state of mind before the killings .
" He said he had felt ' jaded and weird ' , the hot weather was getting to him and he had ' started to flip ' , " said Det Supt Wade .
A spokesman for Northumberland , Tyne and Wear NHS Trust said an independent inquiry into Bradley 's care and treatment was to be carried out .
He said : " At this stage , pending the outcome of the independent inquiry , there is nothing further that we can add other than to offer our condolences to the families involved . "
A further hearing will be held on 26 February .
Polygraph Experience : Clearly Inconsistent Assessments
by " linguist87 "
For many years now , I have dreamed of becoming an analyst for one of the big , 3 - letter agencies .
To this end , I have applied time and again to all of the agencies .
Finally , after several advanced university degrees and considerable work experience , I began to " get the calls . "
But before I expound upon my experiences with the chair , and the machine - some background information seems appropriate .
How did I get there ?
Why ?
What could I offer ?
I grew up speaking 2 Eastern European languages .
By age 21 , I was able to speak most European languages at a 3 or above ( see ILR for ratings ) .
In college , I majored in more foreign languages and area studies , learning another 4 languages to the 1 + or 2 level .
Upon graduation , I took a job overseas , and learned another 2 languages during my 1.5 years stay there .
Through more travel and living overseas , I learned more languages .
By the time I was 28 , I had military experience , spoke 15 foreign languages ( not all at 3 or higher , but all at 1 or higher ) , had lived abroad , and had obtained 2 advanced degrees in scientific disciplines , to complement my foreign language / foreign area studies degree .
At 28 , I decided to get yet another advanced degree in International Relations .
By 31 , I had completed this degree as well .
Why all this education one might logically ask ?
Simple .
I wanted to work as an analyst or operations officer for one of the IC members who typically have needs for technically oriented , political scientist type , polyglots .
I felt that in lieu of an ivy league education , I needed much more experience to be competitive .
I cannot count the days I imagined working on the front - lines or in the back office , applying my myriad talents to the greater good of national security .
The money I made in technology was amazing , but the work was totally unfulfilling .
I knew that the money would be low at one of the agencies , but this meant little to me .
Then 9/11 happened .
I felt as though I was in prime position to help out , and join the war on terror by working for the Intelligence Community .
As a patriotic citizen , I felt it my duty to do what I could , using the God - granted skills that I possess to do my part .
As a speaker of languages like Russian , Arabic and Persian ( Farsi ) , and as a person who had a strong math , science and foreign policy background I felt that I had a unique skillset , and the agencies would be calling me every week to help them out .
Of course , this assessment was totally naïve .
So I pressed on .
I applied to the big four : FBI , NSA , CIA and DIA .
I never heard from the NSA or FBI , but had positive responses for the DIA and CIA .
I had experience with obtaining and maintaining security clearances through various corporate jobs that I had taken along the way , so I had no concerns about this aspect of the process .
Since age 18 , I always wanted to be in the intelligence community , so I took measures to live a good life and stay out of trouble .
Aside from experimental drug use in college , and a few speeding violations , my record was clean .
The US gov't agreed .
They had already granted me S , TS and TS / SCI clearances , so there was a clear precedent for an easy and problem free investigative and clearance granting process .
For that matter , I had even served in the US military , and had an honorable discharge .
Again , I was naïve in my assessment of this situation .
Why ?
My clearances were high - level , however none of them had ever required a lifestyle polygraph .
And this would become the ultimate stumbling block for my efforts to assist with US national security .
I arrived at my CIA polygraph promptly , and was dressed appropriately for the occasion .
I met my polygrapher , and he did the usual " I 'm your new friend , let 's get acquainted " song and dance .
I had already " passed " a CI poly , so the only remaining task to get me the job of my long - term dreams was the lifestyle poly .
Before strapping me into the chair , he explained to me the nature of the exam , and what to expect , and then he started with the " stim - test " and the " acquaintance - test . "
He presented me with the numbers test , told me to lie , then ran the charts .
He was very positive at this point ñ proclaimed that I had strong reactions to lying ( laying the groundwork for the interrogation that would come soon ) .
He explained to me that I was a highly qualified candidate , and that I obviously had the skills needed for the agency , and that I would be an asset to the team to which I was assigned .
He smiled a lot and reassured me that this was just a minor detail , and that the main purpose of the exam was to " establish my credibility . "
He then asked me to share with him any concerns that I had about the test .
I did ñ
I explained that I was nervous and that I really wanted the job , so I was looking forward to finishing this task .
Both admissions were mistakes .
I should have kept my mouth shut .
Since I had nothing in my past to be overly concerned about , I just figured I would press onward , and explained that there was nothing in my past that was derogatory , and that my current TS / SCI is a testament to this fact .
So the test began , as all polygraphs do ñ by affixing and attaching the sensors .
I immediately noticed the extreme pressure in my left arm from the blood pressure cuff ñ it was unbearable , but as I felt my hand go numb , and saw it turn purple , I said nothing .
Prepared myself to answer his questions honestly and accurately .
He asked me only 3 relevant questions :
" Did you intentionally misrepresent yourself on any of the forms you filed ? "
" Have you ever committed a violent crime as I described it at the beginning of the session ? "
" Have you ever been involved in or party to an armed robbery ? "
He mixed these questions with probable - lie control questions such as : " Did you ever steal anything from an employer ? " and " Is there anything in your background that you are afraid that our investigator might find out ? " as well as irrelevant questions like : " Is this the month of January ? " " Are we in the United States ? " etc .
He ran my charts twice , assuring me that this was SOP , and then left the room for 30 minutes .
When he returned , he was extremely bellicose and said " You are not doing well on this exam at all .
In fact , it appears that you have committed a violent crime since your eighteenth birthday , because the machine never lies and you had strong reactions to this question both times . "
Then I knew I was done .
Since I have never committed even a minor crime ( like shoplifting ) , much less a serious crime , I was not sure how to proceed .
For two hours , he screamed at me " I think you are hiding something from me .
I think you have committed a violent crime , and are not reporting it to me . "
After I reiterated my experimental drug use , and speeding violations , he said : " No , this is not right .
You are deceiving me , because the machine said that you have committed a violent crime , so why do n't you just tell me what you did , and we can get on with this test and get you one step closer to the job of your dreams .
Remember , nothing leaves this room , and your secrets are safe with me .
But in order to proceed with the test , you need to tell me the violent crime that you were either involved in or committed . "
After 1 hour , I began to get agitated and irritated .
I asked to see the empirical evidence , and for an explanation of the charts that " prove " this absolutely inaccurate accusation .
I then attempted to reason with my polygrapher ñ
I said : " OK , you have my LOC ( Letter of Clearance ) in front of you , you therefore are fully aware that I have already obtained a TS / SCI , and that my record is clean .
Logically then , you cannot accuse me of such a horrible crime . "
I said furthermore , " since this is the career I have always wanted , you should be able to logically deduce that I would not commit a crime , simply because I understand the rigorous selection procedures for this agency . "
He then got visibly agitated : " You can not use logic to get out of this exam .
You have to confess to me the crime you committed , and you have to do it soon , if you wish to be invited back for another re-examination I think with your computer skills you have robbed a bank or viewed pornography , and that you are lying to me about it .
The CIA does not want folks like yourself working for them .
You are not suitable for the caliber of employee they seek . "
Laughing , I explained that what he had just said made no sense whatsoever , and that he should contact my neighbors right now , and call the other clearance granting agency to verify my veracity in my statements .
I should add that my TS / SCI was granted on November 1 , 2006 ñ so it is not even 3 months old !!!
Frustrated , he left the room for 20 minutes .
When he returned , he explained , " I have reviewed your charts with my colleagues , and there is clearly evidence of deception .
You have blown the opportunity of a lifetime simply because you will not tell me the truth , and confess to the violent crime that you have committed .
I am not going to invite you back for another polygraph , and your chart has been marked DI for Deception Indicated .
You will therefore not be able to proceed with the security screening for the CIA .
All you had to do was to tell me what it was that you did , and we could have put this behind us , but instead you chose to lie .
I hope you realize the seriousness of what you have done here today . "
I proceed to go off on the polygrapher .
I explained to him the pure folly of polygraphy , and how science has no respect for the art or the practitioners of the art , and that he was lying to me .
I then turned toward the two - way mirror and remarked " This is why we have a crisis with Arabic and Farsi speakers in this country .
It is because you like many agencies place all of your faith in this ridiculous assessment tool .
All I ever wanted to do was help , all I ever wanted to do was to apply my talents to the war on terror , and all I wanted to do was serve my country in a way that seemed most appropriate for my age , experience level and education .
Shame on you , and your process . "
So despite being completely truthful , and trying to be nice and reason with the polygrapher , I still was not allowed to proceed to the next step .
For that matter , I was not even offered a second chance .
I failed the test , and I was telling the truth , the whole time about everything !!!
Then I turned toward the polygrapher , and explained to him he had absolutely no right to interrogate me for the length of time he did over what are likely questionable " results " on the charts , and that I would be reporting his behavior and unnecessary badgering to my congressman , and anybody else who would listen .
I further told him that I wished nothing but bad luck for him and his pitiful career .
He then asked me to leave , in a very loud tone .
Throwing off the polygraph gear , and accidentally dumping my bottle of water on his desk , I left .
I then called my POC and self - selected myself out of the process , deciding that NO job in the world is worth this aggravation .
I will never take a polygraph again , and like so many other posters here , was a highly qualified candidate for this line of work .
The polygrapher was out of line , and exam proves nothing , and there is nothing I or anybody who subjects themselves to the test can do , but deal with the outcome .
Please do n't read this as a polemic against anything except the polygraph and the polygraph process .
It most certainly is not .
Instead use this as a cautionary tale that even if you tell the truth 100 % , and even if you have the necessary patriotic zeal , you can still be blocked from the job of your dreams by the usage of this antiquated evaluation method .
I am still very patriotic , and still want to help - only I am not sure how to do so now .
I will likely keep teaching , and hopefully by being an educator , I can do my bit of good for the greater good of US national security .
“ Parts of Launchpad are already free software , we ’ve released pieces that we knew would help other projects like Gnome doing similar work .
We ’ll continue releasing pieces until , in a few years , the whole platform can be made free .
If hackers are interested in helping to componentize a huge monolithic Zope3 app , we could release the Registry and Rosetta as standalone pieces a lot sooner . ”
Canonical ’s Launchpad.net is currently not free software .
The FAQ on the site explains no more than this .
I contacted Mark Shuttleworth about it and he told me this :
He says the FAQ will be updated to reflect this .
So , conspiracy over .
Unless you want to discuss the wording of “ can be made free ” rather than perhaps “ will be ” .
Mr. Shuttleworth has yet to deny eating babies .
PIMPAGE : newworldodour.co.uk is a satirical news site I ’m involved in and it seems to be currently in the throes of a reawakening *
Whenever I hear the phrase " studies prove " this or that , it makes me think back to the beginning of my career as an economist at the Labor Department in Washington .
Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg was scheduled to appear before Congress to argue in favor of some policy that the Labor Department wanted enacted into law .
Down at the bottom of the chain of command , I was given four sets of census data that had not yet been published and was told to analyze these data for a report to go to the Secretary of Labor .
Two of these sets of data seemed to support the Labor Department 's position but the other two went counter to it .
When I wrote up a paper explaining why this was so and concluded that the statistics overall were inconclusive , there was much dismay among those in the hierarchy between me and the Secretary .
They were also puzzled as to why anyone would write up such a paper , knowing what the Department 's position was on the issues .
They took my paper , edited and rewrote it before passing it up the chain of command .
Secretary Goldberg then made his usual confident presentation of the rewritten study to Congress , probably unaware of the contradictory data that had been left out .
It was a valuable experience so early in my career to learn that what " studies prove " is often whatever those who did the studies wanted to prove .
Labor Department studies " prove " whatever serves the interest of the Labor Department , just as Agriculture Department studies " prove " whatever serves the Department of Agriculture 's interests .
It is the same story on the other side of the Atlantic , where a new book about Britain 's criminal justice system exposes the fraudulent methods used to generate statistics about the " success " of various programs of alternatives to imprisonment .
The book is titled " A Land Fit for Criminals " by David Fraser .
The numbers may be accurate but the definition of " success " makes them meaningless .
When a criminal is put on probation and the probation is not revoked for a violation , that is " success . "
Unfortunately , the British criminal justice system does not automatically revoke probation when a criminal commits a new crime .
A criminal on two years ' probation can commit a crime after six months , be convicted and sentenced -- and , after serving his sentence , go back to completing the remaining 18 months of his probation , producing statistical " success " for the probation program .
That is the whole point of the " study . "
On either side of the Atlantic , it is a terminal case of naivete to put statistical studies under the control of the same government agencies whose policies are being studied .
Nor will it do any good to let those agencies farm out these studies to " independent " researchers in academia or think tanks because they will obviously farm them out to people whose track record virtually guarantees that they will reach the conclusions that the agency wants .
Climate expert Richard S. Lindzen of M.I.T. has indicated that the vast amount of government research money available for studies of " global warming " can discourage skeptics from being vocal about their skepticism .
This is not peculiar to studies of " global warming . "
Many people who complain about the corrupting influence of money never seem to apply that to government money .
If high government officials were serious about wanting to know the facts , they could set up an independent statistical agency , along the lines of the General Accounting Office , to do studies of the effects of the policies of the operating agencies .
That would mean that the fox would no longer be in charge of the hen house , whether the fox was the Labor Department , the Commerce Department , or any of the other departments and agencies .
It would also mean that various bright ideas originating in Congress or the White House would now be exposed to the risk of being shown to be costly failures or even counterproductive .
Whole careers could be ruined among both elected officials and bureaucrats .
Do n't hold your breath waiting for it to happen .
But do keep that in mind when someone says " studies prove . . . "
Digital Kayak Data Insecurity Communicating through screens puts distance between people .
The people you deal with become less real as a result .
By Adrian Duyzer
Published March 18 , 2006
A few months ago , I was approached by a company looking for an upgrade to their web - based business management system .
I requested administrative access to the system so I could prepare a proper estimate for the work , which they granted .
I soon found a major security problem : the passwords in their database were unencrypted , which meant I could read them easily .
Most people use the same password for every website they belong to , including their online email accounts .
That means this information could have given me access to the email accounts of hundreds of complete strangers .
That could lead to emails from financial institutions and government .
Fraud and identity theft could follow close behind .
Security
In the age of the " war on terror " , we 've become accustomed to hearing that word as justification for almost anything .
In February , the Christian Science Monitor reported :
The US government is developing a massive computer system that can collect huge amounts of data and , by linking far - flung information from blogs and e-mail to government records and intelligence reports , search for patterns of terrorist activity .
The system - parts of which are operational , parts of which are still under development - is already credited with helping to foil some plots .
It is the federal government 's latest attempt to use broad data - collection and powerful analysis in the fight against terrorism .
But by delving deeply into the digital minutiae of American life , the program is also raising concerns that the government is intruding too deeply into citizens ' privacy .
The privacy of non-Americans , on the other hand , is of little concern .
Much , if not most , of the world 's Internet traffic is routed through hubs in the United States .
Secretive American agencies are monitoring vast amounts of this voice and data traffic .
They are already directly - and illegally , or at least extra-legally - spying on thousands of Americans , and monitoring the communications of millions more .
There is nothing to hold them back from spying on you .
There are ways to protect privacy in spite of this monitoring , but the sloppiness that gave me access to the email addresses and passwords of hundreds of strangers trumps even sophisticated security measures .
Free Music
When people find out I have a little knowledge about the Internet , I often get asked about the best way to download music online .
The best way to download music - and movies , software , audio books and anything else that can be encoded into 0s and 1s - is to install a BitTorrent client like Azureus , configure it , and then head on over to the Pirate Bay .
Unfortunately for many but luckily for the RIAA , this is just too complicated for the average person .
But there are still some easy ways to find free music online .
One is to use Google as described on tech - recipes .
Because those instructions might be a little confusing to some , I created this simple page to make it easier .
The search technique used on that page , which is somewhat like a crude version of high - tech spy agency data mining techniques , can be used to find all sorts of files , including some that are personal and even confidential .
I was trying out the music search page , and I came across a small selection of freely available music files at www.securipho.be/files/3/.
People are predictable .
If someone has a folder called files / 3 / , perhaps there is also a directory called files / 4/.
www.securipho.be/files/4/ contains a bunch of personal documents , including an advisory on Cuban money and a letter giving 30 days notice before vacating a rental property .
What else might be there for anyone to see ?
Distancing
People behave differently when they 're online than they do in real life .
Communicating through screens puts distance between people .
The people you deal with become less real as a result .
Most people would n't read someone else 's mail .
When I told you I had stumbled across someone 's personal files online , did you click the link to see what they were ?
Did you look more closely at any of them ?
It 's easy to do when click and you 're intruding on someone 's privacy .
The proprietors of voyeur websites know this well enough .
Any internet pornographer would tell you that people are less inhibited online .
The automated data - mining programs run by agencies like the American Department of Homeland Security put another layer of distance between citizen and watcher .
All it takes is click and the US government is scanning the private information of millions , perhaps even billions , of people .
This ought to concern you , especially since the phrase " If Allah wills it , I will make the delivery tomorrow , " which sounds pretty suspicious to me , was transmitted to your computer the moment you loaded this page .
They could be on to you right now .
Disclaimer
The " personal files " I linked to above are n't real .
They 're on a server my company pays for .
The website name was registered today .
However , the situation I described did happen .
I came across a stash of music and then a stash of personal files while looking for music files , just as I described , including the way the folders were organized .
But I did n't think the owner of the files would appreciate me pointing out his error publicly , so I made up a site and put some fake documents on it .
Of course , I could n't resist making it a little more dramatic .
I believe that takes this article out of the memoir category and into the fiction - based - on - a - true - story category .
Put a sticker on it , Ryan .

Here is a quote from a British security contractor in Iraq about his American counterparts : " I hate those bastards more than the scumbag insurgents . "
A British colonel recently returned from a tour in the country said that , in our next war , he would sooner fight alongside the Russians than the US .
This is another quote from a British security contractor : " The American way is not my way .
I do n't mind a scrap but I draw the line at mooning the enemy and inviting him to shoot at my backside , and that 's virtually what the Yanks are doing .
I 'm also convinced that many Americans hate the Iraqis , not just the insurgents but all Iraqis ...
What a mess . "
Those last lines are taken from a rather good new book about the experience of Iraq today , Highway To Hell , written by an ex-SAS man who signs himself John Geddes .
My point in all the above , is to show that Ben Griffin , the former SAS soldier who vents his dismay about what is happening to Iraq in today 's Sunday Telegraph , is not a lone voice .
There is a widespread belief in both British special forces and line regiments that American tactics are heavy - handed and counter - productive ; that firepower continues to be used as a substitute for a " hearts and minds " policy ; that local people will never be persuaded to support Coalition forces unless Americans , in uniform and out , treat ordinary Iraqis vastly better than they do today .
Historical parallels should be cited cautiously .
But it is impossible to study any informed critique - including some written by Americans - of operations in Iraq without recalling the Vietnam debacle .
There , too , most Americans treated ordinary Vietnamese with contempt , whatever their political allegiance .
American convoys forced Vietnamese vehicles off the road , killed peasant livestock with impunity , brought down fire on suspected enemy positions heedless of civilians in the target zone , and treated even educated , professional Vietnamese with condescension .
All this is being repeated in Iraq , with predictable and identical consequences .
Iraqis feel a bitter resentment towards foreign troops , whom few would call liberators without irony .
US special forces are perceived as behaving , if anything , worse than line combat units because they have a wider and more aggressive mandate , an intensely macho ethos , and less accountability .
" I 've had conversations with many [ US security contractors ] and regular US soldiers who are evangelical Christians , " writes John Geddes , the ex-SAS soldier quoted above , " who see themselves in a crusade against the Muslim hordes .
In my view , they 're not much different to the Iraqi militiamen and foreign fighters who see themselves at the heart of a jihad against the Christian crusaders . "
In fairness , we should acknowledge that when Britain was " top nation " in the last days of empire , the British Army was sometimes less good at " hearts and minds " than we delude ourselves .
Things happened in Kenya during the Mau Mau insurgency , in Cyprus , Aden and elsewhere that would today result in an orgy of war crimes trials .
Counter - insurgency experts and many special forces officers of all nationalities would assert that it is impossible to fight a campaign of the kind being waged in Iraq with completely clean hands .
The enemy strives to goad or deceive Coalition forces into actions that will harm innocents .
In Northern Ireland , the British Army learned over 30 years how hard it is to fight insurgents without alienating the civil population .
In Iraq , the problem is multiplied many times by the gulf of language and culture , and by the fact that the declared allied aims are probably unattainable .
With wholly inadequate forces on the ground , the Americans and British are striving to hold the country together as a unitary state ; to restore economic and social activity ; and to enable local forces to provide security against criminality as well as terrorism .
All this , in place where historically law and order has been enforced exclusively by terror , torture and summary execution .
There is a further dimension , even more fundamental .
From the day the first American forces crossed the border into Iraq in 2003 , neither they nor their government have resolved the issue of whether they are there to serve Iraqi interests , or those of the United States .
Whatever Washington may say , most Americans think they are working for their own country .
From President Bush downwards , the doctrine has been propagated that every insurgent engaged and killed in Iraq is one less to assault the US homeland .
" Force protection " - the welfare of those wearing US uniforms - is the governing factor in any tactical situation .
Only a tiny handful of American servicemen have been disciplined , far less put on trial , for excesses in combat that have cost civilian lives .
All this makes many British servicemen feel as uncomfortable as Ben Griffin .
Because there is only around one British soldier in Iraq for every 20 Americans , it is hardly surprising that our influence on policy and tactics is small .
We have the worst of both worlds : responsibility in the eyes of international opinion , but precious little power to determine events .
It is often justly said that the US army respects the British , and in particular our special forces .
But mass matters , and we do not have it .
There is no way of getting around this .
If Britain , with its tiny armed forces , chooses to engage alongside the US in Iraq or anywhere else , we should never again delude ourselves - as have so many British prime ministers - that the mere fact of throwing a few chips on the table will enable us to call the turn of the wheel .
Reading all that I have written above , I dislike it because British bleating about our position vis a vis the United States sounds so unattractive .
There is a case for putting up and shutting up , acknowledging that we are in Iraq whether we like it or not , and should simply persevere .
Yet are the things true , said by people like Ben Griffin and John Geddes ?
The answer is almost certainly " Yes " .
They are what make it so hard to be optimistic about Iraq and what our forces are trying to do there , hanging on to American coat tails .
AMP Section Name : War & Disaster Profiteering
Conventional wisdom holds that the horrific crash of the Concorde in 2000 along with the post - 9/11 aviation slump finally grounded the world ’s only supersonic passenger jet for good .
But as a business , the Concorde never really took off .
A limited - run product of state - controlled manufacturers ( Aerospatiale and British Aircraft Corporation ) , the Concorde was sold to then - state - controlled airlines ( British Airways and Air France ) , which viewed the plane as a loss leader .
The Mach 2 bird was good for branding , but window - rattling sonic booms confined it to traveling over oceans , and coaxing 100 passengers to fill the narrow seats at full fare proved impossible .
Despite this precedent ( and half a dozen even less successful attempts to put supersonic passenger jets into service ) , two US companies now think they can make high - speed flight commercially viable .
The trick , it seems , is to focus on the richest of the rich .
Supersonic Aerospace International , founded by J. Michael Paulson , son of Gulfstream founder Allen E. Paulson , has hired Lockheed Martin ’s Skunk Works to design a 12 - seat private jet shaped to minimize sonic booms .
Projected development cost : $ 2.5 billion .
Meanwhile , Aerion , backed by the Bass family of Texas , is spending roughly $ 2 billion to build a fast ( Mach 1.6 ) 12 - seater that will likewise comply with noise regulations .
The planes could begin boarding as early as 2013 and 2012 , respectively .
It ’s easy to bet that neither effort will succeed .
What makes these startups think they can turn supersonic flight into a profitable business in just a few years when countries have tried and failed to do so for decades ?
It ’s also easy to be cynical about the attempt .
Why waste resources on really fast jets to shuttle CEOs between far - flung vacation homes ?
But both businesses just might work , and you should cheer them on .
They may be the best chance we have of seeing commercial supersonic travel return in our lifetime .
The business case for the planes presumes sales of 300 such jets over 10 years at $ 80 million each - a $ 24 billion market .
Analysts say that , given recent trends , such assumptions are n’t unreasonable .
The private - jet business has risen from $ 3 billion in deliveries in 1996 to about $ 16 billion in 2006 ( bigger than the market for fighter planes ) .
Boeing and Airbus each produce about 10 luxury jets for private use annually , which sell for $ 45 million to $ 60 million apiece , while Gulfstream produces 30 to 35 planes a year that go for $ 45 million or more a pop .
Yes , the market needs to grow to meet SAI and Aerion ’s expectations .
But it does seem that selling a handful of seats to the filthy rich might be more economically feasible than selling hundreds of seats to the merely rich .
And it will be far better to have supersonic travel in the hands of nimble , bottom - line driven companies than sclerotic , state - backed behemoths .
Remember , most leaps in communications and transportation technology started as a tools for the ultrawealthy .
Sending data on the first trans- atlantic telegraph cable cost $ 10 a word - in 1866 .
Twenty years later , telegraphic services were widely available to owners of small businesses .
Henry Ford ’s Model A listed for $ 850 in 1903 .
By the 1920s , the Model T went for about $ 265 and could be bought on credit .
When it comes to technology , trickle - down theory actually does apply .
Still , only competition can start that trickle flowing , and private supersonic aviation wo n’t get really interesting until there are 15 greedy entrepreneurs buzzing around that $ 24 billion market .
We need a few ambitious investors to fund supersonic plane production on par with how Union Pacific , Northern Pacific , and Atchison , Topeka & Santa Fe laid tracks in the 19th century or how Global Crossing , Worldcom , and others threaded fiber - optic cables in the 1990s .
Many of these enterprises would fail .
But in the process , they ’d drive prices lower , develop products and services quickly , and gain economies of scale .
Then , and only then , would risk - averse pterodactyls like Boeing and Airbus be willing to take another swing at jetting you from New York to LA in two and a half hours .

There was a real breakthrough in quantum algorithms last week — though you would n’t have known about it from reading Slashdot , Yahoo News , The Economist , or ( for that matter ) this blog .
Farhi , Goldstone , and Gutmann — the feared MIT trio — announced a quantum algorithm for evaluating NAND trees in O ( √ N ) time .
This solves a problem that I worked on as an undergrad nine years ago (! ) , and that many a tyro had unsuccessfully tackled since .
Alright , so suppose we ’ve got this ant at the root of a complete binary tree :
You and your friend take turns moving the ant : first you can move it either down - and - left or down - and - right , then your friend can make the same choice , then you , etc .
If the ant ends up at a sugar cube , you win the game ; if it ends up at a boot , your friend wins .
( Your friend is an exterminator . )
In the above example , it ’s not hard to see that you ’re the one with a winning strategy .
But more generally , we can imagine a tree d levels deep , with an arbitrary sequence of N=2d boots and sugar cubes at the leaf vertices .
Then the question is : how many of the leaf vertices do you have to examine , in order to decide whether you or your friend has the win ?
The goal here is to model games of alternation like chess and go , abstracting away the details .
The boots and sugar cubes correspond to losing and winning board positions .
Then we want to know : how many board positions would a computer have to evaluate , in order to play the game perfectly ?
It ’s clear that you generally do n’t have to examine all the positions .
For example , suppose that at some position where it ’s your turn to move , you discover a move that always lets you win .
Then you do n’t care what happens if you make any other move from that position .
Based on this idea ( which AI types call alpha - beta pruning ) , in 1986 Saks and Wigderson gave a randomized algorithm to find an optimal move in the ant game , after examining ( on average ) only N0.753 of the N leaf vertices .
( Here 0.753 ≈ log 2 ( 1+√33 ) - 2. )
On the other hand , they also showed that this running time was optimal for randomized algorithms with no error .
Then , in 1995 , Santha showed that it was optimal even for randomized algorithms with error .
Alright , but what about the quantum case ?
It was observed early on ( by a simple reduction from the PARITY problem ) that any quantum algorithm for playing the ant game would have to examine at least √N of the N leaf vertices .
But was a √ N running time achievable ?
Until last week , we knew of no quantum algorithm that did even slightly better than the classical bound of N0.753 .
And now it ’s time to eat some crow : I did n’t believe there was such a quantum algorithm .
I thought N0.753 was optimal .
In my defense , though , this was never really a very serious belief , in contrast to ( say ) my belief that quantum computers can’t solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
Really I only claimed N0.753 was optimal to try and goad people into proving me wrong .
And today , I ’m pleased to report that my strategy was successful .
Last Wednesday , Farhi , Goldstone , and Gutmann put out a preprint showing how to find an optimal move for the ant game in time O ( √ ( N log N ) ) .
However , their algorithm only worked in the “ Hamiltonian oracle model , ” a fanciful idealization preferred by physicists in which time is ( get this ) continuous rather than discrete .
Two days later , Childs , Cleve , Jordan , and Yeung showed how to port the algorithm to the ordinary discrete model , except that there the running time goes up to N1 / 2+ ε for any ε>0 .
Then , just yesterday , Farhi , Goldstone , and Gutmann improved the running time in the Hamiltonian oracle model to the optimal O ( √N ) .
One hopes and expects that further improvements in the discrete model are forthcoming .
Another obvious question is whether any game tree can be evaluated in O ( √N ) time , not just the complete binary tree used in the ant game .
Since the complete binary tree was previously considered the “ hardest ” case , the natural conjecture would be yes .
Years ago , David Deutsch gave an interview in which he illustrated Grover ’s algorithm using chess .
I emailed Deutsch to point out that this was a bad example : at the time , we we had no idea how to get a Grover speedup for games of alternation with small branching factor .
Deutsch dutifully posted a correction .
Now I guess I ’ll have to email him again , to tell him one can get a “ Grover ” speedup for games like chess after all .
I put “ Grover ” in quotes because , even though the Farhi - Goldstone - Gutmann algorithm achieves a square - root speedup , it does n’t actually look anything like Grover ’s algorithm .
Instead it ’s based on a quantum walk ( reminiscent of this paper ) , which is analyzed using tools from scattering theory .
Apparently , physics occasionally does come in handy for quantum computing .
All in all , this business with NAND trees has only confirmed my core belief about theoretical computer science : that there are no miracles , except when there are .
As 2006 draws to a close we present some of the most striking images from around the world .
Now that we ’ve more - or - less defined “ design , ” since the working title of this series is Great Design , I better come up with a working definition of “ great . ”
Just about every product category has its blue - chip , gold - plated stars .
Movie stars ?
Brad Pitt .
Best rock song of all time ?
Sweet Home , Alabama , of course .
Office chairs ?
The Herman Miller Aeron .
Portable MP3 players ?
Clearly the Apple iPod .
What do these products have in common ?
Brad Pitt can attract millions of people to the box office .
He ’s very good looking , and very charismatic , and it ’s not even clear if he can act , but who cares ?
Sweet Home , Alabama is one of the catchiest songs of all time .
It ’s extremely popular despite the fact that it ’s impossible to sing or hum ( the refrain requires harmony ) , the melody is awkward , and the lyrics include a couple of reprehensible lines defending Alabama ’s racist and segregationalist governor George Wallace , but few people really notice the flaws , they just enjoy the song .
The Aeron chair became the symbol of high end office chairs .
It ’s expensive and looks like a giant cockroach , but when the directors of 24 need to show the canonical “ super luxury office chair ” for the White House , they use an Aeron .
And finally , the iPod .
Ah , the iPod .
It ’s way more expensive than any competitive MP3 player .
It has fewer features than the competition .
The iPod nano , the tiny one that everybody ’s raving about , is the only product I ’ve ever seen that can be scratched beyond all recognition just by touching it lightly with your finger , and the shiny mirror back will be permanently covered in greasy fingerprint smudges from the moment you take it out of the elegant package until the battery wears out and you have to throw away the whole thing and buy another .
But who cares ?
The blue chip product in every category can usually be thought of as being popular despite obvious design flaws .
Weird .
As the design gets better and better , as the product becomes more and more suitable to its users needs , it becomes more likely to be chosen by customers .
So the 40GB MP3 player , all else being equal , will outsell the 20 GB MP3 player .
The easy - to - use phone will outsell the hard - to - use phone .
All else being equal .
That part is not weird .
But that only gets you so far , as Creative , makers of the unloved ZEN MP3 players , are learning the hard way .
Despite having products that are better than the iPod by just about every reasonable metric , they are unable to even come close to Apple iPod ’s dominant market share .
They ’re cheaper .
They have more memory .
They support more file formats .
Etc. Does n’t matter : they still have single - digit market share while iPod is probably in the 80s somewhere .
That ’s because good design can only take you so far .
Getting every aspect of the design perfect , making a usable product , making the right tradeoffs between price and functionality , between flexibility and ease of use , between weight and battery life , etc. , etc. , etc. , is all really important , but the most it can possibly get you is to # 2 .
It ’s like beauty .
A wannabe model can be tall , with a perfectly symmetrical face , beautiful skin , lovely eyes , and perfectly straight white teeth , and still be considered unattractive .
On the other hand , you can have a gigantic broken nose , or be completely lacking in eyebrows , or have a giant gap between your two front teeth , and still be People Magazine ’s Sexiest Whatever of the Year .
How do you get to be # 1 ?
That ’s the mystery here .
And since certain markets ( graphical operating systems , online auctions , and apparently MP3 players ) seem to be winner - take - all markets , being # 2 or # 3 may not be good enough .
So this is what I ’m talking about when I say “ Great Design . ”
It ’s that ineffable quality that certain incredibly successful products have that makes people fall in love with them despite their flaws .
It ’s extremely hard to pull off .
I sure as heck ca n’t do it .
But , if you bear with me , I think I have some theories as to what ’s happening .
While these theories do not exactly add up to a recipe for making good products into great products , they may give you a clue as to what ’s going on when people go crazy about the Aeron chair or Julia Roberts .
Here ’s the overall plan for this series of articles .
First , I ’m going to go through good design , namely , all the things you should know to get your design adequate given the current state of the art .
Ease of use is a fundamental part of that so I ’ll spend a lot of time on usability .
Later , once I ’ve got all the obvious things taken care of , you ’ll have a really usable design and one which meets your customers ’ needs , and in fact , if you pay more attention to these usability things than your competitors , you may have the best design , but that ’s not going to get you to # 1 .
“ Every time I read Jakob Nielsen , ” I wrote in 2000 , “ I get this feeling that he really does n’t appreciate that usability is not the most important thing on earth .
Sure , usability is important ( I wrote a whole book about it ) .
But it is simply not everyone ’s number one priority , nor should it be .
You get the feeling that if Mr. Nielsen designed a singles bar , it would be well lit , clean , with giant menus printed in Arial 14 point , and you ’d never have to wait to get a drink .
But nobody would go there ; they would all be at Coyote Ugly Saloon pouring beer on each other . ”
So in the final articles , roughly the last third of the series , I ’ll peek under the covers at the black magic of great design .
You may not be able to pull it off .
It takes real talent , not just hard work .
But at least I hope you ’ll recognize some of the things that are going on that make certain gadgets , software , songs , movie stars , and office chairs make that leap from merely throroughly good to truly and significantly great .
Note
I ’ve put up a very high - level index of the articles in this series .
The list of upcoming articles may change and be rearranged a bit by the time I get there , and I may not deliver them all in order , but this is the general , big picture outline of what ’s coming .
You may recognize many of the chapters from the online edition , or the longer printed edition , of User Interface Design for Programmers .
Those chapters will be expanded , updated , and reevaluated but the key ideas will remain the same .
The paragraph about Sweet Home Alabama has been reworded since I posted it yesterday .
US senator Charles Schumer says some videogames aimed at kids " desensitize them to death and destruction . "
But dire pronouncements about new forms of entertainment are old hat .
It goes like this : Young people embrace an activity .
Adults condemn it .
The kids grow up , no better or worse than their elders , and the moral panic subsides .
Then the whole cycle starts over .
Here 's how the establishment has greeted past scourges .
Novels
" The free access which many young people have to romances , novels , and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth ; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge .
Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet ; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind , whether they are furnished with salutary food , or with trash , chaff , or poison ? "
- Reverend Enos Hitchcock , Memoirs of the Bloomsgrove Family , 1790
The Waltz
" The indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced ... at the English Court on Friday last ...
It is quite sufficient to cast one 's eyes on the voluptuous interétwining of the limbs , and close comépressure of the bodies ... to see that it is far indeed removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females .
So long as this obscene display was conéfined to prostitutes and adulteresses , we did not think it deserving of notice ; but now that it is ... forced on the respectable classes of society by the evil example of their superiors , we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion . "
- The Times of London , 1816
Movies
" This new form of entertainment has gone far to blast maidenhood ...
Depraved adults with candies and pennies beguile children with the inevitable result .
The Society has prosecuted many for leading girls astray through these picture shows , but GOD alone knows how many are leading dissolute lives begun at the ' moving pictures . ' "
- The Annual Report of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , 1909
The Telephone
" Does the telephone make men more active or more lazy ?
Does [ it ] break up home life and the old practice of visiting friends ? "
- Survey conducted by the Knights of Columbus Adult Education Committee , San Francisco Bay Area , 1926
Comic Books
" Many adults think that the crimes described in comic books are so far removed from the child 's life that for children they are merely something imaginative or fantastic .
But we have found this to be a great error .
Comic books and life are connected .
A bank robbery is easily translated into the rifling of a candy store .
Delinquencies formerly restricted to adults are increasingly committed by young people and children ...
All child drug addicts , and all children drawn into the narcotics traffic as messengers , with whom we have had contact , were inveterate comic - book readers
This kind of thing is not good mental nourishment for children ! "
- Fredric Wertham , Seduction of the Innocent , 1954
Rock and Roll
" The effect of rock and roll on young people , is to turn them into devil worshippers ; to stimulate self - expression through sex ; to provoke lawlessness ; impair nervous stability and destroy the sanctity of marriage .
It is an evil influence on the youth of our country . "
- Minister Albert Carter , 1956
Videogames
" The disturbing material in Grand Theft Auto and other games like it is stealing the innocence of our children and it's making the difficult job of being a parent even harder ...
I believe that the ability of our children to access pornographic and outrageously violent material on video games rated for adults is spiraling out of control . "
- US senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , 2005

Microsoft weist in einem Update seiner Warnung zur jüngst entdeckten Lücke ( createTextRange ) im Internet Explorer darauf hin , dass bereits erste Webseiten über dieses Leck versuchen , PCs der Besucher mit Schadcode zu infizieren .
Websense , Hersteller von Sicherheitssoftware , bestätigt dies in einer eigenen Meldung , will aber bis Sonntag bereits 200 Seiten gezählt haben .
Mittlerweile dürfte die Zahl weiter gestiegen sein .

How Easily Can Your Brain Be Fooled ?
One of my favorite subjects involving investing are the intellectual errors we humans engage in on regular basis .
Most of these foibles are built into our " wetware . "
The combination of evolutionary developments and our natural tendencies to seek pleasure and avoid pain have led to certain behavioral patterns that undermine our best efforts as investors .
As we pointed out in Know Thyself , when it comes to investing , we humans just ai n't built for it .
Whenever I get questioned on that , I refer to Thomas Gilovich 's book " How We Know What Is n't So . "
Gilovich , a psychology prof a Cornell , details many of the cognitive errors we unknowingly engage in .
People regularly push back on this , believing they are rational ( or mostly rational ) and are free from preconceived biases .
This is , of course , utter nonsense .
I often come across non-investing examples of how much of our behavior is hardwired and chemical , and where we engage in unconscious automatic tendencies .
Our behavior is impacted by factors which we are wholly unaware of .
While this may not appear to directly correlate to markets and trading , they indirectly show how easily our brains can be fooled .
A fascinating example I came across recently this involves food , diet , and how we eat .
Typical diet plans focus on what we eat : fat content , calories , quantity , and exercise ( Note that the diet industry is estimated to be $ 40 - 100 B per year ) .
It turns out our brains regulate our food consumption in ways we are not conscious of .
Often , environmental cues will influence our food intake .
Brian Wansink ( also of Cornell ) has been called the " Sherlock Holmes of Food . "
He is the director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab , and is the author of Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think .
Wansink claims that our minds make more than 200 food - related decisions a day -- most of them without any actual thought .
It turns out the circumstances of consumption greatly impact how much we consume .
Consider these example from Wansink and Mindless Eating :
Container size influences how much we eat : Moviegoers given five - day - old stale popcorn still ate 53 % more if it was served in a big bucket than a small bucket .
Size of a serving bowl , a plate , or a package has repeatedly been shown to bias how much a person serves himself and eats by an average of 20 - 30 % .
Glass Shapes : Because of visual illusions , people ( even bartenders ) pour 28 % more liquid into a short wide glasses than tall ones .
We eat more if we like what we 're drinking :
In one study , diners drank the same wine but 1 / 2 were told it was from California , and the other 1/ 2 were told it was North Dakota wine ( No , ND does not make wine ) .
Those who thought they were drinking California wine ate 11 % more food .
Bulk Purchases : 50 % of the snack foods bought in bulk ( such as at a warehouse club store ) are eaten within 6 days of when it is purchased ( Wansink and his Food and Brand Lab have been credited with the discovery of the 100 calorie packs )
Names of a food can create either positive or negative predispositions that can unfairly bias a person 's perceived taste of a food .
Self Service : A person will eat an average of 92 % of any food they serve themselves .
We do n't pay attention to the extras : 31 % of people leaving an Italian restaurant could n't remember how much bread they ate ; 12 % of the bread eaters denied having eaten any bread at all .
We eat more if the evidence is removed :
In a study of chicken - wing eaters , waitresses removed the bones from half the tables while letting them stack up on the other half .
The diners who still had piles of bones on their plates ate 28 % less .
Too much variety makes us overeat : Snackers were given bowls of M&Ms with either 7 or 10 colors of the candy .
Snackers with 10 color options ate an average of 43 more candies than those with just 7 colors to choose from .
Proximity of candy on one ’s desk has been shown to double how much a person eats over the course of a day Friends make you eat more :
You 'll eat 35 % more dining with a friend than when eating alone .
Even worse , a person will double the amount of food ingested when dining in a group of 7 or more .
Eating fast makes you consume more calories : Consider this University of Rhode Island study on diet : researchers showed the speed at which we eat influences caloric intake .
Faster eaters consumed on average 67 more calories then when they ate slowly .
That 's about seven pounds of per year .
( People also reported feeling more full after eating slowly ) .
What does this have to do with markets and investing ?
It turns out , a whole lot .
Many of our behaviors and belief systems are based upon elements we are wholly unaware of .
We believe in myths , make false assumptions , overtrade , and engage in many investing behaviors that are destructive -- most of the time completely oblivious to them .
Investors are well served if they become aware of these tendencies -- and take steps to avoid fooling their own brains .

There 's a book titled " Cutting Consciousness Down to Size " that , while not wonderfully written or organized , has some amazing material in it about how unconscious we are all the time .
It 's very hard for people to accept or even acknowledge that possibility - but the book has some incontrovertible studies that show it .

And we want to hear what you think about it — what reasons and examples should we be stressing ?
From Thinkprogress .
Via Muckraker , U.S. News reports that “ just a week after E- mails in the U.S. attorneys case became a main focus of congressional Democrats probing the firings , several aides said that they stopped using the White House system except for purely professional correspondence . ”
" We just got a bit lazy , " said one aide .
" We knew E - mails could be subpoenaed .
We saw that with the Clintons but I do n't think anybody saw that we were doing anything wrong . "
But rather than use RNC accounts , “ they have subsequently bought their own private E- mail system through a cellular phone or Blackberry server .
When asked how he communicated , one aide pulled out a new personal cellphone and said , ‘ texting . ’ ”
As was pointed out in the Recommended Diary by citizen 92 earlier this week , allowing their communications to be stored on unsecured non-government servers is a major security threat simply waiting to be exploited .
All someone needs to do is crack the password and they 're in .
The White House is a huge target for electronic espionage by friendly and hostile foreign powers .
For those of you who may have visited Washington , this may be evident when you stroll by the various embassies scattered around the city -- with their unusual sculptures of antennas and wires on their roofs .
The Russians have a compound just three blocks north of the White House .
The US Government spends undisclosed amounts on countermeasures to protect its critical information and its secure networks .
And it has the experts to make sure that those countermeasures are working .
But what if someone in the White House chooses to not use those counter - measures ( simply to avoid leaving a subpoena - able trail of bread - crumbs ) and as a results gets their password jacked ?
I personally know how easy this is to accomplish .
Not simply because of what happened to my boss yesterday , but because once upon a time one of best friends was a hacker .
Not just any hacker - The Hacker .
Kevin Mitnick and I went to High School together ( he later spent several years on the run from federal authorities , I - after realizing I did n't want to go Kevin 's way , went on to work for the IT department at Northrop - Grumman ) .
Way back in the late 70's I got to see first hand how he used to create password phishing programs just like the one I described at the top of this post to access LAUSD , USC and UCLA logon accounts .
Ah , the classics never fade away it seems .
Besides the security issues , this also may blow WH claims of extended executive priviledge completely out of the water .
From Josh Marshall .
“ [ T ] his may have been too clever by half .
If the president ’s aides were using RNC emails or emails from other Republican political committees , they ca n’t have even the vaguest claim to shielding those communications behind executive privilege . ”
And they certainly can't use that claim to protect emails on their personal blackberry and cell phone now can they ?
Oh , and by the way - other federal agencies have banned this practice for security reasons .
A reader who has a security role at a federal agency writes , " On the issue of using outside / unofficial e-mail address from official sites , the CIO at [ redacted ] has expressly forbade the practice for security reasons as it is all too easy to put sensitive information in an e-mail .
...
Needless to say , hearing that the WH does not mandate that practice and lets [ Rove ] do 95 % of his e-mailing from a blackberry , presumably with access to an unofficial address , is quite shocking .
Still find it absolutely amazing that his clearance has not been revoked . "
" Amazing " simply is n't the world for it .
Getting zapped for a couple grand is pretty bad , but just imagine how much of the nation 's assets are being put a risk by these WH jackasses ?
I think Fraking Criminally Negligent is a good set of words for it - how ' bout that ?

Syrian officials are coy when queried how they might rein in Hezbollah , deflecting the question by saying all the problems in the Middle East could be solved through a comprehensive plan to end the Arab - Israeli dispute .
But they hint broadly that Syria can deliver , arguing that the omission of Syria , Hezbollah and Iran from diplomatic talks in Rome on Wednesday renders those discussions meaningless .
“ I do n’t think there is any possible solution without Hezbollah and Syria being at the table , ” said one Syrian official , speaking on condition of anonymity because diplomatic relations are so fraught .
“ Any solution has to take into account the real force in the region .
Syria and Hezbollah are a growing force ; they are not getting weaker , they are getting stronger . ”
President Bush , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others in the administration have said repeatedly that Syria can and should leash Hezbollah , suggesting that maybe Washington ’s Arab allies can wean Damascus away from its alliance with both Iran and Tehran ’s militant Shiite offspring .
In some ways , those are two separate questions , the alliance with Tehran being rather more a passing necessity than a real desire .
Strengthened ties with Iran make Syria feel stronger in the region , along with other factors , like the election of Hamas to lead the Palestinian parliament , and the situation in Iraq .
But the link is not hugely popular in Damascus .
One prominent economist compared it to a “ pleasure marriage , ” a temporary union between a man and a woman that Shiites allow for immediate gratification .
“ The relation with Iran is the kind of relation created under pressure , when you close all doors in front of Syria , ” said the economist , Samir Seifan , noting how the United States , the West and their Arab allies have all shunned Damascus for over a year .
“ This is the only door we have : Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran .
But it is not in the long - term interests of Syria . ”
Investments in Syria from Arab states bristling with oil wealth , for example , have basically dried up .
There is no sign that will change , particularly because the people orchestrating the street demonstrations in Damascus push participants to chant against Arab leaders who have criticized Hezbollah .
“ Abdullah , you pig , tomorrow we will drag you in chains , ” went one recent refrain , referring to the king of Jordan .
Another suggested that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was a lowly real estate broker who should be dumped .
A team of scientists has rather alarmingly discovered that the " surprisingly high rate " of hermaphroditism in polar bears can be directly linked to pollution , the Independent reports .
The researchers - who examined 139 bears across the Arctic region - noted that around one in 50 female bears on Norway 's Svalbard islands has both male and female sex organs .
The toxic compounds currently giving the greatest cause for concern are polybrominated diphenyls ( PBDEs ) - flame retardants used to treat furniture and carpets .
The team , with members from Alaska , Canada , Denmark and Norway , says that " significant deposits " have turned up in polar bears ' fatty tissue , notably in eastern Greenland and the aforementioned Svalbard islands .
Studies on mice suggest PBDEs attack " sex and thyroid glands , motor skills and brain function " .
The compounds travel northwards from the US and Europe - especially on southerly winds .
The moist air carrying the toxins then condenses when it hits the cold arctic air , thereby allowing the deposited chemicals to get into the food chain .
Colin Butfield of the Worldwide Fund for Nature said : " The Arctic is now a chemical sink .
Chemicals from products that we use in our homes every day are contaminating Arctic wildlife . "
The use of such chemicals , combined with the risk of global warming , means many Arctic polar bear populations could disappear by the end of the century .
The problem is simple : levels of toxic waste increase the further you travel up the food chain .
The polar bear study , published in December in Environmental Science and Technology , explains how one chemical compound was " 71 times more concentrated in polar bears than in the seals they normally feed upon " .
PBDEs are not , however , the only risk .
Derek Muir , of Canada 's Environmental Department , said that there is evidence that another retardant - Hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) - has made its way into the Arctic food chain .
He warned : " It 's a chemical that needs to be watched , because it does biomagnify in the aquatic food webs and appears to be a widespread pollutant . "
Humans , meanwhile , are also being warned about the possible toxic effects of flame retardants .
The Detroit Free Press reports that a study carried out by the US - based Ecology Center , released yesterday , demonstrated levels of PBDEs and plastic - softeners called phthalates in cars at around five - times higher than those normally found in houses .
The chemicals - detected in " randomly selected 2000 - 2005 model year cars and trucks made by 11 manufacturers " - were deposited as dust " on floors and windows of cars and trucks , especially in hot weather " .
Although scientists are unsure of the implications of these findings , due to " uncertainty over safe levels of the chemicals " , they noted the news " adds to a growing sense of worry that the widely used chemicals may be accumulating at dangerous levels in humans - damaging developing fetuses and children in ways that are only starting to be understood " .

Some background info on PBDEs
Recent reports are that South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson is recovering from a life - threatening episode of bleeding in the brain .
That is good news , indeed .
It remains to be seen , however , how well he will function cognitively in the coming months .
Johnson suffered a brain hemorrhage last Wednesday caused by bleeding in his brain .
Doctors at the George Washington University hospital in D.C. caution that it ’s too early for a long term prognosis , but they are calling Senator Tim Johnson ’s surgery a success .
The Senator ’s staff is saying that his doctors are happy with his progress because he ’s responding to voices and reaching for and holding his wife ’s hand .
I initially read the above report with extremely cautious optimism .
Republicans everywhere also have Senator Johnson ’s health on their mind .
They are no doubt getting ready to argue that Johnson wo n’t be able to carry out his duties , thus requiring the Republican South Dakota Governor to appoint a new Senator .
But , when determining whether Senator Johnson is well enough to continue on as a Senator , Republicans need to keep in mind the Terri Schiavo rule .
Here ’s the rule : as long as a human body is breathing it is alive and worthy of full respect as a human being .
This is true , even if 70 percent of cortical cells — critical to the functioning of the cortex — are completely destroyed .
It is true even if high - tech machines pump and oxygenate his blood .
Republicans also need to keep in mind the plight of South Dakota senator , Karl Mundt , a Republican , who
suffered a stroke while in office .
Mundt continued to serve until the end of his term in January 1973 , although he was unable to attend Senate sessions and was stripped of his committee assignments by the Senate Republican Conference in 1972 .
Truly , I hope that Senator Johnson continues his recovery and that he regains his cognitive function .
In the meantime , I hope we do n’t hear anything from Republicans about how much cognitive function Johnson needs in order to continue serving as Senator .
We also need to keep in mind the palpable lack of mental functioning of the many neocons who instigated a needless war , a per se diagnosis of mental incapacity , in my opinion .
Yet they continue to serve .
The Schiavo rule , as I interpret it , says that if he ’s breathing , even if totally dependent on complicated machines , and even if he has no intellectual functioning , he ’s fully human .
The Schiavo Rule is grounded in the principle that functionality has no relevance to whether a body built on human DNA is entitled to society ’s resources ( in the case of Terri Schiavo , those resources were expensive medical resources that could have saved the lives of others who might have been brought back to human functionality ) .
The Schiavo Rule is that you are either minimally alive and thus fully entitled to be recogized as a human being or you are completely dead .
If you ’re not the latter , you ’re the former .
If there ’s any doubt , of course , we could have Democrat - leaning doctor diagnose Senator Johnson by simply viewing a videotape of him .
On this blog , a lot of typing has gone on attacking Rudy Giuliani , and some ( but a lot less ) has been spent defending him .
Some , such as commentor Eric Dondero , suggest that Rudy Giuliani is a Libertarian Republican .
As evidence of this , he refers to OnTheIssues.org , who rates Rudy as a “ moderate libertarian ” .
The question , then , falls down to whether Rudy is a candidate that libertarians should support .
On the surface , one might think so .
He ’s appears to be a fan of fiscal liberty , with his constant attempts to cut taxes and balance spending in New York .
As for social liberty , he ’s a long way ahead of his rivals on the conservative wing of the Republican party .
But all of these platforms are balanced by a twinge of authoritarianism .
If you read through his quotes that are the basis for the ontheissues.org characterization , you start to see an underlying problem : Rudy Giuliani does not believe in a libertarian relationship between individual and state .
From an external examination , libertarians look like pot-smoking Republicans .
After all , the mainstream characterization of us is as a group of people who want low taxes , small - government , but without some of the social restrictions the Republicans would enact .
Watching as folks like Eric Dondero ( and another acquaintance ) support Rudy while claiming to be Libertarians , I believe that those folks are nothing more than the caricature of libertarian .
But there ’s a much deeper basis for libertarianism .
I ’ve pointed out before that libertarianism , at its core , is a moral system , not just a political party .
Doctrinaire libertarians believe in a very limited relationship between the individual and his government , and that relationship does not find individual liberty subservient to collective security .
So when you look at Rudy “ on the issues ” , you see that he supports some libertarian policies , but his overall attitude is one that suggests the state should “ maintain ” our economic growth , that the government should use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a method to smooth gasoline prices , and – while he claims to support school vouchers– pumped city dollars even further into government education .
On the social side , he appears to be a serious drug warrior , a staunch supporter of the Patriot Act , has no compunction about government DNA databases , and supports forcing people to take written tests before allowing gun ownership ( and presumably supports registration ) .
Rudy Giuliani appears to hold some libertarian stances on issues , but at the same time , I do n’t see how he can be called a libertarian .
Rudy ’s libertarian stances on certain issues may give him allure to some libertarians , but he is reflexively pro-government on other issues .
If he were elected to the highest office in the land , I ’m simply not sure that he would advance individual liberty .
It ’s still early in the campaign , and if Rudy holds his lead , I think we might get to find out quite a bit more how much of his ontheissues.org profile was a relic of his tenure as the Mayor of New York , and how much coincides with his core beliefs .
But at the moment , I do n’t see Rudy as having the same understanding of the relationship between an individual and the state as I do .
Until I see some major changes in his rhetoric and stated positions , I am not ready to support his candidacy .
Although his general libertarian stances make me somewhat willing to keep an open mind , he ’s got a long way to go before I ’d actually consider voting for him .

An intelligence source has suggested that a prize - winning Iranian nuclear scientist had been assassinated by the Mossad , the Israeli security service , The Sunday Times reported .
Ardeshire Hassanpour , 44 , a nuclear physicist , died in mysterious circumstances , according to Radio Farda , which is funded by the US State Department and broadcasts to Iran .
Tehran official : ' No Iranians arrested in Gaza ' Dudi Cohen Iranian official Larijani , Islamic Jihad leader deny reports of 5 Iranian citizens being arrested in Gaza in Tehran press conference , discuss Palestinian matter No Iranians arrested in Gaza , Tehran official says
According to the Sunday Times , Hassanpour worked at a plant in Isfahan where uranium hexafluoride gas is produced .
The gas is needed to enrich uranium in another plant at Natanz which has become the focus of concerns that Iran may be developing nuclear weapons .
According to Radio Farda , Iranian reports of Hassanpour ’s death emerged on January 21 after a delay of six days , giving the cause as “ gas poisoning ” .
The Iranian reports did not say how or where Hassanpour was poisoned but his death was said to have been announced at a conference on nuclear safety .
Rheva Bhalla of Stratfor , the US intelligence company , told the Sunday Times on Friday that Hassanpour had been targeted by Mossad and that there was “ very strong intelligence ” to suggest that he had been assassinated by the Israelis , who have repeatedly threatened to prevent Iran acquiring the bomb .
Journalists visit Isfahan plant
On Saturday , Iran opened the gates to the Isfahan key uranium conversion facility to visiting diplomats and journalists in an effort to show that its disputed nuclear program is peaceful and not a cover for nuclear bomb making .
The visit to the plant in central Iran was the first such tour since Iran resumed uranium conversion in August 2005 .
The UN Security Council slapped economic sanctions on Iran on December 23 over the country 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , which can be used for making weapons .
The visit also came ahead of a UN deadline for Iran to stop the enrichment .
If Tehran does n't comply by the end of the 60 - day period stipulated by the UN , the Security Council will consider new measures beyond the economic sanctions .
The United States and several of its Western allies believe that Iran is using the nuclear program to produce an atomic weapon - charges Iran denies , saying its aim is to generate electricity .
The diplomats visiting the plant came from Sudan , Cuba , Egypt , Malaysia and Algeria .
They represented the Arab League and two groups of developing nations known as the Nonaligned Movement and the G - 77 - organizations that have asserted the rights of members to pursue national interests unfettered by Western countries .
The plant at Isfahan , 255 miles south of Tehran , is responsible for an early stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , turning yellowcake uranium into uranium hexaflouride gas , or UF - 6 , the feedstock for enrichment .
International concerns have recently focused more on the facility in Natanz , where uranium can be enriched using cascades of centrifuges .
Only highly enriched uranium can be used for bomb - making .
But Iranian officials on Saturday 's tour talked only of the program 's peaceful purposes , which Iran is determined to pursue .
Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , head of Iran 's delegation to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency - the International Atomic Energy Agency - said the message of the visit was to show " that Iran is determined to continue its peaceful nuclear activities . "
" This is an opportunity to see for yourselves what is going on and get first hand information about the activities here , " Soltanieh told the diplomats and dozens of reporters .
The visitors saw several areas of the Isfahan facility , including two cameras installed by the IAEA to monitor activity where uranium gas is produced .
Soltanieh said the two cameras , which take photos every two minutes , are in place according to Iran 's obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty .
They are the only cameras at Isfahan .
Iran removed others here when it stopped allowing the IAEA to conduct snap inspections , a measure it took after the agency referred it to the Security Council last February .
IAEA inspectors visited the Isfahan facility twice in January .
Soltanieh said the tour was " an opportunity to see that the IAEA has full surveillance control over the activities of this facility . "

Well , you can say this for President Bush .
Even in the midst of a clearly politicized action designed to show candor and that he is changing and evolving as the threats from terrorism evolve , he stays remarkably close to the concepts that have guided him since September 12 , 2001 .
Push for power and keep the reins of power centralized in as few hands as possible .
Push the limits of decency and constitutionality to the outer limits .
Use the attacks and America ’s response for partisan advantage whenever possible .
Do n’t pay attention to carping critics .
In some ways the speech the president gave Wednesday in the White House about terrorist suspects was the speech he should have given five years ago .
Get Congress to authorize military commissions or tribunals to try suspected terrorists ?
Check .
See to it that the lines between extreme interrogation tactics and outright torture are carefully drawn so those in the field do n’t step over the line ?
Check .
Make sure policies fit the Geneva Convention on detaining prisoners ?
Check .
It would have been a fine idea to put all these mechanisms in place shortly after the attacks of 2001 , when it became clear the United States was going to engage terrorists .
Getting Congress on board by way of authorizing military commissions and defining how they operate would have helped to build support for aggressive prosecutions of prisoners .
Clear policies on prisoner treatment might have helped to avoid confusion by guards and interrogators and later embarrassment for the government .
The trouble is that instead of engaging Congress and the public early on , the Bush administration operated almost exclusively by executive order and with as much secrecy as possible .
Its lawyers ( none of whom had done actual interrogations ) wrote memos that blurred the distinction between legitimate interrogation tactics and torture , creating confusion in the field that led to deaths of prisoners in Afghanistan and huge embarrassment at Abu Ghraib .
And the current charm offensive , once you get past the charm portion , masks an effort simply to continue and validate the failed policies the administration has been pursuing since the get - go .
Abstract Torture
What is striking to me is that most of the enthusiasm for torture  pardon me if that ’s an overstatement , but it applies to some circles  came almost exclusively from abstract thinkers without direct experience in interrogation rather than those with practical experience .
We had intellectuals and quasi - intellectuals conjuring up worst - case scenarios  would you use torture if you knew the guy had information that could prevent an attack scheduled in a half hour ?
 more appropriate to a late - night college bull session than a serious discussion of likely scenarios in the real world .
Pardon me if some of the conclusions  of course you would and you know it !
 tended toward the ghoulish and even the vicariously sadistic in my view .
In my slot at the Register I have occasion to talk to a wide variety of people with practical experience , including retired cops and military interrogators .
Every one of them told me the most likely outcome of using tactics verging on torture was that the detainee would tell the interrogator anything he thought the interrogator wanted to hear rather than the truth .
The truth might sometimes come from torture , but it ’s far from guaranteed and in fact rather unlikely .
The most extreme tactic any of them had used was making the prisoner stand naked while being questioned , which several claimed was effective .
So why the widespread enthusiasm for using torture or at least going right up to the borders of outright torture ?
I ’m afraid it does n’t speak well for the civility and decency of a disturbing number of Americans .
Concrete Abuses
Besides composing memos that undermined the relatively clear guidelines in the Army Field Manual on acceptable interrogation techniques , the administration rounded up the usual Muslim suspects in the United States and kept them confined for months before acknowledging that few had anything to do with terrorism and releasing them or deporting them on minor immigration violations .
It shipped captives to Guantánamo and simply kept them there , not classified as POWs but without charges filed and no access to lawyers .
All this “ energy in the executive , ” unchecked by Congress and only admonished much later by the judiciary , eventually and perhaps inevitably led to abuses and embarrassment .
So now the administration is in need of , as Dahlia Lithwick in Slate put it , “ a big fat legal do - over . ”
In addition , coming forward with demands that Congress act 60 days before the midterm elections also carries the perception that much of this is done for political rather than national security reasons .
What is striking is that beyond acknowledging that the CIA really does maintain secret prison facilities abroad , which administration flacks had previously half - heartedly denied , most of the administration proposals amount to asking Congress to rubberstamp the kinds of policies that got the administration in trouble in the first place .
For example , the Supreme Court , in its Hamdan decision earlier this year , ruled that the military tribunals the administration proposed were impermissible not just because they had to be authorized by Congress , but because they proposed to operate in secret and to deny suspects the right to see the evidence that might be used in secret against them .
And yet on Thursday the House Armed Services committee held a hearing on a bill that would allow such information to be kept secret from the accused .
It was left to experienced military lawyers and prosecutors , like Maj. Gen. Scott Black , the Army ’s Judge Advocate General , to argue that “ I believe the accused should see that evidence ” in the interest of basic American fairness .
Once again , the practical experience of those who have actually participated in or overseen military justice was ignored in favor of what seems to me a variety of abstract bloodthirstiness .
Advocates of blurring lines  between interrogation and torture , between secret trials and fair trials  argue that the terrorists would n’t cut Americans such breaks .
True enough .
But those of us who advocate special efforts to be fair and transparent do so not because we expect terrorist to reciprocate but because we are Americans who believe in civilized behavior and the special role of this country as an example of how to succeed while doing things right .
Unfortunately , the Bush administration does n’t seem to share that vision of America .
Remembering 9/11
In the current atmosphere , reinforced by the cynical efforts of the administration to try again to frighten people into voting Republican , it is not easy now to remember the feeling that swept over our country just less than five years ago .
Our country , our people , had suffered a devastating and destructive attack by a shadowy but malignant force whose motivations we struggled to try to understand .
In the aftermath , however , we were , at least for a time , all Americans together , all determined to figure out who ( the why could wait ) and bring them to justice , all determined that this attack would not only not destroy this great country but make it stronger .
The rest of the world shared our pain , our sorrow , our anger , our determination .
It could n’t last , of course .
A country as large and diverse as the United States could not stay unified forever .
Besides , unity is an overrated virtue , especially in a country founded on individualism and freedom .
Since politics is inherently grounded in opposition to the other , it was no doubt inevitable that this period of unity would revert to partisanship .
The polarization of the present day is troubling in its own way , however , if only because it feeds the illusion that there are only two choices in public life when in fact there are thousands of alternatives potentially open .
Those who fly are reminded each time they board a plane of what the terrorists have done to a society whose primordial instinct is to be free and trusting and open .
Small towns across America have shiny new fire trucks in tribute to the American tendency to throw money randomly at a perceived problem .
9/11 did n’t “ change everything , ” but it changed a lot .
The government has more power and Americans have less freedom .
I ’d still like to think , however , that the spirit of freedom remains .
We live now with our leaders ’ failure to understand that the terrorists do n’t hate us so much for who we are , with our vaunted freedoms and occasional license , but for what our government does in other parts of the world .
The invasion of Iraq compounded the perception that Uncle Sam seeks not so much vindication against those who harm us as domination of other parts of the world .
Attacking the Wrong Targets
Instead of concentrating on those who attacked us the government sought to settle an older score , adding a thin veneer , hardly plausible even at the time , of terrorism - related justification .
Now Iraq has become a recruiting tool for jihadist terrorists and a sand trap for the military , consuming resources and lives in a cause that is difficult to define , making the definition of victory ever murkier .
To be sure , there is evidence that deploying financial , special forces and other military and law enforcement tools has degraded al - Qaeda into an outfit that inspires and assists in rather than carries out terrorist activities .
Yet it may be more dangerous in that role , as the threat becomes more dispersed and capable of striking societies  as London and Madrid now know all too well  from within as well as from without .
Osama bin Laden may not be the master coordinator , but he is still alive and at large , provoking mischief and misery .
Are we safer now ?
It is a plaintive question without a clear answer .
Government agencies , private businesses and ordinary households have increased security in ways both wise and foolish .
But we live with the knowledge that in a country as open as ours , with so many tempting targets , a determined terrorist can and probably eventually will find a way to do damage .
We also know , however , that America , with all its divisions and occasional hostilities , is remarkably resilient .
And so long as we stay true to our highest ideals of liberty , justice and compassion , hostile forces may be able to hurt us , but they ca n’t destroy us as a country .

( CNN ) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs warned a teenage girl forced into a " spiritual marriage " to submit to sex with her husband or face " losing your salvation , " Utah authorities said in an affidavit .
The five - page document was filed in Las Vegas , Nevada , on Thursday in support of two charges that Jeffs ' practice of arranging marriages between young girls and older men makes him an accomplice to rape .
Jeffs , who is believed by his followers to be a prophet , appeared in a Las Vegas courtroom and agreed to return to Utah to face the charges .
Conviction carries a penalty of five years to life in prison .
( Watch the " prophet " answer to the judge -- 2:33 )
Authorities in Arizona also have two counts of sexual conduct with a minor , along with an additional charge of conspiracy pending against the charismatic 50 - year - old leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
The Utah case will be prosecuted first because it carries the harshest sentence .
His maximum penalty in Arizona upon conviction would be six years in prison .
The girl , who was between 14 and 18 , is identified in the document as Jane Doe .
She was assigned a husband after a church leader had a " revelation , " but told Jeffs she felt she was too young to marry , the affidavit states .
Jeffs responded that it was her spiritual duty .
( Watch ex-followers describe a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " -- 8:05 )
The marriage ceremony was performed in Las Vegas .
Jeffs was captured outside the city on Monday night in a traffic stop , ending two years on the run .
A month after the marriage ceremony , the affidavit states , her husband reminded the girl that Jeffs had instructed them to have children to " replenish the earth , " and " now was the time . "
She had sex against her will , according to the document .
According to the affidavit , she later told Jeffs she " hated having husband - wife relations " and was uncomfortable with her husband touching her , the affidavit states .
Jeffs told her she had to stay in the marriage , according to the affidavit .
The document said he advised her that her husband was her " priesthood head and leader . "
According to the affidavit , Jeffs gave these instructions : " Go back and repent .
You go give yourself mind , body and soul to your husband like you 're supposed to .
He will take you into the heavenly kingdom .
Go back and do what he tells you to do . "
Jeffs told the reluctant bride that having a baby would " change everything . "
( Watch former child brides explain the culture of obedience -- 8:07 )
" No matter what happens you cannot fight with the priesthood because if you do you 'll lose your salvation , " he said , according to the affidavit .
Followers have told authorities that Jeffs has said he " will not be subject to earthly courts , " the affidavit states .
Prosecutors argue that Jeffs should be held without bail because he otherwise will continue to perform " spiritual marriages " between young girls and older men .
Jeffs also told his followers in 2002 , " Our prophet and celestial law -- the principal of revelation -- are under attack " by local law enforcement authorities .
" There is a combined effort in the state of Utah and the state of Arizona to come against our prophet and his people , trying to stop the work of God , " Jeffs said at a church meeting , according to the affidavit .
His followers are willing to hide and support Jeffs , the affidavit says , and he has access to safe houses in Utah , Nevada , Arizona , Texas , Colorado , South Dakota , and Canada , according to the document .

Mmmm , them bloggers are just darn mean and hateful .

Gregory : ... Because it - it 's the Internet , and the blogs , that have really used this White House press conference to somehow support positions out in America - political views - and they - and they - uh - they will clip , and digitize portions of these briefings to fit into their particular argument and I think people try to divine motives of the questioners and - and certainly draw conclusions about , uh , the answers , or - or non-answers , uh , based on their , their , their own political views .
Snow : I 'll - I 'll occasionally punch it up and it's amazing , you get this wonderful imaginative hateful stuff that comes flying out , and , I think one of the , the , the , maybe one of the , the most important takeaways is , it 's the classic old line " not only should you not believe your own press you probably should n't believe your opposition blogs either " .
What do you think , Richard ?
Wolffe : ... I think the press here does a fantastic job of adhering to journalistic standards in covering politics in general .
And the , um , the interesting thing in , in looking at the political coverage as people try to guess what we do is , is that they want us to play a role that really is n't our role .
Our - our role is to ask questions and get information .
But it - the press briefing is n't Prime Minister 's question time .
What WATB's .
Hey , we can take it .
It 's not like us bloggers rolled over while the White House started a war in the middle east or nothing , , .As for Richard 's contention that we want them to be ideologues .
No ---- we want the press to do their jobs .
Nothing more and nothing less .
Is that acceptable ?
( h/t Phil for the full transcript below the fold )
David Gregory :
To assertively lay out the President 's case in a way that perhaps had n't been done before you were brought on .
So the President recognized that " I need a forceful advocate who can be seen on television and who can , who can seize that platform . "
At the same time there 's many of you watching .
If you 're watching on C - Span or , or you 're here tonight .
You wanna watch not only the give and take but the topics to be addressed and see the only representative of the White House on a daily basis , if the President does not speak , say what he wants to say but also be responsive to members of the press .
And whether or not you think we accurately are , uh or , are justly represent the views of the American people that 's , that 's very much something that 's up for debate .
But it 's a useful , it is a useful exercise .
There 's also a downside to it .
If people think , you know , people are playing to the cameras , I can't control what Tony does .
But , um ( laughter ) but I will just say this : if you - if you - if you think that , that , um , you know , people ( laughs ) um -
Tony Snow : ( laughing ) Damn right ( unintelligible )
David Gregory : No , but look , I mean I - I - I hope that some of my colleagues here will - will vouch for this but I mean -
Audience Member : I agree .
David Gregory : Some of these exchanges -
Audience Member : I agree .
David Gregory : I have n't made the point yet .
( laughter )
Uh , that uh , that - no but some -
Audience Member : Calm down ...
David Gregory : some of the exchanges can be just as heated .
I mean you - you described heated - going back to the Ford administration .
So whether it's a gaggle , whether it 's a briefing , a lot of , I think , the , the questioning is the same .
That 's my view , I can speak from my own experiences and having tense exchanges off camera and off camera um , I 've had them both .
So , I think that um , I think there 's utility and I also think there is a downside and I alluded to this a moment ago .
I think that politics and political coverage has become so polarized in this country and in part because everybody - McCurry worried about cable news , with the cameras - that was - that seems like a hundred years ago .
Because it - it 's the Internet , and the blogs , that have really used this White House press conference to somehow support positions out in America - political views - and they - and they - uh - they will clip , and digitize portions of these briefings to fit into their particular argument and I think people try to divine motives of the questioners and - and certainly draw conclusions about , uh , the answers , or - or non-answers , uh , based on their , their , their own political views .
Tony Snow :
You know you raise uh , I 'm glad you raised the blog issue , because , uh , I think they 'll be kind of a generational divide , uh , do either of you guys look at blogs much ?
Panel Member : I write a few , but I do n't look at them much .
( laughter )
Tony Snow :
And my guess is this side of the room is - looks more at blogs .
Um , you look at blogs , right ?
Panel Member : I look at blogs .
I 'm all for blogs , I 'm all for the First Amendment , I think people oughta be empowered to write what they want .
Tony Snow : Yeah .
Well , I think what 's happened is we , we 've got this new Democratic age of the media but you 're right , it actually - I 'll - I 'll occasionally punch it up and it's amazing , you get this wonderful imaginative hateful stuff that comes flying out , and , I think one of the , the , the , maybe one of the , the most important takeaways is , it 's the classic old line " not only should you not believe your own press you probably should n't believe your opposition blogs either " .
What do you think , Richard ?
Richard Wolffe : Yeah , uh , well , uh yeah , I totally agree .
I , I , uh - David hit on a good point here that a lot of the blogs are trying to divine motive and bias .
There seems to be this sort of - the witch hunt that 's out there .
A lot of the blogs are , are , are unduly devoted to media criticism which is itself kind of interesting given all the things you could comment on .
Uh , but look , as you can tell from my accent , I , I 'm not actually from here , and , uh - ( laughter ) from the Bronx , actually .
( Laughter ) But , uh , but in my home country , uh , what used to be my home country , you do n't have to , uh , try and guess what someone 's political bias is in the press , cause the press is divided up neatly according to partisan views .
And , it , uh , in my humble view , I think the press here does a fantastic job of adhering to journalistic standards in covering politics in general .
And the , um , the interesting thing in , in looking at the political coverage as people try to guess what we do is , is that they want us to play a role that really is n't our role .
Our - our role is to ask questions and get information .
But it - the press briefing is n't Prime Minister 's question time .
It 's not a chance for the opposition to take on the government and grill them to a point where they hand - throw their hands up and surrender .
Now , obviously there 's a contentious spirit there - we 're trying to get information , but , it 's not a political exercise , it 's a journalistic exercise , and I think often the blogs are looking for us to be political advocates , more than journalistic ones .
Tony Snow : Another sign of the times , my Blackberry just went off -
Examples are n’t hard to come by .
Shiites seek revenge on Sunnis for the revenge they sought on Shiites ; Irish Catholics retaliate against the Protestants who retaliated against them ; and since 1948 , it ’s hard to think of any partisan in the Middle East who has done anything but play defense .
In each of these instances , people on one side claim that they are merely responding to provocation and dismiss the other side ’s identical claim as disingenuous spin .
But research suggests that these claims reflect genuinely different perceptions of the same bloody conversation .
If the first principle of legitimate punching is that punches must be even - numbered , the second principle is that an even - numbered punch may be no more forceful than the odd - numbered punch that preceded it .
Legitimate retribution is meant to restore balance , and thus an eye for an eye is fair , but an eye for an eyelash is not .
When the European Union condemned Israel for bombing Lebanon in retaliation for the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers , it did not question Israel ’s right to respond , but rather , its “ disproportionate use of force . ”
It is O.K. to hit back , just not too hard .
Research shows that people have as much trouble applying the second principle as the first .
In a study conducted by Sukhwinder Shergill and colleagues at University College London , pairs of volunteers were hooked up to a mechanical device that allowed each of them to exert pressure on the other volunteer ’s fingers .
The researcher began the game by exerting a fixed amount of pressure on the first volunteer ’s finger .
The first volunteer was then asked to exert precisely the same amount of pressure on the second volunteer ’s finger .
The second volunteer was then asked to exert the same amount of pressure on the first volunteer ’s finger .
And so on .
The two volunteers took turns applying equal amounts of pressure to each other ’s fingers while the researchers measured the actual amount of pressure they applied .
The results were striking .
Although volunteers tried to respond to each other ’s touches with equal force , they typically responded with about 40 percent more force than they had just experienced .
Each time a volunteer was touched , he touched back harder , which led the other volunteer to touch back even harder .
What began as a game of soft touches quickly became a game of moderate pokes and then hard prods , even though both volunteers were doing their level best to respond in kind .
Each volunteer was convinced that he was responding with equal force and that for some reason the other volunteer was escalating .
Neither realized that the escalation was the natural byproduct of a neurological quirk that causes the pain we receive to seem more painful than the pain we produce , so we usually give more pain than we have received .
It ’s hard to write this without sounding like a prig .
But it ’s just as hard to erase the images that planted the idea for this essay , so here goes .
The scene is a middle school auditorium , where girls in teams of three or four are bopping to pop songs at a student talent show .
Not bopping , actually , but doing elaborately choreographed re-creations of music videos , in tiny skirts or tight shorts , with bare bellies , rouged cheeks and glittery eyes .
They writhe and strut , shake their bottoms , splay their legs , thrust their chests out and in and out again .
Some straddle empty chairs , like lap dancers without laps .
They do n’t smile much .
Their faces are locked from grim exertion , from all that leaping up and lying down without poles to hold onto .
“ Do n’t stop do n’t stop , ” sings Janet Jackson , all whispery .
“ Jerk it like you ’re making it choke .
... Ohh .
I ’m so stimulated .
Feel so X - rated . ”
The girls spend a lot of time lying on the floor .
They are in the sixth , seventh and eighth grades .
As each routine ends , parents and siblings cheer , whistle and applaud .
I just sit there , not fully comprehending .
It ’s my first suburban Long Island middle school talent show .
I ’m with my daughter , who is 10 and had n’t warned me .
I ’m not sure what I had expected , but it was n’t this .
It was something different .
Something younger .
Something that did n’t make the girls look so ... one - dimensional .
It would be easy to chalk it up to adolescent rebellion , an ancient and necessary phenomenon , except these girls were barely adolescents and they had nothing to rebel against .
This was an official function at a public school , a milieu that in another time or universe might have seen children singing folk ballads , say , or reciting the Gettysburg Address .
In the height of the offshore - outsourcing craze , " Steve " worked for a company that had a flagship application which managed , among other things , performance - related documents about employees .
With labor being so inexpensive , the company decided to rewrite the document management subsystem which was a fairly large part of the application .
Testing , as it turned out , was also a bargain when sent overseas , and the company was able to save an incredible amount of money developing , testing , and deploying a major release of their application to their customers .
Although the support calls increased quite a bit after the rollout , technical support was also a bargain when bought overseas .
There were two bugs , however , that seemed to plague the application .
First , when users would save a document , sometimes the changes would n't " stick . "
The support team attributed this to user error and reminding users how to save correctly .
The other issue was that some documents would have " mixed " data -- employees would have strange performance appraisals tacked on to their record from managers from entirely different departments .
The support team attributed these problems to " random data anomalies " and manually fixed the documents .
It was n't until one of their largest customers threatened to switch to a new vendor , that the company decided to hand the issue to the on - shore developers .
Steve and his fellow programmer worked in parallel to find the problem and , within thirty minutes , uncovered the bug in a global constants file ...
static string strUserID ; static int intDocumentID ;
Being a web - application , having a globally - defined document and user identifier does n't work out so well .
If two documents were modified at the same time , the first 's modifications would be saved to the second 's and second 's would be lost .
The same fun effect happens with the user names .
Steve looked through the customer 's data files and noticed that this problem has been occurring since the rollout -- causing almost six months of data to become corrupt .
As you might imagine , this did n't go over so well for the large customer .
Or really any of the other customers .
After all was said and done , the cost of this statically defined variable was estimated in the millions : lost revenue , lost sales , time to fix , customer 's time to fix , court costs , etc .
But what really inspired Steve to submit this was when , almost a year after this happened , he attended a meeting from his higher - ups to encourage and discuss the benefits of off - shoring .
The salamander Bolitoglossa dofleini can flick out its tongue more than half its body length in about 7 milliseconds , or about 50 times faster than an average eye blink .
The giant palm salamander of Central America shoots out its tongue with more instantaneous power than any known muscle in the animal kingdom , a new study finds .
The salamander , Bolitoglossa dofleini , can shoot out its tongue with 18,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle .
This is nearly double the power output of the previous champ , the Colorado River toad Bufo alvarius .
Bolitoglossa can extend its tongue more than half its body length in about 7 milliseconds , or about 50 times faster than an average eye blink .
Video : Salamander catching a cricket
Stephen Deban of the University of South Florida and his colleagues used high - speed video cameras and electrodes implanted in the salamanders ’ tongue muscles to monitor the animals as they launched at live crickets .
The findings revealed the tongues were propelled outward [ image ] much faster than could be achieved by muscle contraction alone .
The researchers think that still unidentified elastic tissue attached to the salamander ’s tongue stores up energy in preparation for an explosive action .
Deban likens the process to stretching and shooting a rubber band : the recoil occurs faster than the act of releasing a rubber band pulled taut .
“ The amount of energy does n’t change ; it ’s just released faster , ” Deban told LiveScience .
How the salamander achieves its record power output is still unclear .
Tongue - launching systems in other animals require three components : a motor to generate energy , a spring to store the energy and a latch to control the timing of unloading of the spring .
Scientists have so far identified only the motor in the salamander system .
“ What remains to be discovered are the anatomical structures that make up the spring and the latch , ” the researchers write in the Feb. 15 issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
DIGG THIS
It was in the fall of 1967 when I embarked on my 10 - year school career in Germany .
My mother dressed me in a short white skirt , knee - highs , and sandals .
She twisted my unruly hair in a set of pigtails adorned with white ribbons .
The leather satchel I carried on my back was a gift of my grandmother .
In my hand I held the famous Schultüte ( school cone ) whose content of goodies was to sweeten my anxiously awaited day .
The small schoolhouse still conformed to the old way of holding school with three or four grades sharing a classroom .
Centralized school reform had n’t hit the rural parts of Bavaria yet until the following year .
Only 23 years earlier my mother was a first grader in the same schoolroom .
Her morning greeting to her teacher was a dutiful " Heil Hitler " in the Roman Imperial fashion .
The schoolroom , as did every private household and institution , featured the idolized image of the Führer on the wall .
Morning prayer remained a tolerable function for the schoolchildren .
Unlike in my mother ’s days , the idolized image of the State had disappeared from the wall .
Prayers were still allowed in this dominant Catholic state at that time .
The imagery of the National State no longer had a visible presence in my classroom ( no picture of a head of state , no national or state flag ) ; however , its legal and constitutional influence over all German school children remains anchored in Article 7 of the German Constitution .
It reads :
Article 7
The entire school system shall be under the supervision of the state .
Little did I know that starting my Elementary school years was " in the best interest " of my legal guardian over education , the state .
I was being , after all , sozialisiert .
In laymen ’s terms , this meant that I received my first compulsory and obligated introduction to a life outside the security of my family unit according to the conventional wisdom of pedagogical experts and academics on how I need to properly adjust and develop to the social order of society and as such to the imagery of a good ( National ) citizen .
Like all children , there were times when school just seemed like a nuisance to me .
" I do n’t want to go to school today " is the common reaction for children going through this phase .
The standard answer of my mother has always been : " If you do n’t go to school , then I will have to go to jail . "
I thought she was joking .
She was n’t joking .
The German school system upholds compulsory schooling , which demands that all children of school age must physically attend a public or private school whose educational system is under the supervision of the individual state ( Bildungshoheit ) .
The law enforces compliance with financial fines to the parents and eventual imprisonment if they persist in keeping their children out of school .
One religious organization received fees as high as 130,000 Euros in the state of Hessen for homeschooling their children .
Parents have been imprisoned for not paying the fines they received for keeping their children out of state schools .
In 2005 state authorities forcefully removed a 15 - year - old girl from her family for psychiatric evaluation because her parents chose to teach Math and Latin at home to avoid having her repeat a grade again in school .
A 16 - year - old girl was sentenced to two weeks in jail for missing one month of school .
Three large fines did not bring her back , thus imprisonment is to be used for disciplinary action .
Another family was fined 150 Euros for not letting their child attend a school play , which was against their belief , and the father was later imprisoned for not paying the fine .
This is the dilemma in which several German families who wish to homeschool now find themselves .
Their decisions to homeschool do not necessarily have to be religiously motivated .
If a family wants to avoid the teaching of evolution or wants to spare their child the rigid drill of school conformity , they should be able to do so .
Also parents should be the ones who best know their children ’s interests , talents and how to motivate and guide them into the right direction to fulfill their potentials .
Good parents want the best for their children , and if they find the time and energy in teaching them " … within responsibility before God , the spirit of Christian charity , humanity and love of peace , in the love for the People and homeland … " — as the state of Baden - Württemberg had it once quoted in their school law book in 1983 — then they are actually upholding their responsibility as legal guardians .
Accountability then falls on the parents , since it is neither the right of a child nor the right of the state to conform the young to their own image .
The issue is not highly publicized in German news , nor does the right of parents to educate one ’s own children find favor in the German courts , nor with politicians and the general public at large .
The German states and the Federal Government do not see a conflict with compulsory schooling upon religious grounds .
The constitution again cancels out that right in Article 7 :
(2) Parents and guardians shall have the right to decide whether children shall receive religious instruction .
(3) Religious instruction shall form part of the regular curriculum in state schools , with the exception of non-denominational schools .
Without prejudice to the state ’s right of supervision , religious instruction shall be given in accordance with the tenets of the religious community concerned .
Teachers may not be obliged against their will to give religious instruction .
Several European states have compulsory education laws which do not enforce the physical presence of a child in public schools , but which require the child to be educated according to the standards of the sovereign state .
Austria permits homeschooling with a state - approved curriculum , and a state - approved school periodically supervises testing .
Switzerland allows families to homeschool children with occasional visits by a state official as long as the sate school plan is upheld .
Denmark has n’t had compulsory schooling since 1855 , and gives financial aid in the purchase of materials to parents .
Other countries that allow homeschooling are Australia , Sweden , France , Great Britain and the United States .
Germans greatly pride themselves in their educational system .
Their country is , after all , known as the " Land of Poets and Thinkers . "
The Germans ’ intelligence is largely reflected in their engineering , inventiveness and the quality of their craftsmanship .
But so is their love for order , their almost obsessive - compulsive cleanliness , and the creation and maintenance of a large state bureaucracy .
They masterfully cultivate and thrive on making life sometimes more complicated than it really needs to be .
Permitting the right of parents to educate their young at home does not quite fit into the mind - set of a state - educated German Citizen and his collective teachings .
It seems as if they think that the liberty to deviate from a “ National Plan ” will threaten their very existence , as it has been known since 1871 .
This is when Imperial Prussia first instituted a nation - wide compulsory schooling to help form a national identity in a land that yearned for democracy and national unification after the Napoleonic wars .
Young Germania needed an educated and obedient Volk in order to provide the work force to prosper and a strong , obedient military to defend itself .
Germany was also the first country to introduce state certification for teachers , which had the intended effect of that raising the standard of teaching .
Germany ’s children were now under the influence of continued reform such as Neuhumanismus ( New Humanism ) and psychobabble academic philosophies with Kantian influence .
Streamlining the mind of children in accordance with these “ intellectuals ” established the ground for a socialist mentality , which is still prevalent in the German population .
John Taylor Gatto boldly explains the Prussian motive for compulsory schooling in his book The Underground History of American Education :
The Prussian mind , which carried the day , held a clear idea of what centralized schooling should deliver : 1 ) Obedient soldiers to the army ; 2 ) Obedient workers for mines , factories , and farms ; 3 ) Well - subordinated civil servants , trained in their function ; 4 ) Well - subordinated clerks for industry ; 5 ) Citizens who thought alike on most issues ;
6 ) National uniformity in thought , word , and deed .
Germany ’s vocational schooling and education has its roots in the Middle Ages .
It was during the 12th Century where guilds organized the teaching of their profession so that craftsmen could become masters .
Parents taught their children the craft and gave them the education .
As far as academic education went , the first university was founded in Heidelberg in 1386 , and the remaining educational organization was under the control of monasteries and Latin schools .
Education was mostly reserved for nobility , clergy and bourgeois upper class .
In 1524 , during the Reformation , Martin Luther began to emphasize the need to establish and maintain Christian schools .
In his letter " To the Councilmen of All Cities in Germany That They Establish and Maintain Christian Schools , " he addressed the civic leaders of Germany and all beloved German citizens with the urgency that councilmen possessed — more than parents — the resources to establish schools , and that it is their moral duty to promote the kingdom of God ( from their position of power ) .
His good intentions created a conflict between Church and State , which was eventually settled by the Kingdom of Prussia .
During the 18th Century , Prussia became the first country worldwide to establish a free and compulsory primary education .
The guardian over Germany ’s future school education was now under state control .
The mentality carried on through history until it found its way into Germany ’s Fundamental Law .
Hitler only refined it during the Nazi era by indoctrinating Nazi ideology into the curriculum .
In 2000 Germany received a major blow to its school system .
A study conducted by PISA ( Program for International Student Assessment ) , showed that Germans scored very low in Math , Reading , Science , and Problem Solving .
These were embarrassing results for a country that prides itself in its intellectualism , which systematically erased the basic function of parents and gave it to the state in the form of welfare .
The results were somewhat better in 2003 but still have n’t risen to a satisfactory level .
Surprisingly , the study also showed that the less money a country spends on education , the better the scores .
Free education does not necessarily raise the standards of achievement .
Germany is now feeling the backlash in their society .
Its top university ranks 45th place worldwide .
This places Germany in 4th place with seven universities ranking in the top 100 .
A recent decision to allow individual states to charge a basic fee of 500 Euros was met with major student protest throughout the country , thus proving that a sense of entitlement is a major characteristic of socialism .
Although Germany ’s individual states have autonomy of their school education , the line between Federal Government mandates and state regulations have become more and more blurry .
In the aftermath of the shock of the PISA study , officials called for further school reforms that would unify the educational system across the states .
The Federal Government supplies half of a state ’s school finances with the rest contributed locally .
Funds are never adequate since most states find themselves bankrupt .
A recent survey of the population shows a major support for centralizing the educational system across the states .
The fact that so many parents rely on the state to raise their own offspring is a sad legacy for the future .
At this time roughly 80 families in Germany are being persecuted for choosing to educate their own children .
It is estimated that maybe as many as 300 children are being homeschooled .
The concept is gradually taking root throughout the country with strong support coming from the US and from religious groups that are not of the state - sponsored Churches ( Evangelical and Catholic ) .
Germans are still very skeptical toward religious groups such as the Baptists and Pentecostals , especially now that Christian missionaries are settling in their country .
These independent denominations are often viewed as cults since their communities seem to prosper outside the mainstream culture .
It is not only religious groups that wish to have a choice in homeschooling their children .
There are many parents who are dissatisfied with the way their children are brought up or treated in contemporary German schools .
The threat of drugs and the casual attitude toward early sexuality may be enough reason for a parent to protect their child from early u2018sozialisieren ’ according to the opinion of a PhD academic .
However , the fear that homeschooling can create a parallel society warrants no proof , since neighboring European countries permit homeschooling quite successfully .
Germans are very studious by nature .
If parents want to spend the time educating their own children , which many mothers already do by helping with homework , then the capacity to flourish in a " living room environment " can only stimulate the curiosity of a child .
Parents are , after all , an idolized image to the child .
It is this sacred image that the state is now distorting with its constant meddling in family affairs and disrupting the authority and guardianship parents have over their children .
None of these families are seeking to abolish the educational system .
They only wish to have a choice in the techniques and content of their children ’s education .
Knowing about evolution or how to protect against sexually transmitted diseases is n’t making anyone a better welder , banker or auto mechanic .
Neither will the daily interaction with one ’s peers in a classroom provide the foundation of moral character , nor will it develop the characteristics that make us virtuous creatures .
The fact remains that families — parents and siblings — provide the foundation for children ’s abilities to interact with their immediate environment .
If a parent provides this labor of love for a child , then all of humanity is to rejoice in their decision .
An independently thinking child is capable of making decisions when presented with choices , and is able to solve problems and figure things out for himself .
He or she will be less reliant on state charity , and probably will want to emulate the ways of his parents — marry and have children .
Several homeschooling families have left Germany and gone abroad .
They find refuge in the United States , Australia or Ireland .
Over 150,000
Germans have left the country in 2004 , and more leave each year in order to find better opportunities for themselves , shows that a good part of the educated population is saying Auf Wiedersehen to their homeland .
The declining birth rates are n’t helping the welfare state either .
Only 1.34 births per woman are n’t enough to facilitate the cost of social welfare , social security and socialized health care .
The Federal Government calculates that maintaining the present level of benefits will require an average rate of 2.1 children per woman .
The gap is being filled with asylum seekers and immigrants who often are n’t willing to integrate , neither into their society nor into their school system .
Judges and politicians are in denial about the benefits of homeschooling and are determined to enforce the law .
Evidence shows that homeschoolers score higher in almost all categories when tested against public or state - educated students .
Germany still relies on certificates and diplomas for graduates to be successfully employed .
Their four - system education determines the type of career a young person will be able to enter .
Prestige also comes with higher education .
A doctor , teacher or attorney still carries a lot of status in the German society and receives the ear of the policy makers .
Now 40 years later I find myself facing my own school history .
The recent events over homeschooling have left me shocked to say the least .
I was still educated in the drill of repetitive study and memorizing .
I was never good in Math .
I lacked the confidence .
My German writing was satisfactory , though grammar was never my strongpoint .
The greatest asset I was left with was a foreign language : English .
It was in the English language where I excelled in later years .
I began to study Math at a local Junior College , took English grammar and writing classes , and aced them all .
Natural curiosity led me to study more history , science , and my own religion .
During the process I discovered freedom .
The self - taught knowledge became mixed with my personal experience and I began to accept certain truths to be absolute .
I realized I had to make choices in life , and self - education became the best defense against that which wants to extinguish the reverence of life .
In my lifetime this always included parents and God .
I have u2018unschooled ’ myself ever since without becoming a hermit or a social dropout .
German families and their homeschooled children are way ahead of where I was .
They are taking great challenges and risks in order to give something to their children that many of us never had nor ever will have .
They give the sort of time , energy and love to their offspring that can never be found in a sterile school environment or with teachers that expect all children to act , think , and talk alike according to the outdated school model of an Imperial Prussia that has long since ceased to exist .
The Best of Sabine Barnhart
By now most gamers have heard the story of the South Korean man who collapsed to the floor after playing an online game at an Internet café for 50 hours straight .
He later died at a local hospital .
The press identified him only as " Lee . "
The man known as Lee was later identified as Lee Seung Seop , according to a recently published Los Angeles Times article .
More details have now emerged about the 28 - year - old man who seemed to lead a typical gamer 's life .
However , his love of gaming soon began to overtake his normal everyday responsibilities , leading to a tragic end .
Lee was a vocational - college graduate with a girlfriend and a full - time job .
When the clock struck 6 p.m. , Lee would depart his job as an industrial boiler repairman , but instead of heading home to relax , he would change out of his uniform and head to a nearby Internet café -- or PC bang , as it's known in the Korean dialect -- located in Taegu , Korea 's fourth - largest city .
Lee 's game of choice was World of Warcraft , and he soon became addicted to it , spending countless hours playing , sometimes forgetting to get adequate amounts of food , liquids , and sleep .
Soon , he began to arrive late at work .
This continued until one day his supervisor fired him , after multiple warnings regarding his tardiness .
" He seemed like a very normal and ordinary guy , " commented Park Chul Hun , the office manager of Lee 's former employer .
" There was nothing odd about him except that he was a game addict .
We all knew about it .
He could n't stop himself . "
According to coworkers , Lee and his girlfriend , who was also an avid game player , broke up around this time .
Six weeks later , on Wednesday , August 3 , 2005 , Lee entered a PC Internet café and sat down to play Starcraft .
The establishment Lee frequented was dimly lit , with a haze of cigarette smoke in the air .
The room was hushed at times , yet the sounds of muffled gameplay could be heard .
He sat down at the keyboard and logged on to play Starcraft .
During this time , he reportedly ate and drank very little ( if at all ) and left his PC only to take restroom breaks .
Wednesday turned into Thursday , and Thursday turned into Friday .
During this period of more than 50 hours , Lee continued his gaming session , failing to adequately replenish his body 's need for food , drink , and rest .
The evening approached .
Suddenly , Lee coiled over from his chair and fell onto the floor ; a witness recalls he was conscious with his eyes open .
He was rushed to nearby Taegu Fatima Hospital where he died a few hours later .
" He was so concentrated on his game that he forgot to eat and sleep .
He died of heart failure brought on by exhaustion and dehydration , " said Park Young Woo , a Taegu Fatima Hospital psychiatrist .
That death came three months after another incident in Incheon , South Korea , that was previously reported by GameSpot .
The incident brought to light the consequences of online gaming conflicting with the normal everyday responsibilities of real life .
The incident itself revolved around the death of an Incheon infant girl .
The parents of the 4 - month - old infant left her alone so they could visit a neighborhood Internet café to play World of Warcraft .
The couple , both in their 20s , lost track of time , staying at the cafe from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m .
During this five - hour period of time , the infant had turned over onto her stomach , helplessly suffocating herself .
The couple has been charged with involuntary manslaughter , this according to the same Los Angeles Times report that detailed the final moments of Lee 's life .
Grace and Moses Lim , a Korean - American sister and brother residing in Florida , know all too well the lure of Internet cafés in Seoul .
Both frequented them on an almost daily basis during their individual trips to Seoul this past year to visit relatives .
Grace , a 24 - year - old master 's degree student , would usually check her e-mail and surf the Web , while Moses , a 17 - year - old high school student would play his favorite games , which consisted of Diablo II , Counter - Strike , and Starcraft : Brood War .
" The [ cafés ]
I went to usually gave me a discount and free drinks .
After I am done playing for four or five hours , I usually pay three or four US dollars .
I usually order ramen noodles and Coca - Cola -- the food is very cheap , " Moses told GameSpot .
Both agree that the low prices kept them coming back .
The normal hourly charge of a South Korean Internet café is $ 1.00 .
Grace commented that sometimes the competition would even lower its hourly charge to 50 cents , while offering convenient food and soft - drink selections .
" They have a full soft - drink collection , ramen noodles , cookies , chips -- they bring it right up to your PC , " says Grace .
While visiting Internet cafés , Grace and Moses observed unsupervised elementary school - aged students using the PCs .
" There are some high school , elementary , and junior high school students .
It 's usually packed on the weekend and after school .
It 's really hard to find a café that has open spots during those times , " Moses said .
A local law prohibits minors from entering Internet cafés between the hours of 10 p.m. and 9 a.m .
When asked why South Korean society has had a more prevalent occurrence of online gaming addiction , Grace offered her own observation , " There is a lot of stress in Korean society .
Going to PC bangs is one way to relieve stress and disconnect themselves from the real world .
It 's mainly the stress - relieving factor . "
Relieving stress by spending time in an Internet café to play online games may seem harmless to some .
However , it is apparent that the lengthy hours spent playing online games directly contributed to the deaths of Lee and the 4 - month - old infant .
Both incidents share one thing in common : Addiction to time - consuming online games can potentially interfere with normal everyday responsibilities and result in tragic consequences .
According to the Korea Times , the neglect of everyday responsibilities stemming from online game addiction is nothing new to the Korea Agency for Digital Opportunity and Promotion ( KADO ) , a government - funded agency that has witnessed an increase in addicted online gamers contacting it for help .
KADO provided counseling to 2,243 people seeking help in 2003 .
That number more than quadrupled to 8,978 in 2004 .
So far this year , KADO has provided counseling to 6,271 people , according to the Times .
Most clients are male adults and teenagers , and the agency estimates that number will dramatically increase to 12,500 people by the end of this year .
The counseling sessions consist of alternative recreation programs and group therapy to ease addictive compulsions .
KADO plans to open more local counseling agencies across the country ( in addition to its 40 established counseling agencies already in operation ) by expanding its financial support to local counselors , according to the Korea Herald .
Plans are already under way for Korea 's Ministry of Information and Communication to build centers that aim to prevent online gaming and Internet addiction , as well as offer anti-addiction courses to local universities .
The Los Angeles Times is reporting that KADO has already begun to send psychologists into South Korean Internet cafés this month to conduct user surveys , make further analysis , and even personally warn customers about the dangers of online gaming addiction .
One visiting psychologist , Son Eun Suk , feels that online gaming could be a bigger social dilemma than drugs or alcohol because society is naive of its addictiveness .
" Parents and teachers lecture against drugs and alcohol , but they are very open to the Internet .
They think their children are learning something about computers , and they allow them to play from a very young age , " Son commented .
This thinking may explain why South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world .
Three - quarters of all households have high - speed broadband Internet connections ( in addition to its 25,000 Internet cafés ) , compared to one - third of US households .
South Korea 's online gaming industry has grown 25 percent on an annual basis , with revenue of $ 1.2 billion during 2004 .
Two cable TV channels cover online gaming activities .
The channels also profile professional players who garner celebrity - like status and make livings of up to $ 100,000 yearly by winning tournaments and even gaining corporate sponsorship .
A number of reasons are blamed for the rise of online gaming addiction in South Korea .
They range from the longer amount of time needed to finish extensive gaming objectives or storylines , to inexpensive Internet access ( averaging $ 30.00 a month for household high - speed Internet services ) , to a society used to living in small apartments or homes trying to escape unfulfilling daily lifestyles .
Whatever the reason , South Koreans are slowly but surely coming to terms with a social problem that could be a fair warning to the rest of the international online gaming community .
It also sets a benchmark in the area of how far local government agencies might reach out to those who manifest a once - unheard - of addiction , before it potentially gets out of control .
Edward Castranova , the author of Synthetic Worlds : The Business and Culture of Online Games , which is set to be released November 1 , 2005 , by the University of Chicago Press , offered his own simple opinion to the Los Angeles Times .
" I think people recognize at least at a subconscious level that there is something subversive about these games , " he says .
" After all , would n't you rather be a spaceship captain than pouring lattes at Starbucks ? "
The US president planned to bomb the Qatar - based channel - that was the remarkable claim made in a top - secret memo .
Why is the world 's most powerful man so worried about a TV station ?
It was an ambush .
As Britain woke up yesterday morning to snowstorms and arctic temperatures , the Attorney General was preparing to be questioned on Radio Four 's Today programme over government plans to scrap jury trials in complex fraud cases .
Instead , as the interview with John Humphrys ground to an end shortly after 8.30 am , the urbane Lord Goldsmith found himself explaining why he had warned national newspapers not to reveal the contents of a top secret memo detailing a lengthy conversation between the Prime Minister and President George Bush over the direction of the war in Iraq .
' I was n't seeking to gag newspapers ; what I said to newspapers was you need to take legal advice , ' Goldsmith insisted as an increasingly irritable Humphrys accused him of trying to silence the media for political expediency .
' It is not being used to save the embarrassment of a politician , ' Goldsmith persevered .
' That is completely not the case at all . '
It is unlikely this will be the last time Goldsmith will be asked about the memo , which first emerged in the offices of a little known Northamptonshire MP in June last year , and has metamorphosed into a major diplomatic incident .
The status of the now infamous five - page document concerning the meeting between Bush and Blair , on 16 April last year , has already reached mythic proportions among bloggers on the internet .
It is the smoking gun to end all smoking guns , claim conspiracy theorists , who believe it details everything from an agreed date to pull the troops out , to plans to take the one - time rebel stronghold of Fallujah .
The one indisputable fact , though , is that part of the memo - 10 lines to be precise - concerns a conversation between Bush and Blair regarding Al Jazeera , the Arabic satellite television station that the US accuses of being a mouthpiece for al - Qaeda .
According to those familiar with the memo's contents , Bush floated the idea of bombing the Qatar - based station .
The Daily Mirror , which ran the story last Tuesday , claimed the Prime Minister talked Bush out of the plan .
As they attempted damage limitation last week , government officials suggested Bush 's comments were nothing more than a joke .
It was preposterous to suggest Bush would countenance such an idea , the officials said .
The White House described the allegations as ' unfathomable ' although according to those who have seen the memo ' there is no question Bush was serious . '
But whether said in jest or not , the memo reveals Bush 's profound obsession with Al Jazeera , an obsession that stretches from stucco - clad government offices in Washington to the tin huts located behind the razor wire in Guantanamo Bay .
Why is the most powerful man in the world worried about a 24 - hour news organisation ?
Salah Hassan , an Al Jazeera camerman , was arrested by US forces in November 2003 , while filming the aftermath of an attack on a US convoy near the city of Baquba .
Following his arrest he was surprised to discover he had been trailed by US troops for weeks and had been secretly photographed at the scene of other attacks .
When he was interrogated , he was accused of having prior knowledge of attacks on coalition forces .
At the heart of the accusation is the fundamental tension between journalists - largely Arab reporters catering for an Arab audience - who say they are anxious to cover the story from both sides , and a United States that regards reporting on some aspects of the insurgency as tantamount to collaboration with terrorism .
None of which would matter much were into not for the ferocious tenacity and professionalism of Al Jazeera , factors which have made the station an international phenomenon .
Most gallingly for the US , its reporters have told a story that Washington either disagrees with or would rather remain untold : that the kind of war America is prosecuting in Iraq is messy and heavy handed ; that civilians are too often the victims , and that the insurgents are not shadowy sinister figures but ordinary men with more support than politicians would like to acknowledge .
As a result Al Jazeera has seen itself under almost constant attack by a White House whose instinct has been to control the media since the war in Afghanistan .
The US military has harassed its reporters .
Its offices in Baghdad and Kabul have both been bombed by the US and reporters have been detained , threatened and abused .
The reason , perhaps , is not so difficult to fathom .
In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , the station , which now enjoys a viewership of some 50 million , began broadcasting a series of messages from Osama bin Laden .
It was a remarkable scoop , but one for which the station would pay heavy consequences , convincing the US that Al Jazeera was , at the very least , infiltrated by Al Qaeda .
Was bin Laden using the broadcasts to send secret messages to his followers ?
By the April of 2004 - and the first battle of Fallujah - US official loathing of the channel had reached a tipping point .
Its focus was the figure of Ahmed Mansour , who reported from the city .
According to Sami Muhyideen al - Hajj , an Al Jazeera camerman arrested in Afgahnistan in 2001 and detained in Guantanamo Bay , US interrogators are obsessed with the idea of Al Qaeda infiltration of the channel and asked about Mansour over 100 times .
On separate occasions the reporter and producer has been accused of membership of the radical Muslim Brotherhood ( which he denies ) and forming ' improper ' relationships with mujahedeen leaders when he covered the Russian wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya .
' I do n't know why they would ask about me over a hundred times , ' Mansour told The Observer last week .
' But the American authorities did not hide their extreme annoyance and fury as a result of my coverage of the first Fallujah campaign in April of 2004 .
My sole crime was broadcasting the reality of a war I was witnessing .'
Mansour has become something of a cause celebre , lionised almost as much in the West as he is the Middle East .
And the fact remains , despite the plethora of accusations against Al Jazeera by its political enemies , so far only one case of Al Qaeda collaboration has been brought to court - that of Taysir Allouni in Spain .
A celebrated war correspondent who has interviewed bin Laden , Allouni was jailed for seven years after being cleared of the main charges in a case some claim was more political than evidential .
It was a Friday afternoon in early June last year when a five - page document lying in his pigeon - hole in his constituency office caught the attention of Tony Clarke , the then Labour MP for Northampton South .
It was immediately clear to him this was no ordinary party political memo .
As he began to read the document , it became apparent it contained extraordinary details of a discussion between the British Prime Minister and the US President during Tony Blair 's visit to the White House the previous April .
Written by a Blair aide who accompanied the Prime Minister to Washington it was headed ' top secret ' .
It is understood that on the five pages there were details of troop deployments and movements .
Lurking within the pages were also frank discussions over the US assault on Fallujah .
It was clear from the tone of the memo that Blair was far from happy at the tactics used by American forces .
Then , within a few short lines , came the bombshell : documentary evidence the US president had openly talked about bombing Al Jazeera .
Clarke , who had voted against military intervention in Iraq believed he had no choice but to call Downing Street and reveal what he had been sent .
The next day officers from Special Branch interviewed him at his home .
Clarke 's trusted 42 - year - old political researcher , Leo O'Connor , was also questioned .
Detectives investigating the leak searched Clarke 's offices in the House of Commons .
It was not long before they had set their sights on the potential leaker as David Keogh , a 49 - year old civil servant who had been seconded from the Foreign Office to the Cabinet Office .
Keogh lives alone in Northampton , not far from O'Connor , and was a member of the Labour Party and an occasional member of a dining club that Clarke and other senior members of the local Labour Party attended .
He was arrested on 1 September last year and 10 days ago was charged with sending the document to O'Connor some time between 16 April and 28 May 2004 in breach of the Official Secrets Act.
O'Connor , in turn , has been charged with receiving the document under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act .
Details of the Foreign Office 's deep misgivings over the way the US was prosecuting the war had already been reported on 23 May last year in the Sunday Times , which had obtained another leaked document .
Back then there was no desire by the Attorney General to pick a fight with Fleet Street and threaten it with the Official Secrets Act .
Some suspect the difference this time is down to the fact the Al - Jazeera memo has deeply embarrassed the Bush administration .
Keogh and O'Connor are due to appear at Bow Street magistrates ' court , south west London , this Tuesday .
This initial hearing is likely to be held behind closed doors while the defence and prosecution teams fire their opening salvos .
Crucial to the case will be whether the judge believes any of the case can be heard in public .
Legal experts draw comparisons with the case of Katherine Gunn , the former GCHQ employee who alerted the world to the United Nations bugging scandal .
The case against Gunn collapsed over fears British intelligence secrets would be revealed in open court and lead to questions over the legality of the war .
The conclusion must be the government 's legal advisers believe it wo n't be forced into such a humiliating climbdown when the case goes to court .
This time around the government is n't going to blink .
An arab rival to the BBC
The television station was set up in 1996 with $ 150 million from the Emir of Qatar .
It was accused of being al - Qaeda 's mouthpiece when it broadcast a message from Osama bin Laden praising the 9/11 hijackers .
Many Muslim viewers criticise it for being too pro-Western and giving airtime to Israeli officials .
It now rivals the BBC , with a worldwide audience of 50 million .
An English - language satellite service will launch in March 2006 .
In 2004 Index on Censorship praised its ' courage in circumventing censorship and contributing to the free exchange of information in the Arab world ' .

Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour recently traveled in Iran , and here she recaps a conversation with a top government official .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
As I sat down recently with a senior Iranian government official , he urgently waved a column by Thomas Friedman of The New York Times in my face , one about how the United States and Iran need to engage each other .
'' Natural allies , '' this official said .
It was a surprising choice of words considering the barbs Washington and Tehran have been trading of late .
" We are not after conflict .
We are not after crisis .
We are not after war , " said this official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" But we do n't know whether the same is true in the U.S. or not .
If the same is true on the U.S. side , the first step must be to end this vicious cycle that can lead to dangerous action -- war . "
He confided that what he was telling me was not shared by all in the Iranian government , but it was endorsed so high up in the religious leadership that he felt confident spelling out the rationale .
" This view is not off the streets .
It 's not the reformist view and it's not even the view of the whole government , " he replied .
But he insisted he was describing the thinking at the highest levels of the religious leadership -- the center of decision - making power in Iran .
I asked whether he meant Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself .
" Yes , " he said .
The rhetoric between the United States and Iran has intensified of late , with Washington most recently blaming Tehran for funneling weapons into Iraq .
Tehran vehemently denies this .
Washington has also accused Iran of building up its nuclear program , with the ultimate goal of making a nuclear bomb -- something Tehran has long denied .
Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian nuclear power .
Indeed , this senior government official told me the first step between Iran and the United States must be for each side to accept that the other is secure , and to say so .
" We do not want to have to prove that we are strong .
Our nuclear program is not to show the U.S. we are strong .
It is because of our previous centuries of threats and invasions , " he said .
Aha , I intervened , " so you do want the bomb ? "
The official replied : " No , our nuclear program is not about the bomb it 's about power .
We want to say -- that without the UK , U.S. , France , Russia , Germany -- we have done this ourselves [ set up a peaceful nuclear program ] .
That is our strength . "
He said the need to show power was " just common sense after 300 recent years looking over our shoulder , " running through the list of those who have sent armies into Iran -- from Alexander the Great to the Mongols to the Ottomans to Russia to Saddam Hussein .
Then he paused .
" The one country that never invaded us was America . "
Face - to - face dialogue
He said the time is right for the United States and Iran to sit down and talk directly -- to say " we recognize each other . "
He said neither side has done this so far " because of the mentality on each side . "
" Each of us is afraid of looking weak if we take the first step , " he said .
" We have this fear in common with America .
Before contemplating recognition , each side feels it necessary to convince the other side that ' I am not weak . ' "
When the official waved the column by Friedman in my face at the start of the conversation , his point was this :
That despite disagreement over Iran 's nuclear program , despite accusations that Iran is supporting anti-American killers in Iraq , despite even the 1979 hostage crisis , Iran and America are " natural allies " and the time has come to restore relations .
" We are natural allies .
Why ? " he said .
" Because now the major threat for both Iran and the U.S.A. is al Qaeda . "
He said al Qaeda had attacked the " symbol of our faith " when it struck the Golden Dome mosque -- the Al - Askariya Mosque -- in the Iraqi city of Samarra last February , setting off much of the sectarian violence that has plagued the war - torn nation over the last year .
Similarly , he said , al Qaeda struck the " symbols of American power " on 9/11 .
" Why is the U.S. forcing us to enter a struggle with them that is only in al Qaeda 's interest ? " he said .
I pressed him about Iran 's sudden interest in extending an olive branch .
" Why now ?
What 's motivating you ? "
I asked .
" Peace for the Iranian people , " he said .
" But not only peace , peace with security .
Peace based on mutual respect , mutual benefit and mutual security . "
Mindful of the heated rhetoric flying between Tehran and Washington -- between both presidents no less -- this official said : " If we give the impression that we welcome a battle , this is not because it is our first option .
It 's our final option . "
The official then spoke of some other issues of concern to the United States , such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the war it provoked with Israel last summer when it captured and killed Israeli soldiers .
" Hassan Nasrallah miscalculated Israel 's response to the kidnappings , " he said of the Hezbollah leader .
When I pressed him , he admitted Hezbollah also miscalculated Israel 's need to project deterrence and identity .
I asked him why Iran helped Hezbollah in the war .
" We helped Hezbollah in order that they not be wiped out , " he said .
" We helped the enemy of our enemy [ Israel ] . "
I told him many Israelis believe the war 's end was inconclusive and fear they face another challenge from Hezbollah this summer .
The official replied : " We do not believe Hezbollah will do that again . "
And then he turned back to his main point , about America .
" Americans must not make the same miscalculation about us . "
Like almost every Iranian I met , he fulminated against the infamous " Axis of Evil " reference made by President Bush during the 2002 State of the Union address .
Iranians -- from the everyday man and woman on the street to the highest government official -- simply scratch their heads at that , especially since Iran had just worked in partnership with the United States bringing down the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and bringing that country a new democratic government .
And on that note , another senior Iranian official working closely on the Afghanistan issue told me that , after a recent trip there , he was alarmed to conclude that as much as 50 percent of Afghanistan is now once again under control of a resurgent Taliban , al Qaeda and forces of another radical Islamic leader Gulbeddin Hekmatyar .
This Iranian official told me the United States must again engage to prevent disaster from overshadowing the success that was made in Afghanistan after 9/11 .
He said Iran is ready to do its part .
Formula for the future
My 90 - minute conversation with the senior Iranian government official ended with him describing a way forward between the United States and Iran .
" Everything with Iranian engagement .
Everything with U.S. engagement , " he said .
In other words , instead of the United States saying , '' Iran out of the Persian Gulf , Iran out of Lebanon , Iran out of Iraq , '' the United States should welcome Iran 's presence and work with Iran to help keep the region stable , he said .
The question now is which country will take the first step and show they 're not being weak by putting diplomacy back on track .
History awaits the answer .

Navigation tools like Google Maps and Apple Maps have changed the way we find places , explore local businesses , and share directions with friends .
Even though Google Maps and Apple Maps have a similar purpose , you will find that there are some differences in the navigation tools offered and interfaces of these two apps .
Learning more about the differences between Google Maps and Apple Maps will help you choose the best navigation app for your needs .
Maps vs. Maps historical contest
Google Maps , born in 2005 , has been the premier mobile mapping service for both iOS and Android devices since the dawn of the smartphone .
Then , in 2012 Apple decided to join the party with Apple Maps , its own mapper for iPhone and iPad .
For years , Apple Maps struggled with technical issues — wrong directions , lack of support for public transportation , and many glitches and bugs that made the service nearly unusable .
Throughout that time , Google Maps continued to improve and reign supreme .
With iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 , Apple released an updated Maps app that promises to fix the most persistent problems found in previous iOS versions , stemming from the original third - party navigation data in Maps .
That is now getting replaced with fresh data gathered directly by Apple .
The new , updated maps are far more detailed and accurate , based on millions of miles driving in camera - and lidar - equipped cars , new high - resolution satellite images , Apple employees canvassing neighborhoods on foot with radar modules strapped to their backs , and tons of aerial photography .
Visually , both apps are similar , both are free , and both offer basic mapping features including driving directions with turn - by - turn navigation , walking , and public transit directions .
Still , key differences might influence which mapping service you choose .
Platform
Apple Maps was designed exclusively for Apple hardware — iPhones , iPads , and Apple Watches .
Google Maps is cross-platform , but Apple Maps is not .
Apple Maps is built into all branded mobile devices , so if you want to use Google Maps , you ’ll have to download it from the App Store .
Thereafter , Apple users can use Google Maps the same way they do other third - party apps .
And many are continuing to do that despite the many valuable Apple Maps improvements in iOS 12 and 13 .
Interface
At first glance , you ’ll notice some subtle differences in the way maps on the two platforms are visually presented , though they have become noticeably more similar over time .
With Apple Maps , the map rendition looks a bit flatter and shows more default locations , but the text and icons are smaller .
Google Maps also highlights many default locations , but they do n’t always match those of Apple Maps and the icons tend to be larger , more brightly colored , and more eye - catching .
If your vision is less than stellar , Apple maps locations can be harder to decipher at first glance .
With Apple Maps , you can search for specific locations using the search bar at the bottom of the screen and change the map settings ( map , satellite , or transit ) by tapping the information button in the upper right , which takes you to a second screen to make adjustments .
Apple also has custom icons for landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge , and you can see the current weather at your screen location at the lower right .
The new Look Around feature ( tap the binoculars icon ) gives you a street - level view , reminiscent of Google Street View .
With Google Maps , while there may be fewer map icons at launch , the design is brighter , with more color and contrast , so it looks a little brighter and busier than Apple Maps .
Like Apple Maps , Google Maps has a search box and different view modes and more options to change your map : Explore , Driving , Transit , Satellite , Terrain , Traffic , and Biking .
Both apps have a current location button on the screen .
Google has 3D models of most buildings , quick access to input addresses , and settings for your Google account and map .
Apple has similar functions built into the OS .
When it comes to the actual navigation screen , both are simple but with distinctive artistic styles .
Driving mode is straightforward for both .
If you zoom in or choose the walking option , more locations pop up on the street level for Apple .
But Google presents immediate sidebar information about nearby locations , while for Apple , you need to tap to find more details about a particular spot and even Yelp ratings .
Because Apple Maps uses vector graphics , Apple ’s satellite view has a more photographic , conceptual look , while Google ’s satellite view looks more realistic .
Both map apps base their arrival estimations on current traffic conditions .
Red markings along your route indicate heavy traffic , yellow is moderate traffic , and blue is little or no traffic .
You may also see various alerts , from accidents to road closures .
Google is a bit clearer when it comes to how traffic will impact your commute by showing the travel time in red to denote heavy traffic .
Google has more options on the main screen , such as a compass , directions , and quick search , making it easier to find what you ’re looking for on the fly .
Supplementary information is available on Apple Maps , but you have to pull up from the bottom portion of the screen and tap the category .
Unique features
Siri ’s integration with Apple Maps is a unique feature for iOS .
Invoke Siri and tell her where you want to go , and Apple Maps will launch and send you on your way .
You can make other voice adjustments en route .
It also incorporates Siri Natural Language Guidance for easier directions .
Instead of saying “ in 1,000 feet , turn left , ” Siri says “ turn left at the next traffic light . ”
Apple Maps vector graphics use slightly less data than Google Maps , which is convenient if you are on a limited data plan .
One of the flashiest features for Apple Maps is Flyover Mode , a feature that lets you explore densely populated urban centers in 3D landscapes of models of buildings and structures .
Flyover also has a City Tours feature that automatically guides you to various city landmarks .
Where Apple has Flyover Mode , Google has made parts of its Street View , a separate app for user - contributed panoramic views of many places around the world , available for viewing in the main Maps app .
Two other popular Google Maps features are bicycle maps and offline access .
In a bike - friendly city , this is really handy , a function Apple Maps does not offer .
Apple Maps recently added bike - sharing stations to its list of places , and that is helpful , but not the same as a bike route mapper .
Google also facilitates offline planning for those with limited access to Wi-Fi or data .
While Apple Maps uses slightly less data than Google Maps , Google compensates by allowing you to download entire maps for offline use .
Privacy
Because Apple and Google are different companies with different philosophies on data and privacy , you will want to take that into consideration when deciding which to use as your default mapper .
It ’s far more convenient to have all your saved destinations and customized mapping details on a single service .
Apple makes more of a point of concentrating on privacy than Google and most of the app ’s functions are accessible without signing in to a user account .
Most data , navigation , and directions live on your device , not in the cloud and mapping info you seek does not reference your Apple ID .
Data collected by Maps — search terms , navigation routing , and traffic information — is associated with “ random identifiers ” that continually reset .
A process Apple calls “ fuzzing ” converts specific locations where you initiate a search to imprecise locations after 24 hours .
The app will not record a history of what you search for or where you went .
Google is also aware of users ’ privacy concerns and offers numerous customization and control options , such as Incognito mode , that keep your location and searches private .
Other differences
Google Maps is considered a veteran in the game .
Since it ’s been around a lot longer than Apple Maps , it ’s had the chance to upgrade and include many features that Apple Maps does n’t .
For example , Google Maps weighs navigation equally to landmarks .
It also gears its services towards tourism and displays better small - city mapping .
Though , it is safe to say that Apply is quickly catching up .
Both Apple and Google offer information regarding opening times of businesses , descriptions , photos , and user - generated star ratings .
Apple also includes
Yelp and other third - party app ratings , while Google shows you average restaurant wait times and reviews , and helps you discover and navigate to new places .
Bottom line
Apple Maps has evolved over the last seven years , and works fairly well in an increasing number of locations and offers plenty of eye - catching features , but it is still catching up to Google Maps .
For now , just in terms of interface , accuracy , and ease of use , Google Maps remains our map of choice — but maybe not for too much longer .

Editors ' Recommendations
I RECENTLY lunched with , among other people , a woman who was a big fan of The Rules .
This book became a bestseller in the 1990's by promising to help women catch husbands .
The basic premise was that you were supposed to be a ) easy to be with and b ) hard to get .
From the cursory flip - through I once gave a friend 's copy , this involved ripping out any vestiges of personality you might possess , the better to make yourself amenable to any available man ; and then , when said man asked you out , act as if you could n't care less whether he dropped off the face of the earth .
It is hard to defend a manual on how to catch the perfect husband written by a woman who has recently gone through an embarassingly public divorce , but this woman tried .
It is the men you do n't particularly care for , she pointed out , that are the most attentive and persistent .
Possibly true .
But it occurred to me long after this desultory conversation that the authors ( and a large number of women who have attempted to follow their creed ) , might have the causation backwards .
Assume there are better and worse catches in the dating market .
Part of the dating process , a rather big part , involves determining whether you are , or are not , too good for the other person .
So the people who pursue you the most persistently may be the people who are not as good catches as you are ; hence your relative lack of interest .
Conversely , the people you want most are the ones who are probably better catches than you are , and therefore you are probably more likely to do the pursuing .
I do n't rule out the evolutionary possibility that men simply prefer to do the pursuing , however .
What do our readers think ?
Sometimes you just have to marvel at the things published by WorldNetDaily – things such as this column by James Rutz of Megashift Ministries :
There ’s a slow poison out there that ’s severely damaging our children and threatening to tear apart our culture ….
The dangerous food I ’m speaking of is soy .
Soybean products are feminizing , and they ’re all over the place .
You can hardly escape them anymore .
…
Soy is feminizing , and commonly leads to a decrease in the size of the penis , sexual confusion and homosexuality .
That ’s why most of the medical ( not socio - spiritual ) blame for today ’s rise in homosexuality must fall upon the rise in soy formula and other soy products .
( Most babies are bottle - fed during some part of their infancy , and one - fourth of them are getting soy milk ! )
Homosexuals often argue that their homosexuality is inborn because “ I ca n’t remember a time when I was n’t homosexual . ”
No , homosexuality is always deviant .
But now many of them can truthfully say that they can’t remember a time when excess estrogen was n’t influencing them .
Update : Was I right ?
Check out The Year in Perl , 2007 !
Short answer — not even close .
* Allison Randal and chromatic will finally let the world know about the Portland Project .
Yep , they 've had Perl 6 all long and just forgot to commit it .
They both say something about how much it rains in Portland , and how that 's a real downer sometimes .
* Rob Kinyon , wearing a " Programming Republic of Perl " t- shirt , will mysteriously show up at the final table of the World Series of Poker .
He went to Vegas for some laughs and entered hoping to get into the top third , although he made it much farther .
He 'll end up finishing in seventh because he was distracted by Michael Matusow asking him questions about his laptop and if he 's getting good wireless reception .
* Two Damian Conways will try to take the stage at OSCON and will fight about which one was supposed to talk and which one was supposed to be doing module maintenance that week .
Allison will have to explain that part of the Portland Project was creating seven copies of Damian in 2005 in case the original was lost to a horrific spider or koala accident .
The copies were to be kept in cryogenic stasis , but that part of the project did n't quite get done .
They do have six Damians chained to desks in an underground computer facility and are happy to have finally caught the seventh .
Their names are Book Damians 1 & 2 , Modules Damians 1 , 2 & 3 , and Perl 6 Damians 1 & 2 .
The real Damian is sometimes called Conference Damian .
* Larry Wall will annouce Perl 7000 , saying it 's 1.75 times better than Python 4000 , and that he and Guido will simultaneously release them right around Never .
* Randal Schwartz will move to Brazil and write the next Llama book in Brazilian Portuguese , which José Castro will translate to Portuguese Portuguese and also provide the voice for the book - on - tape .
Since that is the only language for the book , a little known Portuguese - English dictionary will outsell Learning Perl 6 .
* Abigail will move to San Jose , CA to work for Rabobank just so he can go to Borders any time he feels like it .
Curiously , he 'll go broke buying books and have to move back to the Netherlands after selling them all on eBay to pay for his return flight .
* chromatic will finish his fiction novel about a group of Java programmers who get work done .
In the story , the project manager correctly forecasts almost everything , and through teamwork each bug is diagnosed within 10 minutes .
The book will rise to the top of the Amazon best seller list when it 's incorrectly categorized under " Business " instead of " Science Fiction " .
chromatic will accept high paying engagements as a motivational speaker and forget all about Perlmonks .
* Chris Nandor will be jailed for gun crimes and Eric Raymond will complain on his blog that he was doing the same thing five years before Chris was and he should be the one getting all the attention .
An ATF officer in Arizona will read that blog accidently while surfing on his in - car computer and arrest Eric , who will then complain that he 's in jail in violation of his constitutional rights .
Chris will be later released at the request of a high - ranking Washington State Republican .
Eric wo n't .
Chris will post on Slashdot that it was worth it to " take one for the team " .
Five thousand esr kiddies will have their responses modded down .
* The NSA will release a report noting that Perl handles most of the internet traffic .
How they know that they wo n't reveal , but they will say " That Larry Wall is some character .
We posted some of his emails on the bulletin board " .
A congressional committee will look into the legality of the NSA reading Usenet , and if Larry should be convicted of something for posting Perl to it .
* Jesse " Jifty " Vincent will sell a new service at Best Practical to go with Jifty .
You can now hire a Best Practical Jifty Consultaint to visit your work site and beat whiny people while shouting " Just frickin ' do it ! " .
He got the idea after watching the videos of Terry Tate on YouTube .
Since only Perl has this popular service , Perl becomes the new sexy thing ( again ) .
Vince Vaughn : ' Tabloids Hate Having To Write About Me'Actor Vince Vaughn is convinced tabloid journalists reluctantly write about him - because they hate the fact he 's dating Jennifer Aniston .
The modest Swingers star admits he feels like an unwelcome soap opera star when he reads stories about himself in the US tabloids - because journalists are always trying to write him " off the show " .
He explains , " I 've never taken the tabloids , and that , seriously - you realise that they 're just doing their job and they 're just trying to sell stories , and that , but I think they 've got to be really disappointed , on some level , that I 'm kind of a guy that they have to put in the tabloids .
" They 're almost like soap opera writers ... and I think they kinda feel that I 'm a cast member they wanna write off the show .
They 're like , ' What do we do with this guy here ? ' "
We 're in a bit of a jam , an email to the support desk read , we accidentally ran an entire day 's worth of transactions for 11 Oct 2009 instead of 11 Oct 2006 .
Can you fix this ?
In the world of retail , it 's not an uncommon practice to " open " for a business date that is not the current date .
Think of 24 - hour stores that want to " close " the day at 11:00 PM instead of midnight , or the cases when the registers are out of commission .
Whatever the reason , it 's a feature that customers want and a feature that T. Ferguson 's company provides in their point - of - sale systems .
Obviously , there 's no way for the software to know if a different date is purposeful or accidental ; all it can do is default the " open " date to the current date and hope that someone would notice a mistake on the registers , receipts , etc. before the day was " closed " out .
The support email was the first " problem " that T.'s company had with this feature since first offering fifteen years ago .
Despite having a nation - wide chain of stores , with each bringing in nearly $ 500,000 / day in sales , this company decided not to go for the extended - hours support contract .
With no one to call at 9:30 PM for support , the shift manager ignored the incorrect date and " closed out " the store 's point - of - sale system .
He left a note for the general manager , who promptly emailed support the next morning .
The general manager also called the support line at 9:01 AM -- just after it opened -- to make sure they got the email .
He was very concerned that the error would gravely impact their October reports , forecasting reports , inventory , and just about anything else that relied on that day 's transactional data .
The support rep assured the general manager that the development team was working on a way to fix the issue .
From a programming perspective , this was actually an easy thing to fix .
All of the daily transactions are stored in a single database table , so a simple UPDATE script and a " re-close " should do the trick .
They reproduced the " problem " on a test machine , ran the fix script , and watched it worked like a charm .
T. called up the store to let the manager know how they planned to resolve the issue .
" But , " the manager asked , " what about when someone makes a return ?
Their printed receipt will have a different transaction date .
Wo n't the register refuse the return ? "
" Nope , " T. replied , " we only use the store number , register number , and transaction number when we validate the receipts for returns . "
" Sounds great , " the manager said in a much less stressful tone , " what a relief !
I was really worried about how bad this would be . "
The fix was sent to a technician to fix the problem on site .
Before running the script , he noticed one thing that the development team missed : not only was there only one day of faulty data in the database , there was only one day .
Period .
All the transactional history was gone !
That , of course , would present a problem when trying to process a return .
Or receiving merchandise that was ordered in the past .
Or verifying an employee 's time clock punches .
Or tracking special - ordered items .
Or knowing whether the store is on pace to meet its weekly sales goal .
Or just about any activity of any consequence in retail that ISN'T selling merchandise .
The technician reported this back to the development team .
After a bit of digging , they figured out why only the one day of data was left : part of the register closing code purges data that 's over three years old .
And how does one find three - year old data when the system clock is not a reliable indicator ?
Why , by taking the business date of the newest transaction and subtracting three years , of course !
The manager 's day was about to get much , much worse .
This post is a companion piece to the one I wrote last week about how managers can guarantee an angry workforce .
This is the “ equal time ” response acknowledging that not all the ills of working life are the fault of management .
Managers certainly have more control over the direction of a workplace than the rank and file workers but a toxic cow - orker is more than capable of destroying any good work done by managers .
Some of the behaviours listed here will make managers angry , some will make peers angry and quite honestly you ’ll make yourself angry and miserable if you perpetrate some of them .
So take control !
Wreak havoc on your workplace and show exactly what “ the power of one ” can achieve .
With a little diligence you could probably manage all ten of these behaviours and turn your workplace into a battlefield filled with angry , disillusioned , desperate people .
( Mental note : people who actually do these horrible things are usually incapable of understanding irony .
Better make the intention here a bit clearer . )
But seriously folks , do n’t do these things .
Really .
Even if you think other people “ deserve ” to be on the receiving end of some of the misery they ’ve been dealing out to you .
It ’s tempting but it ’s a downward spiral that will screw up your life as much as anyone ’s .
If you ’re already in a toxic workplace , do n’t become part of the problem .
Find a way to be positive , stay out of the way or simply get out altogether .
But do n’t descend to the level of sociopaths who behave like this as a matter of course .
So without further ado , the top ten ways anyone can guarantee an angry workplace are :
1. Interfere with how others work .
Everybody has their own style and it ’s perfectly possible yours is better than anybody else ’s .
The thing is , trying to change how others work when your opinion has n’t been invited is a recipe for disaster .
This does n’t mean ignore dangerous or destructive practices but use some judgement – if it is n’t actually your job to coach someone do n’t rush in to tell them they ’re wrong .
2 . Act as though some aspects of your job are below you .
In the feedback to my earlier post , one reader recounted a story where a tech support person refused to go under a desk to fix cabling because they did n’t want to get their pants dirty .
Nobody should put up with being demeaned but if you do n’t like what is expected of you , you probably should be doing another job rather than making everyone angry with your intransigence .
3. Backstab people you do n’t like .
Maybe you ’re right , maybe so - and - so at the next desk really sucks .
Maybe one of your peers is actually completely incompetent .
Do n’t make a bad situation worse by indulging in character assassination – no matter how justified you think it is .
4. Encourage gossip .
Friendly chats are good .
Talking about your own personal life is questionable .
Indulging in gossip about someone else ’s personal life is destructive .
Actively seeking out and listening to gossipers is no better than spreading gossip yourself .
Everyone likes a juicy story but do n’t make it a central part of your work life .
5 . Pass judgement on the performance of others .
If performance appraisals are n’t your job , do n’t offer them .
No matter how sure you are of someone else ’s failings , being unnecessarily judgemental is terribly destructive .
Your own performance is your concern , leave the performance of others to their managers .
6 . Intrude on the “ personal space ” of others .
There are dozens of ways to do this : physically impinging on others ( this does n’t have be touching to be bad ) , spreading your crap out so it limits the space available to others , talking excessively loudly , having an obnoxious ringtone .
Individuality is all well and good but you can hardly expect others to respect your individuality if it involves them being battered by it .
7. Refuse to support co-workers as a matter of course .
I ’m a bit of an old school “ workers stand together ” type .
It does n’t make sense to be dragged down by someone who is incompetent and / or destructive but if you reflexively sell out your peers and take the other side , it will not only make them angry but it ’ll come back to bite you some day in a splendidly karmic manner .
8 . Try to palm your work off on someone else .
If you are overworked , the positive course of action is to communicate this upward to your manager .
Do n’t dump on the people around you .
No matter how sure you are someone else is dodging their fair share , unless you are their manager it simply is n’t your job to push some of your work on them .
Likewise if it ’s simply an unpleasant task , not a question of overwork .
It is n’t your co-worker ’s fault it landed on your desk .
Take it up with the boss .
9 . Suck up to management .
Do your job well by all means .
Be on friendly terms with your superiors .
But actively sucking up ?
Do n’t do it .
You ’ve crossed the line when you ’re spending more time discussing non-work issues with the boss than you spend on discussing work .
Just because a manager might be susceptible to constant flattery is no reason to indulge .
This sort of behaviour is almost always blatantly transparent to co-workers and never goes down well .
10 . Indulge in the negative side of office politics .
You have to understand office politics simply to survive .
But when you cross the line from protecting yourself to actively playing the game to further your own ends you become part of the problem .
Anyone who is actually gaining happiness from playing petty political games is undoubtedly engendering a lot of anger all around themselves .
Many of the above items are a delicate balancing act .
A judicious amount of playing politics and sucking up ( a friend used the delightful term “ upward management ” ) can help everyone .
A little social interaction between co-workers is normally a good thing but crossing the line into gossip or imposing on someone in a way that makes them uncomfortable is guaranteed to make you some enemies .
In the end , the above list is an attempt to say it ’s easy ( and often true ) to blame the boss for everything bad but keep these rules in mind .
Unless you can honestly say you ’re not part of the problem you do n’t really have the right to complain .
Scientists have found that family members share a facial expression “ signature ” — a unique form of the universal facial expressions encountered worldwide .
In a rare study taking into account blind subjects , Gili Peleg , et al. have discovered that family members were identified by their facial expressions 80 % of the time , giving scientific support to the observation that a child “ has her Daddy ’s smile . ”
“ Before our study , it was clear that there is a component of imitation that influences facial expressions , but there was no study that compared the gestalt of facial movements of relatives in several emotions , ” Peleg told PhysOrg.com .
Peleg is a PhD student supervised by Professors Eviatar Nevo and Gadi Katzir at the International Graduate Center of Evolution at the Institute of Evolution , part of the University of Haifa in Israel .
In the 1970s — contrary to some views of the time but in accordance with Darwin — psychologists Paul Ekman and Eibl Eibesfeldt showed that facial expressions are universal : people from different parts of the world smile when happy and frown when sad , etc .
Scientists also know that individuals have unique facial expression signatures .
Due to the existence of different nerves and muscles , some people will have , for example , dimples , “ Duchenne ” smiles ( with circles under the eyes ) and the ability to lift one eyebrow .
Wanting to know if there might be a heritable basis for these individual signatures , Peleg et al. studied the gestalt of facial movements , seen in details such as the intensity and frequency of expressions .
“ Facial expressions are non-verbal communication phenotypes , meaning they are composed from genetics and environmental conditions , ” said Peleg .
“ We decided to investigate a population of born - blind persons in order to eliminate the social influence and the effects of imitation . ”
In the study , the scientists video - taped 51 subjects — 21 who were blind , and a total of 30 of their family members — when provoked to exhibit six emotional states : concentration , sadness , anger , disgust , joy and surprise .
Next , the researchers used a classification tool to assign values ( e.g. for types of movements , frequencies ) to each of the subject ’s expressions .
After defining the values , another classification tool determined which subjects were family members .
Quite convincingly , 80 % of the classifications correctly identified family members when taking into account all six emotional expressions .
The single emotion that received correct classification of family members when tested alone was anger at 75 % .
In a test comparing the family members with each other , the scientists also found that related subjects showed similar frequencies of facial expressions for the emotions of concentration , sadness and anger , but not the others .
“ The hereditary influence that appeared in think - concentrate , sadness , and anger may relate to the induction of the high diversity of facial movements by these emotions , as we found in a previous study , ” said Peleg .
“ We believe that if our study population was larger , we could get significant results even in the other three emotional states : disgust , joy and surprise . ”
Peleg et al. hope that finding a heritable basis for facial expression signatures may lead to discovering genes responsible for facial expressions .
If so , it might be possible to develop repair mechanisms for people lacking facial expressions , such as people with autism .
Much information can be communicated through a person ’s facial expressions , and the scientists also wonder about their evolutionary significance .
“ Communication abilities have an evolutionary advantage ; therefore facial expression phenotypes should be conserved , ” said Peleg .
" Facial expressions are important in inter-individual and hierarchical interactions of people within our own species ; between different human races ; between different tribes ; and in animals between different species .
The relationships of mother - babies ; bonding of pairs ; aggression interactions between individuals and so on should be very important in hierarchical situations in human and animal societies .
Likewise , facial expressions should be of great importance as pre-mating isolating mechanisms between species .
“ The genetic basis of facial expressions is probably composed of an array of gene coding for muscle structure , bone structure and muscle innervations , " Peleg continued .
" However , our results also demonstrate kinship sequences of facial expression .
This could indicate genetic conservation and the existence of brain regions that control facial expressions . ”

Right .
Okay .
Got one for ya .
You ’ll like this .
Earlier today I wrote a post about my father , who I have n’t had any contact with for almost thirty years .
It was a difficult post to write – it had taken me almost two weeks to build up the nerve to write it .
After I got it out there , however , a number of people commented almost immediately – uniformly pleasant , supportive , decent posts .
I ’ll confess , it was nice .
As usual some of them were a little more emotional about the whole thing than I felt comfortable with , but generally the whole thing was a positive experience .
I felt positive that I ’d got the message out , was hopeful that talking about the experience might make such a process easier for someone else to go through , and felt that I ’d said enough for the moment .
Everyone ’s got something out of it .
Everyone ’s happy .
And then I got a comment from a man called Barry Scott .
The comment read as follows :
“ Hi Tom , Always remember one thing .
Life is very , very short and nothing is worth limiting yourself from seeing the ones you love .
I had n’t seen my father in 15 years until 2 years ago .
I was apprehensive but I kept telling myself that no matter how estranged we ’d become there was no river to wide to cross .
Drop me a line if I can be of any more help .
Cheers , Barry ”
Sounds fine , does n’t it ?
Except that ‘ Barry Scott ’ is n’t a real person – he ’s a marketing vehicle for a brand called Cillit Bang and his weblog is a barely disguised viral marketing platform for the product .
Now clearly , it was pretty difficult to believe that even a marketing / advertising organisation would be comfortable actively promoting their product in a space where someone was reporting their first contact with their father for nearly three decades .
I mean , sure , there ’s some limited mileage to be gained in getting a link on a number of weblogs – although with all the anti-spam tech in place now they can’t possibly have been hoping for Googlejuice .
But still , that ’s not an enormous benefit for such a grotesque act .
My view was that any right - thinking person would view trying to market your product on such a post as revolting , corrupt , cynical , disgusting , sick and dishonourable .
And to do such thing in such an offhand , casual manner ?
I mean that ’s got to be bordering on sociopathic .
And for it to be a trick !
It could only be viewed as an attempt by these people to exploit a community ’s – and an individual ’s – good faith to sell a few bottles of highly corrosive cleaning fluid .
And it was n’t even an automated message operating indiscriminately – this was a hand - written note posted by an individual human being .
But as I ’ve said , my instincts in this matter were that no one could be that cynical , so I decided to do some exploring .
Some possibilities – the guy who wrote the comment was n’t connected with the weblog or advertising at all , just reusing the name / meme .
Or maybe the weblog was n’t connected to the brand , and was just some jokers attempt to collate and maintain some funny brand - related stuff .
Maybe it was even an attempt to subvert or parody Cillit Bang .
So stage one is to find the IP address of the person who left the comment .
According to Movable Type that is 213.86.119.210 .
And according to Sam Spade that correlates to a lon30ex01.yr.com which is owned by an organisation called Young & Rubicam .
Going to the website of Young & Rubicam , I see that they handle advertising campaigns .
Their site is all Flash , so forgive me for retyping some of it :
“ We make connections between our client partners and their customers .
We are client - focused , insightful , pragmatic .
We believe in ideas .
Ideas based on rigorous analytic processes and human insights . ”
Hm . Human insights .
Okay , so they ’re an advertising firm , the comment purporting to be Barry Scott comes from their servers , the weblog looks like a marketing tool of some kind .
I think we ’re beginning to see a pattern .
So I find their London offices and I start to ring around .
They have a few offices in London under a variety of names : “ Banner Corporation PLC ” , “ Nylon ” , “ Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe / Y&R ” , “ Y&R Holdings ( U.K. ) Ltd European HQ ” , “ Young & Rubicam Brands EMEA ” .
I ring each in turn , they ’re all terribly helpful , but none of them think they ’re handling the Cillit Bang brand .
So no luck there .
Maybe this is n’t as cynical as we ’d initially thought ?
From here , it ’s back to the internet .
After a search for Cillit Bang and Young & Rubicam brings back very few decent answers , I try the more general Cillit Bang agency which eventually leads me to a page on kreativ online which lists the Cillit Bang account as being the responsibility of Partners J. Walter Thompson , which then leads me back to JWT.com .
From here it ’s back to the phones .
We ’re still trying to determine , by the way , if the weblog is a marketing platform at all .
So off we go to JWT ’s uk offices , who are quite comfortable to accept responsibility for the Cillit Bang account but who sound very confused by the idea that the campaign might have an associated weblog , and even more surprised by the idea that people working for another advertising agency could possibly be posting comments in the name of one of their associated brand assets .
They say they ’ll ring me back shortly , and indeed they do – this time with another set of names including Sabrina Geremia and Marva Carty working at a company called Reckitt Benckiser .
So I go and ring them up .
This phone call is a little more involving .
Sabrina is unavailable , so I talk to Marva .
I ask if they ’re running a viral web - based campaign for the product Cillit Bang and she says , slightly reservedly , that they are and that it ’s a weblog .
Shortly afterwards we ’re at a dead end – Marva really wants to know what ’s going on before she ’ll say any more .
I tell her the story of the evil exploitative marketing company virally promoting cleaning products duplicitously all over the story of my reunion with my estranged father , and for some reason she starts to sound a little nervous .
She ’s unclear as to why any organisation would do that – I point out that people post comments all the time to try and get higher rankings in Google ( it does n’t work ) and traffic from people who follow the links .
She sounds very uncomfortable .
She wants me to send all my evidence to Sabrina who will get back to me on Monday morning .
I say that I can’t guarantee that I wo n’t write about this stuff in public in the meantime .
And it ’s just as well that I did n’t guarantee it , because you ’re reading it .
One way or another – whether these specific people are directly responsible for spamming our conversations with their marketing – this whole enterprise stinks to high heaven .
The fake weblogs that pretend to be real are almost bad enough – it ’s an attempt to muddy the reality of a community with the fantasy world that they need to flog cleaning products and make it seem glamourous or exciting .
But someone out there – associated with one marketing group or another – is also keen to directly stick their dirty little hands in the cookie jars of well - meaning , honourable people .
They ’re quite happy to pollute or destroy the value of the enterprise for everyone else if they can derive even the tiniest return from it .
I ’m going to give them the benfit of the doubt and say that this whole enterprise is based on clumsiness and stupidity rather than evil , but we have to make a stand and make it clear to these people that if you live by the sword you die by the sword .
It ’s not good enough for just these marketing people to realise that they ’ve screwed up and damaged the brands they were associated with – we have to keep making examples of them to stop other clumsy organisations viewing our self - created territories as nothing more than sales opportunities .
Do not lie to us because we will expose you .
Be honourable , or we will erase you .
And all anyone will see when they search on Google for your products is that there is no depth to which you will not stoop to get another few bottles into someone ’s shopping basket .
To be decent about the whole thing , I ’m going to let Marva have the final word , because maybe other marketers out there will hear them and learn from them , and it will stop them making the same mistakes again .
And the evidence I ’m going to send to Sabrina ?
The URL of this post .
If she sends a more coherent response back , I ’ll post that too …
“ Us going into blogging is a new thing – it ’s a new thing and we ’re not trying to do anything that could cause you distaste .
If this is the kind of thing that ’s happening , then we need to stop it happening .
I honestly do n’t believe that the effect it ’s had has been at all intentional .
If this is happening then it needs to be re-evaluated .
This is not what we ’re trying to achieve . “
Addendum ( added 3rd October 2005 ) :
The people at Cillit Bang have apologised for the error of judgment and I have accepted their apology .

Achieving Closure
Maybe you ’ve heard about closures ; they ’re one of those aspects of Perl – like object - oriented programming – that everyone raves about and you can’t really see the big deal until you play around with them and then they just click .
In this article , we ’re going to play around with some closures , in the hope that they ’ll just click for you .
The nice thing about playing around with closures is that you often do n’t realize you ’re doing it .
Do n’t believe me ?
OK , here ’s an ordinary piece of Perl :
my $ print_hello = sub { print " Hello , world ! " ; } $ print_hello - > ( ) ;
We create a subroutine reference in $ print_hello , and then we dereference it , calling the subroutine .
I suppose we could put that into a subroutine :
sub make_hello_printer { return sub { print " Hello , world ! " ; } } my $ print_hello = make_hello_printer ( ) ; $ print_hello - > ( )
Still nothing magical going on here .
And it should n’t be any surprise to you that we can move the “ message ” to a separate variable , like this :
sub make_hello_printer { my $ message = " Hello , world ! " ; return sub { print $ message ; } } my $ print_hello = make_hello_printer ( ) ; $ print_hello - > ( )
As you ’d expect , that prints out the Hello , world !
message .
Nothing special going on here , is there ?
Well , actually , there is .
This is a closure .
Did you notice ?
What ’s special is that the subroutine reference we created refers to a lexical variable called $ message .
The lexical is defined in make_hello_printer , so by rights , it should n’t be visible outside of make_hello_printer , right ?
We call make_hello_printer , $ message gets created , we return the subroutine reference , and then $ message goes away , out of scope .
Except it does n’t .
When we call our subroutine reference , outside of make_hello_printer , it can still see and receive the correct value of $ message .
The subroutine reference forms a closure , ``enclosing ” the lexical variables it refers to .
Here ’s the canonical example of closures , that you ’ll find in practically every Perl book :
sub make_counter { my $ start = shift ; return sub { $ start ++ } } my $ from_ten = make_counter ( 10 ) ; my $ from_three = make_counter ( 3 ) ; print $ from_ten - > ( ) ; # 10 print $ from_ten ->( ) ; # 11 print $ from_three ->( ) ; # 3 print $ from_ten ->( ) ; # 12 print $ from_three ->( ) ; # 4
We ’ve created two “ counter ” subroutines , which have completely independent values .
This happens because each time we call make_counter , Perl creates a new lexical for $ start , which gets wrapped up in the closure we return .
So $ from_ten encloses one $ start which is initialized to 10 , and $ from_three encloses a totally different $ start , which starts at 3 .
It ’s because of this property that Barrie Slaymaker calls closures “ inside - out objects : ” objects are data that have some subroutines attached to them , and closures are subroutines that have some data attached to them .
Now , I said that ’s used in practically every Perl book , because authors try and put off discussing closures until there ’s little time left and they run out of imagination .
( Well , at least that ’s my excuse …)
However , it ’s not an entirely practical example , to say the least .
So let ’s try and find a better one .
This example is a bit more complex , but it demonstrates more clearly one extremely useful feature of closures :
They can be used to bridge the gap between event - driven programs , which use callbacks extensively , and ordinary procedural code .
I recently had to convert a bunch of XML files into an SQL database .
Each file constituted a training course , so I wanted to build a data structure that contained the filename plus some of the details I ’d parsed from the XML .
Here ’s what I ended up with :
use XML :: Twig ; my % courses ; for ( <??.xml > ) { my $ name = $ _ ; $ name =~ s/.xml / / ; my $t= XML :: Twig-> new ( TwigHandlers => { need => sub { push @{$courses {$name} {prereqs}} , $ _->{' att'}->{ course} ; } , # ... } ) ; $t -> parsefile ( $_ ) ; }
What ’s going on here ?
XML :: Twig is a handy module that can be used to create an XML parser – these parsers will call “ TwigHandlers ” when they meet various tags .
We go through all the two - letter XML files in the current directory , and create a parser to parse the file .
When we see something like this :
< need course = " AA " / >
our need handler is called to store the fact that the current course has a prerequisite of the course coded “ AA . ” ( $ _->{' att'}->{...} is XML :: Twig - speak for “ retrieve the value of the attribute called … ” )
And that need handler is a closure – it wraps up the name of the current file we ’re parsing , $ name , so that it can be referred to whenever XML :: Twig decides to use it .
There are many other things you can do with closures – Tom Christiansen once recommended using them for “ data hiding ” in object - oriented code , since they rely on lexical variables that nothing outside of the closure can see .
In fact , some of the most esoteric and advanced applications of Perl make heavy use of closures .
But as we ’ve seen , some of the most useful uses of closures can happen without you noticing them at all …
Recent comments :
… you ’re entirely too nice and not forthright enough in your attacks on religious belief .
You also seem to cozy up with the delusional too much and are n’t willing to engage them or challenge their inane ideas .
Sarcastic comments like the ones you often provide do n’t force the religious to examine their faith .
Cut the not - holier than thou stuff , Hemant .
I can’t believe I have to defend myself for not acting like a douchebag .
Not every discussion with religious people needs to be about how ignorant and wrong they are .
I certainly do n’t believe in God and I do think those who believe in God are wrong in their thinking , but the best way to convince the majority of people that living without religion is even possible is to show them that atheists are kind , happy , and approachable – we ’re not the bogeymen we ’ve been made out to be for so long .
If that happens , the logical reasoning behind atheism will follow .
Unfortunately , this “ friendly atheist ” image is not the one being presented .
How often do you see an atheist on TV with a smile on his face ?
Too many atheists wrongly believe that rational thinking is common sense .
It ’s not .
It needs to be taught .
And no one will listen and understand unless the teaching is coming from the mouth of someone whose trust has been earned .
Of course I ’m against extreme religiosity , because it has caused so much harm in this world .
I believe we’d be better off in a world where supernatural thinking did n’t play a role at all and I commend brilliant atheists like Richard Dawkins for bringing the intellectual challenges against faith to a broader audience than ever before .
But if your religious beliefs ( illogical as they may be ) are doing something positive for our community and our world , and in the process , you ’re not trying to stop scientific progress , impede promising research , hurt my gay friends , control another woman ’s body , force your beliefs upon anyone else , ask the government to give you special privileges , or make me fear coming out as an atheist in public , why should I be attacking you ?
If you ’re religious and you ’re not doing any of that , I ’ll be honest : I do n’t really care what you believe .
I ’m glad you ’re helping make the world I live in a better place for everyone .
If the subject of faith comes up in conversation , I will hold my ground and challenge your beliefs .
I ’m confident that atheists will always have an upper hand when it comes to these discussions .
There are so many religious figures that all of us– Christian , atheist , anything– need to universally condemn .
We ca n’t lose sight of what the real problem is .
It ’s not always “ religion ” itself .
It ’s the people that use religion as a tool to separate one group of people from another .
Atheists know that we are all brothers , sisters , distant cousins ; we ’re all truly interconnected through evolution .
Let ’s bring down those people that use religion to ruin the lives of those who think differently , not the people that agree with us on the issues that really matter .
Is our ultimate approval of others only stemming from their non-belief in God ?
Should n’t we be somewhat happy that they do n’t believe the literal words of their holy books ?
Why not at least acknowledge that interpretation of the books might be a step forward ?
For the “ faithheads ” who feel the same way I do , let ’s start working together on the myriad of problems that religious and non-religious people agree need fixing .
When faced with those issues , there are more important things to worry about than why the good , intelligent religious people in our midst hold their beliefs .
And I ’m sure there are many atheists that are reading that last sentence , ready to lash out at me because I used the words “ intelligent ” and “ religious ” together .
Being angry and antagonistic is n’t helping our cause .
It never has .
There are times and places when we need to be assertive , like when our rights are being violated .
Usually , this is not the case .
Let ’s give friendly atheism a chance here .

Foreign Office has asked ministers to ditch the phrase invented by Bush to avoid stirring up tensions within the Islamic world
Cabinet ministers have been told by the Foreign Office to drop the phrase ' war on terror ' and other terms seen as liable to anger British Muslims and increase tensions more broadly in the Islamic world .
The shift marks a turning point in British political thinking about the strategy against extremism and underlines the growing gulf between the British and American approaches to the continuing problem of radical Islamic militancy .
It comes amid increasingly evident disagreements between President George Bush and Tony Blair over policy in the Middle East .
Experts have welcomed the move away from one of the phrases that has most defined the debate on Islamic extremism , but called it ' belated ' .
' It 's about time , ' said Garry Hindle , terrorism expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London .
' Military terminology is completely counter - productive , merely contributing to isolating communities .
This is a very positive move .'
A Foreign Office spokesman said the government wanted to ' avoid reinforcing and giving succour to the terrorists ' narrative by using language that , taken out of context , could be counter - productive ' .
The same message has been sent to British diplomats and official spokespeople around the world .
' We tend to emphasise upholding shared values as a means to counter terrorists , ' he added .
Many senior British politicians and counter - terrorism specialists have always been uneasy with the term ' the war on terror ' , coined by the White House in the week following the 9/11 attacks , arguing that the term risked inflaming opinions worldwide .
Other critics said that it was too ' military ' and did not adequately describe the nature of the diverse efforts made to counter the new threat .
Eliza Manningham - Buller , the head of MI5 , recently stressed the threat from growing radicalisation among young British Muslims .
Whitehall officials believe that militants use a sense of war and crisis and a ' clash of civilisations ' to recruit supporters , and thus the use of terms such as ' war ' , ' war on terror ' or ' battle ' can be counter - productive .
Though neither Blair nor Margaret Beckett , the Foreign Secretary , has used the term ' war on terror ' in a formal speech since June , President Bush continues to employ the term liberally .
The American leader spoke of how he hoped that Iraq would become ' an ally in the war on terror ' during a joint press briefing with Blair in Washington last Friday .
A spokesman for the US State Department yesterday told The Observer that there was no question of dropping the term .
' It 's the President 's phrase , and that 's good enough for us , ' she said .
The White House website has a page devoted to explaining the ' war on terrorism ' , the terminology preferred by the Pentagon , and how it will be won .
In April this year Bush compared the ' war on terror ' to the Cold War in a keynote speech .
Not all British government figures are abiding by the advice , issued by the Foreign Office 's Engaging with the Islamic World Unit .
Writing in the Sun recently , Gordon Brown , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , referred to ' our police and armed forces in the front line of the war on terror ' .
' One of the problems will be getting all parts of government to abide [ by the new guidelines ] , ' said Hindle , the RUSI expert .
' Whether the Home Office will want to follow remains to be seen .
And politicians all have their own agendas . '
Internet access on campus has been spotty this morning , so the first post of the day will be very brief indeed .
I 'm a life - long Californian and a seventeen - year resident of Los Angeles County , and I 've never before experienced heat and humidity like we had this weekend .
Yesterday , I went for my " long run " of the week at 6:00 AM ; at what is perhaps the coolest moment of the day , it was 79 degrees as I stepped out of my car to begin a jog up Brown Mountain .
Truly , deeply , profoundly unpleasant .
I note that my home town , Carmel , is one of the few spots in the nation that has n't hit 80 degrees once this summer .
I was very lucky as a child ...
I made it home from my run in time to see the awards presentations following the Tour de France .
I am very pleased to see Floyd Landis win , not least because of his Mennonite background .
As I turned on the TV yesterday morning , I predicted that what Floyd Landis did during the national anthem ( always played for the country of the Tour winner ) would indicate the degree to which he still embraces his Mennonite heritage .
Mennonites , particularly traditional ones , do n't salute the flag or sing the national anthem .
Though much of the press coverage of Landis ' traditional upbringing has been interesting and accurate , I 'm sorry that no one seems to mention that the Mennonites are n't just conservative Christians .
In their commitment to voluntary simplicity , an abhorrence of all forms of violence ( even in self - defense ) , and a disdain for displays of patriotism , Mennonites -- like all Anabaptists -- are radically different from what we tend to regard as the stereotypical American conservative Christian !
Many Mennonite schools do n't fly the US flag anywhere on campus -- something that could hardly be said of most Reformed or Baptist private schools !
I was pleased to see that Floyd Landis stood respectfully , hands clasped in front of him during the American national anthem .
His posture was identical to that of the 2nd and 3rd place finishers , a Spaniard and a German .
Click to enlarge .
Note that the American ambassador has his hand over his heart .
Lance Armstrong always put his hand over his heart during the national anthem ( you can find such images easily on the web ) after winning the Tour .
I may no longer worship in the Mennonite church ( neither does Floyd ) , but I was pleased by what I was able to interpret from his stance yesterday .
Whatever he retains of his Anabaptist roots , he seems to remain committed to the principle that to be a Mennonite is to be a citizen of God 's Kingdom , not of an individual country .
His simple , respectful , humble refusal to engage in a patriotic ritual of pledging allegiance to but one corner of that Kingdom is admirable , and a sign perhaps that Landis is still , in some real sense , a true Mennonite .
Good on you , Floyd .

When it comes to the Web , hindsight is more like X - ray vision :
In retrospect , it 's easy to see what was wrong with dot coms that tried to make a business out of giving stuff away for free ( but making it up later in volume ) , or to make fun of venture capitalists who handed millions to budding Web titans who had never run a lemonade stand before , let alone an enterprise .
It 's so easy , in fact , we can't help doing it ourselves .
So as venture capitalists scramble to throw money at anything labled Ajax or Web 2.0 , and Web publishing becomes so simple that anyone with a working mouse hand can put up a site , we offer our list of the 25 worst Web sites of all time .
Many of our bottom 25 date from the dot - com boom , when no bad idea went unfunded .
Some sites were outright scams -- at least two of our featured Net entrepreneurs spent some time in the pokey .
Others are just examples of bad design , or sites that got a little too careless with users ' information , or tried to demand far too much personal data for too little benefit .
And to prove we 're not afraid to pick on somebody much bigger than us , our pick for the worst Web site may be the hottest cyberspot on the planet right now .

I HAD NEVER imagined that it could happen , that I could be arrested for merely speaking my mind in the United States .
Nor would I have dreamed that 20 of the best years of my life would burn in a legal battle over the 1st Amendment rights of immigrants .
But it did happen .
I was 19 years old when I immigrated to the United States in the mid-'70s .
Fresh from high school , I was eagerly anticipating the promises of the “ American dream . ”
After growing up under military occupation in Palestine , I was hoping for a new a way of life .
Of all the American freedoms I looked forward to , the most cherished to me was that of freedom of speech .
In college , I chose to study magazine journalism , and bit by bit , I delearned the reticence instilled in me during years of occupation and learned to express what was in my mind and heart .
Before long , I had an opinion on almost every public issue imaginable — from U.S. involvement in Central America to gay and lesbian issues , from violence in public schools to the death penalty and race relations .
I longed , however , to express myself on the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
This was personal .
I believed that distortions were deeply hurting the Palestinians .
And I believed in the American proposition that to be a good citizen is to be positively engaged in public debate and political discourse .
But instead of being rewarded , my family and I were severely punished for this belief .
In January 1987 , more than a dozen federal agents , supported by three carloads of local police and a helicopter hovering above my front door in Long Beach , arrested me at gunpoint in an early morning raid .
My wife had gone to work .
I was taking care of my 3 - year - old son , Ibrahim , when the agents barged into my home .
As they pushed me into the police car , I was shocked to see that they had left my frantic child behind all alone .
Elsewhere , as I was soon to learn , six of my friends were similarly arrested ( and another person was picked up a week later ) , all of them , like me , charged under the McCarran Act with advocating “ worldwide communism . ”
It was baffling .
I felt the same insecurity and fear I felt as a child when confronted by Israeli occupation soldiers at checkpoints .
But this was the West Coast , not the West Bank ; Southern California , not South Africa .
Federal officials accused me of supporting terrorism , not because I committed violence or even because I planned to ( they continually acknowledged that I did not ) , but simply because our opinions and political activities ( such as writing for newspapers , marching in demonstrations and raising money for hospitals ) were not popular in Washington .
No prosecutor ever filed criminal charges against us , but the government tried to deport us anyway , supposedly for being members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , an accusation that we have repeatedly denied .
As the years passed , every court that examined the evidence ruled in our favor .
Both the district and appellate courts concluded that the government had singled us out purely because of our pro-Palestinian beliefs .
However , the government stubbornly persisted .
For 20 years , the Justice Department tried every tactic up its sleeve to get the courts to deport us .
It persuaded Congress to change laws , charging us retroactively under immigration laws enacted since 1987 , including the anti-terrorism provisions of the Patriot Act .
It failed .
It could not produce a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing on our part , simply because we had never done anything against the law .
Last week , federal immigration Judge Bruce J. Einhorn of Los Angeles dismissed the government ’s attempt to deport us — the second time he has done so .
He said that “ the attenuation of these proceedings is a festering wound on the body of these respondents and an embarrassment to the rule of law . ”
He noted that the government had missed ( by nine months ) the deadline for turning over exculpatory evidence .
Despite all that has happened , I have no bitterness .
Despite the pain of living in legal limbo for 20 years , I am still on my feet and leading a positive life .
I am raising my two boys , now 24 and 14 years old , who are making me more proud every day , and my love is continuing to grow for my wife , who did n’t complain and who stuck with me through the nightmare .
I am preparing to enroll in a doctoral program in education .
I still work hard to earn the love and respect of my friends and neighbors .
Yes , it has been a case of pain , waste and governmental misconduct .
It has been painful to us , our families , friends and communities .
It has been a waste of tremendous resources on the government ’s part that could have been invested instead in pursuing and catching real terrorists .
As for misconduct , how else can you describe 20 years of repression for nothing but a political view ?
Difficult as it is to believe , the government might still appeal Einhorn ’s latest decision .
So far , the government has refused to rule it out .
Nevertheless , my hope is that soon my colleagues and I finally will be vindicated , once and for all , and known for who we are : good citizens , loving family people and trusted neighbors .
Twenty years is much too long .
Enough is enough .
My boys frequently ask me , “ When is it going to end , Daddy ? ” I wish I could tell them , “ It ’s over now . ”

In another Kirlin hangar next door sits a Soviet MiG - 21 Mongol , the bane of US pilots in Vietnam .
Outside , on the flight line , are seven Czech L- 39s , still bearing red Communist stars .
And just beyond them , almost invisible in dusky - gray and sky - blue paint , two MiG - 29 Fulcrums .
The pride of the hallowed Mikoyan - Gurevich Design Bureau , the Russian equivalent of Lockheed Martin , the Fulcrum has a top speed of Mach 2.4 - hundreds of miles per hour faster than an American F - 16 Eagle or F / A - 18 Hornet - and remains one of Russia 's preeminent fighters .
A decade ago , only sovereign nations could afford to buy and maintain sophisticated , high - performance fighters .
But Kirlin 's unmarked hangars contain an air force more formidable than that of many countries .
He has 30 jets in flying condition , 10 in line for maintenance , and dozens more to be delivered .
His MiG - 29 Fulcrums , designed in the late 1970s to go head - to - head with the hottest US planes , are the only privately owned Fulcrums in the world .
Kirlin breaks into a big smile whenever he looks at them .
" Check this out , " Kirlin says , leading me into a back room and opening a steel cabinet .
He takes out a white cotton bag .
Inside it is a pilot 's helmet that connects to the plane 's laser - guided tracking system .
The result : A MiG - 29 pilot can precisely target a missile just by looking in a certain direction .
Federal regulations require all military equipment owned by civilians to be disabled , but somehow - " Ca n't tell you , " Kirlin says - the Fulcrum 's radar weapons systems are intact .
The plane is no match for a US fighter 's sophisticated avionics in an encounter beyond visual range .
But if it can survive long enough to come within view of that fighter , the MiG - 29's ability to fly at high angles of attack becomes a distinct advantage - and where the pilot 's eyes aim , so does its weapon .
Kirlin 's collection began as a rich man 's game to own the baddest toys money can buy .
Then he realized there were others who coveted the planes as much as he did .
So he started a business , Air USA , to sell L - 39s to doctors and executives looking for a nifty flying sports car with twin ejection seats , capable of aerobic loops and rolls and approaching the speed of sound .
As Kirlin puts it , why plod about at 120 mph in a $ 300,000 Cessna when you can fly four times as fast in an L - 39 that costs the same and looks a hundred times sexier ?
" Look at this , " he says , whipping open the forward avionics bay in the nose of an L - 39 .
" We strip out the old stuff , put in light American avionics , save 800 pounds , and there 's enough room for a set of golf clubs ! "
Built to fly in and out of dirt airstrips throughout the Soviet empire , the L - 39 is so sturdy , Kirlin says , " This is the only tactical jet fighter that you could - if the Federal Aviation Administration would let you - land right on the golf course , play a round , and then head home !
How cool is that ? "
Cool enough - but Kirlin had even bigger ideas .
In the past few years , he has built an entirely new and booming business hiring out his fighter jets and pilots to the US government for training exercises .
The Navy deactivated its last full - time adversary squadron in 1996 amid shrinking defense budgets and aging aircraft , even as training demands increased .
And there was Kirlin , sitting on all those former Eastern bloc fighters maintained by factory - trained mechanics .
So the Navy came calling .
" Iraq was flying three kinds of plane when we invaded , " he says .
" The L - 39 , the MiG - 21 , and the MiG - 29 , which are three of the four airplanes that Air USA owns . "
Now Navy fighter jocks train against Kirlin pilots flying Kirlin planes .
With 16 aircraft available for Navy exercises , Kirlin has more fighters in the air than any of the four other companies currently flying for the Pentagon .
Kirlin owes his operation to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the elegant crudeness of its technology .
" When the Soviets built an airplane , they intended it to serve for 50 years , maintained in the middle of nowhere by a kid who could barely read , using a tool kit not much bigger than a box of fishing tackle . "
By comparison , he explains , a US warplane is designed around one parameter - performance .
Price and complexity are barely considered .
" All Americans want is a thoroughbred , but the Russians , they want quarter horses .
And lots of 'em .
Their whole design philosophy is based on simplicity and reliability . "
As an example , Kirlin rattles off the L - 39's features : efficient turbo fan engines that need little maintenance and can fly for three hours on a single tank of gas ; mechanical flight controls ; heavy - duty landing gear and tires for takeoff and landing on unimproved dirt airstrips .
Nearly 3,000 were built throughout the 1980s and 1990s , making them modern and plentiful , with an abundance of spare parts - the perfect aircraft , as it turned out , to dependably and profitably challenge the US military .
As Kirlin is talking , two men who look like they 've been sent over by a Hollywood casting agent walk into the hangar .
Tom Leonard and Pete Pettigrew are both in their early sixties , lean and 6 feet tall , with short silver hair .
Pettigrew is a retired Navy Reserve rear admiral with 20,000 cockpit hours and a kill on a MiG - 21 over Vietnam in 1972 .
Leonard is a retired lieutenant colonel and Navy Top Gun graduate .
Both are just in from San Diego .
Tomorrow they 'll fly back in two of Kirlin 's L - 59s for 10 days of offshore operations against the aircraft carrier Vinson and its battle group .
Kirlin employs a cadre of 20 similarly experienced former fighter jocks , including himself .
Some of what his air force does can be mundane - towing targets on 10,000 feet of cable for other jets to shoot down , for example - but increasingly his pilots are being called upon to pierce the air defenses of Navy aircraft carrier battle groups .
The scenarios vary , but typically Kirlin 's birdsdive toward the carriers from 25,000 feet up and 200 miles out , pretending either to be incoming missiles or enemy fighters .
" Gone are the days and tactics of the movie Top Gun , where you had to turn and burn and get behind 'em to shoot 'em down , " says Eric Petersen , adversary requirements officer at the Naval Air Forces Headquarters in San Diego .
" Now we want to ID someone from 10 émiles out and shoot them down before they even see us .
But there are 50 different kinds of radar out there , and bandits with different radar signatures .
It 's getting really complex for pilots trying to figure out which plane and radar is what . "
Kirlin 's planes can simulate those signatures .
And a carrier has to be able to identify those fighters and scramble its jets off the deck within a few minutes .
But at first , Petersen says , " we found our pilots a lot less ready than we thought they were . "
The realistic scenarios staged by Kirlin and his pilots help .
" When it 's a foreign aircraft like the L - 59 , " he adds , " it 's much more intense , believable , and challenging . "
The Navy paid Kirlin $ 840,000 for 200 hours of flight time in 2004 .
This year , says Petersen , Kirlin is already " way beyond that . "
Even at that price it 's a bargain , he insists .
" Military assets are programmed to last a certain period of time , so why not use theirs for less challenging missions and save ours for the war ? "
As Air USA pilot Leonard puts it , " We show up , do the job , and go away . "
Kirlin imported his first plane in 1994 as the Soviet empire was crumbling , after he spotted a photo of an L - 39 in an aviation magazine .
At the time , he was working as a US Airways 737 captain , though as heir to the world 's largest chain of Hallmark greeting card stores he certainly did n't need the job .
Kirlin likes powerful machines - he roars around Quincy in a restored 1967 Corvette convertible - and the notion of obtaining his very own high - performance war machine grabbed him and would n't let go .
" Here was a sexy - looking , late - model current–production fighter that could go eight - tenths as fast as sound , " he says .
" I said , ' I 'm going on a quest to get one . ' "
So Don Kirlin moved to Kyrgyzstan .
Once he sets his mind to a goal , he 's relentless .
He soloed his first plane at 16 , instructed at 18 , and began flying corporate jets three years later .
He flew in the Navy , got twin bachelor degrees in business and clinical psychology , and then an MBA , all from the University of Northern Colorado , and moved on to US Airways .
In 1993 , he asked the FAA to let him parachute from the rear stairway of a Boeing 727 , like the infamous skyjacker D. B. Cooper , who disappeared over the Cascades with $ 200,000 in 1971 .
Kirlin shrugs his shoulders and grins .
" I just wanted to do it because the only other person to do it was Cooper , " he says .
The FAA said no , unless he could prove unequivocally it was safe .
A year later , he presented 6,500 pages of documents to the agency .
He remains to this day the only person authorized to operate jumps out of the rear door of a 727 .
So it was n't all that surprising when in 1994 Kirlin got on an airplane bound for the poor , mountainous country tucked between China , Kazakhstan , and Uzbekistan .
Kirlin learned Kyrgyzstan was awash in planes that it could n't afford to fly , many having logged little flight time .
" It was a former USSR training base , and I heard they had the most corrosion - free airplanes in all of the republics , " he says .
He bedded down in Bishkek , hired an interpreter , and got busy .
It took six months and plenty of vodka - fueled banquets .
" Their first answer was always ' No , it 's not possible , ' " he says .
" When I said I wanted to buy former Soviet military hardware so people in America could fly them around as toys , they could n't believe that I was n't a spy for the US government !
But it just takes infinite patience and money .
You have to immerse yourself in their lives and get them to trust you . "
After his first L - 39 , Kirlin wanted more .
More altitude .
More performance .
More bragging rights .
Another eight L- 39s followed within a year , and then two MiG - 21s ( one of which was subsequently destroyed in a crash that killed the pilot ) .
But people like Kirlin who worship at the altar of high géforces are never satisfied as long as there 's something faster out there .
And there was : Kyrgyzstan , Kirlin heard , might have a MiG - 29 or two hidden away .
" It 's a mechanical meat - and - potatoes airplane , " he says , leading me onto the flight line where the two Fulcrums sit .
But powerful and deadly all the same .
" It can take off and head straight up and accelerate through the sound barrier to 48,000 feet in 60 seconds ! " he says , nearly jumping out of his ostrich - skin cowboy boots .
" Once I heard those numbers I just had to become the only person to own the biggest , baddest , fastest machine in the world .
Me , chasing the clouds in the purest power machine out there .
I had to have one . "
Wanting one and getting one were two very different things .
For starters , the Kyrgyzstanis insisted that they did n't have any MiG - 29s .
" ' Well , if they did exist , ' " Kirlin recalls asking , " ' what do you think they 'd be worth ? ' "
In late 1994 , after months of negotiations with the ministry of defense , military officers led him to an underground bunker at an airfield in Bishkek , where they showed him two Fulcrums in surprisingly mint condition .
" They were beautiful , " he says .
One had flown only 40 hours , the other 110 .
The bargaining continued for another two years , with Kirlin shuttling in and out frequently for sometimes tense negotiations involving large amounts of cash .
" You sit with your briefcase between your back and the back of the chair .
You 're 1,800 miles from Moscow , and they could kill you any second . "
It took two more years to complete the deal , for a sum he wo n't even ballpark ( Russia sold MiG - 29s to Malaysia and Peru in 1995 for nearly $ 16 million apiece ) .
" All cash , " Kirlin says , pawing through a box of photos in his spartan office overlooking the hangar .
He pulls out shots of him eyeing the two warbirds , surrounded by guys in uniform .
" It was the beginning of a dream that turned into a nightmare . "
Kirlin and his crew dismantled the Fulcrums and packed them in custom - made steel crates with covers of rough - hewn wood labeled as farm implements .
They even built a bridge across a river at the back of the base so they could be towed to the train station .
Then something went wrong .
Kirlin is coy about exactly what - it seems that the money did n't get where it was supposed to .
Suddenly he was unwelcome in Kyrgyzstan .
With nothing but the clothes on his back , his passport , and his bankroll , Kirlin shelled out $ 1,000 to be driven in the trunk of a car from Bishkek across the border to Almaty , Kazakhstan .
Meanwhile , the airplanes , loaded on a flatbed railway car and escorted by Kirlin 's men , were sent to P'ot 'i , Georgia , where they were supposed to be transferred to a ship .
Instead , the government of Georgia threatened to confiscate them .
Kirlin forked over $ 40,000 and had the Fulcrums brought back into Kyrgyzstan , escorted , as always , by his agents , who then chartered a Soviet - era AN - 124 - the largest commercial airplane in the sky - to fly the planes to Tallinn , Estonia , the closest friendly NATO port , where they were quickly seized for another three months .
After three years and more cash outlays required to seal the deal , they arrived in Quincy .
Despite their low flying time , they need complete overhauls before they can safely take wing in the US .
Some doubt Kirlin can get them airborne .
He scoffs : " I 've got all the manuals , " he says , ever confident .
" It 's just a matter of time and money . "
Kirlin has a full - time man in Moscow and another in Prague scouting airplanes and buying parts .
He has jets stationed in Hawaii and Japan to be close to the carrier battle groups Air USA is working with .
And in his conference room just off the hangar sit the chief engineer and two sales people from Povazske Strojarne Letecke Motory , the Slovak Republic company that overhauls the Albatross ' jet engines .
Kirlin is about to take delivery on dozens more L - 59s , and he wants the Slovaks to rebuild their motors .
But they 've been in Quincy for three days , they 're not budging on their price , and in an hour they 're catching a plane home .
" We must make a decision soon , " says an anxious Czech mechanic who works for Kirlin and is acting as a translator .
" It 's all show , " Kirlin replies .
" Go back in there and be very gracious .
Tell them thanks for the price and that I 'll think about it . "
Moments later , the mechanic reenters the hangar and motions Kirlin over .
Sure enough , with minutes to spare , the Slovaks have capitulated , slashing their starting price by 50épercent .
Don Kirlin is floating .
" Outstanding ! " he says , slapping the mechanic on the back .
" Awesome .
I knew it would go our way .
It 's always the same ; you just have to wait 'em out . "
Then , stealing a glance at the hammer and sickle , he can't help himself .
" America won ! " he says with a laugh .
" We 're all they 've got now . "

Our entire industry is scared witless by Google 's dominance in search and advertising .
Microsoft and Yahoo have been unsuccessful at staunching the bleeding of their search market share .
VCs parrot the Google PR FUD machine that you need giant datacenters next to hydroelectric dams to compete .
They spout nonsense about how startups should just use Alexa 's crawl and put some ajax on top of it .
Ye gods .
Grow a spine people !
You have a giant growing market with just one dominant competitor , not even any real # 2 .
You 're going to do clean - tech energy saving software to shut off lightbulbs in high - rises instead ?
Pfft .
Get a stick and try to knock G's crown off .
So here are my tips to get started .
These are all about competing with Google 's search engine .
Of course G is big business now and does a lot of different things .
Their advertising business is particularly strong , and exhibits some eBay - like network effects that substantially enhance its defensibility .
Still , even if you 're going to take that on too , you have to start with a strong base of search driven traffic .
Of all the things broken at Microsoft , the way they use source control on the Windows team is not one of them .
A young Windows engineer writes :
“ … prior to the restart effort of Longhorn , there were about seven [ branches ] , reverse - integrating into one main branch every two or three weeks perhaps .
Now , imagine several thousand developers checking in directly into seven branches .
This will lead to two things : “ 1. you check in frequently , and there ’s a very high chance of either breaking the build , or breaking functionality in the OS , or 2 . , as a counter - reaction , you do n’t check in very often , which clearly is bad , since now you do n’t have a good delta history of what you did .
“ So this clearly did n’t scale .
As part of the restart effort , we decided that each team would get its own feature branch , each feature area ( multiple teams ) would go up to an aggregation branch , and those would lead up to the final main branch .
( As such there ’s now north of a hundred branches in tiers , leading up to about six aggregation branches . )
Teams were free to choose how many sub - feature branches they wanted , if any , and they were free to choose how often they wanted to push up their changes to the aggregation branch .
As part of the reverse - integration ( RI , i.e. pushing up ) process , various quality gates had to pass , including performance tests .
Due to how comprehensive those gates ended up being , this would take at least a day to run , plus perhaps a day or two to triage issues if any cropped up ; so there was a possibly considerable cost to doing an RI in the first place .
However , these gates were essential in upholding the quality of the main branch , and had they not existed , the OS would have never shipped .
I suppose it ’s one of those ‘ what does n’t kill you …’ type deals .
“ Some teams did manage to manufacture pathological cases for themselves where changes would n’t RI up for several months , but that ’s the individual team ’s fault ( or their release management ) , and not the process .
Generally , the more disciplined teams were about quality , the faster and more frequently they ’d RI .
From what you know about the varying levels of stability / quality of components of the OS , it ’s pretty easy to map that back to RI velocity and so forth , since it all goes hand - in - hand pretty nicely . ”
When you ’re working with source control on a huge team , the best way to organize things is to create branches and sub - branches that correspond to your individual feature teams , down to a high level of granularity .
If your tools support it , you can even have private branches for every developer .
So they can check in as often as they want , only merging up when they feel that their code is stable .
Your QA department owns the “ junction points ” above each merge .
That is , as soon as a developer merges their private branch with their team branch , QA gets to look at it and they only merge it up if it meets their quality bar .
The best way to imagine this is to look at this screenshot from Accurev .
As you can see there are a lot of “ leaf ” branches but as things get merged up towards the trunk , they have to pass through QA which basically just checks that it ’s OK and then merges it closer to the trunk .
By the way , Accurev makes a nice source control system that is designed for this style of intensive branching and merging .
The Windows team itself uses their own source control system which , it is rumoured , is just an old version of Perforce for which they bought a source license ; Perforce has a reputation among developers for being expensive , solid , and extremely fast when working with extremely large source code bases .

2007-02-22追記:反応リンク集
Viacom 's DMCA takedown notices continue to generate controversy .
The media giant fired off more than 100,000 notices to YouTube earlier this year , but it appears to have caught numerous legitimate videos in the crossfire .
One of those clips , called " Stop the Falsiness , " satirizes comedian Stephen Colbert , and the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has filed a federal lawsuit against Viacom , asking the judge to declare the video non-infringing .
The video , which was produced by left - wing advocacy group MoveOn , pokes fun both at Colbert and at MoveOn 's own activism .
It was uploaded to YouTube in August of 2006 , but Viacom demanded that it be taken down and said under threat of perjury that its copyright was being violated by the clip .
The video does contain clips from " The Colbert Report , " but the EFF argues that these qualify as fair use , since parody has a well - recognized copyright exemption .
" Our clients ' video is an act of free speech and a fair use of ' Colbert Report ' clips , " said EFF staff attorney Corynne McSherry in a statement sent to Ars Technica .
" Viacom knows this — it 's the same kind of fair use that ' The Colbert Report ' and ' The Daily Show ' rely upon every night as they parody other channels ' news coverage . "
The larger issue in the case is the use of the DMCA to silence parodies and political expression .
" Online sites like YouTube have revolutionized political expression and can give the little guy an audience of millions for a political point of view , " said Eli Pariser , Executive Director of MoveOn .
" Copyright owners need to double - check their claims and think about free speech rights before erasing political content from sites like YouTube and misusing the DMCA . "
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the video does not infringe on Viacom copyrights , and it also asks for damages from the company .
If successful , the lawsuit may exert some " chilling effects " of its own on DMCA takedown notices .

Impact of lunar orbiter seen by observatory in Hawaii
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : September 5 , 2006
Europe 's first probe to the Moon went out with a bang this weekend as it deliberately plunged into the lunar surface in a final attempt to gather useful science data .
The impact was seen from at least one ground telescope , and more observations of the crash site could come soon .
This view of SMART - 1 impacting the lunar surface was captured by the 3.6 - meter optical / infrared Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope .
The impact flash lasted only about 1 millisecond .
It may have been caused by the thermal emission from the impact itself or by the release of spacecraft volatiles , such as the small amount of hydrazine fuel remaining on board .
Credits : Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope Corporation
The 630 - pound SMART - 1 spacecraft met its fiery demise at 0542:22 GMT ( 1:42:22 a.m. EDT )
Sunday , just seconds later than predictions issued by controllers in the preceding days .
SMART - 1 hit the Moon at a very oblique angle - comparable to that of a commercial airliner on final approach to a runway , according to European Space Agency officials .
About the size of a typical washing machine , the craft was expected to collide with the surface at a speed well over 4,000 miles per hour .
Officials had called upon a large group of professional and amateur astronomers around the world to observe the Moon around the expected impact time .
Scientists stationed at observatories across the globe trained their eyes on the Moon , and astronomers at the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope were the first to submit a sighting live to SMART - 1's control room in Germany .
Perched atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii , the observatory 's 11.8 - foot telescope detected the impact flash using a wide - field infrared camera .
Several optical and radio telescopes , Sweden 's Odin satellite , and countless amateur astronomers were also looking for signs of the crash .
Reports from these observers are still being sought and analyzed .
" We have a lot of work still to do , " said Pascale Ehrenfreund , the SMART - 1 impact ground campaign coordinator .
" We have to collect all the data .
We have to process the data correctly and try to interpret them in terms of impact physics , in terms of lunar science - and also what happened to the spacecraft .
" I think it will help as a guide for future impactors on the Moon , " she said .
" We are very happy and grateful for the participation worldwide of all the professional and amateur astronomers . "
Analysis of other data from ground observations is also expected to reveal whether bits of rock and dust were thrown high enough above the lunar surface to be illuminated by sunlight .
Post - impact observations of the crash site later this week will look for signs of a fresh ejecta blanket .
Instruments aboard SMART - 1 were also gathering data and beaming it back to Earth in the final days and hours of the mission .
The crash ended SMART - 1's three - year mission that tested a number of cutting edge technologies that engineers hope to apply to future probes .
The craft featured a solar - electric ion propulsion system that slowly boosted it out of Earth orbit following its launch in September 2003 .
The Moon 's gravity captured SMART - 1 into lunar orbit in November 2004 , where it was set to begin a six - month mission to serve as both a testbed and science platform .
Good spacecraft performance allowed managers to extend the mission by more than a year to this summer , when it was planned to make an uncontrolled impact on the Moon 's far side where the crash would not have been visible to observers on Earth .
A two - week series of thruster firings in late June and early July raised the probe 's orbit and delayed the looming lunar impact until September 3 .
The orbit change also moved the site of the crash to an ideal location on the Moon 's near side .
Several last - minute maneuvers were conducted last week to reduce the chances of SMART - 1 smacking into the Moon an orbit earlier than expected .
Analysis of high - resolution images of the impact zone revealed rough terrain that could be high enough to cause the craft to crash before the planned time .
In its final few circuits around the Moon , SMART - 1 was flying at just a few miles above the lunar surface as it reached the low point of each orbit .
Controllers feared high mountains could stand in the way of the probe and cause an early impact .
SMART - 1 also went into a sudden safe mode last week , severely curtailing most spacecraft and science activities for about six hours .
Ground teams devised a quick fix to the situation so the end - of - mission plan could continue , and no other problems were reported before the last communications from the craft were received in the mission 's final moments .

About the Ancient Olympics by Howard Nowes for the 2004 Games
What we know today about the ancient games is based on archaeological evidence and ancient written text .
The Olympics officially began in 776 BC and ran until the Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius outlawed Pagan festivals in 394 AD .
This was a 1200 year uninterrupted span for the Games which was held at Olympia every 4 years .
The games were a perfect joinwatch .me outlet for the many independent Greek city - states to demonstrate their civic pride .
Everyone is familiar with the famous professional warriors produced by the Spartans .
These warriors has great athletic skill and training and it became accepted that the games were a better way to compete for victory , a form of mock battle as it were .
Although there were no team sports in the Ancient games , an athlete represented his whole City when he entered the arena .
Training for the games took place in Elis , a staging ground about 40 miles from Olympia .
The Athletes would march into Olympia a day before the games began in a great processional ceremony .
The Olympic games were open to every free Greek citizen who would make the trek from as far away as Asia Minor or the Italian colonies .
During the pilgrimage journey and during the Olympic festival itself , there was truce established throughout the land , a ban on warfare and judicial proceedings .
Spectators , officials , athletes and trainers felt safe to journey to Olympia .
As many as 40,000 spectators would fit into the main stadium and another 30,000 workers , servants , family members and slaves could also have been accommodated in camps around the city .
The logistics of having that many people at the festival was challenging to say the least .
There were shortages of the basic conveniences we take for granted ; not enough water , food , bathrooms or showers .
As ripe and unhygienic as the atmosphere was , the Olympics festivals were the place to be for the Ancient peoples .
The events lasted officially for 5 days and nights .
One was considered to have completed a life goal if they could have attended the games at least once .
After all , the Olympics was also a religious festival .
The contests , banquets , and rites were held in honor of the great patriarch deity Zeus .
A 40 foot tall ivory and gold statue of Zeus , one of the 7 Wonders of The Ancient World , presided in the main temple complex .
On the second day of the Festival 100 white oxen were sacrificed at a large altar and the bulk of the meat was cooked and distributed to the spectators in a public feast .
The ancient Olympic athletes were professionals .
The democratic society of ancient Greece allowed poor fishermen and illiterate bakers to compete with the aristocratic elite on the playing field .
This provided great opportunity for social advancement .
Young children who showed promise in sports were sponsored by the village elders and placed with professional trainers .
Great financial gain and fame was the prize for victory .
Spectators could also profit on betting on the outcome of contests .
Officially the winner at the Olympic games was crowned with a laurel wreath , but back home in their native city , he was hailed as a hero , given a parade , a civic position , free meals and a pension for life .
Athletes could go around to various contests all year leading up to the Olympics becoming rich .
For example , a typical prize for a contest in Corinth or Athens could have been 50 amphora filled with olive oil , the modern equivalent of $ 40,000 .
These athletes were treated well .
They had entourages , trainers , coaches , and masseuses .
Top athletes in antiquity were equivalent to modern day NBA stars !
According to the earliest records , only one athletic event was held in the ancient Olympics - - a foot race of about 183 m ( 200 yd ) , or the length of the stadium .
A cook , Coroibus of Elis , was the first recorded winner .
When the powerful , warlike Spartans began to compete , they influenced the agenda .
The 18th Olympics included wrestling and a pentathlon consisting of running , jumping , javelin throwing , discus throwing , and wrestling .
Boxing was added at the 23d Olympiad , and the Games continued to expand , with the addition of chariot racing and other equestrian events .
Of the combat sports , wrestling , boxing and the pankration , the pankration was particularly gruesome .
Olympia was said to be only second to Athens in the beauty of the sculpture .
Olympic winners were quick to commission statues of themselves to honor their victories .
The Olympics became international in the Roman Empire , open to world athletes but soon the games lost appeal to the spectacle of the Gladiator games of the professional soldiers .
The sporting games were held well into the Christian times and in the late 4th Century AD , the great statue of Zeus was removed and hauled to Constantinople .
It was destroyed in a fire a century later .
Olympia suffered repeated earthquakes , floods and barbarian raids in the 6th and 7th Centuries AD and soon the city was covered over by river silt and laid buried .
Olympia and the games were rediscovered in the 18 Century and made popular again in the Victorian era .
Today , technology allows the modern games to reach billions of viewers and the format of the games has changed quite significantly but the excitement , competitive spirit , fame for the athletes and the ability to represent your home town is the same as it was in antiquity !
The Ancient Games
Pentathlon [ 5 events ]
1. Discus
The ancient Greeks considered the rhythm and precision of an athlete throwing the discus to be as important as his strength .
The discus was made of either stone , iron , bronze , or lead , and was shaped like a flying saucer and weighed from around 3 to 9 pounds .
Sizes varied , since the boys ' division was not expected to throw the same weight as the men .
2. Javelin
The javelin was a man - high length of wood , with either a sharpened end or an attached metal point .
It was lighter then the standard military issue of the time .
It had great advantage over the modern day javelin which made it go further .
A leather thong , agkyle , at midpoint on the shaft created a loop for a throwers two fingers which gave him more leverage and greatly increased the precision and distance of a javelin's flight .
3. Long Jump
The long jump was a very difficult event which required excellent balance .
Unlike today where jumpers get a running start , the ancients had to commence from a stationary starting position .
Athletes used lead or stone jump weights ( halteres ) shaped like curved barbells which were swung back and forth to provide momentum so as to increase the length of their jump .
The halteres were swung out in front of the athlete during his ascent , and forcibly thrust behind his back during his landing .
He had to land on his feet or suffer a foul .
4. Running
There were 4 types of races at Olympia .
The stadion was the oldest event of the Games .
Runners sprinted for 1 stade ( 192 m. ) , or the length of the stadium .
The other races were a omega replica watches 2 - stade race ( 384 m. ) , and a long - distance run which ranged from 7 to 24 stades ( 1,344 m. to 4,608 m. ) .
As if these races were n't enough , the Greeks had one particularly grueling event which we lack .
This was a 2 to 4 - stade ( 384 m. to 768 m. ) race by athletes in armor .
If we remember that the standard hoplite armor ( helmet , shield , and greaves ) weighed about 50 - 60 lbs , it is easy to imagine what such an event must have been like .
This race was especially useful in building the speed and stamina that Greek men needed during their military service .
5. Wresting
Like the modern sport , an athlete needed to throw his opponent on the ground , landing him on a hip , shoulder , or back for a fair fall .
3 throws were necessary to win a match .
Biting was not allowed , and genital holds were also illegal .
Attacks such as breaking your opponent 's fingers were also permitted .
Other Events
Chariot Race
4 horses were tethered to a war chariot which pulled the driver .
Up to 40 chariots were in competition at once .
The track with a turning post was 600 yards long x 200 yards wide .
The driver had to have great skill to turn his rig past the post at just the right moment or be thrown .
The race had 12 laps so they had to turn posts 24 times !
There were many accidents and a good deal of carnage .
The victory was not to the rider but to the owner of the chariot and horses .
Combat Events
For the warrior , his display of athleticism was paramount .
Enormous strength could insure loyal comrades on the battlefield and bring you closer to the level of Zeus , who had unlimited physical power .
Wrestling was the gentlest of these physical matches or combat sports .
Genital holds were illegal .
In boxing , Greek rules banned eye gouging and body blows .
All blows were always aimed at the head and one could identify a boxer by his horribly disfigured face .
There is an incident recorded where a Roman aristocratic boxer was denied his inheritance because his brothers could not recognize him .
The deadliest of the combat sports was the Pankration , which also offered the most in prize money .
It was a combination of boxing and wrestling where groin kicks , strangulation , arm locks and kicking was legal .
This event required the most skill offensively and defensively and competitors did often die .

Story Highlights • Video shows teens persuading the boys , who are " falling around "
• Teenage uncle and his roommate are charged in the case
• Authorities found the video in a camera confiscated as stolen
• Police : Apparently not the first time the teens encouraged the kids to smoke pot
Adjust font size :
WATAUGA , Texas ( CNN ) -- Police in suburban Fort Worth , Texas , said a videotape found in a search for stolen goods appears to show two teenagers persuading a 2 - year - old boy and his 5 - year - old brother to smoke marijuana .
Third - degree felony charges have been filed against the teenagers .
" I have never seen anything like this quite so disturbing , " said Bruce Ure , director of public safety for the Watauga Police Department .
" Our children count on us to protect them ; these individuals did everything but protect these children . "
( Watch kids puff on apparent joint as teens laugh )
The incident began unfolding February 22 , when the Fort Worth Police Department executed a search warrant to look for stolen goods in the apartment of 17 - year - old Demetris McCoy , the unemployed uncle of the two children , and 18 - year - old Vanswan Polty , Ure said .
Among the items recovered was camera equipment , Ure said .
Upon looking at one of the tapes , investigators came across " a session where these two males were providing marijuana " to the youngsters , he said .
" They were essentially trying to get them high , laughing .
The children are stumbling , falling around . "
Ure said it appeared that the videotaped scene was not the boys ' first such session .
The 2 - year - old was holding what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette " like he 's done it before , " Ure said .
" He 's inhaling . "
The boys ' mother , McCoy 's sister , has told police she was sleeping in the back bedroom during the incident .
She has not been charged , Ure said .
Nor has another minor , who served as the cameraman , Ure said .
In the video , a man puts a cigarette into the toddler 's mouth .
The other boy is seen smoking without prompting .
The children have been in the custody of Child Protective Services , Ure said .

Harris : Separation of church and state ' a lie ' RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 24 , 2006 Print This Email This
In a lengthy interview with Florida Baptist Witness , struggling U.S. Senate candidate Katherine Harris asserts , among other things , that the separation of church and state is a fallacy .
" We have to have the faithful in government and over time , " the Witness quotes Harris as saying , " that lie we have been told , the separation of church and state , people have internalized , thinking that they needed to avoid politics and that is so wrong because God is the one who chooses our rulers . "
Excerpted answers from the interview follow :
On civil rights for gays : " Civil rights have to do with individual rights and I do n't think they apply to the gay issues .
I have not supported gay marriage and I do not support any civil rights actions with regard to homosexuality . "
When asked if abortion is a moral evil : " Yes .
Because it 's a life , it 's a life .
Life begins at conception . "
Stem cell research : " I 'm the only candidate in the primary or general who 's voted against embryonic stem cell research and has voted for cord blood research and adult stem cell research .
...
There are no successes for embryonic .
That is why the private sector is not involved and there is no justification for taking a live embryo and destroying it . "
Regarding the Florida primary : " Florida is the forerunner state .
... [ W ] hat happens in Florida sets the trend for what happens nationally .
And with this election , if Bill Nelson wins , its going to be a very frightening proposition in 2008 in the presidential elections because whoever wins Florida will win the presidency . "
The interview in full is available here .
Ursula Le Guin finds inspiration for her powerfully imagined fantasy worlds in landscape as much as literature .
Her home in the west hills of Portland , above Oregon 's Willamette river , has a spectacular view of Mount St Helens , which blew its top 25 years ago , but is now eerily tranquil .
In this gabled house in the Pacific north - west , her home for almost half a century , Le Guin conceived the parallel series that won her recognition as a Grand Master of both fantasy and science fiction .
Thirty years before Harry Potter , in A Wizard of Earthsea ( 1968 ) , she sent Ged , also called Sparrowhawk , to a school for wizards in a pre-industrial archipelago of dragons and sorcerers governed by magic , death and the power of language .
Le Guin , who also writes realist fiction , poetry , essays and books for young children , says : " I 'm impatient with genre as a label of quality .
But if we could stop critics being ignorant , genre would be interesting . "
Her credit to JK Rowling for giving the " whole fantasy field a boost " is tinged with regret .
" I did n't feel she ripped me off , as some people did , " she says quietly , " though she could have been more gracious about her predecessors .
My incredulity was at the critics who found the first book wonderfully original .
She has many virtues , but originality is n't one of them .
That hurt . "
Savoured by adults and children , the Earthsea quartet , including The Tombs of Atuan ( 1971 ) , The Farthest Shore ( 1973 ) and Tehanu ( 1990 ) , has never been out of print , and was augmented in 2001 by Tales from Earthsea and the novel The Other Wind .
The Left Hand of Darkness ( 1969 ) was a founding classic of her Ekumen cycle of adult science fiction , premised on " Mobiles " , or explorers , from the planet Hain .
The novel won both the Nebula and Hugo awards , as did her tale of flawed utopias , The Dispossessed ( 1974 ) .
In The Lathe of Heaven ( 1971 ) , her sci - fi classic set in a dystopic Portland , a man with the gift to make his dreams reality is catastrophically manipulated by a utopian psychiatrist .
For Margaret Atwood , Le Guin is a " quintessentially American writer " , of undoubted literary quality , " for whom the quest for the Peaceable Kingdom is ongoing " .
Her worlds , Le Guin says , are not so much invented as discovered .
" I stare and see something , maybe a person in a landscape , and have to find out what it is . "
But whether charting inner lands or outer space , her eye remains on the here and now .
At 76 , Le Guin counts among her affiliations the peace and women 's movements ( " I take a perverse pleasure in calling myself a feminist " ) , and Taoism ( " profoundly subversive " ) .
Her 20th novel , Gifts , now out in Orion paperback , begins a new series for young adults , " The Annals of the Western Shore " .
The second book , Voices , will be published in March .
" Writing fantasy is n't writing for children , but it erases the distinctions ; it 's inherently a crossover genre , " she says .
Much of fantasy writing , she adds , is " about power - just look at Tolkien .
It 's a means to examine what it does to the person who has it , and to others . "
A believer , with Shelley , that " the great instrument of moral good is the imagination " , she says : " If you can not or will not imagine the results of your actions , there 's no way you can act morally or responsibly .
Little kids can't do it ; babies are morally monsters - completely greedy .
Their imagination has to be trained into foresight and empathy . "
No easy task .
As she once wrote in exasperation , " Sure , it 's simple , writing for kids .
Just as simple as bringing them up . "
Gifts , like some of her earlier books , is about a slave - owning society obsessed with purity of lineage .
" There are so many cultures that do that - especially when they think something special runs in the blood , " she says .
" Some reviewers say , ' slavery 's dead ' .
What planet are they living on ? "
Le Guin was born in 1929 in Berkeley , California , where her father , Alfred Kroeber , a German immigrant , founded the university anthropology department , studying the " wrecks of cultures , the ruins of languages , smashed by a monoculture " .
Her mother , Theodora , shared his fascination with native American life , and wrote Ishi in Two Worlds ( 1961 ) , on a Yahi Indian 's encounter with " civilisation " .
" We had a house full of folktales ; I liked the Norse better than the Greek , " says Le Guin , who sees the frontier between civilised and barbaric as " boundaries of the mind alone " .
During summers on the family ranch in the Napa Valley , native American " uncles " made her aware of both the richness of their oral culture , and the bigotry they faced .
They and the valley inspired Always Coming Home ( 1985 ) , about post - nuclear holocaust Californians .
" White is not the norm for me , or equivalent to being human , as in so much of the fantasy I read , " she says .
" I made a conscious choice to make most of my characters people of colour . "
In the Earthsea books , Ged is a dark copper-red , and his friend Vetch is black .
" I 've had endless battles with cover departments .
Gradually the people on the books are darkening - it 's taken that long . "
The early Earthsea books were loosely adapted as a TV miniseries for the US sci - fi channel last year , but it was " roundly booed and deserves to die a quiet death " , she says .
" Everybody was white except for one black man .
It was a travesty . "
Her own earlier screenplay has languished ( " they said it was the wrong moment for fantasy in Hollywood " ) .
After studying French and Italian literature at Radcliffe College and Columbia University , she won a Fulbright scholarship to France .
She met Charles Le Guin , a fellow scholar from Georgia , " in steerage " on the Queen Mary .
" We married in Paris in 1953 , then moved to the Deep South .
Going to a totally segregated society was quite a shock .
I pulled him west . "
A historian , he took up a post at Portland State University in 1958 .
The couple have three children and three grandchildren .
Initially a poet , Le Guin published her first novel at 37 .
From JRR
Tolkien , " I learned the trick of hinting at a whole background with a few names , so you 'd feel situated in a real world , not a fantasy bubble . "
But , " raised as irreligious as a jackrabbit " , she found much of CS Lewis " simply Christian apologia , full of hatred and contempt for people who did n't agree .
The division into good and evil was different from Tolkien , where evil beings are only a metaphor for the evil in our lives ; he never casts people into the outer darkness as Lewis enjoyed doing . "
Though fantasy is often miscast as escapist , for Le Guin , it is the natural language of the " spiritual journey and the struggles of good and evil in the soul " .
It begins to resemble dream , she says , " and the symbols seem to be near universal and accessible to all .
They 're the same through the ages : we read the Epic of Gilgamesh and get it .
The symbolic language is basic but not primitive or childish ; it 's a deep grammar of understanding . "
Jung was a useful stepping stone ( " unlike Freud , he understood what artists do " ) .
She traces a fantasy lineage , from Frankenstein to Philip K Dick , embracing Jorge Luis Borges , Italo Calvino , Jose Saramago and Gabriel García Márquez .
But she also aspired to other traditions , from Dickens and Tolstoy , to Hardy and Woolf : " You have to shoot as high as you can shoot . "
She had abandoned " hardware and soldiers " sci- fi in her teens .
" It all had conservative assumptions : white men go forth and conquer the universe , " she says .
" As an anthropologist 's daughter , you look more from the point of view of the conquered . "
But in the 60s she became part of a generation " not interested in space conquest or wiring , but using the form as a wonderful box of fixed metaphors you can play with endlessly , like a musician with a sonata . "
Her alternative planets , from which emissaries report back like space - age anthropologists , are " thought experiments " to probe the present , not prediction or extrapolation into the future .
The novels sift the essential in human nature from the mutable .
Change is the " key word : you 're opening the door to imagination , and the possibility of things being other than they are " .
She has an abiding interest in " peculiar arrangements " of gender and sexuality .
" It 's a tremendous playground , and it does n't do any harm to have people 's ideas shook up , " she says .
" I do my thinking narratively . "
The germ of The Left Hand of Darkness was a society that had never known war .
But the inhabitants are androgynous ( " the king was pregnant " ) .
" I eliminated gender to find out what was left , " she later wrote .
Some feminists carped at her use of the pronoun " he " of her androgyns .
But the writer Sarah LeFanu sees the questioning of masculinity and femininity as prescient : " She was asking how we live now , and how we might live .
She writes wonderfully about what it means to be human . "
Girls were barred from the Earthsea school for wizards .
" While in science fiction I was destroying gender , my imagination in fantasy was more traditional . "
She found herself " reborn slowly , over 15 years ; I evolved with second - stage feminism " .
In Tehanu , a darker novel that challenges the earlier books , she returned to Earthsea after a 17 - year gap , writing from the view of a mature woman and an abused girl .
In the latest of her Ekumen novels , The Telling ( 2000 ) , an emissary from a post - funda - mentalist Earth arrives on Aka , where the written word is banned .
Christian and Islamic fundamentalism fed into the novel , but the impetus was Mao 's suppression of Taoism .
" He wiped out an ancient religious practice in a generation , " she says .
" Culture and knowledge are so vulnerable ; that shocked me . "
Le Guin , whose fantasies are partly about the artist as magician , learning to temper power with responsibility and talent with humility , says she wrestles with the temptation to moralise .
" Sometimes one 's very angry and preaches , but I know that to clinch a point is to close it , " she says .
" To leave the reader free to decide what your work means , that 's the real art ; it makes the work inexhaustible . "
SXSW to MPAA : STFU
Just a thought from 15 March 2006 about Apple , Geek , Internet , Movies , Music , Politics , SXSW .
One of the most interesting panels at SXSW Interactive 2006 was The Future of Darknets , moderated by JD Lasica .
And while the concept of Darknets - communities using private subnetworks to communicate and collaborate out of view of the larger internet - is indeed fascinating , the panel was not interesting because of the intended topic .
In fact , we never actually got to hear much about DarkNets , much to my disappointment , because the panel was hijacked the moment one panelist said , " Hello , my name is Kori Bernards , and I 'm from the Motion Picture Association of America . "
What followed was an hour - long firing squad as one audience member after another directed angry questions her way .
The feeling of pent - up frustrations with the movie biz was palpable , especially as her claims of flexibility and excitement within the MPAA to find " creative new solutions " to the problems raised by the audience rang more and more hollow , the more times she repeated them .
A couple times I almost felt sorry for her .
And there were times when the cries of freedom coming from the crowd sounded like little more than selfish little privileged kids wanting to do what they want , when they wanted .
And then I remembered all those awful anti-piracy trailers they make us watch before the movies we paid to see , the total unabashed lie of their " we just wanna protect artists " line , and the way they want to make us pay over and over for the same content in multiple formats , and all my sympathy for the MPAA evaporated .
Think about this : I can go to the store and buy a five inch reflective disc that holds digital media .
If that disc is a music CD , I can pop it in my computer , encode it , put it on my iPod , and listen to it whenever I like .
But if that disc is a movie DVD , I cannot , even though the same iPod is perfectly capable of playing the same digital content that I own just the same .
( Oh , and by the way , Apple created a billion dollar industry in legal song downloading because of this .
Where 's the Apple Movie Store ?
Ask the MPAA . )
Now , being the geek I am , I know I can encode movies and do what I just described .
But I 've got to use one of a handful of quasi-legal programs .
The MPAA does n't want me to do that , and they 've threatened legal action against those that do .
Plus , there 's no way to do it using the same tools that came with my computer and iPod ( namely iTunes ) because of that same legal threat .
The audience was filled with other examples of an industry gone crazy .
One guy moved to the UK and all his DVDs stopped working because they were region - encoded ( as most are ) .
Her answer ?
That was in the contract you agreed to when you bought the DVD .
Another guy asked why he can't just download the Sopranos .
After all , he 's a HBO subscriber , so he paid for it , he just happened to miss the last episode .
Her answer , again , was that the time is part of the contract .
My answer :
Give it a couple years and HBO will be doing this , or they 'll be out of business .
Another audience member said she worked at a small film studio , doing clearances for copyrighted works to appear in movies ( simply having a movie on in the background of another movie requires a release , at least according to the MPAA ) and most of the time the artists involved all said it was fine - it was the studio lawyers who stood in the way .
And that 's really the problem , is n't it ?
There are these industries of middlemen - RIAA , MPAA - that claim to " protect artists " but what they 're really protecting is themselves .
Artists ( and I include myself in that word ) need to rise up and tell these people to go get stuffed .
We can decide when a mashup is perfectly fine with us .
We can decide to embrace file traders to build awareness of our work .
We do n't need you anymore .
You 're just holding us back .
After all , when we allow these industry groups to frame the debate about the internet and file trading as artists versus pirates , it 's a false dichotomy .
No one in that angry audience in Austin wants to dupe a movie to sell it on the street .
That 's piracy .
We just want to put movies on our hard drives and iPods , share our mix CDs with each other ( just like we used to do with tapes ) , and mash that funny video with that cool song to produce something new , something we 'll give away for free .
All these acts are illegal , or at least under threat by industry groups .
Meanwhile , real pirates are on the streets selling bootleg DVDs .
What are these industry groups doing about that very real threat ?
If only they realized that artist geeks like us are exactly the kind of people who could come up with some really interesting ways to attack the real piracy problem , if only they let us do what we want with the media we buy ?
Until we ( users , industry groups , lawyers , and politicians ) finally make a clear legal and procedural distinction between copying a work for noncommercial creation of new works ( like mashups or backups ) and wholesale piracy for profit ( like duplicating a work for the purpose of resale ) , we 're just going to keep shouting at each other in conference rooms and newspapers , and real innovation will never get made .
UPDATE : You can listen in to the whole panel thanks to SXSW 's MP3 Podcast .
You can also see some of the best moments , thanks to the video clips by Chuck Olsen .
The bombs were crude , homemade devices
Officials say more than 300 explosions took place simultaneously in 50 cities and towns across the country including the capital Dhaka .
An outlawed Islamic group , Jamatul Mujahideen Bangladesh , says it carried out the attacks .
Police say that more than 50 people have been arrested in connection with the blasts .
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia condemned the attacks as " cowardly " .
" The attackers are enemies of the country , people , peace , humanity and democracy , " she said .
Reports say many of the injured have been admitted to local hospitals , although most of the injuries are not life - threatening .
The blasts caused panic across many cities leading to massive traffic jams .
Reports say parents rushed to bring their children home from school .
It was a horrible experience .
In the name of humanity , I ask all the extremist groups to please think twice before attempting this kind of coordinated crime
Jesin Zahir , Dhaka
Fear of concerted campaign
" It 's an organised attack , " said Home Minister Lutfozzaman Babor , adding that 58 of the country 's 64 districts were affected .
In each incident , bombs were set off in crowded spots , mainly at government offices , journalists ' clubs and courts , between 1030 and 1130 local time .
Mr Babor said timing devices were found at the scenes of blasts but most of the bombs were small , homemade devices - wrapped in tape or paper .
One of the deaths was a young boy in Savar , near Dhaka , who was killed when he picked up a device .
The other confirmed death was in the western town of Rajshahi , where doctors say a businessman died from wounds in an explosion .
Dhaka resident Jesin Zahir witnessed a blast near Jahangir Nagar university .
" It was a horrible experience .
In the name of humanity , I ask all the extremist groups to please think twice before attempting this kind of coordinated crime . "
Unexplained
Leaflets from the Jamatul Mujahideen Bangladesh have appeared at the site of some of the blasts .
" It is time to implement Islamic law in Bangladesh " and " Bush and Blair be warned and get out of Muslim countries " , the leaflets say .
Early this year the Bangladesh government banned Jamatul Mujahideen and another group , Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh
Security has been stepped up across the country
They were accused of being behind a series of bomb blasts , including those at two local aid agencies - Grameen and Brac .
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Dhaka said the banning was a major change in policy as the government had long insisted there was no threat from Islamic militancy .
Police and security forces were quickly deployed on Wednesday and were seen checking vehicles at Dhaka 's main intersections .
Several unexplained bombs have exploded across Bangladesh in recent years .
On Saturday , one person was killed and 50 others injured after several bombs were thrown at a Muslim shrine in eastern Bangladesh .
In May last year , the British High Commissioner in Bangladesh was hurt in a grenade explosion at a Muslim shrine in the north - eastern town of Sylhet .
Three people were killed and more than 50 wounded in that attack .
“ We know it ’s going to run all the way , at least to the election . ”

Conformity
Product conformity is of paramount importance .
Safety and responsibility for environment begins at the design stage of each product , the specification of materials and components , right through to the production method .
We strive to supply you with a safe product and one that conforms to all regulations .
One of the things that I have been thinking about a lot lately is the way that the current Web world ( particularly the Web 2.0 stuff ) and games seems to be ships passing in the night .
It ’s led me to say a lot lately that the two groups have a lot to learn from one another .
Right now , with big dot - com folks like Joi Ito calling WoW “ the new golf , ” there ’s a bit more awareness crossing the gap , but sometimes I wonder if the right lessons are bring learned .
So I thought I ’d post my quick off - the - top - of - my - head list of stuff that each side should learn from the other .
Things that the Web folks can learn from games :
Interface .
Games bring a lot of interface knowledge to the table ; consider that most games offer far more complex environments to navigate , with far subtler information , than the typical webpage .
And yet , the current trend towards simpler interfaces in webpages has mostly meant simplifying actual capability .

It ’s the content , stupid .
Far too many web services are features , not systems , and far too many of them are intended to grow via user content without being seeded with actual content .
The most robust user content communities are those built by fandoms , accreting like pearls around initial ideas .

Entertainment .
Games are about fun ; far too many web services are simply not fun .
All activities can be improved by adding some fun factor : game - like qualities like collecting , ranking , and so on .

Feedback .
Games understand that everything is about feedback .
Websites often seem to forget , and I do n’t know why .
This is getting better with AJAX , but there ’s still a heck of a lot of forms of feedback that are missing , particularly persistent feedback .

Identity .
One thing games typically do well is provide identity and context .
I am not referring solely to avatars and characters , but also to themes .
Avatars and profiles , obviously , rock .
Puzzle games do n’t have avatars , and yet the context of Bookworm is memorable , and nobody is going to forget Zuma ‘s weirdo frog .
Context matters .

Depth .
Games often provide something that is simple on the face of it , yet reveals hidden unexpected depths .
It ’s implicit in the models games provide .
Yet often , a given web service ( or even a new application or tool ) has no hidden depths .
It is what it is on the surface .
There ’s more enthusiasm for continuing to interact with software when it keeps revealing cool stuff to you .
Things that the game guys can learn from the Web :
Digital distribution .
There are n’t any websites that you buy in a store .
That ’s because stores are an outmoded way to distribute digital data .
The prime reason to do it is because you want to retain control of the entire process from generation of data through distribution and onto the playback mechanism .
But bits , by and large , do want to be free .

Platforms .
Web services are full of APIs that connect services and apps , magnify utility , and allow mashups and greater user content .
Games , even those which are designed for modding , do n’t really embrace openness .
The industry is pretty determined to be a content creation industry , but games are not content , they are systems content lives in .

Small pieces loosely joined .
The web has figured out that bite - size chunks are what make sense for the largest amount of people .
Sure , lots of bite - sized chunks aggregated into a site like Amazon or eBay makes something that ’s big overall , but it ’s got some advantages over linear structures : easy to jump in anywhere , easy to do things in different orders , easy to search and index , and easy to add to .

KISS .
Games are in love with overcomplication ( particularly the “ mainstream ” games industry , which is anything but , targeted as it is at mostly hardcore gamers and hobbyists ) .
Most websites do something highly targeted and simple , and do it well .
Crazy game budgets are a symptom of a problem , not something to emulate .

Client agnostic .
Web guys rely on standards and assume that any damn browser might interact with their content .
They provide alternate versions for differing client platforms .
Us , we often design completely new games for different platforms , then release them under the same name .
Britney Spears has hardly seen her husband since revealing she was pregnant , it 's been claimed .
Friends say the pop babe - who announced the happy news ten days ago - is constantly left alone with the couple 's eight - month - old son , Sean Preston , while Kevin Federline works on his rap album .
Britney even spent Mother 's Day - celebrated in the US last Sunday ( 14.05.06 ) - alone in Los Angeles .
She then travelled to New York alone this week .
A friend told Britain 's The Sun newspaper : " Kevin was in the studio or drinking .
Even after she returned they 've barely been together .
He works flat out .
" It is n't the first time Kevin has come under fire .
The former dancer reportedly spent too much time partying and seeing friends after the couple 's baby was born last year , and Britney was said to be upset that he was not spending enough time helping her with their son .
Some of Britney 's fans even urged her to dump Kevin .
They set up a website , DivorceKevin.com , which included a petition begging the young mum to leave .
A statement on the website read : " Are you sick of seeing the train wreck that is Britney and Kevin ? "
I was thinking about setting up a newsletter on FuckForForest .
What a nightmare that turned out to be , not as easy as it sounds like .
For you who that have no idea how the world look like , for people like us .
I am talking about people that are working with the art form of nudity and sex .
You would think that the internet is build for the adult industry as a big majority of all internet user end up there some point of the day .
Still to use PayPal , a well known pay system is not ok for us obscene people .
They refuse to support adult materials like FuckForForest .
We are not even a big scary pornographic page ,
We are just a bunch of openminded sexual liberated people collecting money for something more than ourself .
Still they refused us to use it in our collection of funds for ecology .
PayPal are discriminating a legal working group .
This is strange .
It is even stranger that this can be legal .
Yesterday I was using the hole day trying to set up a email newsletter .
For a amateur and small group of followers , this would be easer to do over a ready made management system .
After trying one after one I realized this was not going to be so easy as I first imagined .
No one wanted to be connected to adult scary material .
To run a adult page and wanting to have simple newsletter , you have to be a fucking computer geek .
You have to make it yourself or buy license and set up .
We will manage to figure it out and one day , if we will turn into computer geeks on the way , this will be the price to pay for getting a simple newsletter sent out to our fans .
Lately , Joel on Software 's discussion forums have been a hotspot for Lisp discussions , probably because Joel 's been learning Lisp and hanging out with Paul Graham from time to time .
There 's a thread today called Lisp Lovers , how would you fix Lisp or bring it up to date ?.
I 'd like to ask the same question to people who hang out here .
I think it would be best to keep the answers to the question at Joel 's forum so it 's all in one place .
I 've posted my reply to Joel 's forum .
Please comment on it if you have any thoughts .
Daily Howler : Dowd and Matthews let us see the shape of the coverage to come
B ACK TO THE FUTURE !
Dowd and Matthews let us see the shape of the coverage to come : // link // print // previous // next //
WEDNESDAY , FEBRUARY 21 , 2007
IN THE BEDROOM : Let 's face it .
If theres anything dumber than Maureen Dowd , its Maureen Dowd writing from Beverly Hills .
( Is Santa Monica close enough ?
Simply put , Maureen Dowd despises the Clintons .
In case her readers were too dumb to catch it , she arranges to cite the Lincoln Bedroom three separate times in this mornings column , while forgetting to tell us how badly her tribe twisted that tale back in 1998 .
( Link below . )
And this morning , Dowd has found a live one in her dumb pal , Brother Geffen .
How dumb is Geffen when it comes to politics ?
Here he is , showing the world how to let the hate machine win : DOWD ( 2/21/07 ) : Hillary is not David Geffen 's dreamgirl .
'' Whoever is the nominee is going to win , so the stakes are very high , '' says Mr. Geffen , the Hollywood mogul and sultan of '' Dreamgirls , '' as he sits by a crackling fire beneath a Jasper Johns flag and a matched pair of de Koonings in the house that Jack Warner built ( which old - time Hollywood stars joked was the house that God would have built ) .
'' Not since the Vietnam War has there been this level of disappointment in the behavior of America throughout the world , and I do n't think that another incredibly polarizing figure , no matter how smart she is and no matter how ambitious she is — and God knows , is there anybody more ambitious than Hillary Clinton ? — can bring the country together .
Good God , what a loser !
As these boys have done since the dawn of time , Geffen knows to slime the woman for daring to be so ambitious . 
And what does it mean when Geffen says that Clinton is incredibly polarizing ?
It means this : Right - wing nut jobs invented a string of ugly tales about Clinton — and Geffen is tired of fighting the fight .
In fact , Hillary Clinton is incredibly polarizing  because Maureen Dowd sat and stared while high - profile crackpots accused her and her husband of ( for example ) a long string of murders .
Today , Geffen is nt angry at the haters and crackpots for this sorry history .
Not him !
Hes angry at Clinton instead !
Let 's face it .
If theres anything dumber than Maureen Dowd , its Maureen Dowd writing from Beverly Hills .
( Is Santa Monica close enough ?
Click here for a simpering 1997 example . )
But lets add one more nominee : Hollywood mogul David Geffen , who Dowd uses to vent her endless spleen in this mornings  Vile Clinton , the Sequel .
Simply put , Maureen Dowd despises the Clintons .

Today , Geffen is nt angry at the haters and crackpots for this sorry history .
Not him !
Crackpots invented wild stories about her .
And David Geffen is now blaming her .
Meanwhile , Geffen is too stupid to understand a basic fact about Obama , his own ( perfectly reasonable ) choice for the White House .
Heres that fact : Obama will turn out to be incredibly polarizing  himself , as soon as he gets the nomination .
( Or hell turn out to be a flip - flopper , like Kerry .
Or hell turn out to be a big liar , like Gore . )
The same Hate Machine which made Clinton so polarizing  will make this brilliant man a big punch - line too .
Indeed ,
Dowd is already hard at work on the project .
Again today , she snidely compares Obama to an iconic white woman : DOWD : Barack Obama has made an entrance in Hollywood unmatched since Scarlett O'Hara swept into the Twelve Oaks barbecue .
Instead of the Tarleton twins , the Illinois senator is flirting with the DreamWorks trio : Mr. Geffen , Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg , who gave him a party last night that raised $ 1.3 million and Hillary 's hackles .
In her last column , Obama was legally blonde ( see all Dem males are big girlie - men .
And yes , though Geffen hasnt noticed it yet , shes a nut when it comes to race also .
Dowd has been a nutcase for years .
Today , she finds a match — David Geffen .
Eek !
To Maureen Dowd , the Clintons are liars .
And Bill Clinton is a very , very bad , naughty boy .
But she doesnt want to say these things herself , so she latches onto Geffen , and lets him do it .
And good lord , is he ready to vent !
Twice , she quotes him saying or suggesting that Bill Clinton is still engaging in extramarital sex .
And here is the moguls take on the Clintons  honesty , quoted this morning by Dowd :  Everybody in politics lies , but they do it with such ease , it 's troubling . 
What evidence are we given for this ?
Read the column : Geffen wanted Bill Clinton to pardon Leonard Peltier , were told , and Clinton didnt do it .
Thats when the pair fell out ,  Dowd says .
And this is the one example Geffen ( through Dowd ) gives in support of that sweeping statement about two peoples honesty .
Is it possible to get any dumber than Geffen ?
Amazing , is nt it ?
In a world of Bush and Cheney — and Romney — Dowd and Geffen still believe that the Clintons are the reigning stars of dishonesty !
But then , nothing is dumber than Maureen Dowd — unless its Dowd writing from Hollywood .
IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM : Weve been wanting to congratulate tristero for his soul — for retaining the ability to be shocked by the way they lied about the Lincoln Bedroom .
( nothing these people wont say and do to make you believe their favorite stories .
Today , Dowd mentions the Lincoln Bedroom three separate times .
You cant get more dishonest .
NOT A MISTAKE : Perhaps you begin to see we were right .
It wasnt a coincidence when Maureen Dowd called Obama legally blonde ,  and it is nt a coincidence when she calls him  Scarlett OHara today .
Dowd is a walking nightmare on matters of gender , and shes not much better on race .
Dont worry — shes going to sneer at Obama endlessly , just as she did with the lactating 
Gore .
Her insider cohort is barely sane — and they direct our sad discourse .
Make no mistake :
This will continue until liberals get smart — until we say that this must stop , until we go after these tortured souls whenever they slander any one of our candidates .
First , shes coming for Hillary Clinton .
If we sit around and stare , shell be coming for Obama next .
AGAIN , THE NECESSARY CONTEXT : Lets say it again :
We were raised Irish Catholic ourselves , back in the era of Tailgunner Joe .
But most of us who were raised Irish Catholic found ways to grow up and move on from the eras less pleasing aspects .
Dowds particular cohort didnt ; the underside of an otherwise wonderful culture still plays tricks with their damaged heads .
When Dowd calls
Dem males girlie - men , you need to understand where it comes from , and you need to understand that it is nt some kind of odd , random event .
Dowd is one of the emotional losers from the unfortunate side of an earlier culture .
For years , though , her tortured impulses and ideas have been driving our political discourse .
SPOT OFF : How big a fool is Maureen Dowd ?
Heres the start of her very first column on Gores bald spot , early in 1997 : DOWD ( 1/30/97 ) : Is the Spot getting bigger ?
Tipper says it is n't , but I know it is .
At this rate , by the year 2000 I 'll look like Joe Biden , wandering around with okra plugs in my head .
It 's making me a little crazy .
Actually , everything these days is making me a little crazy .
I 've been so loyal for four years , staying in the shadow of President Smarmy and just praying I do n't get splattered .
Ah yes — the birth of Gore as a little crazy . 
Over the next several years , Dowd continued her bad spot series ; she wrote columns in which Crazy Gore conversed with  the Spot in September 1997 , December 1997 and June 1998 .
After a tantalizing hiatus , she brought her brilliant format back in August 2000 , right after the Democratic convention .
And then , triumph of the will !
There it was again , driving Dowds column on the Sunday before the 2000 election .
Omigod !
Gore was addressing his bald spot again !
Her headline ?
No , readers , we re really not joking .
 I Feel Pretty ,  her inane headline said : DOWD ( 11/5/00 ) : I feel stunning
And entrancing ,
Feel like running and dancing for joy . . .
O.K. , enough gloating .
Behave , Albert .
Just look in the mirror now and put on your serious I only - care - about - the - issues face .
If I rub in a tad more of this mahogany - colored industrial mousse , the Spot will disappear under my Reagan pompadour .
That s how Dowd started her widely - read column two days before the crucial election which eventually sent the U. S. to Iraq .
She mocked Gore — and lets mention that headline again .
Once again , in the voice - of - Gore :  I Feel Pretty ,  she said .
Lets say it — these people are barely sane .
And yes , Dowd will do this to Obama too ; as weve seen ( though you cant quite accept it ) , she has already started .
Libs and Dems cant pick - and - choose their outrage over this sort of clowning .
We have to react to it every time .
We have to defend all our candidates .
Meanwhile , the Times should finally do the right thing .
Maureen Dowd is barely sane .
There are nice rehab centers near Beverly Hills .
The Times should escort her to one .
BARELY SANE : On todays op - ed page , sharing space with Dowd : Peter Funt ( of Candid Camera ! ) writes
Andrew Rosenthal — second generation , to the Times manor born — selected this inane discussion .
Let s repeat it , until we get it straight .
These hapless people are barely sane .
And yet , they direct our discussions .
BACK TO THE FUTURE : Give him credit for one small favor .
MATTHEWS ( 2/19/07 ) : I dont believe early polls .
However , I have spent weeks now listening to women — pretty educated women , in fact , very educated women , East Coast types , very professional — one after another after another says ,  I don`t like Hillary Clinton . 
They really don`t like her .
And then I look at the polls [ of the nations Democrats ] , she is up to 40 percent .
What is the disconnect ?
Explain it to me .
Why is Hillary doing so well in the general population but the cognoscenti , the people around Washington and New York , the people that really read the papers , really keep up , really follow politics , have this complicated problem with Hillary ?
For some reason , Matthews believes that his lady friends are part of  the cognoscenti — and he knows that these friends simply hate Lady Clinton .
And if you saw the way Matthews  cohort covered Gore in 1999 and 2000 , you can expect the same treatment for Clinton .
If libs and Dems have an ounce of sense , well start objecting .
Right now .
But some of us wont start reacting yet , due to something else Matthews said .
Speaking with Obama aide David Axelrod , he provided a further look at what will be coming this year : MATTHEWS ( 2/19/07 ) : Let me ask you , David Axelrod — let me just try to make a proposition to you .
On behalf of our producers here and everybody that works at MSNBC , we would like a lot to have your candidate , Barack Obama , to sit — the junior senator from Illinois — be our guest , our special guest on a town meeting with college students at some college , perhaps , of his choice .
Certainly a good college .
And we would to love him in the round with the students for an hour , like we did with John McCain and we have done with other candidates , including Hillary Clinton in the past , and Rudy Giuliani and the others .
We have tried to get everybody .
We would really like to get Barack Obama .
You dont have to answer today .
Yes , Matthews has had other pols on his tour ;  but no , he has never beg - invited a guest in this manner .
As he continued , the shape of the future was clear in his grovel : MATTHEWS ( continuing directly ) :
Well , we will pay for it , and it is very expensive , but it will be a well - lighted room and he get a chance to answer questions for a full hour in front of students , and they will get involved with him .
And I think it is a great platform for a guy who , clearly , according to my kids , and maybe me too — the kid in me — appeals to the youth of America and the young at heart .
There is no doubt what you say is true .
He does draw on something deeply good about this country .
Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss !
Matthews  friends ( they re part of the cognoscenti ) just cant stand the thought of Vile Clinton .
But his kids — and yes , the kid within — think that Obama does draw on something deeply good about this country . 
If you dont understand what that pandering means , you didnt see Matthews  hour - long coverage of Obamas announcement , when he and Fineman and Lynn Sweet might as well have been wearing their cheerleader sweaters .
And you didnt see his coverage of Campaign 2000 , when he pandered and fawned to Dem challenger Bill Bradley — and trashed Gore for two solid years .
Indeed , what makes this clownish , erratic man think hes tied to the cognoscenti ?
Perhaps he reviewed the high - toned constructs he himself used during Campaign 2000 !
It might be the program from July 29 , 1999 , when he delivered his standard derisions as his guests watched tape of Gore : MATTHEWS ( 7/29/99 ) : Is Al Gore just incapable of putting , like , one foot in front of the other in this campaign ?
Hes a professional politician —
SCARBOROUGH : Yeah .
Hes awful .
MATTHEWS : — who acts like an amateur .
I dont get it .
Did you ever see the movie  Altered States ? 
I mean , his face is , like , getting contorted in some of these — theres bubbles coming out of his forehead !
Ever the high - brow intellectual , Matthews compared Gore to a sci- fi monster .
And , as always , more was coming .
Mary Boyle , former Dem Senate candidate from Ohio , said that Gore had appeared in Cleveland that day .
Matthews continued his onslaught : MATTHEWS : What mode was he in ?
Was he in , was he in the quiet mode , or that sort of Clutch Cargo craziness he gets into , or was he  BOYLE : No , no , but he was 
MATTHEWS : — or was he in the  Altered States  where the head starts to bubble ?
What state was he in today ?
No wonder Matthews glances about and believes hes part of the cognoscenti !
In the two segments of this program which dealt with Gore , Matthews said that Gore had  the shakes ;  called him Bill Clintons  bathtub ring ;  and said that he was a square and loser . 
He said that Gore was a little too clock - like . 
He said that Gore was pandering to women because he supported the right to choose .
He said that Gore was into robotics .
( He landed hard on Boyle , and on Norah ODonnell , when they tried to challenge his ridicule . )
At one point , he ridiculed Boyle for her defense of Gore , saying that , in explaining his point , he would be talking like Al Gore , very slowly , like Mr. Rogers . 
He said that  Gore is acting like hes made out of metal — not just wood , metal . 
In time , he returned to his  Clutch Cargo theme .
Why was Bush polling well among women ?
After showing more tape of Gore , Matthews thought he might have the answer : MATTHEWS :
Well , could it be that — that George W. Bush seems like a spontaneous human male , rather than a windup robot , like that performance we just saw ?
That wasnt a human performance
He doesnt behave now like — he behaves like a windup Clutch Cargo cartoon character .
I wouldnt think that would appeal to the other gender .
Just guessing .
Gore went on to win 54 percent of the womens vote , compared to Bushs 43 .
But so what ?
This sort of thing went on for two years as this utterly stupid man earned his way into the hearts ( and wallets ) of Jack Welchs  cognoscenti .
This Sunday , Gore will likely share an Academy Award for a film about his brilliant work on warming .
But back when it mattered , Matthews compared Gore to the star of a horror film — and to Clutch Cargo , a cartoon .
With Bradley , of course , it was different .
If you want to know how this years primary will be treated , lets recall the way Matthews covered Bill Bradley , the Obama of Campaign 2000 .
Bradley wasnt part of the Clinton team — and so , on Hardball , he was endlessly flattered .
Almost surely , this is how Matthews — and others in the cognoscenti — will be covering Obamas primary run , since ( through absolutely no fault of his own ) Obama is this years anti-Clinton .
How absurd could Hardball be in its treatment of Bradley ?
On September 7 , 1999 , Howard Fineman appeared on the show to discuss a Newsweek profile of the former senator .
Fineman found his host in typical form ; after playing tape of Gore , Matthews compared Gore to a  Chinese poster  and a  man - like object — a phrase he applied to Gore three separate times in that month alone .
In response , Fineman praised Bradley as a  Boy Scout and a sports hero straight out of central casting  — and as a man who had spent more time with African - Americans in a work environment , albeit the NBA , than anybody else whos ever run . 
 I think that s a big appeal ,  Matthews dumbly answered .
But then , invidious comparisons , served up straight , were par for the course now on Hardball .
When Fineman returned on September 21 , Matthews introduced a segment by comparing Gore , whos part of the bathtub ring ,  to  this clean - as - a - whistle NBA star , Bill Bradley . 
Repeatedly , Gore was called  a man - like object and a  bathtub ring ,  and , of course , robotic ( and , mockingly ,  Mr. Wizard ) .
Here was Matthews a few weeks later , reviewing tape of another Gore speech : MATTHEWS ( 10/12/99 ) :
That strikes me as virtual reality .
Theres a man — Ben Jones , you were a congressman — where he , hes reading every word from his script !
And then it must say in his script ,  Now walk out from behind the lectern and start slashing on — your arms , talking about slashing .
And he did it almost like an automaton , like thats what Churchill once said of Molotov , you know , the , the closest thing to a human robot .
To his credit , Jones didnt seem to know how to react to such an utterly bizarre presentation .
But Hardballs host was inventive in trashing Gore — and in fleshing out Bradleys high character .
On that September 7 show , for example , Matthews had surely set a new record for ludicrous fawning .
By now , the host — a member of the cognoscenti , youll recall — was puffing Bill Bradley quite hard : FINEMAN ( 9/7/99 ) : [ Bradleys ] straight out of central casting in the old - fashioned sense : well - credentialed 
MATTHEWS : Right .
FINEMAN : Sports hero  MATTHEWS : Right .
FINEMAN : Fellowship of Christian Athletes when he was young , the whole nine yards .
So what he offers Democrats is a chance to keep the Democrats in the White House .
MATTHEWS : I think that five oclock shadow , by the way , and the receding hairline are big pluses with men .
Just guessing .
Just guessing .
He looks like a real guy .
Did you follow that ?
According to Matthews , Bradleys hairline and five oclock shadow showed him to be a real guy . 
And , for the deeply scholarly Matthews , Bradley s hairline was no passing fancy .
It came up again when Fineman returned to Hardball two weeks later : MATTHEWS ( 9/21/99 ; playing tape of Bradley ) : I think hes doing — hes gonna do much better [ than Gore ] among men .
And I think that receding hairline of his is gonna be a lot more popular than Clintons Maginot Line hairline , because a lot of guys say they cant figure out Clinton because he never seems to lose any hair .
And look at this guy , Bradley .
He looks like a regular guy youd bump into .
Again , Bradley s hairline made him a regular guy . 
Two nights later , Matthews spoke with Peter Maas — and he raised the subject again : MATTHEWS ( 9/23/99 ) :
Well , what do you make of the guy up there in New York , where you re at — what do you make of guys like Dollar Bill Bradley , the gritty NBA star that goes out on the court with guys like Russell and Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson ?
And heres a gritty , real guy with a receding hairline .
He looks like a real guy .
He looks like Bruce Willis , not Pierce Brosnan or Mel Gibson .
Do you think were gonna go back to that era of looking for guys that are real guys ?
Luckily , Maas understood what Matthews wanted , so he was able to pander in turn .
 Were looking for the genuine article , is what were looking for ,  he dumbly replied .
But then , inane conversation about Bradleys authenticity  were sweeping through the press at this time .
Even those outside the cohort , like crime writer Maas , understood the themes of this brainless new drama .
Or maybe its just that Maas is part of Matthews  east coast cognoscenti too .
Lets be clear .
Plainly , it wasnt Bradleys fault that Matthews was willing to engage in such nonsense .
Nor will it be Obamas fault or doing when Matthews stages this clown - show again ( but only during the primaries ) .
But make no mistake , this clown - show is coming — staged by one of the stupidest men in the history of American  journalism .
Democrats and liberals must decide — now — how we plan to respond .
Obama supporters may quietly chortle , hoping to be helped , as Bradley was , by Matthews  consummate clowning .
We would suggest that this is unwise .
In 1999 , Matthews endlessly played the fool as he tried to help Bradley take the nomination .
But uh - oh !
Gore won the nomination , as Clinton may do — and hed been badly damaged in the process .
And of course , Matthews continued to savage Gore all through the rest of Campaign 2000 .
This two - year pounding paved the way for Bushs trip to the White House .
Dems and liberals need to decide if they re willing to let this happen again .
Make no mistake — you wont hear a word about what is coming from the well - mannered boys of your liberal elites .
Nor will they mention it as it occurs .
E. J. Dionne wont say a word , any more than he did during Campaign 2000 ; Josh Marshall most likely wont stand and fight either .
We have high hopes for Kevin Drum , but lets face it — even Kevin has to be rated a toss - up .
Jamison Foser will stand up and fight , but one or two people just is nt enough .
Dems and libs need to ask themselves now if they re ready to let Giuliani ( or McCain ) be elected .
Many liberals sat aside while Gore was being savaged in 1999 .
Result ?
George W. Bush squirmed his ways to the White House — and the U.S. Army is now in Iraq .
So heres a question , to all those members of the liberal cognoscenti who voted for Nader or just clammed up while the fools attacked Gore for two years :
How does your lassitude look to you now ?
And this :
Are you willing to let this happen again ?
Are you prepared to let Saint John McCain be the author of your next crackpot war ?
TO SUMMARIZE : Dowd was obsessed with Gores bald spot , Matthews with Bradleys five oclock shadow .
( Ah , we Irish ! )
Have we said that these people are barely sane ?
That these crackpots are driving your discourse ?
TOMORROW —TO THE COGNOSCENTI BORN : Who on earth is Susan Glasser ?
A look at your press corps elite .
FRIDAY AND MONDAY — HOW GORE GOT SLIMED : This Sunday , we hope well see Al Gore on stage as David Guggenheim receives an Oscar .
On Friday and Monday , well help you remember why this man never sat in the White House .
On Friday , well show you how Glasser played you for fools in 1999 , as Gore staged his run for the White House .
( In the business world , people get sent to jail for similar conduct . )
On Monday , well show you how the New York Times mocked Gores work on global warming in that same year , when it massively mattered .
How did Bush ever get to the White House ?
On page one of the New York Times , one of Dowds friends was working quite hard to make you think Gore was a nut .
Yep !
She was troubled by Gores loony asides — as he discussed his mid - life crisis ,  of course .
We hope that Gore will be warmly honored this Sunday .
But there is nt a circle in hell warm enough for the loathsome pair of scribes well revisit .
A TOP SCHOLARS DARING : No doubt about it — Matthews played the role of the scholar in his discussions of Campaign 2000 .
He called Gore a bathtub ring over forty times in 1999 alone ; in the next year , he ratcheted up his imagery , saying that Gore would lick the bathroom floor  if he had to in order to be president ( see MATTHEWS ( 7/21/99 ) :
Is he the bathtub ring of the Clinton administration ?
REP .
PETER KING : He really is .
The residue , whatever — you know , whatever term you want to use , yeah .
MATTHEWS : Well , that s not a very nice one .
If you can come up with a better one , Ill start using it , but for right now I m saying bathtub ring  because I think he is taking a hit for Clintons zaniness of the year before .
Indeed , Gore was taking a hit for Clinton — on Hardball , every damn night .
For the record , Matthews never quite found a better one .
He called Gore the bathtub ring all year , then added the image of licking the floor .
It s no wonder that a man of his caliber finds himself swarmed by the cognoscenti .
All around him , he hears their lofty theories .
And surprise !
They all hate Clinton !
In her last column , Obama was legally blonde ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 2/16/07 ) .
In todays piece , hes Scarlett OHara .
And if you think these sneering references are some sort of odd coincidence , you havent watched this tortured nutcase working her magic down through the years .
For years , Dowd imagined conversations with Gores bald spot ( more below ) ; by the time he began his race for the White House , Dowd wrote that Gore was so feminized  that he was practically lactating .
But then , inside the tortured mind of Dowd , Dem males are big girlie - men .
And yes , though Geffen hasnt noticed it yet , shes a nut when it comes to race also .
Dowd has been a nutcase for years .
Today , she finds a match — David Geffen .
Eek !
To Maureen Dowd , the Clintons are liars .
And Bill Clinton is a very , very bad , naughty boy .
But she doesnt want to say these things herself , so she latches onto Geffen , and lets him do it .
And good lord , is he ready to vent !
Twice , she quotes him saying or suggesting that Bill Clinton is still engaging in extramarital sex .
And here is the moguls take on the Clintons  honesty , quoted this morning by Dowd : Whatare we given for this ?
Read the column : Geffen wanted Bill Clinton to pardon Leonard Peltier , were told , and Clinton didnt do it .
Thats when the pair fell out ,  Dowd says .
And this is theexample Geffen ( through Dowd ) gives in support of that sweeping statement about two peoples honesty .
Is it possible to getdumber than Geffen ?
Amazing , is nt it ?
In a world of Bush and Cheney — and Romney — Dowd and Geffen still believe thatare the reigning stars of dishonesty !
But then , nothing is dumber than Maureen Dowd — unless its Dowd writing from Hollywood .
Weve been wanting to congratulate tristero for his soul — for retaining the ability to be shocked by the way they lied about the Lincoln Bedroom .
( Click here , scroll down to 2/9/07 . )
One example :
They added in Chelsea Clintons 72 slumber - party friends to swell the number of White House overnight guests  in their bogus headlines ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 2/8/07 ) .
There isthese people wont say and do to make you believe their favorite stories .
Today , Dowd mentions the Lincoln Bedroom You cant get more dishonest .
Perhaps you begin to see we were right .
Ita coincidence when Maureen Dowd called Obama legally blonde ,  and ita coincidence when she calls him  Scarlett OHara today .
Dowd is a walking nightmare on matters of gender , and shes not much better on race .
Dont worry — shes going to sneer at Obama endlessly , just as she did with the lactating 
Gore .
Her insider cohort is barely sane — and they direct our sad discourse .
Make no mistake :
This will continue until liberals get smart — until we say that thisstop , until we go after these tortured souls whenever they slanderof our candidates .
First , shes coming for Hillary Clinton .
If we sit around and stare , shell be coming for Obama next .
Lets say it again :
We were raised Irish Catholic ourselves , back in the era of Tailgunner Joe .
But most of us who were raised Irish Catholic found ways to grow up and move on from the eras less pleasing aspects .
Dowds particular cohort didnt ; the underside of an otherwise wonderful culture still plays tricks with their damaged heads .
When Dowd calls
Dem males girlie - men , you need to understand where it comes from , and you need to understand that itsome kind of odd , random event .
Dowd is one of the emotional losers from the unfortunate side of an earlier culture .
For years , though , her tortured impulses and ideas have been driving our political discourse .
How big a fool is Maureen Dowd ?
Heres the start of her very first column on Gores bald spot , early in 1997 : Ah yes — the birth of Gore as a little crazy . 
Over the next several years , Dowd continued her bad spot series ; she wrote columns in which Crazy Gore conversed with  the Spot in September 1997 , December 1997 and June 1998 .
After a tantalizing hiatus , she brought her brilliant format back in August 2000 , right after the Democratic convention .
And then , triumph of the will !
There it was again , driving Dowds column on the Sunday before the 2000 election .
Omigod !
Her headline ?
No , readers , we re really not joking .
 I Feel Pretty ,  her inane headline said : That s how Dowd started her widely - read column two days before the crucial election which eventually sent the U. S. to Iraq .
She mocked Gore — and lets mention that headline again .
Once again , in the voice - of - Gore :  I Feel Pretty ,  she said .
Lets say it — these people are barely sane .
And yes , Dowddo this to Obama too ; as weve seen ( though you cant quite accept it ) , she has already started .
Libs and Dems cant pick - and - choose their outrage over this sort of clowning .
We have to react to it every time .
We have to defendour candidates .
Meanwhile , the Times should finally do the right thing .
Maureen Dowd is barely sane .
There are nice rehab centers near Beverly Hills .
The Times should escort her to one .
On todays op - ed page , sharing space with Dowd : Peter Funt ( of ! ) writes a completely inane analysis of Clintons web site .
And dont miss his penultimate paragraph , in which he dumbly warns us again about Obamas middle name .
Andrew Rosenthal — second generation , to the Times manor born — selected this inane discussion .
Let s repeat it , until we get it straight .
These hapless people are barely sane .
And yet , they direct our discussions .
Give him credit for one small favor .
On Monday evening , Chris Matthews gave liberals , progressives and Democrats a clear look at what will be coming .
How will Clinton be covered this year ?
Here — let an idiot tell you :
For some reason , Matthews believes that his lady friends are part of  the cognoscenti — and hethat these friends simply hate Lady Clinton .
And if you saw the way Matthews  cohort covered Gore in 1999 and 2000 , you can expect the same treatment for Clinton .
If libs and Dems have an ounce of sense , well start objecting .
Right now .
But some of usstart reacting yet , due to something else Matthews said .
Speaking with Obama aide David Axelrod , he provided a further look at what will be coming this year : Yes , Matthewshad other pols on his tour ;  but no , he has never beg - invited a guest in this manner .
As he continued , the shape of the future was clear in his grovel : Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss !
Matthews  friends ( they re part of the cognoscenti ) just cant stand the thought of Vile Clinton .
But his kids — and yes , the kid within — think that Obama does draw on something deeply good about this country .
If you dont understand what that pandering means , you didnt see Matthews  hour - long coverage of Obamas announcement , when he and Fineman and Lynn Sweet might as well have been wearing their cheerleader sweaters .
And you didnt see his coverage of Campaign 2000 , when he pandered and fawned to Dem challenger Bill Bradley — and trashed Gore for two solid years .
Indeed , what makes this clownish , erratic man think hes tied to the cognoscenti ?
Perhaps he reviewed the high - toned constructs he himself used during Campaign 2000 !
It might be the program from July 29 , 1999 , when he delivered his standard derisions as his guests watched tape of Gore :
Ever the high - brow intellectual , Matthews compared Gore to a sci- fi monster .
And , as always , more was coming .
Mary Boyle , former Dem Senate candidate from Ohio , said that Gore had appeared in Cleveland that day .
Matthews continued his onslaught :
No wonder Matthews glances about and believes hes part of the cognoscenti !
In the two segments of this program which dealt with Gore , Matthews said that Gore had  the shakes ;  called him Bill Clintons  bathtub ring ;  and said that he was a square and loser . 
He said that Gore was a little too clock - like . 
He said that Gore was pandering to women because he supported the right to choose .
He said that Gore was into robotics .
( He landed hard on Boyle , and on Norah ODonnell , when they tried to challenge his ridicule . )
At one point , he ridiculed Boyle for her defense of Gore , saying that , in explaining his point , he would be talking like Al Gore , very slowly , like Mr. Rogers . 
He said that  Gore is acting like hes made out of metal — not just wood , metal . 
In time , he returned to his  Clutch Cargo theme .
Why was Bush polling well among women ?
After showing more tape of Gore , Matthews thought he might have the answer : Gore went on to win 54 percent of the womens vote , compared to Bushs 43 .
But so what ?
This sort of thing went on for two years as this utterly stupid man earned his way into the hearts ( and wallets ) of Jack Welchs  cognoscenti .
This Sunday , Gore will likely share an Academy Award for a film about his brilliant work on warming .
But back when it mattered , Matthews compared Gore to the star of a horror film — and to Clutch Cargo , a cartoon .
With Bradley , of course , it was different .
If you want to know how this years primary will be treated , lets recall the way Matthews covered Bill Bradley , the Obama of Campaign 2000 .
Bradley wasnt part of the Clinton team — and so , on , he was endlessly flattered .
Almost surely , this is how Matthews — and others in the cognoscenti — will be covering Obamas primary run , since ( through absolutely no fault of his own ) Obama is this years anti-Clinton .
How absurd couldbe in its treatment of Bradley ?
On September 7 , 1999 , Howard Fineman appeared on the show to discuss aprofile of the former senator .
Fineman found his host in typical form ; after playing tape of Gore , Matthews compared Gore to a  Chinese poster  and a  man - like object — a phrase he applied to Gore three separate times in that month alone .
In response , Fineman praised Bradley as a  Boy Scout and a sports hero straight out of central casting  — and as a man who had spent more time with African - Americans in a work environment , albeit the NBA , than anybody else whos ever run . 
 I think that s a big appeal ,  Matthews dumbly answered .
But then , invidious comparisons , served up straight , were par for the course now on When Fineman returned on September 21 , Matthews introduced a segment by comparing Gore , whos part of the bathtub ring ,  to  this clean - as - a - whistle NBA star , Bill Bradley . 
Repeatedly , Gore was called  a man - like object and a  bathtub ring ,  and , of course , robotic ( and , mockingly ,  Mr. Wizard ) .
Here was Matthews a few weeks later , reviewing tape of another Gore speech :
To his credit , Jones didnt seem to know how to react to such an utterly bizarre presentation .
But s host was inventive in trashing Gore — and in fleshing out Bradleys high character .
On that September 7 show , for example , Matthews had surely set a new record for ludicrous fawning .
By now , the host — a member of the cognoscenti , youll recall — was puffing Bill Bradley quite hard : Did you follow that ?
According to Matthews , Bradleys hairline and five oclock shadow showed him to be a real guy . 
And , for the deeply scholarly Matthews , Bradley s hairline was no passing fancy .
It came up again when Fineman returned totwo weeks later : Again , Bradley s hairline made him a regular guy . 
Two nights later , Matthews spoke with Peter Maas — and he raised the subject again : Luckily , Maas understood what Matthews wanted , so he was able to pander in turn .
 Were looking for the genuine article , is what were looking for ,  he dumbly replied .
But then , inane conversation about Bradleys authenticity  were sweeping through the press at this time .
Even those outside the cohort , like crime writer Maas , understood the themes of this brainless new drama .
Or maybe its just that Maas is part of Matthews  east coast cognoscenti too .
Let s be clear .
Plainly , it wasnt Bradleys fault that Matthews was willing to engage in such nonsense .
Nor will it be Obamas fault or doing when Matthews stages this clown - show again ( but only during the primaries ) .
But make no mistake , this clown - show is coming — staged by one of the stupidest men in the history of American  journalism .
Democrats and liberals must decide — now — how we plan to respond .
Obama supporters may quietly chortle , hoping to be helped , as Bradley was , by Matthews  consummate clowning .
We would suggest that this is unwise .
In 1999 , Matthews endlessly played the fool as he tried to help Bradley take the nomination .
But uh - oh !
Gore won the nomination , as Clinton may do — and hed been badly damaged in the process .
And of course , Matthews continued to savage Gore all through the rest of Campaign 2000 .
This two - year pounding paved the way for Bushs trip to the White House .
Dems and liberals need to decide if they re willing to let this happen again .
Make no mistake — you wont hear a word about what is coming from the well - mannered boys of your liberal elites .
Nor will they mention it as it occurs .
E. J. Dionne wont say a word , any more than he did during Campaign 2000 ; Josh Marshall most likely wont stand and fight either .
We have high hopes for Kevin Drum , but lets face it — even Kevin has to be rated a toss - up .
Jamison Foserstand up and fight , but one or two people just is nt enough .
Dems and libs need to ask themselvesif they re ready to let Giuliani ( or McCain ) be elected .
Many liberals sat aside while Gore was being savaged in 1999 .
Result ?
George W. Bush squirmed his ways to the White House — and the U.S. Army is now in Iraq .
So heres a question , to all those members of the liberal cognoscenti who voted for Nader or just clammed up while the fools attacked Gore for two years :
How does your lassitude look to you now ?
And this :
Are you willing to let this happen again ?
Are you prepared to let Saint John McCain be the author of yourcrackpot war ?
Dowd was obsessed with Gores bald spot , Matthews with Bradleys five oclock shadow .
( Ah , we Irish ! )
Have we said that these people are barely sane ?
That these crackpots are driving your discourse ?
Who on earth is Susan Glasser ?
A look at your press corps elite .
This Sunday , we hope well see Al Gore on stage as David Guggenheim receives an Oscar .
On Friday and Monday , well help you remember why this man never sat in the White House .
On Friday , well show you how Glasser played you for fools in 1999 , as Gore staged his run for the White House .
( In the business world , peoplefor similar conduct . )
On Monday , well show you how the New York Times mocked Gores work on global warming in that same year , when it massively mattered .
How did Bush ever get to the White House ?
On page one of the New York Times , one of Dowds friends was working quite hard to make you think Gore was a nut .
Yep !
She was troubled by Gores loony asides — as he discussed his mid - life crisis ,  of course .
We hope that Gore will be warmly honored this Sunday .
But there is nt a circle in hell warm enough for the loathsome pair of scribes well revisit .
No doubt about it — Matthews played the role of the scholar in his discussions of Campaign 2000 .
He called Gore a bathtub ring over forty times in 1999 alone ; in the next year , he ratcheted up his imagery , saying that Gore would lick the bathroom floor  if he had to in order to be president ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 1/10/07 ) .
Occasionally , Matthews complimented himself for his daring .
 Im sure he loves that one ,  he said on May 14 , 1999 , after calling Gore the bathtub ring . 
 Ive been very risqué at times ,  he said a week later , in his infantile way , of this same crude formulation .
On March 8 , 1999 , he called Gore the bathtub ring as I keep saying to the discomfort of many others .
In July of that year , we got a peek into the soul of the artist as one guest balked at his language : Indeed , Goretaking a hit for Clinton — on , every damn night .
For the record , Matthews never quite found a better one .
He called Gore the bathtub ring all year , then added the image of licking the floor .
It s no wonder that a man of his caliber finds himself swarmed by the cognoscenti .
All around him , he hears their lofty theories .
And surprise !
Two - and - a- half years ago , I warned Antiwar.com readers that the fix was in at the 9/11 Commission , that the Bush administration had a powerful friend on the inside who would whitewash its pre-9/11 failings .
My worst fears have been confirmed by Bob Woodward .
We now learn that a key piece of information further indicting former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice for gross negligence was withheld from the “ independent ” commission ’s best - selling report .
On July 10 , 2001 , the CIA gave the White House its starkest warning on Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda in the run-up to the attacks .
It was issued directly to Rice by then - CIA Director George Tenet , who called an emergency meeting with her at the White House to warn her a big attack was coming .
Tenet brought along his top counterterrorism aide .
But Rice gave them both the “ brush - off , ” according to Woodward in his latest book , State of Denial .
The dramatic meeting never appeared in The 9/11 Commission Report , as if it never happened .
The media are calling it a “ mystery . ”
But who controlled what went into the report ?
None other than Rice ’s close neocon pal Philip Zelikow , executive director of the commission .
He steered the investigation , picked witnesses , formulated lines of questioning , subpoenaed documents  and even drafted the final report .
As I detailed in my March 31 , 2004 , column , Zelikow had a glaring conflict of interest .
“ There ’s a raft of evidence to suggest that Zelikow has personal , professional and political reasons not to see the commission hold Rice and other Bush officials accountable for pre-9/11 failings , ” I warned as the commission was wrapping up its hearings .
Zelikow and Rice worked together in the first Bush White House as NSC aides from 1989 to 1991 .
Not long after their White House stint , they wrote a book on Germany together .
Then , following the 2000 election , the pair were reunited in the White House when George W. Bush named Zelikow to his NSC transition team .
Perhaps his friend Rice kept him in the dark about the emergency July 10 meeting .
Perhaps it was not an intentional omission on his part .
That ’s not what Woodward found .
In fact , “ Zelikow knew something about the July 10 meeting , ” he writes .
What ’s more , Rice ’s insider pal also buried no less than five pre-9/11 memos from her NSC aides seeking retaliation against bin Laden for the USS Cole bombing .
Her aides said they had the evidence to go after bin Laden months before the 9/11 attacks .
But Rice did nothing .
On March 2 , 2001 , then - senior White House counterterrorism official Roger Cressey sent a memo to Rice relaying intelligence that bin Laden had gloated about the attack on the Cole in a poem he read at his son ’s wedding .
“ BIN LADEN on the USS COLE ” was the title of the urgent memo .
But Rice could n’t be bothered with stuff that happened on Clinton ’s watch .
Undeterred , Cressey a few weeks later followed up with Rice ’s deputy Steve Hadley .
He wrote , “ We know all we need to about who did the attack to make a policy decision . ”
His March 22 e-mail  written under the heading , “ Need for Terrorism DC Next Week ”  fell on deaf ears .
Two days later , White House terror czar Richard Clarke weighed in on the subject .
He wrote both Rice and Hadley that the Yemeni prime minister had told the State Department that while Yemen was not saying so publicly , Yemen was 99 percent certain that bin Laden was responsible for the Cole attack .
His March 24 memo , “ Yemen ’s View on the USS Cole , ” only elicited more yawns from Bush ’s top security aides .
By the summer , Clarke finally had the ironclad proof he needed to convince Rice and the president to take action against bin Laden .
On June 21  less than three months before the 9/11 attacks 
Clarke fired off another memo to Rice and Hadley alerting them that a new al - Qaeda video claimed responsibility for the Cole .
His memo could n’t have been more plain : “ Al Qida [ sic ] Video Claims Responsibility for Cole Attack . ”
More yawns from Rice .
Later that month , two Saudi jihadists arrested by Bahraini authorities during the summer threat spike told their captors that their al - Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan had held celebratory parties over the Cole attack .
By now , Clarke ’s hair was on fire .
He dashed off another memo to Rice on June 29 .
Rice again did nothing  except cut Clarke out of Cabinet meetings in a virtual demotion , that is .
Why were these damning memos buried in tiny agate type deep in the footnotes of the 9/11 report ?
Because Condi ’s loyal pal and former White House colleague wrote the report .
He picked what we ’d see in the narrative and what we ’d have to hunt for in the footnotes  all the way back on page 509 .
The information that Zelikow omitted and buried would have otherwise indicted his friend as one of the most incompetent national security advisers to ever serve in the White House .
Rice not only missed the gravest threat to U.S. national security , but arrogantly brushed off warnings about it and failed to take action that could have disrupted the plot .
Her negligence should have come through loud and clear in the 9/11 report , but it did n’t .
The American people were deceived .
If Rice had a powerful friend inside the 9/11 Commission , do you think she could count on him painting her in the best possible light ?
What if she promised him a high - level job in the administration after his stint with the commission was completed ?
Zelikow now works as a senior policy adviser to Rice at the State Department .
Todd Skinner dies in accident on Leaning Tower
Much has been going around the internet about Todd Skinner ’s death Monday while rapping off the Leaning Tower in Yosemite .
I received an email today from a climbing partner who just moved out to California .
His friend and fiance were on Leaning Tower right before Skinner .
They were rapping down as he was jugging up and helped afterwards .
Their report from the scene is that
His harness broke .
It was old and worn out , and he had a new one on the way in the mail .
If that is n’t a sad reminder for all of us to check our gear regularly , I do n’t know what is .
The SuperTopo forum has a long thread with a lot of stories memorializing Todd .
Will Gadd ( Gravsports ) and Dougald MacDonald ( The Mountain World ) relate their thoughts about Todd and there is some more media coverage at MSNBC , MountEverest.net and The Mercury News .
UPDATE : More from my friend on the accident and the harness failure :
what he heard from one of their SAR friends was that the belay loop gave out
Again , remember to check your gear …

AS ANY recent visitor to Rome can report , Italy 's urban landscape has a new feature , as common as cafés selling delicious cappuccino .
Take the Via della Conciliazione , the avenue leading to the Vatican : much of the pavement is dotted with traders from Africa , hawking “ ethnic ” carvings or bags , belts and sunglasses with fake brand names .
Watch for a while and you see the cat - and - mouse games the traders play : every so often , they get warning of a police raid , and they bundle their wares into a sack and flee .
If they fail to escape , it will instead be the police who bundle up and remove their goods .
In some Italian cities , like Venice , signs tell visitors not to buy from street traders on pain of a stiff fine .
Clearly the owners of pricey local boutiques hate the competition .
But most locals shrug their shoulders as they step past the traders , or else they make fun of the peddlers ' habit of speaking Italian laced with French .
If they think about it at all , tourists and locals alike probably assume these traders are just a disorganised , random sample of Europe 's vast army of human flotsam and jetsam , desperate migrants from poor places who arrive in leaky boats .
In reality , the traders on the streets leading to the Vatican are anything but disorganised .
They are members of a highly disciplined international community , at once religious and economic , with headquarters in another holy city — Touba , in the heart of Senegal , three hours ' drive from Dakar , the capital .
Like so many Senegalese migrants ( some of whom drive taxis in New York or pick lemons in Spain ) , those Roman peddlers belong to a dynamic Sufi Muslim movement called the Mourides .
They are followers of Cheikh Amadou Bamba , a religious leader who died in 1927 .
Inspired by his teaching , they have made an ingenious response to the advent of global markets in goods and labour .
Most of Senegal 's 11 m people are Muslims , and they usually belong to one or other of two big movements , the Mourides or the older Tidjanes .
Bamba described the teaching now known as Mouridism as a return to Islam 's roots .
But his Islam has little in common with the more austere variety propagated from Saudi Arabia .
For one thing , Mouridism has a cult of saints and shrines — including the tomb of its founder — which devout Saudis would reject .
But the self - sufficient Mourides do n't care ; they raise money for their favourite causes and build their own mosques with no need of Saudi cash .
At his home in Touba , a pious but cosmopolitan place where local businesses boast of branches in every corner of the earth , one of Bamba 's grandsons , Cheikh Ka , explains the doctrine of self - reliance .
“ If you depend on others , ” he says , “ you are not free — it is our philosophy of life . ”
Before he died Bamba expressed several wishes : in particular he hoped Touba , which he founded , would be a holy city .
His extended family , the Mbacke , includes many marabouts , or religious teachers .
What they teach includes hard work , self - reliance and solidarity .
These ideas have propelled his followers out of their country in search of work , to send money back to their families , to support their marabouts ( many of whom tour the world to visit disciples ) and to develop Touba .
All these factors have helped make the Mourides one of the more successful African communities , at home and abroad .
Wherever they are , they club together to acquire a mosque and community centre .
Their networks help migrants leave Senegal , find work and procure documents .
Far from being helpless victims of fate , many Mourides are shrewd operators in a complex , cross - border network .
Take Alioune Ka , the owner of a wholesale shop close to Rome 's Termini station : he is a brother of Cheikh Ka in Touba , who takes care of the Senegal - based members of the family .
Alioune sells “ ethnic ” items to Senegalese ( and others ) who hawk them on streets or beaches .
Some stock is from Senegal ; a lot from Indonesia , Thailand or India .
Alioune Ka admits that other migrants may be even more resourceful than the Mourides .
Many of his competitors are from Bangladesh .
He admires them : “ They watch the weather forecast and if it is going to rain the next day they are all out selling umbrellas . ”
On the street , Mr Ka greets fellow Mourides , who form cheerful , close - knit sub - groups .
Sellers of bags and belts , mostly made in China , gather to hone their techniques for dodging the police .
At lunch - time Mr Ka is joined by a compatriot , Nav Gueye , who sits outside the shop selling hot Senegalese food to all comers for € 5 ( $ 6.50 ) a meal .
Once a week most Mourides in Rome gather to pray , socialise and see who needs help .
Small groups may co-operate to hire a container and send home their purchases of consumer goods , which may then be resold in Dakar 's Sandaga market , run by the Mourides .
Through many different channels , money trickles back home .
Firms that move money round the world have outlets all over Senegal .
And there are simpler ways for migrants in Italy to help the family : call a Sandaga trader and he will advance cash to a needy relative .
Mourides are believed to make up around 40 % of Senegal 's population .
But they form a majority among Senegal 's diaspora , which is estimated to number at least 700,000 .
Mourides probably account for at least 80 % of the Senegalese peddlers who throng Italy 's open spaces .
( France , the colonial power , has ceased to be the land of choice for Senegalese .
For a decade it has been Italy .
Now Spain is taking over ; about 80 Senegalese drowned this month in a shipwreck en route to the Canaries . )
Many Mourides say they prefer peddling to more settled jobs .
In part this reflects Bamba 's call for self - reliance .
In any case few seem to fall into serious crime .
Once he has his papers and visas , a Mouride peddler is free to go home for months at a time .
At the end of this year , thousands will return for a Muslim festival known in Africa as Tabaski .
Many will stay for another festival , the Grand Magal , before heading back to Europe in spring .
Tim Judah
One of the Mourides ' strengths is the pyramid structure of their organisation .
At the top is the caliph , a rank now held by the last surviving son of Bamba .
Once he has pronounced on any big issue , all will fall into line .
Under his leadership , Touba is growing at a phenomenal rate .
Its population , a mere 2,000 or so in 1958 , may now have reached 700,000 .
Alcohol and tobacco are banned in Touba , which enjoys autonomy within Senegal .
A university is being built .
Compared with some Muslim lands , the cultural climate is liberal .
Women eschew trousers but none wears a face - veil and many do not cover their hair .
Girls and boys go to school together .
Appeals to the faithful to fund a new hospital or water system can bring in millions of euros ; many Mourides are wealthy and generous .
In Britain , El Hadji Diouf , a Senegalese footballer , is a donor to Mouride causes .
The current caliph is 91 .
Part of his role as prince - cum - religious leader is to mediate between marabouts , including Bamba 's many grandsons .
In theory , he will be succeeded on his death by Bamba 's oldest grandson .
But there are rumblings in Touba : some say the brotherhood need not be dominated by the Mbacke clan for ever .
In any case the matter should be resolved peacefully , given the Mouride emphasis on non-violence .
“ Blood must not be spilled , ” says Atou Diagne , a Mouride scholar .
Little known as they are , the Mourides might have a lot to teach the rest of the world — not only about how to respond to globalisation , but how to practise religion in a peaceful way .
April 2006
( This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006 Startup School . )
The startups we 've funded so far are pretty quick , but they seem quicker to learn some lessons than others .
I think it 's because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive .
We 've now invested in enough companies that I 've learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones : they 're the ones I have to keep repeating .
So I 'm going to number these points , and maybe with future startups I 'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding .
I 'll make them all read this , and then instead of nagging them in detail , I 'll just be able to say : number four !
1. Release Early .
The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup : get a version 1 out fast , then improve it based on users ' reactions .
By " release early " I do n't mean you should release something full of bugs , but that you should release something minimal .
Users hate bugs , but they do n't seem to mind a minimal version 1 , if there 's more coming soon .
There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast .
One is that this is simply the right way to write software , whether for a startup or not .
I 've been repeating that since 1993 , and I have n't seen much since to contradict it .
I 've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff , and none because they were too quick . [ 1 ]
One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you wo n't know your users .
Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month .
Who are all those people ?
They have no idea .
No web startup does .
And since you do n't know your users , it 's dangerous to guess what they 'll like .
Better to release something and let them tell you .
Wufoo took this to heart and released their form - builder before the underlying database .
You can't even drive the thing yet , but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver 's seat and hold the steering wheel .
And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it : Linux users complained they used too much Flash , so they rewrote their software not to .
If they 'd waited to release everything at once , they would n't have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired in .
Even if you had no users , it would still be important to release quickly , because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise .
If anything major is broken -- if the idea 's no good , for example , or the founders hate one another -- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it .
And if you have such problems you want to find them early .
Perhaps the most important reason to release early , though , is that it makes you work harder .
When you 're working on something that is n't released , problems are intriguing .
In something that 's out there , problems are alarming .
There is a lot more urgency once you release .
And I think that 's precisely why people put it off .
They know they 'll have to work a lot harder once they do . [ 2 ]
2. Keep Pumping Out Features .
Of course , " release early " has a second component , without which it would be bad advice .
If you 're going to start with something that does n't do much , you better improve it fast .
What I find myself repeating is " pump out features . "
And this rule is n't just for the initial stages .
This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups .
I do n't mean , of course , that you should make your application ever more complex .
By " feature " I mean one unit of hacking -- one quantum of making users ' lives better .
As with exercise , improvements beget improvements .
If you run every day , you 'll probably feel like running tomorrow .
But if you skip running for a couple weeks , it will be an effort to drag yourself out .
So it is with hacking : the more ideas you implement , the more ideas you 'll have .
You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two .
This is not just a good way to get development done ; it is also a form of marketing .
Users love a site that 's constantly improving .
In fact , users expect a site to improve .
Imagine if you visited a site that seemed very good , and then returned two months later and not one thing had changed .
Would n't it start to seem lame ? [ 3 ]
They 'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments , because customers are used to companies ignoring them .
If you 're the rare exception -- a company that actually listens -- you 'll generate fanatical loyalty .
You wo n't need to advertise , because your users will do it for you .
This seems obvious too , so why do I have to keep repeating it ?
I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are .
Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws , you start to get used to it , and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its identity .
For example , I doubt many people at Yahoo ( or Google for that matter ) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them .
I think the solution is to assume that anything you 've made is far short of what it could be .
Force yourself , as a sort of intellectual exercise , to keep thinking of improvements .
Ok , sure , what you have is perfect .
But if you had to change something , what would it be ?
If your product seems finished , there are two possible explanations : ( a ) it is finished , or ( b ) you lack imagination .
Experience suggests ( b ) is a thousand times more likely .
3. Make Users Happy .
Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule : make users happy .
One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything .
They can't force anyone to use their software , and they can't force anyone to do deals with them .
A startup has to sing for its supper .
That 's why the successful ones make great things .
They have to , or die .
When you 're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds .
The most powerful wind is users .
They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky , as they did with Google , or leave you flat on the pavement , as they do with most startups .
Users are a fickle wind , but more powerful than any other .
If they take you up , no competitor can keep you down .
As a little piece of debris , the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat , but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will catch .
I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is .
The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors .
It 's them you have to design your site for .
The people who really care will find what they want by themselves .
The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button .
Think about your own experience : most links you follow lead to something lame .
Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link .
So your site has to say " Wait !
Do n't click on Back .
This site is n't lame .
Look at this , for example . "
There are two things you have to do to make people pause .
The most important is to explain , as concisely as possible , what the hell your site is about .
How often have you visited a site that seemed to assume you already knew what they did ?
For example , the corporate site that says the company makes enterprise content management solutions for business that enable organizations to unify people , content and processes to minimize business risk , accelerate time - to - value and sustain lower total cost of ownership .
An established company may get away with such an opaque description , but no startup can .
A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does . [ 4 ]
And not just to users .
You need this for everyone : investors , acquirers , partners , reporters , potential employees , and even current employees .
You probably should n't even start a company to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two sentences .
The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you 've got , right away .
If you have something impressive , try to put it on the front page , because that 's the only one most visitors will see .
Though indeed there 's a paradox here : the more you push the good stuff toward the front , the more likely visitors are to explore further . [ 5 ]
In the best case these two suggestions get combined : you tell visitors what your site is about by showing them .
One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is " show , do n't tell . "
Do n't say that a character 's angry ; have him grind his teeth , or break his pencil in half .
Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it .
The industry term here is " conversion . "
The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users -- whatever your definition of a user is .
You can measure this in your growth rate .
Either your site is catching on , or it is n't , and you must know which .
If you have decent growth , you 'll win in the end , no matter how obscure you are now .
And if you do n't , you need to fix something .
4. Fear the Right Things .
Another thing I find myself saying a lot is " do n't worry . "
Actually , it 's more often " do n't worry about this ; worry about that instead . "
Startups are right to be paranoid , but they sometimes fear the wrong things .
Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem .
Disasters are normal in a startup : a founder quits , you discover a patent that covers what you 're doing , your servers keep crashing , you run into an insoluble technical problem , you have to change your name , a deal falls through -- these are all par for the course .
They wo n't kill you unless you let them .
Nor will most competitors .
A lot of startups worry " what if Google builds something like us ? "
Actually big companies are not the ones you have to worry about -- not even Google .
The people at Google are smart , but no smarter than you ; they 're not as motivated , because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails ; and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down .
What you should fear , as a startup , is not the established players , but other startups you do n't know exist yet .
They 're way more dangerous than Google because , like you , they 're cornered animals .
Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security .
You should compete against what someone else could be doing , not just what you can see people doing .
A corollary is that you should n't relax just because you have no visible competitors yet .
No matter what your idea , there 's someone else out there working on the same thing .
That 's the downside of it being easier to start a startup : more people are doing it .
But I disagree with Caterina
Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup .
More people are starting startups , but not as many more as could .
Most college graduates still think they have to get a job .
The average person can't ignore something that 's been beaten into their head since they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper .
And in any case , competitors are not the biggest threat .
Way more startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors .
There are a lot of ways to do it , but the three main ones are internal disputes , inertia , and ignoring users .
Each is , by itself , enough to kill you .
But if I had to pick the worst , it would be ignoring users .
If you want a recipe for a startup that 's going to die , here it is : a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love , and that 's what they 're going to build , no matter what .
Almost everyone 's initial plan is broken .
If companies stuck to their initial plans , Microsoft would be selling programming languages , and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards .
In both cases their customers told them what their business should be -- and they were smart enough to listen .
As Richard Feynman said , the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man .
You 'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking .
This principle is very powerful .
It 's why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo , for example .
And it applies to startups too .
No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users .
5. Commitment Is a Self - Fulfilling Prophecy .
I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder , and it 's not what you might think .
The most important quality in a startup founder is determination .
Not intelligence -- determination .
This is a little depressing .
I 'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart , not merely determined .
A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that .
Not just founders , but investors too .
They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence .
And you can tell they really believe this , because it affects their investment decisions .
Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors .
This may work in biotech , where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research , but in software you want to invest in students , not professors .
Microsoft , Yahoo , and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it .
What students lack in experience they more than make up in dedication .
Of course , if you want to get rich , it 's not enough merely to be determined .
You have to be smart too , right ?
I 'd like to think so , but I 've had an experience that convinced me otherwise : I spent several years living in New York .
You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it wo n't kill you .
But lose even a little bit in the commitment department , and that will kill you very rapidly .
Running a startup is like walking on your hands : it 's possible , but it requires extraordinary effort .
If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to , he'd be very indignant .
Imagine if you were hired at some big company , and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you 'd ever had to before , they expected you to answer support calls , administer the servers , design the web site , cold - call customers , find the company office space , and go out and get everyone lunch .
And to do all this not in the calm , womb - like atmosphere of a big company , but against a backdrop of constant disasters .
That 's the part that really demands determination .
In a startup , there 's always some disaster happening .
So if you 're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit , there 's always one right there .
But if you lack commitment , chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit .
Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is , so if they sense you 're ambivalent , they wo n't give you much attention .
If you lack commitment , you 'll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you .
If you lack commitment , it will seem to you that you 're unlucky .
Whereas if you 're determined to stick around , people will pay attention to you , because odds are they 'll have to deal with you later .
You 're a local , not just a tourist , so everyone has to come to terms with you .
At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they 're going to give this startup thing a shot for three months , and if something great happens , they 'll stick with it -- " something great " meaning either that someone wants to buy them or invest millions of dollars in them .
But if this is your attitude , " something great " is very unlikely to happen to you , because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment .
If an acquirer thinks you 're going to stick around no matter what , they 'll be more likely to buy you , because if they do n't and you stick around , you 'll probably grow , your price will go up , and they 'll be left wishing they 'd bought you earlier .
Ditto for investors .
What really motivates investors , even big VCs , is not the hope of good returns , but the fear of missing out . [ 6 ]
So if you make it clear you 're going to succeed no matter what , and the only reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster , you 're much more likely to get money .
You can't fake this .
The only way to convince everyone that you 're ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to .
You have to be the right kind of determined , though .
I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn , because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup .
You have to be determined , but flexible , like a running back .
A successful running back does n't just put his head down and try to run through people .
He improvises : if someone appears in front of him , he runs around them ; if someone tries to grab him , he spins out of their grip ; he 'll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help .
The one thing he 'll never do is stand still . [ 7 ]
6. There Is Always Room .
I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software .
He said he did n't think so , because the whole social thing was tapped out .
Really ?
So in a hundred years the only social networking sites will be the Facebook , MySpace , Flickr , and Del.icio.us ?
Not likely .
There is always room for new stuff .
At every point in history , even the darkest bits of the dark ages , people were discovering things that made everyone say " why did n't anyone think of that before ? "
We know this continued to be true up till 2004 , when the Facebook was founded -- though strictly speaking someone else did think of that .
The reason we do n't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are , and assume that 's how things have to be .
For example , it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google .
Surely that field , at least , is tapped out .
Really ?
In a hundred years -- or even twenty -- are people still going to search for information using something like the current Google ?
Even Google probably does n't think that .
In particular , I do n't think there 's any limit to the number of startups .
Sometimes you hear people saying " All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed .
How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy , after all ? "
That sounds cleverly skeptical , but I can prove it 's mistaken .
No one proposes that there 's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big , slow - moving companies with a couple thousand people each .
Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small , fast - moving companies with ten each ?
It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard .
The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo -- though it seems even that should be unlimited , if the startups were actually worth buying -- but the amount of wealth that can be created .
And I do n't think there 's any limit on that , except cosmological ones .
So for all practical purposes , there is no limit to the number of startups .
Startups make wealth , which means they make things people want , and if there 's a limit on the number of things people want , we are nowhere near it .
I still do n't even have a flying car .
7. Do n't Get Your Hopes Up .
This is another one I 've been repeating since long before Y Combinator .
It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb .
Startup founders are naturally optimistic .
They would n't do it otherwise .
But you should treat your optimism the way you 'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor : as a source of power that 's also very dangerous .
You have to build a shield around it , or it will fry you .
The shielding of a reactor is not uniform ; the reactor would be useless if it were .
It 's pierced in a few places to let pipes in .
An optimism shield has to be pierced too .
I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of yourself , and what you expect of other people .
It 's ok to be optimistic about what you can do , but assume the worst about machines and other people .
This is particularly necessary in a startup , because you tend to be pushing the limits of whatever you 're doing .
So things do n't happen in the smooth , predictable way they do in the rest of the world .
Things change suddenly , and usually for the worse .
Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals .
If your startup is doing a deal , just assume it 's not going to happen .
The VCs who say they 're going to invest in you are n't .
The company that says they 're going to buy you is n't .
The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company wo n't .
Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised .
The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being disappointed when things fall through .
It 's for a more practical reason : to prevent them from leaning their company against something that 's going to fall over , taking them with it .
For example , if someone says they want to invest in you , there 's a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors .
That 's why people proposing deals seem so positive : they want you to stop looking .
And you want to stop too , because doing deals is a pain .
Raising money , in particular , is a huge time sink .
So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking .
Even if you ultimately do the first deal , it will be to your advantage to have kept looking , because you 'll get better terms .
Deals are dynamic ; unless you 're negotiating with someone unusually honest , there 's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal 's done .
There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake , and if the other side senses weakness -- if they sense you need this deal -- they will be very tempted to screw you in the details .
VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators .
They 're trained to take advantage of weakness . [ 8 ]
So while they 're often nice guys , they just can't help it .
And as pros they do this more than you .
So do n't even try to bluff them .
The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it .
And if you do n't believe in a deal , you 'll be less likely to depend on it .
So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads : when you hear someone say the words " we want to invest in you " or " we want to acquire you , " I want the following phrase to appear automatically in your head : do n't get your hopes up .
Just continue running your company as if this deal did n't exist .
Nothing is more likely to make it close .
The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users , and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face .
Speed , not Money
The way I 've described it , starting a startup sounds pretty stressful .
It is .
When I talk to the founders of the companies we 've funded , they all say the same thing : I knew it would be hard , but I did n't realize it would be this hard .
So why do it ?
It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or heroic , but just to make money ?
Is making money really that important ?
No , not really .
It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously .
I regard making money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible .
There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se .
So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups ?
I 'll tell you why .
Economically , a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich , but as a way to work faster .
You have to make a living , and a startup is a way to get that done quickly , instead of letting it drag on through your whole life . [ 9 ]
We take it for granted most of the time , but human life is fairly miraculous .
It is also palpably short .
You 're given this marvellous thing , and then poof , it 's taken away .
You can see why people invent gods to explain it .
But even to people who do n't believe in gods , life commands respect .
There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur , and almost everyone has a sense , when this happens , of wasting something precious .
As Ben Franklin said , if you love life , do n't waste time , because time is what life is made of .
So no , there 's nothing particularly grand about making money .
That 's not what makes startups worth the trouble .
What 's important about startups is the speed .
By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time , you show respect for life , and there is something grand about that .
Notes
[ 1 ] Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs , and not fixing them fast enough , but I do n't know of any that died from releasing something stable but minimal very early , then promptly improving it .
[ 2 ] I know this is why I have n't released Arc .
The moment I do , I 'll have people nagging me for features .
[ 3 ] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect .
Users judge a site not as a single snapshot , but as an animation with multiple frames .
Of the two , I 'd say the rate of improvement is more important to users than where you currently are .
[ 4 ]
It should not always tell this to users , however .
For example , MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats .
But it was wiser for them , initially , to pretend that the site was about bands .
[ 5 ] Similarly , do n't make users register to try your site .
Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it .
But they 've been trained to expect the opposite .
Most of the things they 've tried on the web have sucked -- and probably especially those that made them register .
[ 6 ] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way .
They do n't make their money ( if they make money ) off their median investments .
In a typical fund , half the companies fail , most of the rest generate mediocre returns , and one or two " make the fund " by succeeding spectacularly .
So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities , it could hose the whole fund .
[ 7 ] The attitude of a running back does n't translate to soccer .
Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders , a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes .
[ 8 ] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we 're not professional negotiators , and do n't want to turn into them .
[ 9 ]
There are two ways to do work you love : ( a ) to make money , then work on what you love , or ( b ) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love .
In practice the first phases of both consist mostly of unedifying schleps , and in ( b ) the second phase is less secure .

In what animal welfare advocates are describing as a “ historic advance , ” Burger King , the world ’s second - largest hamburger chain , said yesterday that it would begin buying eggs and pork from suppliers that did not confine their animals in cages and crates .
The company said that it would also favor suppliers of chickens that use gas , or “ controlled - atmospheric stunning , ” rather than electric shocks to knock birds unconscious before slaughter .
It is considered a more humane method , though only a handful of slaughterhouses use it .
The goal for the next few months , Burger King said is for 2 percent of its eggs to be “ cage free , ” and for 10 percent of its pork to come from farms that allow sows to move around inside pens , rather than being confined to crates .
The company said those percentages would rise as more farmers shift to these methods and more competitively priced supplies become available .
The cage - free eggs and crate - free pork will cost more , although it is not clear how much because Burger King is still negotiating prices , Steven Grover , vice president for food safety , quality assurance and regulatory compliance , said .
Prices of food at the chain ’s restaurants will not be increased as a result .
A California company has figured out how to use two simple materials – water and salt – to create a solution that wipes out single - celled organisms , and which appears to speed healing of burns , wounds and diabetic ulcers .
The solution looks , smells and tastes like water , but carries an ion imbalance that makes short work of bacteria , viruses and even hard - to - kill spores .
Developed by Oculus Innovative Sciences in Petaluma , the super - oxygenated water is claimed to be as effective a disinfectant as chlorine bleach , but is harmless to people , animals and plants .
If accidentally ingested by a child , the likely impact is a bad case of clean teeth .
Oculus said the solution , called Microcyn , may prove effective in the fight against superbugs , crossover viruses like bird flu and Ebola , and bioterrorism threats such as anthrax .
The company has just been granted approval in the United States to test the solution in the treatment of wounds , and already has government approval in Europe , Canada and Mexico for diverse uses , from disinfectant to wound irrigation .
Doctors conducting trials in Mexico and India are recounting stories at international conferences of their surprise at another feature of the solution :
It speeds the healing of severe burns and diabetic ulcers .
According to Hoji Alimi , founder and president of Oculus , the ion-hungry water creates an osmotic potential that ruptures the cell walls of single - celled organisms , and out leaks the cell 's cytoplasm .
Because multicellular organisms – people , animals , plants – are tightly bound , the water is prevented from surrounding the cells , and there is no negative impact .
While super - oxygenated water is nothing new – Microcyn has its roots in efforts to decontaminate nuclear reactors ' cooling pipes , according to Alimi – it is typically effective for only a few hours after it is formulated .
To keep it handy , hospitals and labs must invest in extremely expensive machines costing $ 100,000 or more .
Oculus has developed a new formula with a shelf life of at least a year , which opens up an array of potential applications .
And unlike prior formulations of super - oxygenated water , Microcyn is pH-neutral , so it wo n't damage healthy tissue .
This has prompted successful experiments in the treatment of challenging wounds like diabetic ulcers .
Physicians in Mexico using Microcyn observed rapid healing of burns and ulcers that the body could not repair for a decade or more because of infections , said Dr. Andres Gutierrez , head of the cell - therapy unit at the National Institute of Rehabilitation in Mexico City and an adviser to Oculus .
" Mexico was early to obtain the technology and give regulatory approval , " he said .
" Doctors using the product noticed the horrific smell of diabetic wounds was gone . "
The smell came from bacteria .
Dr. Amar Pal Singh Suri of the Diabetic Foot Care Clinic in Delhi , India , began experimenting with Microcyn after learning of it last fall in Germany .
Trying it on a severe necrotic wound of a patient whose only remaining option was amputation , Suri said he was surprised to see rapid improvement and the growth of healthy skin tissue .
" I shifted my other patients onto Microcyn treatment and we are now treating more than 50 , with very good results , " said Suri .
India leads the world in diabetes , with 37 million people affected .
" Every year , diabetics in my country suffer a million foot or lower - leg amputations , " said Suri .
Personal tragedy aside , " saving a foot is a fourth the cost of amputation and an artificial limb , " he said .
Chronic wound care is a multibillion - dollar market worldwide .
The solution will be available to U.S. physicians in June , said Alimi .
Trials are being organized for preoperative disinfectant , dental applications and burn and diabetic treatments , he said .
The company is keen to explore other applications , like tools to combat bioterrorism and user - friendly antiseptics and disinfectants to battle superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics and vaccines .
Alimi says he 's giving serious thought to a misting device that could sterilize the air of hospital wards in the grip of epidemics .
The solution also might be used as a hospital hand wash – a user - friendly , non-caustic disinfectant would benefit patients if it enabled medical workers to wash their hands more often , he said .
Pointing to his computer screen , Maj. Gen. Timothy Ghormley sounds more like a Peace Corps volunteer showing off holiday photos than the shaven - headed US Marine entrusted with defeating Al Qaeda in East Africa .
" That 's what it 's about right there , " he says , stabbing his eyeglasses at the pictures of African children celebrating as water gushes from a new well .
" Look at those kids .
They 're gonna remember this .
In 25 years they 'll say , ' I remember the West - they were good . ' "
In 2002 , more than 1,500 US troops were sent to this former French colony in East Africa to hunt followers of Al Qaeda throughout the region .
Now , under General Ghormley , their mission has evolved to preempt the broader growth of Islamic militancy among the area 's largely Muslim population .
" We are trying to dry up the recruiting pool for Al Qaeda by showing people the way ahead .
We are doing this one village , one person at a time , " says Ghormley , commander of the joint task force based in Djibouti .
" We 're waging peace just as hard as we can . "
Previously East Africa has hosted an array of Islamic militant groups .
In 1998 , Al Qaeda bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , killing more than 220 people .
The group has also tried to shoot down an Israeli airliner in Mombasa , Kenya , and sink oil tankers and US navy vessels in the Red Sea .
Now many analysts worry that trouble is again brewing as rising poverty combines with the anti-Western ideologies of hard - line Islamic missionaries in a region already dogged by porous borders , plentiful weapons , and poor governance .
" There are n't actually that many groups or individuals involved , " says Matt Bryden , director of the Horn of Africa project for International Crisis Watch .
" But there 's a danger that if these groups are not contained it is just a matter of time before they strike at Western targets in Somalia or start reaching out to the region again . "
" Some of them did have links with Al Qaeda but for the most part there does n't seem to be an active Al Qaeda or even an Al Qaeda franchise , " says Mr. Bryden .
" But the US has discovered that there are actually much fewer targets than they expected . "
No targets but hearts and minds
Unable to find or strike at any visible Al Qaeda members , US forces based in Camp Lemonier - Djibouti's former French Foreign Legion base - have instead begun to work to tackle the factors that might contribute to the growth of extremism in the future .
Ghormley 's men have so far built more than 30 schools and 25 clinics , as well as new wells and bridges .
They are focusing particularly on the mainly Muslim areas close to the porous Somali border where poverty and dissatisfaction with pro-Western central governments might make many receptive to extremist teachings .
" Ungoverned spaces are vulnerable .
The forces of law and order do n't exist there , " says Lt. Col.
Richard Baillon , of Britain 's Parachute Regiment .
A small contingent of British troops are working with US forces in a coalition effort .
" The people in these areas are n't getting government support . "
Planners in Camp Lemonier say that their long - term strategy is to gradually move deeper into these poor and ungoverned areas .
" We 're not likely to go where we 're not wanted or where there 's open hostility , " says Baillon , tapping a wall - map like a schoolmaster .
" But it 's about pushing the boundaries of where we are wanted . "
The Coalition 's planners hope that by tackling localized dissatisfaction now , they can create long - term goodwill toward the US in the region .
" A lot of times when we first show up there 's a mixed reaction , " says Sgt. Richard Crandall of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion .
" One place we went to they considered the US to be warmongers .
But we built a school and when we left they said they considered us friends . "
The military is taking time to adapt to its new humanitarian mission too - and this means that there have been some mistakes made along the way .
For example , the task force 's military budget only covers the cost of constructing and renovating school buildings .
Before the schools can open , soldiers have to pester nongovernmental organizations , charities , and friends back home for donated textbooks .
In other cases there has been poor communication between the US and local people .
Some villages , thinking that the Americans could only build schools , requested a new school when they needed wells and bridges instead .
The mistake was realized too late .
Meanwhile , the US increasingly depends on local governments to use their cultural and linguistic knowledge to track and tackle Islamic extremists .
" The information sharing is not ideal ; not up to the point that we would like , " admits Nabeel Khoury , deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Sanaa , Yemen .
And although there are handfuls of up - armored Humvees parked alongside rusting French artillery pieces throughout Camp Lemonier , the US increasingly seeks to delegate its military operations .
" We 're doing military - to - military training with five countries in the region , " says Col. Doug Carroll , director of operations for the Horn of Africa task force .
The US has trained Yemeni special forces in counter - terrorism while officers from Mauritius and the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean have been taught how to train their own soldiers once they return home .
" In Ethiopia we 've taught border security , we 've taught basic counter - terrorism , what they call advanced map reading and also defensive operations , " says Carroll , who denies that the training will upset the region 's delicate balance of power .
" We 're not teaching them anything that would be applicable to the Ethiopian - Eritrean border war , " he says of the training of Ethiopian border guards , while also denying that US - trained troops have been used to crush recent uprisings in Yemen .
Somalia remains a clear blind spot
But although the lack of recent Al Qaeda attacks in the region points to the mission 's success so far , there remains a clear blind spot at the heart of the US deployment .
" It 's a bit of a paradox , " says Bryden .
" The threat that the US perceives in the region comes from Somalia , but that is the only place where they can't operate . "
Senior officers in Djibouti refuse to even discuss Somalia , although one officer privately admitted having contact with high - level members of the government of Somaliland - a breakaway republic in the north of the war - torn country that recently arrested one Al Qaeda team linked to extremist groups in Mogadishu .
" The US has had to develop a much more nuanced approach and it shows that they are dealing with the problem , " says Bryden .
" They 've had to discover the difference between terrorism and a domestic insurgency . "
As the US gradually increases its understanding of the region there is no sign of the mission winding down .
Instead , as more British troops also prepare to deploy to the region , the operation seems to have become entirely open - ended .
" It 's important that we share what we have to allow all nations to advance , " says General Ghormley .
" We did n't earn being born in America - the Good Lord put us there and with that came responsibility . "
An area five times larger than Iraq
Standing in his office , Ghormley , surrounded by maps where arrow - straight borders drawn by European colonialists cut across mountains , deserts , and complex ethnic groups , provides more than an echo of a Victorian soldier - missionary .
" You can win a heart and mind today and lose it tomorrow , " Ghormley continues .
" We see no spread of radical ideology .
We see a lot of people who would like it to spread . "
But with Camp Lemonier boasting less than 1 percent of the troops currently deployed in Iraq and responsible for an area five times larger , Ghormley is aware that there is a limit to what the US can achieve in the region .
" I could use more money , more people , but I 've got the resources I need to carry on , " he says , taking a last look at the pictures on his computer screen .
" They 're good people and it breaks your heart that you can't do more for them . "
DARK energy and dark matter , two of the greatest mysteries confronting physicists , may be two sides of the same coin .
A new and as yet undiscovered kind of star could explain both phenomena and , in turn , remove black holes from the lexicon of cosmology .

Last week at the 22nd Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting in Santa Barbara , California , Chapline suggested that the objects that till now have been thought of as black holes could …

cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
March 22nd , 2007
WARNING : The following is not a recommendation to buy , sell or hold any financial instrument .
Trading stocks , currencies and options involves serious risks .
For years , I ’ve kept this information to myself , waiting for a chance to look at it again more seriously and systematically .
Unfortunately , I do n’t really see myself being able to allocate the time to research this stuff further .
I know that several Cryptogon readers are traders and / or otherwise involved with the financial markets .
Others of you are good at writing software .
There are several neuroscientists out there and at least one rocket scientist - type guy or gal !
HA .
Seriously , it ’s true .
Three INTJs have written in , in response to the INTJ reference I made in a previous post .
These are the types of people who can nail this stuff to the wall , to the extent that it can be nailed to the wall .
I thought that some of you might take a look at this information and have the skills and tenacity to take it further than I was able to .
Maybe figure something out … and share it with the rest of us .
Anyway , here goes .
STOCKS : INSIDER CRIMES AND THE ACCUMULATION PHASE
From around 1998 to 2003 , I looked for a way out of having a day job through trading , stocks mostly .
I learned a lot of things the hard way , but at least I learned .
My goal was n’t to get rich .
All I wanted to do was make small profits consistently .
Fifty bucks a day was actually my goal .
I managed to do this , and orders of magnitude better , on occasion , for a while , but it was hard , time consuming and incredibly stressful .
Was trading ( intraday ) worth it ?
For me , not really , but it was better than showing up to some office .
Was it gambling ?
In a word , yes , but I did n’t know that at the time .
I thought that the tools and systems I used were working .
Actually , they were n’t working .
How did I know they were n’t really working ?
Because I started to lose money !
They had just appeared to be working .
I stopped trading as soon as I lost confidence in the tools .
( Maybe the tools actually worked for a while , but then stopped working ?
That ’s possible , I suppose , but not likely . )
I had always assumed the entire business of the markets to be a massive criminal enterprise that allowed public participation simply because it made a few people extremely wealthy .
But , I wondered , when do the fewest people make the most money in the shortest period of time ?
During gaps .
A gap is a sudden , violent change in the price of a stock , future , bond , etc .
Gaps are caused by some event that temporarily creates a state of disequilibrium in order flows .
Gaps on stocks started to draw my attention because I just knew that insiders ( and others ) were pre-positioning themselves to profit from those moves .
I noticed that , quite regularly , unknown , crappy little companies would go up 25 % , 50 % , 100 % , 200 % or more in a single session .
You see them almost every day on the top percent gainers board .
For years , I looked at those and shrugged .
“ Yep .
People hit the lotto too , ” I ’d say to myself .
I watched another one pop , then , finally , I thought : “ This is the scene of a crime for sure . ”
I ’m not talking about legal insider trading by corporate officers that the financial press follows .
I ’m talking about the mistresses of executives and $ 2000 per hour prostitutes who heard something over pillow talk , friends at country clubs who get a tip during the golfcart ride to the 18th hole , industrial espionage operators ( former spooks ) who have these idiots under surveillance , low level IT staff who read the executives ’ email , not for fun , but for profit , etc. etc .
The point is that LOTS of people who are n’t corporate insiders know the news before the market does .
They buy before the news comes out .
This happens every day .
Thousands of symbols .
Every couple of days at least one of them goes up by 25 % or more .
How would I go about finding them ?
Assume maximum criminal behavior and find stocks where the signal to noise ratio is very high .
I came up with a system where I doubled a few times ; I made nearly 3 x once .
No losses .
I could never bring myself to allocate large amounts of capital to hold overnight on these “ Risk of ruin ” bets because I did n’t believe this was really working , even when I was hitting .
( All stock bets are , in my opinion , risk of ruin . )
Was it luck each time ?
Possibly .
Whatever it was , here ’s what I did :
I looked for cheap stocks that were flatlining or trading in a narrow range near their 52 week lows .
Then I looked for increases in volume and churn .
Churn is increasing volume with prices staying flat , or increasing slightly .
Under churn , prices stay relatively flat because the buying is accompanied with selling to keep the price from running away .
There is , however , a net inflow of capital .
This is the critical part :
The activity had to be happening in the absence of any news .
I ’d read about Dow theory , so the minute I started to notice these volume increases , without news , it made sense .
What I was seeing was the accumulation phase on these stocks , where people with inside information were buying ahead of the good news .
I never looked at earnings .
The company ’s products or services did n’t matter .
All I was looking for was that very specific pattern .
The trick was finding stocks with a high enough signal to noise ratio to spot the criminal insider buying .
This nonsense happens on all stocks , I ’m sure , but it ’s too difficult to see most of the time .
That ’s why the flatliners and narrow rangers are nice .
I picked stocks near their 52 week lows because , well , for some reason they stopped there before .
Think of this as an up or out proposition .
Oh yeah , it could go to zero and you could lose your money .
Do n’t use stops on these bets .
These are all or nothing gambles .
Why ?
Because market makers will often drive down the price before the big move up .
These stocks are very simple to manipulate .
Just before a big move , they might run the stops , just under where you ’ve drawn your support line , to scoop up a bunch of shares at a discount .
( This just happened on one today , as a matter of fact . )
Double and triple bottoms are built on the skulls of people who thought there were being smart by setting stops down near a 52 week low .
If you ’re reckless enough to buy a crap company near a 52 week low and are worried about it dropping more , forget this method .
You ’ll get stopped out , and minutes , hours or days later , the thing could suddenly double .
Company bought out .
Drug approved .
Government contract awarded .
Whatever .
Why not wait for the fake dip before the big move up ?
Sometimes there is no dip at all .
Sometimes there is .
Again , nobody said it was going to be easy .
Why not use a screen that only looks for double bottoms AND a follow - on positive slope OBV on no news ?
* scratch whiskers *
Every time I think I ’ve beaten this crap to death , there ’s always another weird path to take .
I ’m no longer in a position to do 20 hour research binges on this stuff , but some of you young whipper snappers should try it .
The way to play this is with small bets on multiple setups with capital that you assume will be lost .
As soon as you get a pop on any of them , sell immediately into the “ dumb money ” players who show up to chase the news , which might just be some kind of criminal press release .
Do n’t try to parse the news .
Do n’t even look at it .
Get to battlestations .
Lock and load .
How much you take off the table is up to you .
I would typically dump it all in one shot .
But you might consider selling 1 / 2 or 3 / 4 of what you started with and set a trailing stop on the rest .
You might also draw a trend line connecting the bottoms of an on balance volume ( OBV ) study to better plan your exit .
Upward slope ?
Let it ride .
Cross down ?
Dump it .
I liked watching this on one and three minute charts .
You just need some way of seeing that more dumb money is flowing into the thing than insiders are pulling out .
There was no way to know what would happen an hour , a day or a week later .
Sometimes they would go higher or much higher , sometimes they would crash back down .
Once you get out , though , do n’t even think about looking at the thing again .
Spend your time looking for the next one , trading sideways , near its 52 week low , with anomalous volume on no news .
Ca n’t find any ?
Ask your significant other to duct tape your hands to the desk so you do n’t make any stupid , undisciplined trades .
Actually , if you have the time to dedicate to this type of work , you probably do n’t have a significant other , or a company has provided you with a padded room and just slides food and coffee under the door .
If you have access to Trade Station or some other scriptable tool , a screen could be written to automate the search .
[ I have no reciprocal relationship with the TradeStation Group . ]
FYI : TradeStation is not a toy .
It is the most sophisticated strategy testing and trading platform available to the public .
Any strategy can be coded and tested using that software .
When I was doing this , I was doing it manually , individually inspecting hundreds of charts .
A note on volume : Screen for stocks with an average daily volume of at least 25,000 shares .
Many crap stocks barely trade at all , so any activity will skew your volume studies and could give you false positives .
But if you see a dead one with volume picking up out of nowhere ( no news ) , with the price holding steady ( churn ) , keep an eye on it .
Read about OBV .
Then read about it again .
I was doing this on NASDAQ listed stocks in the $ 1 to $ 3 dollar range ; stocks colloquially referred to as dog food .
I do n’t see why this technique could n’t work on the serious pink sheet garbage penny stocks as well .
I mean , what ’s the difference between a $ 2.25 NASDAQ stock and a penny stock ?
About two bucks .
Another note on volume :
Your volume studies are the key to this .
If you can apply two moving averages to daily volume , that will spot the weirdness .
Make your long MA something like 13 periods and your short ( trigger ) MA something like 5 or 3 periods .
If you get a fast period MA cross on the volume , ON NO NEWS , that might be something .
You ’re looking for sustained , anomalous volume .
One day spikes may or may not be something .
There ’s no way to know on those .
But when that average daily volume starts breaking out , that ’s interesting .
Up sloping OBV on no news is interesting .
What period ?
Screen using daily closes .
There ’s no need to gear up for an intraday - style gun battle during the screening process .
( TR and I tried to do it in real time using TradeStation ’s incredible Radar , but we failed .
We could n’t filter the cranks from the real moves .
Our tools were finding real moves and cranks .
Sadly , for us , they looked the same in fog of war .
We progressed to the Magic Mystery Dot , which was very interesting and weird , but did n’t quite work .
It kinda worked , but I nearly pissed myself trading based on its signals . )
You can quietly sit back , look at the daily data and pick these out very carefully .
The criminals need to take their time on accumulation .
They ca n’t do it too fast or the price will go up , or smarty pants people with their volume studies on their radar screens might spot it .
The setups are usually slow and steady , they happen over days or weeks .
Once you ’re in , just set price alarms using some tool and do n’t think about them again .
Initially , set your alarms somewhere above the top of recent ranges that the stocks have been oscillating in , or just above the flatline if it ’s really just trading sideways .
If the price breaks out on no news , continue to hold ; this could just be a temporary crank that will fade fast .
If the breakout occurs on the news , dump it , even if you ’re only making cigarette butts and bottle caps .
A weak pop on news just means that there are n’t enough suckers willing to take the bait .
How do you know it ’s a weak pop ?
What ’s the slope like on your one and three minute OBV charts after the news ?
Flat to down ?
Buddy , you ’re juggling hand grenades with the pins pulled at that stage .
Also , because these moves may involve very serious criminal activity you want to get clear of the pig before the exchange halts trading and the SEC gets in on the act .
By the time the authorities are parsing the news and taking note of the order flow , you want to be outside in your hammock , sipping a cold beer .
Again , nobody said it was going to be easy .
Note :
The above strategy should work on the short side too , in theory , but I have only ever worked the long angle .
Why ?
To play this short , there will be more noise , you ’ll have to play with more expensive stocks and to not use stops when short could result in unthinkable disaster .
You could potentially lose more than your initial bet .
CURRENCIES : FOREX FUNNY MONEY
FOREX is the best pure gamble now , for intraday action , but you have to sit there for hours and just be able to react to momentum / panic moves on news .
FOREX is for people who have the temperament of a sniper .
Most of it is boring to the point of being unbearable .
Finally , unexpectedly , you ’ll get window of opportunity , lasting seconds , to take one shot .
That ’s FOREX .
I ’ve only used a realtime simulator for FOREX and never traded with real money .
I tried all of my old daytrading tricks ( multi period stochastics , MAs , Ichimoku , trend following , etc. ) and none of it seemed to work for me .
What looked good , though , was a straddle of USD / CHF and EUR / USD just before news .
USD / CHF and EUR / USD move in opposite directions almost all of the time .
Get in long ( or short - I do n’t think it matters ) on both sets of pairs , just before news .
Once scheduled economic news hits the market , there could be a violent reaction one way of the other .
Immediately dump the position that ’s losing and let the winning pair ride for some number of PIPs .
Were talking seconds to minutes .
Get out .
Turn off your computer .
You ’re done for the day .
FOREX is probably the best venue for news driven action .
You will make or lose the most money on FOREX .
It ’s easily the noisiest , whip sawing fake out thing I ’ve ever seen , but sometimes , those pairs just run and keep on running one way .
Outside of news , though , that thing is a crap shoot .

You just run the thing with a practice account that is loaded with 50,000 pretend dollars .
It ’s totally free .
OPTIONS RACKETS : EXPIRATION ANTICS
I actually wrote this as part of a comment .
I ’ll just reproduce it here .
I initially named the market maker , but I ’m removing it now .
It does n’t matter who it was .
Why ?
Well , that firm frightens me .
There ’s no way to know what they ’re capable of doing .
I ’ll just call them Big Firm .
One day , things were looking good long on Amazon .
We got a bit of a pullback during a multilane uptrend , lots of support .
I got in heavy , 1000 shares .
It wobbled around a bit , then the futures took off .
Up and away .
I thought , “ Wooo hoooo ! ” this is going to be a good one .
Buyers pouring in !
Wait .
What ’s this ?
Big Firm is on the ask .
HAHA Big Firm is up to his old tricks , that guy !
Not going to fool me !
* hands quivering at that point *
Futures rising .
The Nasdaq 100 is climbing .
It ’s ok .
It ’s ok .
Stand fast .
Stand fast .
( I was viewing the battlespace on three displays . )
Big Firm is selling AMZN .
He ’s keeping the lid on Amazon right now .
Is he just trying to front load shares for himself before the pop ???
What the ???
Actually , the price is dropping .
The support on the bid side , outside the spread , started to disappear on Level 2 .
“ F*ck this shit , man . ” I sent a sell limit order outside the spread .
( This is a way to jump the line that forms at the exits when the theater is on fire . )
I was lucky , someone took it at the market for a loss of only ten cents or $ 100 on that 1000 shares .
Seconds later , the long red candles started dripping down my multiperiod charts .
Time sales cascaded red with large block sales .
* my hair is standing on end even now remembering this , I nearly got decapitated on this one *
The idiots in the chat room spat out things like :
AMZN REVERSE IT SHORT !!!
WHAT THE HELL ??
HOLY CRAP
OMG
Etc .
Big Firm single handedly moved Amazon down nearly $ 2 in a couple of minutes , through hourly and daily supports .
Well , not single handedly .
They just used their deep pockets to frighten lots of traders into dumping .
And the move took on a life of its own .
I just sat back and watched it happen , in awe .
Why did They do it ?
Someone told the chatroom I was in that it was about options expiration , and that Big Firm had obviously bought a bunch of out of the money puts that were about to expire worthless .
But guess what ?
Instead of expiring worthless , Big Firm just drove the price of the stock down until those options were in the money !
I watched this happen .
Amazon did that move on its own , without follow through from the futures or other tier 1 stocks .
As usual , do n’t take my word for it :
Stock Price Clustering on Option Expiration Dates
This paper presents striking evidence that option trading changes the prices of underlying stocks .
In particular , we show that on expiration dates the closing prices of stocks with listed options cluster at option strike prices .
On each expiration date , the returns of optionable stocks are altered by an average of at least 16.5 basis points , which translates into aggregate market capitalization shifts on the order of $ 9 billion .
We provide evidence that hedge re-balancing by option market - makers and stock price manipulation by firm proprietary traders contribute to the clustering .
That was it for me .
I could think of better things to do than dog paddling in a shark tank .
But ….
Maybe this could be visualized in a way ( heat chart ) that would show where the largest clusters of out of the money options were sitting .
This would have to be a real time screen of the NASDAQ 100 .
( Forget it on smaller stocks . )
You ’re looking for stocks that have large pools of options that are out of the money and for stocks that begin to move toward those option clusters IN OPPOSITION TO THE FUTURES .
How do you play ?
If a large cluster of options is below the market price , the futures are rising , and the tier one stock is wobbling or starting to fall , buy puts somewhere down there .
If the large cluster of options is above the market price , the futures are dropping , and the stock price is wobbling or starting to rise , buy calls .
The fact that the stock starts moving toward those options in opposition to the futures shows you that a powerful market maker or two might be refusing to let their options expire worthless .
If you knew where the options cluster was , and , therefore , the motivation behind the bullshit crank of a move , I suppose you could play the stock directly .
Of the three dangerous trading schemes above , this last one would be the most difficult to program .
It might also be the most profitable .
Well , guys , that ’s it .
I need to go build a bean frame and collect some cow manure .
They Thought You'd Say This : Unlikely phrases from real phrasebooks
I 've always been fascinated by phrasebooks ; my parents like to tell the story of my trying to talk to an Italian couple in Syracuse at the age of seven , using nothing but Berlitz Italian .
Phrasebooks offer the seductive illusion of mastering a language at little cost — flip the pages and handle any situation , from booking a room to going on a date to setting a broken leg .
Mostly they are little marvels of pragmatic compression .
But for that very reason , I like to find the occasional oddity — sentences you can hardly conceive of ever using , little tidbits of inexplicability in an otherwise ruthlessly disciplined little work .
All the following sentences are culled from real phrasebooks .
( As opposed to a fake phrasebook . )

If Larry Brilliant ’s life were a film , critics would pan the plot as implausible .
Trained as a physician , he was studying in an Indian monastery in 1973 when a guru told him to join the UN smallpox vaccination effort .
Brilliant helped eradicate the disease from India and eventually the planet .
He returned to the US and founded a charity organization , Seva , that has saved millions of people in developing countries from blindness ; cofounded the online community the Well ; and served as CEO for four tech companies .
Oh , and he also found time to march with Martin Luther King Jr. and moonlight as a physician for Jerry Garcia .
Last October , Brilliant received a $ 100,000 TED Prize to further his idea for building a global early - warning system for disease and disaster .
Four months later Google hired him to head its charitable arm , Google.org , with an initial bankroll of 3 million shares – worth about $ 1.15 billion – and 1 percent of annual profits .
Brilliant recently suspended a self - imposed “ quiet period ” to talk about his plans for Google.org .

How do you get put in charge of $ 1 billion ?
There are a number of contradictory stories floating around , all true .
I gave a talk at a TED salon , and somebody there invited me to give it at Google .
The next thing I know , I get a call saying , We have this Google foundation , might you be interested ?
And then began the Google hiring dance .
I got to meet all 6,500 employees one on one , for an hour each .
[ Laughs . ]
They must have run out of good candidates , so they picked me .
It seems like you were meant for this job .
My life only makes sense in retrospect .
I was the mascot on the smallpox initiative .
I was young and I could speak Hindi and I could type .
I stayed there for over 10 years , and I rose to a big lofty title .
But I learned epidemiology ; I learned public health ; I learned developing countries ; I learned how to live through floods and catastrophes and famines .
I ’ve held hundreds of dead babies in my arms .
I ’ve learned how to think when the world is going to hell all around me .
What ’s your mandate ?
We ’ll have three big areas : climate crisis , global public heath , and global poverty , not necessarily in that order .
I ’m going to approach this the way a venture capitalist would – map out the industry to see what the gaps are .
You fund an initiative , learn what works , and ask , “ Will it scale ? ”
What makes Google.org different from , say , the Gates foundation ?
We are not really a foundation .
It ’s a bit of a 501 ( c ) 3 , a bit of a C corp , and a bit of an academic environment .
I can play more of the keys on the keyboard .
A 501 ( c ) 3 ca n’t lobby .
A 501 ( c ) 3 ca n’t invest in a company or build an industry .
It may be that the only way to deal with climate change is to create an industry or build companies .
Where ’s the money coming from ?
One percent of the equity , 1 percent of the profits , and 1 percent of the people go into Google.org .
The most important asset is n’t money , it ’s people .
One percent of the people means 60 or 70 of the smartest people in the world trying to solve some of the biggest problems in the world .
Are engineers really the best source for solutions to the world ’s biggest problems ?
I hope that you ’ll put in that Wired questioned the value of engineers .
Touché .
Many of the issues we face in dealing with rapid climate change are well suited to an engineering mind .
Do you consider avian flu an information problem ?
Absolutely .
There ’s a 10 to 15 percent chance that H5N1 will achieve escape velocity and mutate to be transmitted from human to human .
If it does , between 100 million and 300 million people will die .
The world will incur costs of $ 1 trillion to $ 3 trillion .
But there ’s an 85 to 90 percent chance of it not happening .
How do you think this through with a government that is anti-science ?
How does one decide when experts do n’t agree ?
Information is the key .
Google can help make good information ubiquitous .
Do you expect some of your initiatives to fail ?
God , I hope so .
I am a technologist .
If I have a 100 percent batting average , you should fire me , because it means we have n’t tried anything really noble .
How are you fitting in ?
Google ’s a strange place .
When I met Eric Schmidt , he said , “ If you are kind to everybody , then you will make good decisions because people will give you good information , and if you are truthful to everybody , they will be truthful to you . ”
That ’s what ’s different about Google .
They screw up and make mistakes , but they genuinely mean the good stuff about “ do n’t be evil . ”
It ’s a catchy slogan , but you ’re going further .
We are trying to change that to :
Do something really , really , really good .
