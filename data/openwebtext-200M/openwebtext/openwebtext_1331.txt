Asher Meir has alerted us to a news article titled “ Desertification may have retarded global warming by as much as 20 % ” by Ehud Zion Waldoks which has appeared in the Jerusalem Post .
Excerpts from the article read
“ In an article published on Friday in the journal Science , Prof. Dan Yakir and Dr. Eyal Rotenberg of the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department discuss their analysis of findings from the Yatir Forest research station . ”
“ The desert reflects sunlight and releases infrared radiation , which has a cooling effect .
And in a world in which desertification is continuing at a rate of about six million hectares a year , that news might have a significant effect on how we estimate the rates and magnitude of climate change . “
Of course there significant negative effects of desertification , including the loss of biodiversity and the creation of an environment for dust storms .
The study does show though yet another example of the important role of human cased landscape processes within the climate system .
As everyone is engrossed by assorted groundless Christmas ( and other ongoing bear market ) rallies , and oblivious to the debt monsters hiding in both the closet and under the bed , Zero Hedge has decided it is about time to present the ugliest truth faced by our ' intellectual superiors ' and their Wall Street henchman who succeeded in pulling off Goal # 1 for 2009 - the biggest ever bonus season ( forget record bonuses in 2010 ... in fact , scratch any bonuses next year if what is likely to transpire in the upcoming 12 months does in fact occur ) .
If someone asks you what happened in 2009 , the answer is simple - two things .
There was a huge credit and liquidity crunch , and then there was Quantitative Easing .
The last is the Fed 's equivalent of band - aiding a zombied and ponzied corpse , better known as the US economy .
It worked for a while , but now the zombie is about to go back into critical , followed by comatose , and lastly , undead ( and 401 ( k ) - depleting ) condition .
In 2009 , total supply of all USD denominated fixed income , net of maturities , declined by $ 300 billion from $ 2.05 trillion to $ 1.75 trillion .
This makes sense : the abovementioned crunches stopped the flow of credit from January until well into April , and generally firms were unwilling to demonstrate to the market how clothless they are by hitting the capital markets until well into Q2 if not Q3 .
What happened was a move so drastic by the Fed , that into November , the worst of the worst High Yield names were freely upsizing dividend recap deals ( see CCU ) - the very same greed and stupidity that brought us here .
Luckily , so far securitization and CDOs have not made a dramatic entrance .
They likely will , at which point it will be time to buy a one - way ticket for either our southern or northern neighbor , both of which , in the supremest of ironies , transact in a currency that will survive long after the dollar is dead and buried .
Back to the math ...
And here is the kicker .
Accounting for securities purchased by the Fed , which effectively made the market in the Treasury , the agency and MBS arenas , but also served to " drain duration " from the broader US $ fixed income market , the stunning result is that net issuance in 2009 was only $ 200 billion .
Take a second to digest that .
And while you are lamenting the death of private debt markets , here is precisely what the Fed , the Treasury , and all bank CEOs are doing all their best to keep hidden until they are safely on their private jets heading toward warmer climes : in 2010 , the total estimated net issuance across all US $ denominated fixed income classes is expected to increase by 27 % , from $ 1.75 trillion to $ 2.22 trillion .
The culprit : Treasury issuance to keep funding an impossible budget .
And , yes , we use the term impossible in its most technical sense .
As everyone who has taken First Grade math knows , there is no way that the ludicrous deficit spending the US has embarked on makes any sense at all ... none .
But the administration can sure pretend it does , until everything falls apart and blaming everyone else for its fiscal imprudence is no longer an option .
Out of the $ 2.22 trillion in expected 2010 issuance , $ 200 billion will be absorbed by the Fed while QE continues through March .
Then the US is on its own : $ 2.06 trillion will have to find non-Fed originating demand .
To sum up : $ 200 billion in 2009 ; $ 2.1 trillion in 2010 .
Good luck .
As we pointed , the number one reason why 2010 is set to be a truly " interesting " year is a result of the upcoming explosion in US Treasury issuance .
Fiscal 2010 gross coupon issuance is expected to hit $ 2.55 trillion , a $ 700 billion increase from 2009 , which in turn was $ 1.1 trillion increase from 2008 .
For those of you needing a primer on the exponential function , click here .
But wait , there is a light in the tunnel : in 2011 , gross issuance is expected to decline ... to $ 1.9 trillion .
And while things are hair - raising in " gross " country ( not Bill ... at least not yet ) , they are not much better in netville either .
Net of maturities , 2010 coupon issuance will be about $ 1.8 trillion , a 45 % increase from the $ 1.3 trillion in FY 2009 ( and the paltry $ 255 billion in 2008 ) .
Now everyone knows that the average maturity of the UST curve has become a big problem for Tim Geithner : nearly 40 % of all marketable debt matures within a year ( a percentage that has kept on growing ) .
In fact , the Treasury provided guidance in its November 2009 refunding , in which it stated that it intends " to focus on increasing the average maturity " of its debt after relying heavily on Bill issuance in H2 .
Once again , we wish Tim the best of luck .
Why our generous best intentions to the US Treasury ?
Because unless the US consumer decides to forgo the purchase of the 4th sequential Kindle and buy some Treasuries ( and not just any : 30 Year Bonds or bust ) , the presumption that the Bond printer will have the option of finding vast foreign appetite for its spewage is a very myopic one .
We already know that China is a major question mark , and will aggressively be looking at pumping capital into its own economy instead of that of Uncle Sam's - at some point the return on investment in its own middle class will surpass that of funding the rapidly disappearing US middle class .
That tipping point could be as soon as 2010 .
As for Japan - the country has plunged into its nth consecutive deflationary period .
Whether or not the finance minister announces yet another affair with the Quantitative Easing whore on any given day , depends merely on what side of the bed he wakes up on .
The country will have its hands full monetizing its own sovereign issuance , let alone ours .
Lastly , the UK - well , with the country set to have zero bankers left in a few months , we do n't think the traditionally third largest purchaser of US debt will be doing much purchasing any time soon .
None of this is merely speculation : October TIC data confirmed these preliminary observations .
It will only become more pronounced in upcoming months .
How about that great globalization dynamo : emerging markets ?
Alas , they have their hands full with issuing their own record amounts of both sovereign and corporate debt as well : in 2009 gross EM debt issuance reached an astounding $ 217 billion , $ 29 billion higher than the previous record in 2007 .
Gross EM issuance was particularly high in the last quarter at $ 73 billion , with October breaking the record for the largest ever monthly gross issuance of emerging market global bonds at $ 38 billion ( January is traditionally the busiest month of the year . )
With $ 81 billion , 2009 was notably a record year for sovereign bonds , while gross issuance of corporate bonds amounted to $ 136 billion , the second highest level after that of 2007 with $ 155 billion .
Bottom line : everyone has major problems at home , and is more focused on the supply than the demand side of the equation .
What options does this leave for the administration ?
Very few , and all of them are ugly .
As we stated earlier on , the options for the Fed are threefold :
Announce a new iteration of Quantitative Easing .
This will be met with major disapproval across all voting classes ( at least those whose residential zip codes do not start with 10xxx or 068xx ) , creating major headaches for Obama and the democrats which are already struggling with collapsing polls .
Prepare for a major increase in interest rates .
While on the surface this would be very welcome for a Fed that keeps hinting that deflation is the biggest concern for the economy , Bernanke 's complete lack of preparation from a monetary standpoint ( we are surprised the Fed 's $ 200 million reverse repos have not made the late night comedy circuit yet ) to a forced interest rate increase , would likely result in runaway inflation almost overnight .
The result would be a huge blow to a still deteriorating economy .
Engineer a stock market collapse .
Recently investors have , rightfully , realized there is no more risk in equities , not because the assets backing the stockholder equity are actually creating greater cash flow ( as we demonstrated recently , that is not the case ) , but simply because taxpayers have involuntarily become safekeepers for the entire stock market , due to Bernanke 's forced intervention in bond and equity markets .
Yet the President 's Working Group is fully aware that when the time comes to hitting the " reverse " button , it will do so .
Will the resultant rush into safe assets be sufficient to generate the needed endogenous demand for Treasuries is unknown .
It will likely be correlated to the size of the equity market drop .
If the Fed decides on option three , we fully believe a 30 % drop ( or greater ) in equities is very probable as the new supply / demand regime in fixed income becomes apparent .
We hope mainstream media takes the ideas presented here and processes them for broader consumption as indeed the Fed is caught in a very fragile dilemma , and the sooner its hand is pushed , the less disastrous the final outcome for investors .
Then again , as Eric Sprott has been pointing out for quite some time , it could very well be that the US economy has become merely one huge Ponzi , and as such , its expansion or reduction on the margin is uncontrollable .
We very well may have passed into the stage where blind growth is the only alternative to a complete collapse .
We hope that is not the case .
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all readers .

Israel has reacted angrily to the issuing by a British court of an arrest warrant for the former Israeli Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni .
The warrant , granted by a London court on Saturday , was revoked on Monday when it was found Ms Livni was not visiting the UK .
Ms Livni was foreign minister during Israel 's Gaza assault last winter .
It is the first time a UK court has issued a warrant for the arrest of a former Israeli minister .
Ms Livni said the court had been " abused " by the Palestinian plaintiffs who requested the warrant .
" What needs to be put on trial here is the abuse of the British legal system , " she told the BBC .
" This is not a suit against Tzipi Livni , this is not a law suit against Israel .
This is a lawsuit against any democracy that fights terror . "
She stood by her decisions during the three - week assault Gaza offensive which began in December last year , she said .
Israel 's foreign ministry summoned the UK 's ambassador to Israel to deliver a rebuke over the warrant .
We completely reject this absurdity taking place in Britain
Benjamin Netanyahu
Israeli Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the situation was " an absurdity " .
" We will not accept a situation in which [ former Israeli Prime Minister ] Ehud Olmert , [ Defence Minister ] Ehud Barak and Tzipi Livni will be summoned to the defendants ' chair , " Mr Netanyahu said in a statement .
" We will not agree to have Israel Defence Force soldiers , who defended the citizens of Israel bravely and ethically against a cruel and criminal enemy , be recognised as war criminals .
We completely reject this absurdity taking place in Britain , " he said .
Pro-Palestinian campaigners have tried several times to have Israeli officials arrested under the principle of universal jurisdiction .
' Cynical act '
This allows domestic courts in countries around the world to try war crimes suspects , even if the crime took place outside the country and the suspect is not a citizen .
UN backs Gaza war crimes report Legal row over Gaza report Israel debates response to report Full UN report on Gaza war Israel denies claims by human rights groups and the UN investigator Richard Goldstone that its forces committed war crimes during the operation , which it said was aimed at ending Palestinian rocket fire at its southern towns .
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has also been accused of committing war crimes during the conflict .
Israel 's foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday : " Israel rejects the cynical act taken in a British court , " against Ms Livni , now the head of the opposition Kadima party , " at the initiative of extreme elements " .
It called on the British government to " act against the exploitation of the British legal system against Israel " .
Addressing a conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday , Ms Livni did not refer specifically to the arrest attempt .
But she said : " Israel must do what is right for Israel , regardless of judgements , statements and arrest warrants .
It 's the leadership 's duty , and I would repeat each and every decision , " Israeli media reported .
' Strategic partner '
Israel says it fully complies with international law , which it says it interprets in line with other Western countries such as the US and UK .
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO ARREST ISRAELI OFFICIALS
Oct 2009 : Former military chief Moshe Yaalon cancelled a UK visit because of fears of arrest for alleged war crimes Oct 2009 : Filed attempt to raise warrant against Defence Minister Ehud Barak .
Court ruled he had diplomatic immunity Sept 2005 : Arrest warrant issued for a former head of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip Gen Doron Almog .
He received warning before disembarking from an aircraft at Heathrow Airport , and flew back to Israel On Monday Ms Livni 's office denied the reports that a warrant had been issued and that she had cancelled plans to visit the UK because of fears of arrest .
It said a planned trip had been cancelled two weeks earlier because of scheduling problems .
The British foreign office said it was " urgently looking into the implications of the case " .
" The UK is determined to do all it can to promote peace in the Middle East , and to be a strategic partner of Israel , " it said in a statement .
" To do this , Israel 's leaders need to be able to come to the UK for talks with the British government . "
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 people were killed during Israel 's Cast Lead operation between 27 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 , more than half of them civilians .
Israel puts the number of deaths at 1,166 - fewer than 300 of them civilians .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .
The BBC's Tim Franks says that , privately , senior Israeli figures are warning of what they see as an increasing anti-Israeli bent in the British establishment .
In turn , our correspondent adds , there is clearly concern among British officials that should further arrest warrants be issued , relations with Israel could be damaged .

Microsoft is being sued by a small tech firm for using a part of its name , Bing !
Information Design , as the moniker for its new search engine .
Bing !
Information Design says it 's been using the name for almost ten years , far longer than the seven - month - old Bing search engine .
St. Louis - based Bing !
Information Design filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in its home city .
The company claims that Microsoft 's search engine violates its trademark on the word ' Bing ' .
Bing !
Information Design says it has had rights to that name since 2000 .
Specifically , the suit alleges Microsoft is guilty of " trademark infringement , unfair competition and tortious interference with business expectancy . "
( Source : arstechnica.com )
Bing Grabs Hold of Search Market
Microsoft 's Bing search engine launched in May of 2009 , and has received mostly good reviews ever since .
By late September it had already eaten up almost 9 per cent of the total search market -- remarkable growth for a brand new engine .
It 's almost certain that Bing !
Information Design will argue that part of that growth is due to the search engine 's simple and very catchy name .
Bing !
Information Design is not Bing Search
Bing !
Information Design is an " Internet - related company " that produces interactive designs , graphics , animations and diagrams .
Bing !
Information Design claims Microsoft 's use of the word confuses consumers , some of whom might think the company is associated with Microsoft .
In a statement , Bing !
Information Design 's legal counsel Anthony Smith had this to say : " My client selected this unique mark to distinguish itself in the marketplace and invested substantial time and effort promoting its business using Bing !.
Microsoft 's use of the identical mark and its aggressive advertising have gutted all of my client 's efforts to distinguish its business and created confusion that must be remedied . "
( Source : Internetnews.com )
Microsoft Dismisses Claims
For its part , Microsoft does n't believe small - time online graphics design companies have much to do with search engines and today shot back , " We do not believe there is any confusion in the marketplace with regard to the complainant 's offerings and Microsoft's Bing . "
The case is bringing back plenty of memories from 2004 , when Microsoft and Linux vendor Lindows became involved in a similar suit .
Back then , the software giant ended up paying Lindows $ 20 million to simply change its name .

Writing in a journal or diary , where you may pour your heart out for no one ’s eyes but your own , can be an intensely personal experience .
Writing longhand in a paper notebook used to be standard practice for journal writing , but most people nowadays type faster than they write , and digital text is easier to search .
But finding a journal application that suits your sense of style is just as personal a decision as finding the right notebook in which to write .
When Jendrik Seipp could n’t find what he was looking for in a journal app , he began coding his own , and that became RedNotebook .
RedNotebook is a desktop journal and diary .
You can use it to write notes or work logs or keep a regular diary .
You can tag entries , and insert files , pictures , and links .
Once you ’ve entered them , you can search your entries , and export them to plain text , HTML , LaTeX , or PDF .
Entries can be formatted with a wiki - style markup language , and the application even provides statistics about your journal .
RedNotebook lets you construct templates for repeating posts , so you can make a template for each day of the week , or named templates for special events such as work meetings or trips .
Another fun feature is a word cloud that shows the words and tags you use most often .
The program supports wiki markup not just in journal entries , but everywhere .
That means you can write ** bold ** text in the main text area , and also in the categories on the right side of each page .
You can also have links and pictures in the category entries .
Seipp says he chose to write RedNotebook in Python because “ I wanted to write a bigger software project with this awesome language .
At first I used the wxPython toolkit , but was soon fed up with it , because it was very difficult to use and there was n’t much documentation about it .
I switched to PyGTK for the 0.5 release and am very happy with this decision .
The GUI is partly designed with Glade .
For programming I mostly use Eclipse with PyDev or Geany .
The project uses SVN , because that was the only version control tool I knew at the time .
The application itself makes use of PyYAML and txt2tags because those libs make the conversion of the content from disk to GUI to HTML and back a breeze .
“ For the future I have planned Zeitgeist integration to give users an auto - generated log of activities .
I also plan to implement some kind of encryption .
And maybe RedNotebook will even make the switch to real rich text editing . ”
Since he began development in August 2008 Seipp has made 40 releases .
He says he hosts the product on SourceForge .
net because “ it is the best - known service for open source software and a starting point for many people ’s searches for free software . ”
He announces new releases at freshmeat.net and gnomefiles.org , and via Twitter .
If you ’d like to get involved with the project , you can contact Seipp through RedNotebook ’s forum or via e-mail .
He says , “ RedNotebook needs more translators , and also documentation writers and testers .
In addition the project seriously needs someone in charge of creating Windows installers ( or the first Mac package ) for new versions .
If you are a developer , help is needed for the encryption work .
Last but not least , if you know your way around CSS , it would be great if you could design some templates for nicer content previews . ”
The 34 Languages of McDonald's
An Interactive Linguistic Quiz
This set of pages was inspired by a visit to McDonald 's in May 2004 .
Along with our son's Happy Meal , we got a small playstation - type game where you have to help a monkey catch bananas as they fall from the sky .
I was amused to note that the instructions came in no fewer than 34 languages , spoken in and around Europe .
It occurred to me that even without speaking a word of some of these languages , it is possible to work out what they are from their unique spelling peculiarities , and as we munched away I scribbled down my guesses .
Then I thought , why not see if other people find this an interesting process ?
So I 've drawn up this interactive quiz - no scores , just the intellectual challenge at each stage of knowing how many guesses it took you to get the right answer .
So here we are .
But before we start , a word of warning - not all of the languages concerned are in the same alphabet as English .
Indeed , even those that are mostly have a lot of extra diacritical marks - not just letters like � , � , � , � , � , and � which most internet browsers will show correctly , but also weirder cases like ą , ē , č , ğ , ľ , ń , ş , and even ů .
For those weirder letters , when we get to them , I 'll describe what they look like so it should n't matter too much if you can't see them .
But if the alphabet is completely different , it becomes a bit difficult to do even that .
So , please consider this table :
AIAI БЕРБА НА БАНАНИ
Помогни му на AIAI да се собере сите банан и Среќно !
תפוס את הבננ ה
AIAI
עזור ל- Tails לאסוף את כל הבננות .
בהצלחה !
AIAI ბანანის ლაჭერ ი
დასმარება AIAI მოაგროვეთ ყველი ბანანი .
აბა იცით !
جمع موز AIAI ™
ساعد AIAI ™ في جمع الموز .
حظا موفقا !
Το Πιάσιμο της Μπανάνα ς του AIAI
Βοηθήσ τε τον AIAI να σ υλλέξε ι όλε ς τις μπανάνε ς.
Καλή Επιτυχία !
The first of the four alphabets is used by five of the languages in the quiz .
The others are used by one language each .
You can probably see the last one clearly , as it's programmed into most browsers , but the others are more exotic ( especially the middle one ) .
If you can't see them clearly you will be at a disadvantage in doing the quiz .
If you can see them all , start the quiz .
If you can't , start the shorter version .
Each page will give you a selection of up to 45 languages to choose from ( 32 languages in the short version ) .
If you make the wrong choice you can try again .
I do n't yet have anything sophisticated like a marking mechanism - you 'll have to keep score for yourself .
I have placed an " I give up ! " link at the bottom of each page in case it seems impossible to guess the right answer .
Please send comments , either by email or in my livejournal

Howard Dean tells Vermont Public Radio :
This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate .
Honestly the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill , go back to the House , start the reconciliation process , where you only need 51 votes and it would be a much simpler bill .
Headaches and heartaches .
Broken bones and broken spirits .
Hurting bodies and hurt feelings .
We often use the same words to describe physical and mental pain .
Over - the - counter pain relieving drugs have long been used to alleviate physical pain , while a host of other medications have been employed in the treatment of depression and anxiety .
But is it possible that a common painkiller could serve double duty , easing not just the physical pains of sore joints and headaches , but also the pain of social rejection ?
A research team led by psychologist C. Nathan DeWall of the University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences Department of Psychology has uncovered evidence indicating that acetaminophen ( the active ingredient in Tylenol ) may blunt social pain .
" The idea -- that a drug designed to alleviate physical pain should reduce the pain of social rejection -- seemed simple and straightforward based on what we know about neural overlap between social and physical pain systems .
To my surprise , I could n't find anyone who had ever tested this idea , " DeWall said .
According to a study due to be published in the journal Psychological Science , DeWall and colleagues were correct .
Physical and social pain appear to overlap in the brain , relying on some of the same behavioral and neural mechanisms .
DeWall and colleagues investigated this connection through two experiments .
In the first experiment , 62 healthy volunteers took 1,000 milligrams daily of either acetaminophen or a placebo .
Each evening , participants reported how much they experienced social pain using a version of the " Hurt Feelings Scale " - a measurement tool widely accepted by psychologists as a valid measure of social pain .
Hurt feelings and social pain decreased over time in those taking acetaminophen , while no change was observed in subjects taking the placebo .
Levels of positive emotions remained stable , with no significant changes observed in either group .
These results indicate that acetaminophen use may decrease self - reported social pain over time , by impacting emotions linked to hurt feelings .
" We were very excited about these initial findings , " DeWall said .
" The next step was to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the findings . "
In the second experiment , 25 healthy volunteers took 2,000 milligrams daily of either acetaminophen or a placebo .
After three weeks of taking the pills , subjects participated in a computer game rigged to create feelings of social rejection .
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) employed during the game revealed that acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions associated with the distress of social pain and the affective component of physical pain ( the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula ) .
In other words , the parts of the brain associated with physical lit up in the placebo subjects when they were rejected , while the acetaminophen group displayed significantly less activity in these brain areas in response to rejection .
According to the academic paper detailing the experiments : " ... findings suggest that at least temporary mitigation of social pain - related distress may be achieved by means of an over - the - counter painkiller that is normally used for physical aches and painsâ€¦ .
Furthermore , many studies have shown that being rejected can trigger aggressive and antisocial behavior , which could lead to further complications in social life ... .
If acetaminophen reduces the distress of rejection , the antisocial behavioral consequences of rejection may be reduced as well . "
Researchers caution that readers should not immediately stock up on acetaminophen to ease social pain and anxiety , noting " [ t ] o be sure , our findings do not constitute a call for widespread use of acetaminophen to cope with all types of personal problems .
Future research is needed to verify the potential benefits of acetaminophen on reducing emotional and antisocial responses to social rejection . "
Long - term use of acetaminophen has also been linked to serious liver damage , so it is important for patients to follow all package directions and consult their physicians if they are contemplating taking any medication for an off - label use .
" This research has the potential to change how scientists and laypersons understand physical and social pain .
Social pain , such as chronic loneliness , damages health as much as smoking and obesity .
We hope our findings can pave the way for interventions designed to reduce the pain of social rejection , " DeWall said .

( CNN ) --
The Food and Drug Administration has notified about 30 manufacturers of alcoholic beverages containing added caffeine that it intends to take a look at their products .
The question is not only if these products -- such as 24/7 made by Mix Master Beverage Co. and Joose by United Brands Co. -- are safe , but also whether it is even legal to add caffeine to such drinks , the agency says .
In September , 18 attorneys general from states including Connecticut , Utah , California and New York sent a letter to the FDA outlining why they consider such drinks dangerous .
They were joined by a number of doctors and scientists who have conducted research on the subject .
The letter cited several studies that showed stimulants such as caffeine mask the intoxicating effects of alcohol and could lead to increased risk - taking and other alcohol - related problems such as violence , sexual assault , traffic accidents and even suicide .
One study done last year found usage to be nearly 30 percent among college students , in whom the beverages are associated with " heavy episodic drinking and episodes of weekly drunkenness . "
It also found people who drink caffeinated alcoholic beverages are more likely to have alcohol - related problems .
" The increasing popularity of consumption of caffeinated alcoholic beverages by college students and reports of potential health and safety issues necessitates that we look seriously at the scientific evidence as soon as possible , " said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs .
Any ingredient added to food is considered a food additive .
According to the FDA , " food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety submitted to the agency . "
Ingredients added to food are considered unsafe and against the law unless the FDA approves their use or unless the ingredients are " generally recognized as safe , " a designation that still requires evidence of safety at the levels used in the product .
To date , caffeine has been approved for use only in soft drinks , and only at concentrations under 200 parts per million .
The fact that the FDA never approved caffeine in alcoholic beverages raises questions about whether such drinks can be legally marketed .
The makers have 30 days to provide safety data to support claims that the caffeine use is generally recognized as safe .
If the FDA finds that it is not , it can demand the products be taken off the market .
Last year , Anheuser - Busch and Miller agreed to take their popular caffeinated alcoholic beverages off the market .
The companies reformulated Tilt , Sparks and Bud Extra , taking out the caffeine .
Both agreed not to make caffeinated alcoholic drinks in the future .

You probably wo n’t see it in most US news outlets , but on Monday morning in Kabul and Jalalabad , hundreds of university students demonstrated against US strikes this weekend that allegedly killed a number of civilians .
I want to underline the irony that the students in Tehran University are protesting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , while students in these two Afghan cities are calling for Yankees to go home .
Nangarhar University in Jalalabad only has a student body of about 3200 , so ‘ hundreds ’ of students protesting there would be a significant proportion of the student body .
The demonstrations could be a harbinger of things to come , but there was worse news .
CIA field officers blown up , four US troops killed Sunday , and the rejection of most of the cabinet nominees by parliament , all signal rocky times ahead .
The past two weeks have seen the situation in Afghanistan deteriorate palpably , raising significant questions about the viability of the Obama - McChrystal plan for the country .
The chain of catastrophes has been reported in piecemeal fashion , but taken together these events are far more ominous than they might appear on the surface .
First , the US military launched a raid in Kunar Province two days after Christmas on a village at night , in which President Hamid Karzai alleged that 10 civilians , some 8 of them schoolchildren , had been killed ( some say dragged out of their beds and executed ) .
The NYT reported the head of a Kabul delegation to the village saying , “ They gathered eight school students from two compounds and put them in one room and shot them with small arms . ”
( The spokesman is a former governor of Kunar and now a close adviser to President Hamid Karzai– i.e. not exactly a pro-Taliban source ) .
The charitable theory is that in a nighttime raid , US troops got disoriented and hit the wrong group of young men .
The outraged Afghan public saw this raid as an atrocity , and on Wednesday December 30 , they mounted street protests against the US in Jalalabad , an eastern Pashtun city , and Kabul .
In Jalalabad , hundreds of university students blocked the main roads , and then marched in the streets , chanting “ Death to Obama ” and “ Death to America , ” and burning Obama in effigy .
( If they go on like that , the anti-imperialist Pashtun college students of Jalalabad may attract the support of Fox Cable News . . .)
Even while the protests were taking place in Jalalabad and Kabul , a NATO missile strike on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province was alleged to have killed as many as 7 more civilians , some of them children .
Now the Afghan public was really angry .
Then on Thursday , all hell broke loose when a high - level Pashtun Jordanian asset who had been informing to the CIA on the location of important al - Qaeda and Taliban operatives detonated a vest bomb at FOB Chapman in Khost province , a CIA forward base .
The attacker killed 7 field officers and one Jordanian intelligence operative detailed to the base .
Those experienced field officers were on the front lines in the fight against al - Qaeda and their loss is a big blow to counter - terrorism .
It is true that they had been drawn in to a campaign of assassination , but it is the president who gave them that task–unwisely , in my view .
The use of a double agent not only to misinform but actually to kill the most experienced counter - terrorism officers in the region showed the sophistication of tactical thinking in the Afghan insurgency .
The CIA ’s dependence on a double agent who finally openly betrayed them raises troubling questions about US strategy and tactics in the region .
Such informants essentially direct CIA drone missile strikes .
You could imagine Siraj Haqqani , leader of the Haqqani Network in Khost and over the border in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan , inserting such a double agent into FOB Chapman and then using the CIA .
For instance , what if a middling member of the Haqqani network launched a challenge to Siraj ’s leadership and that of his ailing father , Jalaluddin ( an old - time ally of Reagan who was warmly greeted in the White House in the 1980s ) ?
Would n’t it be easy enough just to have the double agent tell the CIA that the challenger is a really bad guy in cahoots with al - Qaeda ?
Boom .
Drone strike kills Taliban leaders in North Waziristan .
In this way , Siraj could have used the US to eliminate rivals and become more and more powerful .
And how many double agents have given up a few Arab jihadis who had fallen out with the Haqqanis , but then deliberately followed this up with bad intel on some innocent village , making the name of the US mud among the Pashtuns ?
The drone strikes should n’t be run by the CIA , and probably should n’t be run at all .
It could well be that savvy old - time Mujahidin trained in CIA tradecraft in the 1980s are having our young wet behind the ears field officers for lunch .
In short , is the bombing at FOB Chapman the tip of an iceberg of misinformation , on which the Titanic of Obama ’s AfPak policy could well founder ?
Aljazeera English has video of these dramatic events leading up to the New Year , including the anti-US demonstrations , which looked big and significant to me on satellite television .
A soldier of the Afghan army shot an American soldier , further raising suspicions between the two supposed partners .
Then a Canadian unit and embedded journalist were blown up .
There were more errant US strikes over the weekend , producing the demonstrations in Kabul and Jalalabad on Monday morning .
Then there were two other pieces of information coming out in the past few days that suggest all is not well .
First , a report on the Afghanistan Army threw cold water all over the idea that it could be enlarged and trained to provide security in the country any time soon .
High desertion rates , illiteracy , working half days , refusal to stand and fight against the enemy , and other factors just made that prospect remote .
But such training , and the substitution of the Afghan National Army for NATO and US forces is the centerpiece of the Obama - McChrystal plan .
Finally , the Afghan parliament rejected 17 of the 24 nominees to the cabinet offered by President Karzai .
The speaker of the House , Yunus Qanuni , supported Karzai ’s rival , Abdullah Abdullah , in August ’s presidential elections – which many Afghans believe Karzai stole .
This rejection was the Abdullah faction ’s chance to humiliate Karzai in revenge .
Aljazeera English has video on the rejection of 70 percent of the cabinet , including the old time warlord of Herat , Ismail Khan , and a key women ’s affairs minister .
But the step means that we go into the winter with 17 ministries headless .
Having an increasingly competent Afghan government to partner with was another key element of the Obama plan .
There is not one .
So , the US is killing schoolchildren far too often , enraging the Afghan public .
It has provoked a student protest movement against it in Jalalabad and Kabul .
Its informants are double agents .
Its supposed partner , the Afghan army , mostly does n’t actually exist and could n’t be depended on to show up to anything important ; and that is when they are n’t taking potshots at US troops ; and there is no Afghan government as we go into 2010 .
President Obama may have a lot on his plate , but Afghanistan could make or break his presidency .
If he does n’t view what has happened there while he was in Hawaii with alarm and begin thinking of alternative strategies , he could be in big trouble .

The idea of a culture that finds heavier women more attractive than thin women seems appealing .
But the practice of " gavage " — force feeding — in Mauritania confirms that living up any female standard of beauty is never easy .
Last night 's episode of the National Geographic Channel 's series Taboo focused on how obesity is viewed in different cultures .
One segment was devoted to Mauritania , where a woman 's size " indicates the amount of space she occupies in her husband 's heart . "
Because famine is a regular occurrence in the West African country , bigger women symbolize not only fertility , but wealth and health .
In fact , one in five women there practice gavage , which is a kind of force - feeding akin to torture .
Gaining weight is n't exactly easy .
Often , the women rely on meals of milk mixed with crushed millet and butter to gain weight , and many of them force their daughters at a young age to consume several bowls of the mixture .
Gavage is now beginning to be seen by some in Mauritania as child abuse , since instruments are used to inflict pain in order to force the children to swallow .
Additionally , many young girls die from complications of gavage , like choking on their own vomit .
In adulthood , the women of Mauritania feel the effects of lifelong obesity , like heart trouble , difficulty breathing , and joint pain .
Why must appealing to men always be such a heavy burden on women ?

Health care spending is out of control .
Spending on health care in 2008 made up 17 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product , up from just 6 percent in 1965 .
And national health care spending is expected to account for 25 percent of our GDP by 2025 .
Without reform , federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid alone will exceed the entire defense budget by 2019 .
Health care spending will be higher than total spending on all domestic discretionary programs by that year , and it will even surpass spending on Social Security .
Health care reform will not only make care available to more Americans ; it stands to save taxpayers and the government billions of dollars while providing an infusion of jobs into the economy .
Reforming the way health care is delivered will translate into real savings and better care .
$ 2 trillion : Amount we can save over the next 10 years by promoting cost - saving innovations and reducing waste and inefficiencies .
$ 196 billion : Administrative savings associated with technology and payment reform .
$ 299 billion : Estimated savings as a result of increased use of preventative care , better management of chronic illness , and reduction in medical errors leading to fewer and less expensive acute care episodes .
Medicare reform , one major component of the health care reform bills now being considered in Congress , could save billions over the next 10 years .
The Congressional Budget Office projects that in 2020 outlays for Medicare and Medicaid — the two largest health care programs — will be a full 2 percentage points of GDP higher than they were in 2008 .
14.2 percent : Medicare ’s share of the federal budget in 2009 , up from 13 percent in 2008 .
Medicare also went from comprising 3.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 3.5 percent in 2009 .
$ 499 billion : Federal Medicare spending in 2009 .
If no health reform is enacted , expected federal spending on Medicare will nearly double , totaling $ 1 trillion in 2020 .
14 percent :
The amount by which Medicare overpays private insurers in the Medicare Advantage program .
Taxpayers will save an estimated $ 175 billion over the next 10 years by reducing Medicare overpayments to private insurers .
$ 17.4 billion : The estimated cost of unplanned rehospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries .
Approximately one - fifth of Medicare beneficiaries who had been discharged from a hospital are unexpectedly readmitted within 30 days .
$ 12 billion : Estimated savings to taxpayers over the next 10 years by creating incentives tied to the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries .
$ 38 billion : Estimated Medicare savings over the next 10 years by realigning Medicare ’s payments to teaching hospitals to track actual costs of physician training and to encourage primary care training .
Medicare pays teaching hospitals more than twice the cost of indirect expenses incurred from training physicians attributable to Medicare patients .
Health care reform translates into new jobs for Americans who badly need them .
400,000 : Number of jobs that could be created per year if health care reform is enacted that reduces the growth of insurance premiums .
120,000 : Number of jobs added to the economy for every 10 percent reduction in excess health care cost growth .
Our current health care system is wasteful and inefficient , and many commonly used procedures rack up costs without providing any benefit to the sick and injured .
$ 800 billion : How much waste and inefficiencies in our health care system cost us each year .
One - third or more :
The estimated number of treatments and procedures performed in the United States that have no proven benefits .
Between $ 18 billion and $ 33 billion :
How much the overuse of radiology services costs Americans each year .
$ 550 million : How much the overprescription of antibiotics costs the nation each year .
$ 700 million : How much we could save each year by eliminating unnecessary heart stents .
More than $ 2 billion :
How much we spend each year on arthroscopic knee surgery for people with osteoarthritis — a surgery we now know does not help these individuals .
Up to 70 percent : Percentage of hysterectomies performed that have been judged as inappropriate by experts .

The US is sending up to 3,500 soldiers and 2,200 marines to Haiti to help rescue efforts in the wake of the devastating earthquake .
President Barack Obama pledged one of the biggest relief efforts in recent US history and said Haiti would " not be forgotten " in its hour of need .
The search for survivors continues but rescuers lack heavy lifting equipment and many are using their bare hands .
The Red Cross estimates 45,000 - 50,000 people are dead and up to 3 m affected .
BBC correspondents say the situation is increasingly desperate , with aid only trickling in .

Mr Obama confirmed that some US rescuers were already working on the ground in Haiti .
Speaking in Washington , he promised the country " every element of our national capacity , our diplomacy , and development assistance , the power of our military and most importantly , the compassion of our country " following the disaster .
" To the people of Haiti , we say clearly and with conviction , you will not be forsaken , you will not be forgotten , " he said .
However he warned it would take time for much - needed help to reach people .
Mr Obama also promised an immediate $ 100 m for Haiti 's relief effort and said that investment would grow over the coming year to aid long - term recovery .
AT THE SCENE Andy Gallacher , BBC News , Haiti Haiti is at a critical juncture at the moment .
I 've come across two schools that have completely collapsed , you could see the bodies trapped inside - but there were no rescue teams on the ground .
I have n't seen anyone in the two days I 've been here .
Haitians are still digging through the rubble with their hands .
The bodies are beginning to build up , both on the streets and in public spaces .
There are no coffins here , no arrangements for burials .
There is no sense that the promised relief efforts have begun in earnest .
The first 100 - strong contingent from the US Army 's 82nd Airborne Division is expected to arrive in Haiti by the end of Thursday , with several hundred more due by Friday .
The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier will arrive on Thursday .
The USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is also on its way .
The US forces will join Haitians and international search and rescue teams already on the ground .
Aid groups say it is a race against time to find people trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings .
Elisabeth Byrs , of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , said : " The priority is to find survivors .
We are working against the clock . "
The head of Medecins du Monde , Olivier Bernard , told AFP news agency that aid had to arrive by Thursday evening .

Doctor 's assistant Jimitre Coquillon told Associated Press : " This is much worse than a hurricane .
There 's no water .
There 's nothing .
Thirsty people are going to die . "
The BBC's Matthew Price in Port - au - Prince says Haiti is in massive need of food , water and medicine , as well as bulldozers and heavy lifting equipment .
But perhaps more than anything it needs someone to take charge here , our correspondent says .
The government is fragile at the best of times and there is no sense it is able to do anything for now .
Meanwhile , the US Federal Aviation Authority said it had stopped civilian flights to Haiti at the Haitian government 's request because there was not enough space on the ground for more planes and only limited fuel for them to leave .
Flights were later resumed , reports said .
The director of Port - au - Prince 's general hospital said that by 1100 ( 1600 GMT ) at least 1,500 bodies were already stacked inside and outside the morgue , with police continuing to bring more corpses on pick - up trucks , Reuters reports .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it could be days before even an estimate of the death toll from the earthquake could be made , but said he feared it would be " very high " .

He was dug out and is now in hospital .
A few US aid planes and a 50 - strong Chinese rescue team with sniffer dogs have landed at the airport serving the capital , Port - au - Prince .

Please close all uTorrent applications and try again . "
So far I 've been unable to find an existing solution to this problem .
The only reason I 'm trying to install uTorrent is to use the scheduling function , to allow downloads during my off - peak times .
So if anyone can suggest a solution , or an alternative program which has a scheduling function , that would be greatly appreciated .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The government will appeal a court decision to dismiss charges against Blackwater security guards accused of killing 14 Iraqi civilians in 2007 , Vice President Joe Biden said on Saturday .

The U.S. federal court found last month that the defendants ’ constitutional rights had been violated , angering many Iraqis .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government has hired U.S. lawyers to prepare a law suit against Blackwater , a security contractor now called Xe Services .
With Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at his side at a Baghdad news conference , Biden expressed “ personal regret ” for the violence in a Baghdad traffic circle when Blackwater guards were accused of opening fire on innocent civilians .
The guards said they shot in self - defense in the incident , which occurred during some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq .
“ The United States is determined , determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people , ” Biden said .
“ While we fully respect the independence and integrity of the U.S. judicial system , we were disappointed by the judge ’s decision to dismiss the indictment , which was based on the way in which some evidence had been acquired , ” Biden said .
The U.S. Justice Department would file the appeal next week , he said .
The incident came to symbolize for Iraqis what they saw as foreigners ’ disregard for their lives after private guards protecting U.S. personnel were given immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts following the 2003 U.S. - led invasion .
It also threw a critical light on the U.S. use of private security contractors in Iraq .
U.N. human rights experts have called on Iraq and the United States to ensure that the case is prosecuted , saying it underscores the need for credible oversight of private security companies working for governments in war zones .
The belligerent , foul - mouthed man stood less than a foot away from me , jabbing his finger into the air to make his point .
“ That old man should n’t be on the road , ” he said .
“ He turned right into me . ”
My 81 - year - old father stood nearby , embarrassed and shaken .
On a 1 - to - 10 scale , the accident hardly registered :
My dad ’s car barely brushed the other vehicle , with no discernible damage to either car or occupant .
But the bully facing me at that moment acted like he wanted blood .
I thought to myself , could he be right ?
Had my dad become a hazard to himself and others ?
Was it time to take away the keys ?

It ’s a question adult children ask themselves with dread .
Losing the ability to drive impacts a person ’s dignity and independence , especially in California , where transportation options can be limited .
But we all can cite an example of older drivers who caused horrific accidents .
More than 3 million California drivers are 65 or older , some of them over the century mark .
Statistically , they ’re considered safe drivers ; teenagers are far more accident prone , according to state DMV records .
But older drivers are more likely to be killed or critically injured when involved in an accident .
Short of taking the keys away , we can do many things to lower the risk and help our parents become better drivers .
And when they reach the point where they can no longer drive safely , we can ease the transition from driver to passenger .
The first step ?
Have the conversation long before your parent ’s driving becomes a problem , says Jane Mahakian , an Orange County clinical psychologist whose company , Aging Matters , specializes in geriatric issues .
Advertisement
“ I encourage my boomer clients to establish an open dialogue with their parents , ” she says , citing statistics that show only 25 % of older adults find the conversation uncomfortable .
Some of her suggestions for opening the discussion :
* “ People just do n’t drive as safely out there as they did before . . . ”
* “ When did your mother ( or father ) stop driving ? ”
Advertisement
* “ What effect does your medication have on your driving ? ”
Candid , occasional conversations stressing your concern about your parent ’s safety should follow , experts say .
Often the discussions reveal problems that can be solved easily , perhaps by taking a refresher driving course .
Physical problems can be overcome .
If a driver can no longer see over the steering wheel , a pillow can boost them ; if they ’re too inflexible to look over their shoulder when changing lanes , physical therapy might help .
If they feel uncomfortable with the speed of freeway traffic , they can limit their driving to surface streets .
Retired lawyer Julian Ertz , 90 , used to get nervous when he drove on the freeway from his home in south Orange County to Westwood to visit a friend .
“ The motorcycles would cut in and out of traffic and people drove crazily , ” he says .
Now he takes Pacific Coast Highway instead .
“ It takes longer , but I ’m happier . ”
Advertisement
By imposing his own restrictions , Ertz is emulating others .
Some give up driving at night , others only take well - known routes ( to the market and church , for instance ) , and others avoid dangerous intersections or rush - hour traffic .
If Dad or Mom wo n’t limit or stop driving , enlist the support of a doctor , Mahakian says .
“ Older people will listen to their doctors even if they wo n’t listen to you , ” she says .
Before you make the push , however , find transportation alternatives -- family , friends , local programs -- that allow your parents to remain engaged in their activities .
Do n’t cut them off .
Advertisement
If you ’ve done your homework and they still refuse to move to the passenger seat , it might be time to alert the DMV .
Charley Fenner gets calls all the time from children who are worried about a parent ’s driving ability .
Fenner , 71 , heads the DMV’s Senior Ombudsmen program in Sacramento .
“ They tell us Mom or Dad is getting a little shaky and say that maybe we should take a look at them , ” he says .
If the situation seems to warrant it , the driver is required to take vision , written and on - the - road driving tests .
Advertisement
“ If they pass , they ’re in the clear , ” Fenner says .
If not , their licenses can be revoked .
The DMV offers videos , brochures and extensive online senior assistance at www.dmv.ca.gov.
Locally , call the L.A. senior ombudsman , Ann Love , at ( 310 ) 412-6103 .
Other good information can be found at www.aaa.com and www.thehartford.com.
California drivers are required to pass written and vision tests ( but not on - the - road tests ) when renewing licenses that expire after their 70th birthdays and at five - year intervals thereafter .
Ertz , who just received his license for another five years , said he was relieved when he passed .
“ If I could n’t have driven anymore , I would have felt lost , ” he says .
“ Now I ’m good until I ’m 95 , if I live that long . ”

To calm my fears about my dad ’s driving , I embarked on weekly ride - alongs with him after his accident .
Dad was fine for years , finally giving up the keys in his mid-80s .
The belligerent accident victim ?
After shouting at me for several minutes , he tipped his hand .
He wanted $ 250 , he said .
I played dumb .
He finally went away empty - handed .

Foreign media banned from reporting in Tehran from Dec. 7 -
9
Most of the Iranian capital ’s Internet links with the outside world were down on Saturday , two days ahead of planned demonstrations by opponents of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Sources close to Iran ’s technical services told AFP the cut was the result of “ a decision by the authorities ” rather than a technical breakdown , but telecommunications ministry officials were unavailable for comment .

Officials furthermore revoked all foreign media permits , in an attempt to block any reports coming out of Tehran between Dec. 7 and Dec. 9 .
“ Police and elite Revolutionary Guards have warned that any ‘ illegal ’ rally will be fiercely confronted on Monday when the country marks Student Day , commemorating the killing of three students in 1953 under the former Shah , ” reported Reuters .
Internet lines , texting and at times even mobile phone connections have often been cut or scrambled since Ahmadinejad ’s contested re-election in June , but this was the first such occurrence a full two days before planned protests .
Iranian opposition groups are preparing to hold fresh demonstrations on Monday , several websites reported , as the nation marks the annual Students Day .
The elite Revolutionary Guards and other authorities have warned they will crack down on any attempt by regime opponents to hijack the event to mount further protests against Ahmadinejad .

Tehran on December 7 marks the 1953 killing by the shah ’s security forces of three students , just months after a US - backed coup toppled popular prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq .
With AFP .
The Chinese government has announced retaliatory measures over a planned sale of advanced US weaponry to Taiwan .
China 's defence ministry said it would suspend military exchanges with the US , impose sanctions on companies selling arms to Taiwan and review wider co-operation on international issues .
The confrontation over the $ 6.3 bn ( £ 4bn ) arms sale to Taiwan – a self - governing island that Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory – threatens to strain a relationship already troubled by disputes about internet censorship and trade .
The planned arms sales , announced by the US military yesterday , could hinder Washington 's efforts to win Chinese support for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme and exacerbate disputes over the standoff between Beijing and internet giant Google over censorship .
The state - run Xinhua news agency cited the defence ministry as saying the suspension was due to the " severe harm " of the arms sales on relations between the US and China .
Included in the proposed arms deal are two Osprey mine - hunting ships , 60 Black Hawk helicopters , missiles , machine guns and ammunition , night vision gear , radar equipment and information technology .
" This is definitely going to cause considerable tension in the relationship , " a US official who has served in China told the Guardian .
The official added that relations between the US , China and Taiwan had improved in the past two years under Taiwan 's president , Ma Ying - jeou .
Officially the US downplayed the threat to the bilateral relationship , claiming that the sale would not alter the balance in the region .
The sale indicates that Barack Obama will continue the US policy of maintaining the diplomatic status quo between China and Taiwan , while providing the island with weapons to deter Chinese military action .
In 2008 , for example , the Pentagon announced the sale of $ 6.4bn in aircraft and missiles .
" We have worked through these issues before , " a state department official said .
" We will work through them again .
" This is a clear demonstration of the commitment that this administration has to provide Taiwan the defensive weapons it needs .
We think this action contributes to maintaining security and stability across the Taiwan Strait . "
The announcement comes in an unusually tense period between China and the US , which maintain close economic links .
Last week the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , called on Beijing to investigate claims by Google of a co-ordinated attack on the email accounts of rights activists that originated in China .
She likened Chinese online censorship to the rise of communist Europe , warning that an " information curtain " threatened to descend on the world unless action to protect internet freedom was taken .
Beijing called the charges baseless and said Clinton 's remarks hurt the relationship between the two countries .
With the miserable state of the US economy contributing to tension with China , America 's largest creditor nation , the US public and members of Congress are becoming restless for action on China 's rights record .
China and Taiwan have had an uneasy relationship since the founding of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 .
Taiwan maintains significant defence capabilities , in large part due to decades of arms purchases from the US .
Its primary military mission remains defence against aggression from China , which has not renounced the use of force against to the island .
The US recognises Beijing as the sole legal government but maintains significant unofficial links with Taipei .
The US does not support Taiwanese independence and opposes unilateral action by either side to alter the status quo .
Taiwan maintains an economic and cultural representative in Washington .
What if …
We stopped waiting for permission to be content and started working towards it ?
We spent less time thinking of what we ca n’t do and more time just doing things that make us come alive ?
We focused on loving ourselves first instead of trying to find love through others ?
We did n’t think it was bad when we felt down but instead recognized that it ’s part of the ebb and flow of life ?
We believed that each person we met could change the world ?
We used the resources we have wisely rather than trying to get more of what we do n’t need ?
We remembered the good things as much as we remember the bad things ?
We cried when we needed to and asked for help without feeling small ?
We looked at ways we could help other people instead of ways they can help us ?
We worried less and loved more ?
We thought about possibilities instead of necessities ?
We ’re more powerful than we ’ll ever understand ?
There are no easy , clear , or right answers to these questions ?
So here is the story .
It shall be brief .
I wanted to draw journal comics because it would force me to draw from life and I could focus on getting better at craft .
I wanted to take some time to get good at this , or at least get comfortable , so that I could make full on graphic novels .
Mission accomplished .
I have better skills and more confidence .
Most importantly of all I have all of you .
I finished my children ’s book and thanks to all your pre-orders I got it printed in time for this year ’s convention season .
Just after I got the book printed , I hung up my pencil for a while .
I have spent all of the time to now writing .
I now have my first actual graphic novel fully written and ready for pre-production .
I finished it about a month ago .
I have been sitting on it for a month while I catch up on some freelance gigs that have zapped my time .
Among them is an anthology entry for Red Stylo Media .
The anthology is called : “ Shakespeare Shaken ” .
It should be good .
I ’ll link when I know more .
The second big gig is the start of a new marching pre-season .
I will now be writing drum parts for a drumline .
While I am doing that I will be checking to make sure my script is worth making a full comic .
If it is worth it , I will then proceed with pre-production .
Pre-production for comics means gathering reference materials and making character sketches and location sketches .
After that , and once a lot of drumline writing is out of the way , I will begin with production proper .
The novel is divided into a few discrete chapters .
I plan on posting the novel on here one chapter at a time .
To break up the chapters I will have some journal comics between them .
A few funny things have happened here and I still want to share .
In the meantime , until I get some material polished and produced , this site is going to stay dark .
I plan on updating my art - blog site more often .
I would love it if you were to meet me there .
Join my facebook page or follow me on twitter , and you can see what I am up to there as well .
I will put out a blast on each of these outlets when I am ready to post material again .
My tentative deadline is to have the thing done and printed by Feb of next year .
Not sure how that will go .
Let ’s all hope together .

Eyes on the Street : San Francisco ’s First Green Bike Box Gets Bike Stencil
DPT crews reveal a brand new bike stencil .
Photos : Michael Rhodes
San Francisco ’s first green bike box can no longer be mistaken for just a car - sized strip of green paint : this morning , DPT crews stenciled in a bicycle symbol to indicate to cars that the green box on Scott Street at Oak is for bikes only .
In marked contrast to the pre-stencil bike box , the new stencil seemed to help most drivers understand that they ’re required to wait behind the box during red lights .
Only a few scofflaws ignored the bike box , often stopping behind it initially and then rolling into it – often with cell phones pressed against their ears .
The new stencil is the latest development in the ongoing saga of the Scott Street bike box , which started as a traffic stop line and bike stencil without green paint , and was then painted over in green last month when a partial lifting of the bicycle injunction allowed some experimental treatments .
At that point , the MTA did not paint in the stencil over the green paint , citing the need to collect before and after data on the traffic device since it ’s still experimental in California .
Judson
True , a spokesperson for the MTA , said the agency did four one - hour p.m. peak counts last month , and found that half of stopped vehicles were encroaching into the bike box .
Fifty - five percent of stopped cyclists were waiting in the bike box , and 30 percent were waiting in the crosswalk .
" We did go ahead and collect some data , and we felt like we had enough ‘ before ’ data to go ahead and install the symbol , " said True .
" We had planned to install it later in the month , but when we looked at the data we were getting and decided that was sufficiently informative , we went ahead and moved forward . "
This driver understood and obeyed the newly - updated bike box .
Volker Neumann , a cyclist who rides down Scott Street regularly , was pleased to see the bike stencil go in .
" Yay , " exclaimed Neumann , encountering the freshly - dried stencil .
" It ’s nice to finally see it official and not just have a bunch of rogue graffiti types put in their own version of it . "
While more drivers now seem to understand the bike box , the design still does n’t seem to be entirely intuitive for bicyclists , since the box does n’t extend to the bike lane .
True said the MTA was open to looking at other design modifications if the current configuration does n’t send a clear enough message to drivers and cyclists .
Even though dozens of cyclists passed through the busy Wiggle corridor on Scott immediately after DPT crews left , it took about 25 minutes after the paint dried for the first pair of cyclists to make use of the bike box , so a full Portland - style bike box , complete with a painted bike lane and additional signage , should be a logical next step in the evolution of the MTA ’s bike box experimentation .
The Scott Street green bike box , painted on December 3rd , was the first in California .
Long Beach installed a green bike box December 20th that more closely resembles the Portland bike boxes .
Some of the first cyclists to use the updated bike box .
Loaded up with bike stencils .
A ruling by the IRS will allow Citi to dodge a direct hit to tangible common equity while saving money on taxes .
A WaPo story today notes that the government ’s promise to sell its stake in Citigroup ’s common shares would have qualified as an “ ownership change , ” forcing the bank to reduce the value of its deferred tax assets . *
But the IRS said not to worry about it …
I wrote about the issue last month , mentioning the potential problem of an “ ownership change . ”
This news is a good opportunity to update deferred tax asset figures , which Reuters ’ Stephen Culp has arranged into the following nifty chart :
The chart is updated to include all the common equity that banks have estimated will be raised to repay TARP .
It does NOT include ADDITIONAL DTAs that will be created as part of that TARP repayment .**
The problem with including deferred tax assets in capital is that DTAs are only useful when you make money , but the point of capital is to be there when you do n’t .
Imagine declaring bankruptcy and asking the judge to let you pay off your credit card bills with tax loss carryforwards .
Luckily , bank regulators take account of this , sort of .
The measures of capital that they look at ( anything with “ tier 1 ″ in the name ) exclude most DTAs .
So that ’s good news .
— — ——
* For the really adventurous , here ’s a slideshow explaining section 382 limitations for deferred tax assets that result from ownership changes .
** My understanding is that some banks are buying back TARP preferred at a premium to book value .
This creates a loss for tax purposes , boosting DTAs .
Citi also generates a DTA , I believe , by ending its loss - sharing agreement with the government .
The House of Representatives has always been the stepchild .
With 435 members , it 's hard to remember all the players , let alone invite them all on TV .
The Senate , with only 100 members , each with a lot more power , usually basks in the attention .
This week , as President Obama courted members of the Senate Democratic Caucus on healthcare , House Democrats went public with long - festering resentments toward what some refer to as the Upper Chamber .
“ There is a growing sense that we ’re lifting more than our share , ” California Democrat Xavier Becerra told Politico .
“ Members are hoping the Senate will kick into gear because the public expects a lot more to get done . ”
Added Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern , “ Sometimes I get the feeling that some of those guys [ in the Senate ] just like to see their names in the paper and see their faces on TV . "
Virginia Democrat Tom Perriello accused the Senate of " dithering " and California Democrat Zoe Lofgren , who often presides over the House , added , “ If you just take a look at the number of bills we ’ve sent to the Senate and what they ’ve done , I do n’t know what they ’re doing with their time honestly . "
So it came as no surprise last week when Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised House freshmen that in 2010 she would not force them to vote on any controversial issues -- immigration , union protection , same - sex marriage -- unless the Senate goes first .
“ The speaker has told members in meetings that we ’ve done our jobs , ” one aide told the Hill newspaper .
“ Next year the Senate ’s going to have to prove what it can accomplish before we go sticking our necks out any further . ”
Virginia Democrat Gerry Connolly , who heads the freshman class , said Pelosi 's message was well received .
“ Freshmen , particularly , are not enamored of the idea of being asked to walk the plank on a controversial item if the Senate is not going to take any action , ” he said .

Is Google part of a conspiracy to keep the general public from learning about the “ Climategate ” scandal ?
Believers continue to point at the odd comings - and - goings of Climategate as a search suggestion on Google as a sign that the search engine is trying to foist its own political views about global warming on searchers .
Not so fast , conspiracy buffs .
Google Suggest & Climategate
Let ’s start with supposedly the most damning evidence first .
A system called Google Suggest automatically displays search topics that it believes you may be after , when you start typing any word .
So consider what happens when you start typing in the word “ climategate ” into Google :
In the screenshot above , when you get to the fourth letter in climategate — clim — rather than suggesting the full word “ climategate , ” Google instead suggests “ climate change ” at the top , then some other words and “ climate change facts ” at the bottom .
This screenshot was taken on Saturday around 1 pm Pacific Time .
At that time , even entering the entire word “ climategate ” would not get Google to suggest it .
Clearly Google has an agenda !
Then again , if Google Suggest is based on popular search topics , maybe Climategate is n’t that popular .
Perhaps that ’s why it ’s not showing .
Maybe .
But if that were the case , then what was happening earlier this week ?
Here ’s a screenshot from December 2 :
Notice in that , after typing in “ clim , ” you get a suggestion for “ climate gate scandal . ”
Three days later , that ’s gone .
And back at the end of November , we had various reports that typing in “ cli ” would bring up “ climategate ” itself , which currently does n’t show .
Official : Google Suggest Terms Come & Go
So what ’s up ?
When I asked Google about this previously , for my Of Climategate , Googlegate & When Stories Get Too Long story , I was told :
Google has not ever removed the query [ climategate ] or variations of the query from Google Suggest .
Google Suggest uses a variety of algorithms in order to come up with relevant suggestions while the user is typing .
We do remove certain clearly pornographic or hateful or malicious slur terms from Suggest .
That was n’t particularly satisfactory , as it did n’t address why something my show one day and disappear the next .
My best explanation was :
My assumption is that on one day , if a lot of people were searching for Climategate , then that might appear .
Then if queries dropped off , the suggestion might go away .
Then return again if more started searching again .
I ’m checking to see if I can get more clarification .
For this story , I did get a fresh statement :
Google suggestions are based on aggregate data including popular searches that have been entered on Google over time .
In addition , Toolbar shows queries that a user has typed before , which are retained on the user ’s machine .
It is perfectly normal for suggestions to appear for a short while , stop appearing , and then start appearing again .
Unofficial : Google ’s Flaky & Still Assumes Everyone Trusts It
OK , I ’m sure that ’s not going to please any cynics out there .
But I still do n’t believe Google is deliberately removing that term from Google Suggest .
Having covered Google since the company literally began , all I can offer you is the real explanation that I personally believe goes something like this :
We ’re kind of flaky about things at Google .
We have these algorithms that you ’d think should operate consistently , but they ’re not perfect .
So why ’s that term coming and going ?
We do n’t really know .
We ’d drill down into it , but we ’re kind of busy building cool things with Lego .
Plus , we do n’t really think it ’s that big of a deal .
Only crazy people would think we ’re really trying to manipulate people in this way , right ?
That ’s a typical Google failure .
No , it ’s not just crazy people .
It ’s people who have a general mistrust of any big organization .
And when you ’re dealing with a story where there ’s evidence of a concerted effort to suppress information , yeah , some people are going to get paranoid about how the biggest information dissemenator on the planet —
Google — is acting in relation to that .
So put away the Lego and spend some time ensuring that Google Suggest is n’t operating as if you simply throw dice each morning to decide what it will say .
Conspiracy Theorists , Meet Common Sense
Meanwhile , those of you with mistrust of Google over Climategate ?
Let ’s again use some common sense and examine just how well this supposed Google Suggest conspiracy is working .
First , what ’s happening with Google ’s competitors ?
Over at Yahoo , they have their own version of Google Suggest .
When I start typing , when I get to “ clim , ” Yahoo shows me this :
That ’s right , along with “ climate change , ” you now get “ climate gate . ”
Over at Bing , the same thing happens and faster , if you only enter “ cl ” :
Those are screenshots from today , but both Yahoo and Bing operated exactly as shown when I also looked on December 2 .
So kudos to them for consistency .
Kudos , I suppose , for getting a term suggested that I have no doubt is popular .
And if they both show Climategate as a suggestion but Google does n’t , perhaps that ’s a sign that Google is doing some editing ?
Forget Suggestions ; What About The Results ?
Perhaps .
But then again , who the hell cares what ’s suggested as a search ?
Seriously , think about it .
Do we think people who do n’t know about Climategate are being prevented from learning about it because it does n’t show when they start typing the letters of it ?
That makes absolutely know sense .
If you ’re typing Climategate into the search box , you already know about it .
So what happens in reaction to your search ?
Let ’s see :
Those are the results you get back for climategate on Google .
There are far more “ pro-Climategate ” than anti , with pro meaning those who view the leaked emails as evidence of a concerted effort to push global warming as being manmade despite evidence from some that this might not be the case .
If Google ’s trying to climatewash Climategate , why would n’t it skew the results you get when searching for it .
So much for those boffins at Google .
They ’re so busy building Lego that while they rigged the suggested queries , they failed to clear out any anti-global warming articles from the far more important search listings .
Speaking of global warming , if you ’re a believer that human activity is a cause of it , you ’re more likely to be searching for global warming as a search term than Climategate , are n’t you ?
So if there ’s a conspiracy to suppress opposition views , would n’t you do it for searches on global warming ?
Let ’s start first with what Google suggests for that :
As you can see , we get “ global warming ” ( which could be pro or con on the issue of whether it is “ real ” or not ) , “ global warming facts ( again , pro or con ) and “ global warming hoax . ”
Not too smart , Google .
You ’ve allowed those searching for global warming to understand that this might all be a big hoax .
But what about the actual results ?
What do you get on a search for global warming ?
Is there a climatewash there ?
Those are the top results today .
In the news section , you ’ve currently got one article featured on the Climategate scandal saying that it does not disprove global warming , followed by one about global warming skeptics and one that seems against global warming concerns .
That ’s a fairly diverse mix .
Further below , we get Wikipedia , the US EPA site and GlobalWarming.org , which is an anti-global warming site :
Match Counts That Mean Nothing
My favorite part in all this is how Climategate proponents keep pointing at the number of results you get on Google , versus global warming , as somehow proof of how “ popular ” Climategate is .
Let ’s take James Delingpole of the Daily Telegraph , who wrote earlier this week :
Meanwhile at Telegraph blogs , the site that popularised the word Climategate – 25 million Google hits so far – there are those who just ca n’t see what the fuss is about .
I ’d previously written in Of Climategate , Googlegate & When Stories Get Too Long about how those counts are largely meaningless , but now let me spell it out in excruciating detail .
In a search for climategate on Google , I currently get “ about 30,700,000 ” matches , even more than what Delingpole found :
In contrast , a search for global warming brings up “ about 10,600,000 ” matches :
So Climategate is three times more popular than global warming !
No .
See , as I previously explained , searching for any word without putting a plus symbol in front of the word ( or phrase ) means that you are searching for that word PLUS other words that Google considers related to it .
A search for + climategate brings back “ about 2,260,000 ” matches :
A search for +” global warming ” brings back “ about 9,840,000 ” matches :
In short , the count for global warming hardly changes but the count for climategate plunges from 30 million to 2 million .
What ’s going on ?
Again , I asked Google .
They know all the words that a broad search on Climategate would be matching .
However , Google did n’t seem that interested in itemizing these , saying :
Google ’s calculation of the total number of search results is only an estimate .
We understand that a ballpark figure is valuable , and by providing an estimate rather than an exact account , we can return quality search results faster .
Blah , blah , blah .
Translation :
Yeah , we ’ve known for years that our counts make no sense , but we ’ve got better things to do than to spend time improving the counts we show .
I mean , check out this cool Lego thing we built !
Besides , only crazy people every pay attention to things like match counts .
Is my translation too mean ?
No .
Go back to 2006 , and Google ’s idiotic counts were the top item in my 25 Things I Hate About Google piece .
I wrote :
Climategate Or Climate At The Golden Gate
That ’s OK , Google .
No worries if you ca n’t be bothered to explain the crappy search counts that you put out , which make no sense and which are being quoted by major newspapers to prove how popular Climategate is .
I ’ll do it myself , to see if I can figure out why that Climategate count changes so dramatically .
Consider this search :
That ’s where I searched for + climate + gate - climategate - “ climate - gate ” , which means , in order :
Find all pages that say “ climate ” on them and also say “ gate ” on them then
Remove all pages that have the word “ climategate ” on them
Remove all pages that have the word “ climate - gate ” on them
What do I find ?
I find 10 million pages out there that have the words “ climate ” and “ gate ” on them but not “ climategate ” or “ climate - gate . ”
Pages that would have existed before Climategate was dubbed Climategate .
That ’s a lot of pages .
Here ’s one about the climate near the Golden Gate :
Here ’s one about climate and automatic gate openers :
My assumption is that when you search for “ climategate ” on Google without a + symbol in front of it , you ’re pulling back some false matches like this .
Now I ’d try to show this .
I ’d like to go through those 30 million results for “ climategate ” and show how some of these false matches are included .
But if I try to drill into the results , I run into the standing problem that major search engines only let you see the first 1,000 results :
In that example , I ’d gone as far as I could , to result 822 , then chose the show omitted results option and then could n’t get past 924 ( over at Bing , I ca n’t get past .
As I said , no major search engine will show more than 1,000 results for any query , even if they have more .
Not Google , not Yahoo , not Bing .
But Google should have let me view to at least the full 1,000 ( at Bing , I could n’t get past 818 ) .
Still , even if I could get there , the ranking system will still rank pages with “ climategate ” on them above those that must have the words “ climate ” and “ gate ” somewhere on them .
Want Popularity Figures ?
Meet Google Trends
Let me be clear .
I DO think Climategate is a popular search topic right now .
I just think those who feel there ’s a Google conspiracy to suppress it are grabbing on to whatever facts they can find ( Google Suggest , Google match counts ) even if those are the wrong tools to document popularity of a search topic .
Folks , you want Google Trends .
That shows you the volume of searches that have happened over time .
As topics get popular , there are more searches .
Let ’s see how climate change , global warming , climategate and climate - gate all rank against each other using Google Trends :
You can interact with the chart above yourself here .
It shows that for all the years that Google has search data that it shares , for all regions of the world , that global warming is the more popular term than climate change .
It also shows that climategate is more popular than climate - gate .
So , in a face - off , how does global warming fare against climategate ?
Here ’s a look for the last 30 days :
Climategate has about 40 % of the search popularity of global warming , I ’d say — which is a lot .
There ’s no doubt people are interested in this aspect of the global warming debate .
Interestingly , Sweden and Australia top exhibit the most interest in it :
That brings me back to Google Suggest .
It ’s different for different countries .
In Sweden , while Climategate is n’t suggested , “ climate scam ” is :
In Australia , “ climate change skeptics ” is suggested :
In Summary
Overall , there ’s no doubt that Climategate is a popular topic , no doubt .
However , those who want to demonstrate how popular would be better advised to use Google Trends , rather than the far less dependable web search results counts .
As for Google , I ’ll wish again that they ’d provide better results counts .
I ’d also hope for more consistency on how , when and why it shows suggested terms .
Finally , I ’m still hoping that Google will show precisely what it searched for when it looks for more than the word you ’ve entered .
Last year , Google grew more transparent about how it customizes results but failed to deal with broad searching as part of that .
Clearly , that type of disclosure is overdue .
Nikita Filatov knocked down by Darcy Verot ( Photo © boeboda.ru )
NHL Blue Jackets forward Nikita Filatov , playing on a loan basis for CSKA of the KHL , was knocked down by Darcy Verot of Vityaz Chekhov in Monday ’s game between Vityaz and CSKA .
After the famous bench - clearing fight Vityaz , a team having an enormous for the KHL amount of tough guys , did n’t fight at all .
There were rumors that players were told not to fight in order to calm down fans .
The KHL even warned Vityaz to exclude the team from the league in case of another cancelled game .
The peace did n’t last long as on Monday Darcy Verot knocked down youngster Nikita Filatov with a cheap shot to the head and got a game misconduct .
Here is the video of Verot ’s cheap shot on Filatov :
The phone does n't really have an official name , though it 's obviously being referred to as the Google Phone , and both its user agent string ( browser identifier ) and EXIF data on pictures taken on the device identify it as the " Nexus One , " which we take to be a code name for the phone ( it 's also a reference to a line of replicants in the film Blade Runner ) .
Some shots identify the device as " Phone 88 , " apparently an earlier code name .
It is highly unlikely it will be released to the public as the Nexus One , in our opinion .
The phone was given to Google employees at an all - hands meeting on Friday , December 10th .
The story broke when a number of Googlers tweeted about the phone .
Google posted on its blog that it was experimenting with " eating its own dogfood " on the Android front by giving employees " around the globe " a device to test .
There have been zero -- zero -- official statements about Google selling the device to retailers or directly to consumers .
There is a Wall Street Journal article which claims that this is the strategy Google is headed in , but the post contains a number of poorly sourced and suspect facts , so we say take it with a major grain of salt .
Other reports say " what if " and " could . "
That does n't make it so .
As of right now , the only way to get this phone is to work for Google .
The phone itself appears to be the HTC Dragon / Passion ( with at least the specs of the Bravo , which looks to be a variant of the other models ) .
All are Snapdragon - based phones with a 3.7 - inch AMOLED displays , 5 megapixel cameras , and no physical keyboards .
There have been rumors ( or fact , as stated in the aforementioned WSJ report ) that this phone runs a " real " or different version of Android .
Based on the pictures we 've seen , this is inaccurate .
It appears to run a version of Android that looks nearly identical to the version currently found on the Droid ( 2.0.1 ) --
Google 's latest , most official device .
The version number we 've heard is Android 2.1 , which would not be a drastic departure from 2.0 .
There are rumors that if sold , the device will be available unlocked and able to function on both AT&T and T - Mobile 3G bands .
A source tells us that they have spoken with someone with first - hand knowledge , and this is the case , despite earlier rumors that it would only function using T - Mobile 's 3G network .
And now , some philosophical perspective on what this device could mean , depending on how it ends up coming to market .
As we said , there is currently a theory floating around that the Google Phone will be sold directly by Google to consumers , or by the company to retailers and carriers .
If that is the case , it should cause a real splintering of the Open Handset Alliance , and could also be a sign that Google is moving away from its " all in " mentality demonstrated at the birth of Android .
Positioning itself as the purveyor of the " real " Google Phone , while controlling distribution of both hardware and software for that device could be hugely disruptive to its current strategy of ' one platform , many devices ' ( clearly taken from the Windows Mobile handbook ) .
A move to full control over its ecosystem and hardware in this way certainly calls to mind something closer to Apple 's strategy , though it is still confusing as to why Google would make this move given the relative success and growth of Android worldwide .
Our guess would be the pressures to homogenize the experience and give developers a single path to app creation may now seem more logical to the company ; it 's worked beautifully for their biggest rival .
What everyone seems to be ignoring is the fact that Google has created two other " Google Phones " in the past ; the Dev Phone 1 ( shock , an unlocked phone that Google sold online ! ) , and the Ion .
Both were " Google " phones , both were given out to employees early on , and both were built by HTC .
They also both went on to become " with Google " devices , and it 's entirely possible that the Nexus One is the next generation of those phones .
Given the fact that there is currently no developer device with specs similar to Android 's current high water mark ( the Droid ) , seeing a new dev phone with a faster CPU , newer version of Android , and higher resolution screen actually makes perfect sense .
If we were the betting type , we 'd say you were going to see this phone come to market much in the way the myTouch and G1 did -- as official , Google branded devices .
Google Phones , if you will .
Regardless , all we know of this phone and Google 's strategy behind it has been built largely atop rumors .
The phone clearly exists , and some employees clearly have it , but as to what the long term positioning will be , Google has been 100 percent silent -- a point to note when reading articles claiming that this device is " confirmed " as being sold by Google .
There is no evidence of that .
For now , stay tuned -- we 'll have more info as we get it !
Peter Kafka over at All Things Digital says that T - Mobile is now on - board to sell this device as an unsubsidized , unlocked phone through its retail channels ( he claims the big G first went to Verizon , but was turned down ) .
That does n't really make a lot of sense if the phone does indeed work on both T - Mobile and AT&T 3G networks .
We can't see what 's in it for T - Mobile in that scenario , unless this were 3G only on its network , like ... previous Google dev phones .
We can't help but feel there 's a crucial piece of this puzzle still missing -- here 's hoping we get that info soon .
A tipster who has played with phone has some interesting tidbits about the new version of Android .
Our source says that the app tray has been changed , and that instead of scrolling through icons , it now " flips " to a new page with a " 3D tinge . "
We 're also told that it 's fast -- faster than the Droid .
One disappointing note : our tipster says there 's no multitouch to be found in the browser ...
AKA , no pinch to zoom .
Today is the birthday of Linus .
Although that 's essentially a private event for him , there 's an interesting historical link to the creation of the Linux kernel , too .
As is well known , before he started writing Linux , Linus coded on a Sinclair QL , a brilliant if rather bizarre system that was based on a cut - down version of the Motorola 68000 chip used in the Amiga , Atari ST , Apple Lisa and Macintosh .
Linus was prepared to put up with the limitations of that chip because it offered multi-tasking – and hence the possibility of some advanced programming .
It was for similarly rigorous reasons that he avoided buying a PC for some time : he disliked the underlying architecture of Intel 's chips .
But when the 80386 came out , Linus finally succumbed , and at the end of 1990 , decided to buy a PC .
The only problem was finding the funds to pay for it .
One source was a grant from the Finnish government .
This was actually a student loan meant for general living costs during his time at university , rather than specifically for buying computers , but Linus not unreasonably felt that a PC was an indispensable item for a student studying computing science , and hence a permitted expense .
He finally paid off that debt in November 1992 .
To this student loan , Linus added what he termed “ Christmas money ” .
As anyone who has a birthday very near Christmas will tell you , such “ Christmas money ” almost invariably includes money for the birthday bundled in too , so it 's likely that some funds for the PC arrived in the form of birthday presents .
Significantly , Linus wasted no time in buying the new computer after Christmas – and hence his birthday .
As he told me in 1996 : “ I remember the first non-holiday day of the New Year I went to buy a PC . ”
The specification is rather sobering :
386 , DX33 , 4 Megs of RAM , no co-processor , 40 Megs hard disc
Having acquired the hardware , Linus then had to wait for the software he wanted – Tanenbaum 's Minix operating system .
This was one reason why he had finally opted for the PC : Tanenbaum 's Unix - like system had been ported to the 80386 , and ran quite quickly on it , as Linus discovered during his university studies , which whetted his appetite for this educational tool .
Minix may have been fast on the PC but it was painfully slow in arriving .
In his first published interview , in Linux News , Linus recalled what exactly he got up to in the meantime :
As it turned out , Minix was n't available in Finland ( at least I was n't able to find it easily ) , so while I got my machine on January 5th 1991 ( easy date to remember due to the monthly payments :-) , I was forced to run DOS on it for a couple of months while waiting for the Minix disks .
So Jan -Feb was spent about 70 - 30 playing " Prince of Persia " and getting aquainted with the machine .
When Minix finally arrived , I had solved " PoP " , and knew a smattering of 386 machine code ( enough to be able to get the machine into protected mode and sit there looping ) .
So I installed Minix ( leaving some room for " PoP " on a DOS partition ) , and started hacking .
Getting Minix was n't altogether a pleasant experience : the keyboard bindings were wrong , and it did n't exactly act like the suns I was used to ( ugghh .
I * hate* the bourne shell for interactive work ) .
The keyboard was easy to correct ( although I did n't like the Minix keyboard driver code ) , and applying Bruce Evans ' 386 - patches made the system a bit more " real " .
So somewhere around March - 91 , I had a 386 system running Minix - 386 , and I was able to install awb 's gcc -1.37.1 port .
After that , I was able to port bash to the resulting mess , and things looked a bit better .
I also spent my time generally fooling around ( porting gcc - 1.40 and various other programs ) , and kept on learning about the 386 while doing so ( writing small boot - disks that would set up a protected mode environment and print out various inane messages ) .
In that interview , Linus modestly described the genesis of Linux thus :
" Linux " did n't really exist until about August - 91 - before that what I had was essentially just a very basic protected mode system that had evolved from a glorified " Hello world " program into a even more glorified terminal emulator .
Linux stopped for quite a while at the terminal emulator stage : I played around with Minix , and used my protected mode program to read news from the univerity machine .
No down / upload , but it did a fair vt100 emulation , and did it by using two tasks which communicated from keybodard -> modem and modem -> screen .
By mid-summer - 91 , " Linux " was able to read the disk ( joyful moment ) , and eventually had a small and stupid disk driver and a simple buffer cache .
So I started out trying to make a filesystem , and used the Minix fs for simple practical reasons : that way I already had a file layout I could test things on .
After some more programming ( talk about glossing things over ) , I had a very simple UNIX that had some of the basic functionalities of the real thing : I could run small test - programs under it .
By that time I looked around for some standards texts - I decided early on that I did n't want to write the user - level programs , and that in order to easily port things I 'd either have to make the new system compatible with Minix ( ugghh ) or follow some other kind of standard .
What I wanted was a POSIX guide , not so much to be 100 % posix , but in order not to do anything really stupid I 'd regret later .
My quest for the posix standards failed , as the posix standard committee sells the standard to feed itself as I found out , but I did get a good pointer to the ( then very alpha and unsupported ) GNU libc.a , which had an early manual accompanying it .
The manual was of some help , but the biggest help was actually the contact to the person who pointed it out to me : arl@sauna.hut.fi .
He was / is the organizer of the pub / OS subdirectory at nic.
funet.fi , and was interested in giving Linux a home at nic .
Back then , I was only idly thinking about making my system available ( and I had no real time - table ) , but arl happily created a pub / OS / Linux subdirectory at nic , and thus also gave the system it 's name .
I was n't really ready for a release yet , so the directory contained just a README for about a month ( " this directory is for the freely distributable Minix clone " or something like that ) .
Arl probably thought the project would n't come to anything .
I think we can safely say that “ arl ” - Ari Lemmke , a member of the Helsinki University staff – was a little mistaken on that point .
It 's truly extraordinary to contemplate that Linus 's “ glorified " Hello world " program ” is now running nearly 90 % of the world 's top supercomputers .
And at the other end of the scale , it is making huge in - roads into the smartphone market , which means that one day there may be billions of people with the Linux kernel in their pocket .
Indeed , it is difficult to imagine what the world would be like today had Linus not bought that PC in 1991 with his Christmas and birthday money .
There could hardly be a better time than today to thank him for Linux , his amazing gift to us , and to wish him many happy returns .

If you read this , I bet you know one or two things about procrastination .
I do too .
We all do .
Procrastination is a natural phenomenon and even the most purposeful person is tempted to put off what she / he can do today until tomorrow .
There is always a « good reason » for it , especially when an important change in your life is at stake .
" before " and " after " images of yourself
Make a list of your excuses for not taking action on what you would like to accomplish .
Then read it aloud : does it make you feel uneasy ?
Good !
Discomfort is a sign that deep inside you know that nothing justifies your inaction and that you are ready for change .
Rewrite your excuses with a confident statement .
For instance , if one of the excuses on your list is « I ’m not ready » , you can write : « I ’m not ready , this is not the perfect moment , but then the perfect moment may never come , so let ’s take action today , before adding ‘ it ’s too late ’ on my list of excuses .
» Visualize yourself as an excuse - maker and as an excuse - killer .
Try to get inspiration from your list of excuses and draw your self - portrait as an excuse - maker .
Do n’t try to make a work of art , just draw a sketch expressing clearly your fear of commitment .
Do you like what you see ?
No ?
Great !
Now read again your list of confident statements and reshape your self - portrait as an excuse - maker into your self - portrait as an excuse - killer and a doer .
Again , this is not art .
I find my self - portraits quite ludicrous but , at least , in the second one I stand up !

I find my self - portraits quite ludicrous but , at least , in the second one I stand up !
Make a vision board of your excuses .
You can search for symbolic images on the Internet ( or in some magazines ) .
I , for my part , chose to visualize my three main recurrent excuses .
I think the images I found speak for themselves , but feel free to add captions or a collage of words .
Click to enlarge
Finally , make a vision board of self - confidence , showing symbolic images that are the opposite of the ones you chose for your vision board of excuses .
You can keep your two vision boards and your two self - portraits side by side ( close to the vision board of your goals , if you already made one ) and contemplate them as « before and after » images of yourself .
Which they are .
Each one of these excuses is fear of commitment in disguise .
A sly hydra , as I see it , who lures you into a well of unproductive exhaustion .
To beat the hydra , you first need to discover her many faces .
This is much simpler than it sounds : all you have to do is follow self - growth experts ’ advice and write down what you would like to accomplish , then write down your excuses for not taking action and challenge the reasoning behind each of them .
But you can do more : create a visual representation of your excuses and of yourself as an excuse - maker .
Then transform these visions into visions of action and self - confidence .
You can use vision boards , virtual galleries , drawing software , or just pen and paper , plus some glue .
Here are my method and my vision boards and sketches , based on my « favorite » excuses : « I do n't have enough strength for a fresh start » , « I do n’t know where to start » , « I ’m too old for this » .
Decade Debate : 6 Greatest Sports Rivalries
The word rivalry is defined as “ competition for the same objective or superiority in the same field . ”
Rivalries exist in all facets of life , but they are no more apparent than in the world of sport .
With the end of the decade looming , here are the six most intense rivalries of the last ten years .
6. Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson Competition between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson may not produce the mystique that Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus once did , but their rivalry has been exciting nonetheless .
Without Tiger Woods , professional golf ’s popularity would be a mere morsel of what it is today .
The man has won 14 majors , holds his own tournament ( the AT&T National ) , designed two beautiful courses , is the only golfer with his own video game , and garners public intrigue on the same level as world leaders .
Still , his status as figurehead of professional golf would n’t have any merit without some stiff competition .
Enter Phil Mickelson , Tiger ’s only adversary with any staying power .
When Mickelson won the 2000 Buick Invitational , he also officially ended Tiger ’s streak of consecutive tournament wins at six .
Over the years , Mickelson would hire Butch Harmon , Tiger ’s former coach , and joke about Tiger ’s use of “ inferior equipment . ”
Still , their rivalry always remained amicable , even as Phil won his first major in ’ 04 ( The Masters ) , the PGA Championship in ’05 another Green Jacket in ’06 .
During this year ’s Masters , Tiger and Mickelson were finally paired together in a major event .
Trudging down the final back nine at Augusta , the two golfers put on a show that thankfully lived up to the hype .

5. Lakers vs. Spurs
These two Western Conference giants won seven of the 10 titles in the ‘00s .
Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant won three consecutive titles to start the decade , and then Kobe won one “ on his own ” in ’09 ( though Pau Gasol might have something to say about that ) .
Meanwhile , led by Tim Duncan ( arguably the greatest power forward ever to play the game ) , the Spurs won the NBA championship in ’03 , ’05 and ’07 .
One of these two franchises represented the West in every season save for ’ 06 ( Dallas ) .
The Spurs and Lakers faced each other five times in the playoffs , and the winner went on to the Finals every time .
Not only did this rivalry feature a great matchup between Duncan and Shaq , but Manu Ginobili served as a great foil for Kobe Bryant while the speedy Tony Parker and the physical Derek Fisher were a study in contrasts .
This rivalry reached its pinnacle during the 2004 Playoffs when Fisher hit an impossible buzzer - beater to win Game 5 on the road and swing the series .

4. Colts vs. Patriots
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the best NFL rivalry of the decade is that it ’s brand new .
While the Colts and Patriots have seemingly battled forever , the rivalry is still in its infancy compared to great battles between the Cowboys and Giants , Cowboys and 49ers , and Bears and Packers .
It was n’t until 2003 when Peyton Manning ’s Colts went into Foxboro in the AFC Championship Game and lost to Tom Brady ’s Patriots , 24 - 14 , that football fans said , “ Hey – this could be one hell of a rivalry . ”
The theme of this rivalry grew quickly : New England had Peyton ’s number .
Not only did they beat him ’ 03 , but they also produced victories in Week 1 of ’04 and in the Divisional Round of ’04 before Peyton finally rose to the challenge and knocked off New England in Foxboro in Week 9 of the ’05 season .
But of course , everyone remembers the 2006 AFC Championship Game when Manning had to rally the Colts to a 38 - 34 win ( the game featured four lead changes in the final seven minutes ) to catapult his team to a Super Bowl victory against the Bears two weeks later .
And now that Peyton has proven that he can overcome Brady and the Pats , Bill Belichick breathed some life into the rivalry last week when he inexplicably went for it on a 4th and 2 from his own 28 - yard line when his team was up 34 - 28 late in the fourth quarter .
The rest is history : The Pats ’ offense was stopped cold , Manning and the Colts punched it in and a new storyline in the rivalry was born .
Pats / Colts features two of the best teams of the decade , run by two of the best quarterbacks in NFL history .
What else do you need ?

3. Federer vs. Nadal
For the first time in nine years , tennis made the cover of Sports Illustrated .
It was to commemorate the 4 hour and 48 minute Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal .
Hailed as the greatest tennis match of all time , Nadal would emerge the victor , ending Federer ’s streak of five consecutive Wimbledon championships .
After Pete Sampras retired , Federer quickly took a stranglehold on the sport , winning multiple Grand Slams .
In 2005 , a young Spaniard with a speedy serve and a stupefying backhand became the French Open champion .
From this point on , Nadal and Federer would enter the most interesting rivalry between two athletes in the past decade .
Rivalries come to life on the center stage and these two constantly manage to meet , as if ordered by the fates .
They have met a record seven times in a Grand Slam final .
Until Fed ’s loss to Martin Del Potro at the 2009 U.S. Open , all of their losses in Grand Slam finals had been to each other .
Although tennis welcomed Federer with open arms , the sport needed Nadal for the sake of competition .
From 2005 to 2008 , Nadal defeated Federer in the finals at the French Open , depriving the Swiss of a Career Grand Slam ( Fed would later capture the title in 2009 ) .
Nadal has run into Federer in each of his title runs – five times in the final .
To put everything in perspective , the two have won 17 of the last 19 Grand Slams .
Now that ’s a rivalry .
— Christopher Glotfelty
2. Duke vs. UNC
In college hoops , the best rivalry of the ‘00s is the best rivalry of all time – Duke vs. North Carolina .
The two schools are located a mere eight miles apart and that proximity breeds pure contempt .
The Blue Devils dominated for the first half of the decade , winning 12 of 14 head - to - head matchups from ’00 to ‘ 05 , a national championship in ’01 and ACC regular season titles in ’00 , ’01 , ’04 and ’06 .
The Tar Heels ’ resurgence coincided with the arrival of Roy Williams in ’03 .
Since ‘ 05 , North Carolina has won seven of nine head - to - head matchups .
They have also won two national championships ( ’05 and ’09 ) and five ACC titles ( ’01 , ’03 , ’07 , ’08 and ’09 ) .
More recently , Roy Williams added fuel to the fire by signing the top prep recruit Harrison Barnes out from under Mike Krzyzewski ’s prominent nose .
With both coaches entrenched in great programs , this rivalry shows no signs of letting up .
These two teams hate each other , and that ’s just the way we like it .
— John Paulsen
1. Red Sox vs. Yankees
The Red Sox and Yankees certainly made a strong argument this decade for keeping their status as one of the greatest rivalries in sports history .
What has transpired over the past 10 years between these two clubs ca n’t be summarized in just one paragraph .
But damn it , we ’ll try : Yankees hand the Red Sox their worst home loss ever , 22 - 1 ; Carl Everett breaks up Mike Mussiana ’s perfect game at Fenway ; Larry Lucchino labels the Yankees the “ Evil Empire ” ; Pedro Martinez … Karim Garcia … Don Zimmer tossed on his face ; “ Aaron BLEEPING Boone ! ” ; A - Rod is heading to Boston … no wait , the Yankees ; Dave Robert ’s steal ; Jason Varitek vs. Alex Rodrgiez ; David Ortiz ’s walk - off single ; Curt Schilling ’s bloody sock ; Boston ’s improbable comeback from down 3 - 1 ; Red Sox Nation is born ; Gary Sheffield ’s cap is knocked off by a Boston fan ; Johnny Damon is a traitor ;
The Yankees five - game sweep ; Roger Clemens chooses the Yankees over the Sox ; The Mitchell Report … That ’s a lot of great history and memorable moments between these two teams in just 10 years .
All told , the Red Sox and Yankees have accounted for four of this decade ’s 10 World Series winners and six of the 10 AL Pennant winners .
These two storied franchises absolutely loathe each other , and it makes for some great storylines . —

In interview with Channel 4 News , young woman says babies and young children are ' sold to order ' to US nationals
A young Mexican woman who escaped from human traffickers has told US special agents how she witnessed babies and children being " sold to order " to US citizens .
America 's Department of Homeland Security in Washington says the girl , known only as Maria , had " significant ~ information " and possessed a " remarkable memory " of her experiences inside the gang .
In an interview with Channel 4 News , to be broadcast tonight , the teenager tells of a cross - border trade in babies and young children , where Mexican and US gangs worked together to supply a demand in the United States .
As a result of the interview , US officials and Mexican authorities have begun an investigation into the alleged trafficking .
Maria says she was 16 when she was lured into the gang by a man on the streets of the Mexican border town of Ciudad Juárez .
Since the 1990s , thousands of women have disappeared from the town .
Hundreds of bodies bearing signs of rape and sexual mutilation have been dumped on waste ground in the city ; thousands more have never returned .
In 2009 , 55 teenage girls vanished in the town , which has been gripped by violence as two drug cartels fight a lethal turf war over cocaine smuggling routes into the US .
Maria , who was in hiding when she talked to Channel 4 News , said she had been given presents and promised a job in an office by the gang member but was instead drugged and raped and sold to men .
In late December , US special agents flew the teenager to the US for a full interview .
Describing what the gang did to one girl who tried to escape , she said : " They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over her .
One of the men told me , ' If you do n't do as I say , I will do the same to you . '
I wanted to look away – but they did n't ' let me .
" Even though the girl was on fire , they kept hitting her .
They were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing .
They burned her alive . "
Maria , which is not her real name , said the gang had held young women in a house on the Mexican border until they were sold to the US as sex slaves .
But she said they also dealt in children , and told of one occasion when the gang was contacted by a woman in New York .
" She said she needed a seven - year - old girl and a nine - year - old boy – and she needed them in three days , " Maria quoted the woman as saying .
Maria told special agents the gang would prowl the streets of poor areas looking for children .
" They stole the children , " she said .
" One of the gang members took a six - year - old kid .
I had to look after him for three hours .
He told me he wanted to see his mummy .
Then I started crying .
I said : ' I do n't think you 're ever going to see your mummy again . '
All he kept saying was , ' I want to see my mummy . ' "
Maria , who escaped after a gang member left her alone in a house , says children were often around .
But not for long .
" I saw the Americans taking kids , " she said : " a four - year - old and another boy .
He barely walked .
He was only about two years old .
They took them to New York . "
The US state department estimates that more than 20,000 young women and children are trafficked across the border from Mexico each year .
But conviction rates remain low .
Mexico 's attorney general , Arturo Chaves , has been accused of failing to do enough to bring human traffickers to justice , he has insisted the country is " definitely focusing " on the issue .
Maria has been told she may have to give evidence against the gang if they are caught .
It is something she says she is determined to do .
" Women are sold .
They are abducted , bought and even killed by these men .
If these men are ever found , jail wo n't be enough to make them pay for the way they have made us feel . "
Back from the Dead : Maria 's Story will be broadcast on Channel 4 News tonight , from 7 pm .

For most of the past 12 months , Paul Volcker was sitting on the policy sidelines .
He had impressive sounding job titles — member of President Obama ’s Transition Economic Advisory Board immediately after last November ’s election , and then head of the new Economic Recovery Advisory Board .
But the recovery board , and Mr. Volcker himself , has seldom met with the president .
Economic and financial sector policy , by all accounts , has been made largely by Tim Geithner at Treasury and Larry Summers at the White House , with help from Peter Orszag at the Office of Management and Budget and Christina Romer at the Council of Economic Advisers .
With characteristic wry humor , Mr. Volcker denied in late October that he had lost clout within the administration : “ I did not have influence to start with . ”
But that same front - page interview in The New York Times included a well - placed shock to the prevailing policy consensus .
Mr. Volcker , a legendary former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board with much more experience with Wall Street than any current policy maker , was blunt :
We need to break up our biggest banks and return to the basic split of activities that existed under the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 — one highly regulated ( and somewhat boring ) set of banks to run the payments system , and a completely separate set of financial entities to help firms raise capital ( and to trade securities ) .
This proposal is not just at odds with the regulatory reform legislation then ( and now ) working its way through Congress ; Mr. Volcker is basically saying that what the administration has proposed and what Congress looks likely to enact in early 2010 is essentially bunk .
Speaking to a group of senior finance executives , as reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday , Mr. Volcker made his point even more forcefully .
There is no benefit to running our financial system in its current fashion , with high risks ( for society ) and high returns ( for top bankers ) .
Most of financial innovation , in his view , is not just worthless to society – it is downright dangerous to our broader economic health .
Mr. Volcker seems to make substantive public statements only when he feels important issues are at stake .
He also knows exactly how to influence policy — he has not been welcomed in the front door ( controlled by the people who have daily meetings with the president ) , so he ’s going round the back , aiming at shifting mainstream views about what are “ safe ” banks .
Many smart technocrats listen carefully to what he has to say .
This strategy is partly about timing — and in this regard Mr. Volcker has chosen his moment well .
The economy is starting to recover , but this process is clearly going to take a while and unemployment will stay high for the foreseeable future .
At the same time , our biggest banks are making good money — mostly from trading , not much from lending to small business — and they are lining up to pay very big bonuses .
Not only is this contrast — high unemployment versus bankers ’ bonuses — annoying and unfair , it is also not good economics .
Bankers are , in effect , being rewarded for taking the risks that created the global crisis and led to huge job losses .
And they are being implicitly encouraged to do the same thing again .
The case for keeping big banks in their current configuration is completely lame .
Even if we are lucky enough to avoid another major crisis any time soon , the fiscal costs are enormous and coming right at you ( and your taxes ) .
Now that Paul Volcker has picked up his hammer , he will not lightly set it aside .
He knows how to sway the policy community and he knows how to escalate when they do n’t pay attention .
Expect him to pound away until he prevails .

Hello , I just released the small package explicit - iomodes - 0.1 : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/explicit-iomodes-0.1
It 's a wrapper around System .
IO that provides a Handle type which is parametrized with the IOMode it is in .
All operations on handles specify the needed IOMode which makes it a type error if you read from a write - only handle or if you write to a read - only handle for example .

A while back , having nothing better to do , I set about creating an image with all the RGB colours .
Yes , that ’s right .
All 16.8 million .
This little show of lunacy also turned out to be a great demonstration of the powers of the PNG image format :
The graphic , being 16.8 million pixels and 24 bit colour , ends up a modest 50 MB uncompressed .
The PNG format produces a 58.0 kB file .
Before you take look at this ( truly ) colourful piece of art , I warn those with slow computers .
Do n’t let the light download trick you – the graphic packs a nice punch to the CPU if you ’re on something like 400 MHz .
Update :
Per popular request , I have now created a version of the image with all pixels randomized …
( This time it ’s a bit more than 58 kB … )
And how about a little mathematical challenge :
What are the chances that , by randomizing the pixels in the ( randomized ) image above , I would get the ( ordered ) version at the top ? 🙂
Update 2 : I created another version of the ordered image , with the squares laid out along the diagonal of the image instead .
This one ( 78 kB ) did n’t compress quite as well as the first one ( 58 kB ) .
Edit 2011 - 06 - 30 : Was inspired by one of the comments to try and compress the 58 kB png file .
IzArc can create a 7z file which is only 705 bytes large !
That is 1/71436th the size of the uncompressed image in Tiff format .
That ’s pretty impressive stuff !
HARARE , Zimbabwe — Zimbabweans are hoping that 2010 will bring continued economic and political improvements , but there are already many signs that the new year will bring more of the same .
2009 was n’t the best of years but it was a huge improvement on 2008 .
For Zimbabweans there was one thing that stood out : a stable economy with zero inflation .
While there were cash shortages over the holiday , there was no repeat of the long lines at banks that made the festive season so miserable for many in recent years .
Nor were there the waves of abductions and human rights abuses that were common in the wake of 2008 ’s bloody poll .
While the state has been contriving cases against lawyers and civic activists , it has found the courts less sympathetic than in the past .
The winds of change , first articulated by British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1960 , are once again blowing across the land and there is a palpable sense in which President Robert Mugabe ’s repressive regime is doomed .
But it is not going without a fight .
It recently recruited professor Jonathan Moyo , a former minister of information , whose recriminatory prose and sinister threats have occupied column inches in the official press in past electoral contests .
Moyo is already applying his considerable talents to denouncing Morgan Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) despite the fact that it is now part of the government .
He has accused Tsvangirai , who is prime minister , of running a “ parallel government ” with the support of donors who do n’t want to see their funds falling into Mugabe ’s hands .
As 2009 drew to a close , Mugabe announced members of statutory commissions to regulate the media , protect human rights and run elections following lengthy negotiations with the MDC , as stipulated in last February ’s political agreement .
Civil society has complained that many of the appointees are staunch supporters of Mugabe ’s Zanu - PF party .
Among those appointed to the Human Rights Commission , for instance , is a former senior immigration officer who in 2003 was responsible for the abduction and deportation of a foreign correspondent in violation of three High Court orders .
It remains to be seen if these so - called independent bodies are given free rein .
“ While the coalition is still holding , ” the editor of the independent Financial Gazette wrote at the end of last year , “ it is all too clear that the marriage is not working .
It has been dogged by allegations and counter - allegations .
Should the wrangling in the unity government continue into the new year there wo n’t be much for Zimbabweans to hope for . ”
So while there has been real progress on the economic front with stabilization and investor interest , the political situation remains fragile as Mugabe battles to retain control .
“ The country ’s economy will continue to be held hostage by politics , ” the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president , Kumbirayi Katsande , warned last week .
Katsande should know .
He was arrested and interrogated by police recently when the company he heads , Nestle Zimbabwe , declined to purchase milk from a company , Gushungo Holdings , belonging to First Lady Grace Mugabe .
This followed protests in Europe that Nestle was doing business with properties seized from white farmers .
A compromise has since been reached .
But the impression remains that Nestle has been ordered to purchase its requirements from the first family .
Significantly , Mugabe is in breach of his own policy outlawing multiple - farm ownership .
He and his wife own six .
And elsewhere farm seizures persist .
A list published recently of land seizures in the Chegutu area southwest of Harare reveals the participation of judges , policemen and local land allocation officials .
Western governments have told Tsvangirai that he should ensure compliance with February ’s political agreement before asking for sanctions to be lifted .
With Mugabe ’s followers helping themselves to farm property , threats being made against international companies such as Nestle , and the attorney general continuing to bring trumped - up charges against MDC activists , a genuine democratic order seems still far off .
The case of Roy Bennett who Mugabe refuses to appoint to government because “ he is facing very serious charges ” is emblematic of the problems the MDC faces .
Bennett is deputy minister of agriculture - designate and seen by Zanu - PF as a threat to its land policies .
Mugabe said over the holiday that there was no urgency in completing negotiations between the parties while South African mediators try to set time - frames for a comprehensive deal .
He used the Copenhagen climate summit to grandstand in front of an influential audience , once again denouncing the West for hypocrisy .
But it has become clear that developing countries no longer see Mugabe as their spokesman .
And his entourage of over 60 including his wife , cabinet ministers and their wives raised questions about Zimbabwe ’s commitment to fiscal probity at a time when the country is holding out the begging bowl to donors .
Tsvangirai declined an invitation to attend .
So long as old habits die hard and Mugabe continues to be the chief obstacle to reform , the prospects for 2010 remain dim .

As you might expect from research sponsored by an index - fund company , it shows that active mutual - fund managers fail to outperform the market .
But at least it does so with pretty charts .
Here ’s what happens when you compare actual before - fees returns from mutual - fund managers ( the blue line ) with what you ’d expect if no managers had any skill at all , and the returns were simply distributed by chance ( the red line ) .
On the left hand side of the chart , you see actual fund managers significantly underperforming what you ’d expect by luck alone .
On the right hand side , however , it seems that if you ’re skilled at manager selection , there is a glimmer of hope that you might find a little bit of alpha .
Not a lot , but something statistically significant .
Unfortunately , all that alpha — and then some — gets eaten away by fees .
Here ’s the chart for after - fees returns :
The red line , remember , is the distribution of returns you ’d expect if all mutual - fund managers had an alpha of zero .
The blue line is actual returns .
Fama and French conclude :
For the vast majority of actively managed funds , true α is probably negative ; that is , the fund managers do not have enough skill to produce risk adjusted expected returns that cover their costs .
Which comes as no surprise , but it ’s still good to see some relatively solid empirics here .
Anybody wanting to make an intellectually - credible case in favor of investing in actively - managed mutual funds is going to have to attack this paper head - on .
One commonly hears the argument that the FDIC creates moral hazard in the banking system , because depositors are n't worried about the soundness of their banks .
I find this argument broadly dubious , since I have no idea how the vast majority of depositors could possibly be expected to have informed opinions on the soundness of their banks .
Moreover , during the Great Depression , local wealthy people -- who did have quite a lot of knowledge about the banks , and the local economies into which they lent -- got hammered along with the rest of America .
But this suggests that there is a different , more plausible form of moral hazard operating right now :
" A California Banker " writes to Mish , giving yet another reason why banks are n't lending :
If you 're a bank with a relatively healthy balance sheet with adequate capital , ( like us ) you want to maintain surplus capital in order to stay on the FDIC 's list of banks they can transfer the loans and deposits from a failed institution into .
This is a home run for the acquiring bank and far more of an instant benefit than any new lending .
The problem here is that healthy banks end up competing with each other to have the largest capital surplus and therefore the greatest chance of being anointed in this manner by the FDIC .
If everybody was lending , the FDIC would still have to place failed banks ' assets and deposits with someone .
But instead we get the opposite corner solution , where nobody is lending -- except , presumably , for banks which are close to failure and need all the interest income they can get .
I wonder whether the FDIC has anybody thinking about how to counteract this syndrome .
The FDIC system of liquidating banks by selling their assets to other banks seems to be fostering credit contraction .
On the other hand , so does letting a bunch of banks fail .
BRATISLAVA .
Tréner hokejistov Ján Filc má jasno v tom , koho chce na olympiáde do Vancouveri .
V jeho 23 - člennej nominácii na olympijský turnaj bol najväčším otáznikom tretí brankár .
Napokon zavolal Rastislava Staňu .
Zverejnenie nominácie znamenalo vyvrcholenie roku , v ktorom si Slovensko pripomína 80 .
výročie organizovaného hokeja .
„ Nominácia , ktorú som zvolil je to najideálnejšie , čo máme .
Tým však nechcem vylúčiť aj ostatných hráčov , s ktorými počítame na ďalšie turnaje , " povedal Filc .
" Do skupiny čakateľov spadá dvanás ť mien , konkrétne spomeniem hráčov z NHL Mareka Svatoša a Borisa Valábika . "
Na olympiáde si zahrajú všetci skúsení hráči , ktorí boli pri najväčších úspechoch Slovenska .
Otázny bol najmä post tretieho brankára .
Jaroslava Haláka s Petrom Budajom doplnil Rastislav Staňa .
" Najlep šie z brankárov sa ukazuje Jaroslav Halák , ktorý predvádza v NHL výborné výkony , čo ocenilo aj vedenie profiligy cenou pre najlep šieho hráča týždňa .
Peter Budaj je stabilnou dvojkou a ako tretieho gólmana sme nominovali Rasťa Staňu .
Ten sa uchytil v KHL , kde je stabilným členom Čerepovca , " dodal tréner .
Medzi obrancami sa objavili stabilné opory .
Lídrami budú skúsení kapitán tímu Zdeno Chára s Ľubomírom Višňovským .
V nominácii sú okrem nich ďalší traja z NHL .
Z Európy je vo výbere dvojica Martin Štrbák - Richard Lintner .
" O obrancoch z NHL nie je pochýb .
Z ostatných líg sme sa nakoniec rozhodli pre Martina Štrbáka , ktorý si stále udržuje výbornú výkonnosť a patrí medzi najlepších defenzívnych obrancov v KHL , a Richarda Lintnera , ktorý by zas mal byť podporou pre ofenzívu . "
Filc nominoval aj Miroslava Šatana , ktorý v tejto sezóne ešte nehral .
" S Mirom som hovoril včera večer .
Potvrdil mi , že určite začne hrať v prvom januárovom týždni .
Vyberá si medzi poslednými dvoma alternatívami zo zámoria a Európy . "
Do zostavy sa zmestili aj defenzívni špecialisti Tomáš Kopecký z Chicaga a Martin Cibák zo Spartaku Moskva .
Nechýba ani Žigmund Pálffy , ktorý sa vrátil do reprezentácie pred mesiacom .
" Do útoku sa nám črtá viacero alternatív .
Atraktívna je určita trojica Marián Hossa , Marián Gáborík a Pavol Demitra , ktorá na posledných hrách v Turíne predvádzala krásny hokej .
Jozef Stümpel si zas rozumie so Žigom Pálffym .
V prípravných zápasoch mal skvelé momenty Richard Zedník a aj Marcel Hossa , ktorý sa vypracoval na jedného z najlepších strelcov KHL . "
O bránenie by sa mali starať okrem spomínanej dvojice aj veterán Michal Handzuš a bojovník zo Spartaka Moskva Branko Radivojevič .
Predbežná nominácia SR na ženský hokejový turnaj na ZOH vo Vancouveri ( 13 . - 25 . februára 2010 ) :
Brankárky : Jana Budajová ( HC OSY Spišská Nová Ves ) , Monika Kvaková ( HC Slovan Bratislava ženy ) , Zuzana Tomčíková ( Bemidji State University / USA ) .
Obrankyne : Petra Babiaková ( MHK Martin ) , Iveta Karafiátová ( LHC Linköpings / Švéd. ) , Michaela Matejová ( SC Reinach / Švajč . ) , Barbora Brémová , Petra Országhová , Edita Raková ( všetky HC Slovan Bratislava ženy ) .
Útočníčky : Natalie Babonyová ( Toronto Crush / Kan. ) , Janka Čulíková ( HC OSY Spišská Nová Ves ) , Nikoleta Celárová , Nicol Čupková , Zuzana Moravčíková , Anna Džurňáková , Nikola Gápová , Mária Herichová , Petra Jurčová ( všetky HC Slovan Bratislava ženy ) , Jana Kapustová , Petra Pravlíková ( obe HC Tornado Moskva / Rus. ) , Martina Veličková ( Slavia Praha / ČR ) .
Slovenskí ú točníci s vekovým priemerom 32 rokov
Nomináciu slovenskej mužskej reprezentácie na hokejový turnaj na ZOH 2010 zrejme najviac vystihuje slovo - skúsenosť .
Vekový priemer 23 hráčov , ktorí sa ocitli v aktuálnom výbere trénera Jána Filca , bude počas olympijského turnaja 30,52 roka .
Rokmi nadobudnuté skúsenosti z vrcholných podujatí cítiť najmä v útočných formáciách , kde 13 hráčov vytvorí počas ZOH 2010 priemer 32 rokov .
O niečo mladší sú 7 obrancovia ( 29,3 roka ) a najmladší traja brankári ( 27,33 roku ) .
Najstarším hokejistom Slovenska figurujúcim na olympijskej súpiske je útočník Žigmund Pálffy , ktorý 5 . mája 2010 oslávi 38 . narodeniny .
Len o dva mesiace mladší je jeho dlhoročný " parťák " z ú toku Jozef Stümpel .
Na opačnej strane vekového oblúka sa nachádza obranca Andrej Sekera .
Benjamínok olympijského tímu bude mať 8 . júna 2010 iba 24 rokov .
Pre zaujímavosť , najmladším ú točníkom v kádri je súčasný topkanonier NHL Marián Gáborík , ktorý práve počas ZOH 2010 dovŕši 28 rokov .
Najstarším a najskúsenejším obrancom je Martin Štrbák .
Pätnásteho januára bude mať 35 rokov .
Dvadsaťtri slovenských hokejistov nominovaných v danom momente do Vancouveru odohralo v reprezentačnom drese dovedna 1310 zápasov a strelilo v nich 312 gólov .
Suverénne najlepším strelcom je Miroslav Šatan so 70 gólmi .
Najviac zápasov s dvojkrížom na hrudi má za sebou Štrbák - 146 .
Ako je známe , súčasn ý Filcov výber pre ZOH 2010 ešte nemusí mať konečnú podobu .
Vzhľadom na to , že od oznámenia nominácie do začiatku olympijského turnaja uplynie ešte šesť týždňov , tréneri jednotlivých reprezentačných tímov môžu do 15 .
februára urobiť menšie zmeny v kádroch , ak si to vyžiadajú zranenia alebo iné vážne dôvody .
SITA
At a time when the NFL is facing plenty of external criticism regarding the decision to play the Pro Bowl a week before the Super Bowl , the league probably is n’t looking for any internal complaints as to the new format .
Colts president G.M. Bill Polian probably did n’t get the memo .
In a recent appearance on 1070 the Fan with our pal Dan Dakich , Polian sounded off regarding the situation , via SportsRadioInterviews.com .
“ It ’s stupid , ” Polian said .
“ It ’s a disruption , but we ’ll deal with it . ”
He apparently does n’t like the fact that , even though the Colts players named to the team do n’t have to participate in the game , they have to show up at the event , and maybe wave to their moms .
“ If it were n’t for the Pro Bowl disruption , they would have the weekend off , but they ca n’t because we have to send those players to Miami to do Lord knows what , ” Polian added .
“ We ’ll come back and practice on Sunday and the Pro Bowl players will go and do whatever they have to do and then the team will leave on Monday . ”
Asked whether the Pro Bowlers will fly back to Indianapolis on Sunday and then travel back down to Florida with the team on Monday , Polian said , “ I do n’t know that they fly them back .
I think they plan to keep them down there that evening .
They have n’t even told us yet what this is all about .
We do n’t even have any details or anything like that .
Maybe they will call us Friday and tell us .
“ In any event , the fact of the matter is that we ’re thinking that they ’re down there Sunday night and they will meet us Monday , which is a hell of a thing , is n’t it ?
It sends a great message to all the young people out there and all the coaches that talk teamwork that you take your best seven players and split them up from your team at the ultimate moment in sports . ”
Wow .
In unrelated news , Polian ’s tenure on the Competition Committee could be ending soon .
Maybe they ’ll call him Friday and tell him .
' Poor Al Gore .
Global warming completely debunked via the very Internet you invented .
Oh , oh , the irony ! "
This quip by comedian Jon Stewart on " The Daily Show " last week was a welcome break from the steady disclosures of science gone bad .
So too was the instantly viral online video called " Hide the Decline , " a mocking send - up of the scientists who tried to suppress data showing global cooling .
It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube .

Inside a McDonald ’s Happy Meal Toy -- Jake Sully Avatar
I ’m normally not impressed by the free toy inside kid ’s meals at fast food restaurants .
However , the Avatar Jake Sully McDonald ’s Happy Meal toy caught my attention due to how it lit up .
And , as you 'll soon see , breaking open the toy revealed some useful electronic components .
Jake Sully toy head lights up ( artistic emphasis added ) .
After lunch , my son immediately lost interest in the toy .
Perhaps if the arms and legs were hinged , it could have joined his action figure legion in participating in an imaginary battle .
But , all it did was light up .
( There ’s a toy design theory that states the best toys are those that the child directs in new unplanned ways , rather than a few specific actions intended by the manufacturer . )
As my wife and I were cleaning up , I noticed that the Avatar toy flickered off and on , even though no one was playing with it .
At first , I assumed it was programmed to flash randomly , but it turned off when we stopped moving .
Next , I hypothesized that the illumination was based on sound or touch , yet neither set of my test inputs seemed to correlate with the flashing .
Finally , I recognized that the flashing corresponded with vibration .
Having opened up a pair of blinky shoes , I guessed that the Happy Meal toy contained a spring and metal tube .
The only way to know for sure is open - heart surgery !
Breaking open the toy would also satisfy my curiosity about the light source .
Years ago , blue LEDs were expensive enough that toys would often contain a red , orange - yellow , or off - green LED .
Even though the Jake Sully toy is made of translucent blue plastic , which might normally tint a blander color LED , I suspected that it contained a true blue LED .
Searching For Openings
Given that this was my kid ’s toy , I would have preferred to find a non-destructive way to look inside .
However , these toys are usually well sealed to avoid harming a small child ; else they swallow a small electronic part .
Toy back with speaker , power switch , and triangle screw .
The back of the toy includes a speaker with air - holes , a slide - switch for power , and a triangle screw .
The speaker is odd , because the toy we received does n’t make any noise .
Perhaps a bad unit ?
Or perhaps a clue ?
Unscrew triangle screw with triangle screwdriver bit .
To open up the toy , I started with the most obvious -- unscrewing the triangle screw .
For a number of years , I used the tip of a triangle file , but now I use a set of four triangle power bits .
Specifically , Jake seems to take a TA23 0.090 ″ ( McMaster - Carr # 5941A13 $ 2.87 )
Unfortunately , removing a single screw was not enough to remove the back of the toy .
Something more drastic needed to occur .
Detach toy arm with pliers .
A pair of pliers with serrated teeth gripped the slightly squishy arms enough to remove them .
With enough effort , I suppose the arms could be reinserted , but , realistically , I think we ’re past the point of no return .
Crack toy chest open with pliers .
The shoulder socket hole provides an access point to begin prying and nibbling away at the toy ’s chest plate .
Rather than coming off in a single piece , the plastic tended to rip away a chunk at a time .
Still , a big enough crack formed at the join line between the major molded pieces to make separation fairly easy .
Inspecting the Internals
The toy ’s cavity is hollow and fairly spacious .
There are a number of surprises inside .
Inside McDonald ’s avatar toy .
A standalone motherboard holds all of the electronics .
I ca n’t wait to see what is underneath the big blue object in the center .
Surely it is a spring and metal contact for sensing vibration !
Beneath Jake Sully ’s mask ( under the face ) is a solid clear piece of plastic where the LED is aimed .
Acrylic light pipe inside toy face .
The solid clear plastic piece is made of acrylic .
It is shaped to distribute the blue LED light more evenly .
This is called a “ light pipe ” , which is used to provide designer - styling in a wide range of electrical devices .
This is a really nice touch , but almost seems unnecessary in a plastic container that I would have expected to have fairly good light diffusion by itself .
Free Batteries
The large blue cover on top of the circuit board has a couple of tabs holding it in place .
A small screwdriver can release the tabs to pop off the cover .
Three coin cells .
I ’m shocked to find three discrete coin cells .
Wow !
It is very unusual to find a true battery holder in a disposable toy .
Each coin cell is a 1.5 volt alkaline .
That makes 4.5 volts total ( a battery of three cells in series ) , which is necessary to provide enough voltage to light a blue LED .
The coin cell is of type L736H of 0.31 ″ diameter by 0.14 ″ thickness .
This type is compatible with SR41 , LR41 , 192 , V3GA , LR736 , L736 , L736 F , AG3 , 192 , LR41 , G3 , V36A , L736H , G3A , and GP192 .
A popular online retailer sells a pack of ten for $ 3.79 ( 38 cents each ) .
That means the batteries alone are worth a dollar .
Avatar toy circuit board with blue LED , coin cells , and speaker .
With a little desoldering , you can get a piezo speaker and a blue LED from the motherboard as well .
Avatar circuit board .
The PCB ( printed circuit board ) has surprisingly few passive components .
There ’s a 30000 ohm surface - mount resistor ( marked 303 ) and a 52 nF capacitor ( inexact measurement ) .
The black blob in the center is epoxy covering a custom integrated circuit .
Nowhere do I see a vibration sensor .
Scratching my head , my best guess was that a crude motion sensor ( accelerometer ) is built into the chip that is covered by the black epoxy .
But , I was wrong !
Several loyal readers ( Frank and Tristan ) suggested that the speaker is wired as a piezoelectric sensor .
That is , rather than the microcontroller providing power to the speaker to produce vibrations as sound , sound ( or contact ) vibrates the speaker to produce power at the microcontroller input .
Indeed .
Even the slightest contact with the “ speaker ” causes the LED to flash .
When I shorted out the “ speaker ” , the device no longer responded to vibration .
Neat trick .
Another unusual aspect of this toy is the silk screened text on the PCB .
Marks include :
R1 - first resistor
C1 - first capacitor
Bzz - the buzzer / speaker
LED - the light - emitting diode
Vcc - positive connection to the battery
Vss - negative connection to the battery
FG -6095 - the part number ?
090605 - manufactured date of June 5 , 2009 ?
Rev1.0 94HB1.2 - board and chip version ?
FA6A ( opposite side )
There seems to be two very different groups at work in this toy .
The people that made the standard low - grade no -joint throwaway body .
And the people that included three non-soldered coin cells , a wired speaker / sensor , acrylic light pipe face , blue LED , and a & microcontroller .
Let this be a lesson to you junkbot enthusiasts .
Next time , rather than discarding your Happy Meal toy to the trash , take a moment to crack it open to see if you can salvage a couple of useful parts !

AT&T’s ( s t ) Ralph de la Vega used today ’s UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York to deliver a message to the carrier ’s data - hungry mobile users :
We will have ways of modifying — or monetizing — your behavior .
Noting that roughly 3 percent of AT&T users generate 40 percent of the traffic on the network , de la Vega spoke of offering “ incentives ” to get users to curb their data habits .
Those “ incentives , ” though , may come in the form of stiffer fees or higher changes for downloading information during business hours — what ’s known as congestion pricing for mobile broadband .
“ I ’m not going to give you in detail what we ’re going to do , but if three are causing 40 percent , then we ’re going to try to focus on making sure we give incentives to those small percentages to either reduce or modify their usage so they do n’t crowd out the other users in those same cell sites , ” de la Vega said .
“ You ’ll see us address that more in detail in the future … What ’s driving usage on the network and driving these high - usage situations are things like video or audio that keeps playing around the clock .
We ’ve got to get to those customers and have them recognize and change their patterns . ”
As Stacey wrote a few months ago ( GigaOM Pro , sub. required ) , a combination of attractive price plans , high - quality smartphones and the rise of mobile applications are already driving mobile broadband usage — in a big way .
Much of the traffic is due to streaming content such as web - based video and on - the - go music services that require far more bandwidth than things like text messaging and mobile e-mail .
And that consumption will surely continue to surge as netbooks and a flood of other connected devices come to market , and as t he fatter pipes of LTE make accessing content even easier and faster .
Indeed , de la Vega this morning said that simply boosting capacity on AT&T ’s 850 Mhz network in New York resulted in an “ overnight ” traffic increase of 30 percent .
AT&T ’s woes are a prime example of network shortcomings , to be sure , and the carrier is scrambling to appease data - hungry users by upgrading its 3G network to HSPA en route to the 4G technology LTE .
But other operators are certain to experience such growing pains as they grow their data businesses with iPhone - like handsets .
Carriers are increasingly turning to technologies like Wi-Fi and femtocells to help offload the increasing traffic , but operators will likely also abandon their flat - rate pricing models in favor of congestion pricing .
A consumer who uses mobile data primarily for email on the phone , for instance , could opt for 200 kbps service while a netbook - toting road warrior could be asked to shell out for a 1.5 M bps connection .
And connectivity could vary not just by user but also by use case , giving consumers the flexibility to pay more when they need a lot of data quickly or during peak hours .
Cable operators and a handful of European ISPs are already toying with such models .
Congestion pricing has some substantial drawbacks , of course .
Charging consumers based on a host of variables is a marketing strategy destined to foster confusion in the minds of users , and it could force carriers to make upgrades to billing infrastructures to ensure users are billed accurately .
But with mobile data already straining the capacity of some operators ’ networks , it ’s a model you may see sooner than you expect .
We are eating ourselves out of house and home .
Recently , in the September 24 issue of Nature , Johan Rockström and his colleagues proposed 10 “ planetary boundaries ” to define safe limits of human activity .
( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group . )
Those limits include caps on greenhouse gas emissions , biodiversity loss , the global conversion of land cover to cropland , and other mega-impacts on the earth ’s ecosystems .
Yet humanity has already exceeded several of them and is on a trajectory to exceed most of the others .
The rising demand for food plays a large role in those transgressions .
The green revolution that made grain production soar gave humanity some breathing space , but the continuing rise in population and demand for meat production is exhausting that buffer .
The father of the green revolution , Norman Borlaug , who passed away in September at the age of 95 , made exactly this point in 1970 when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize : “ There can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until the agencies that fight for increased food production and those that fight for population control unite in a common effort . ”
That common effort was inconsistent at best and sometimes essentially nonexistent .
Since 1970 the population has risen from 3.7 billion to 6.9 billion and continues to increase by around 80 million a year .
Food production per person has declined in some big regions , notably sub-Saharan Africa .
In India the doubling of population has absorbed almost all of the increase in grain production .
Food production accounts for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions when one tallies those from fossil fuels used in growing , preparing and transporting food ; the carbon dioxide released by clearing land for farming and pastures ; the methane from rice paddies and ruminant livestock ; and the nitrous oxide from fertilizer use .
Through the clearing of forestland , food production is also responsible for much of the loss of biodiversity .
Chemical fertilizers cause massive depositions of nitrogen and phosphorus , which now destroy estuaries in hundreds of river systems and threaten ocean chemistry .
Roughly 70 percent of worldwide water use goes to food production , which is implicated in groundwater depletion and ecologically destructive freshwater consumption from California to the Indo - Gangetic Plain to Central Asia to northern China .
The green revolution , in short , has not negated the dangerous side effects of a burgeoning human population , which are bound to increase as the population exceeds seven billion around 2012 and continues to grow as forecast toward nine billion by 2046 .
Meat consumption per capita is rising as well .
Beef poses the biggest threat because cattle require up to 16 kilograms of feed grains for each kilogram of consumed meat , they emit large amounts of methane , and the fertilizer used to grow their feed contributes hugely to nitrogen oxides .
It is not enough to produce more food ; we must also simultaneously stabilize the global population and reduce the ecological consequences of food production — a triple challenge .
A rapid voluntary reduction in fertility rates in the poor countries , brought about by more access to family planning , higher child survival and education for girls , could stabilize the population at around eight billion by 2050 .
Payments to poor communities to resist deforestation could save species habitats .
No -till farming and other methods can preserve soils and biodiversity .
More efficient fertilizer use can reduce the transport of excessive nitrogen and phosphorus .
Better irrigation and seed varieties can conserve water and reduce other ecological pressures .
And a diet shifted away from eating beef would conserve ecosystems while improving human health .
Those changes will require a tremendous public - private effort that is yet to be mobilized .
As we remember Borlaug ’s great achievements , we must redouble our efforts to respond to his admonitions as well .
The window of opportunity to achieve sustainable development is closing .

This article was originally printed with the title , " Transgressing Planetary Boundaries . "
London , England ( CNN ) -- A UK priest has defended his comments that it is acceptable to steal from large companies .
Tim Jones , parish priest of St Lawrence and St Hilda , told his congregation in York , northern England : " My advice , as a Christian priest , is to shoplift . "
Jones , who according to the church Web site previously worked in Corinth , Mississippi , made his comments about what he regarded as acceptable behavior by those in need when they were desperate .
In a transcript of his sermon published in the local newspaper , " The Press , " Jones said : " I do not offer such advice because I think that stealing is a good thing , or because I think it is harmless , for it is neither .
" I would ask that they do not steal from small family businesses , but from large national businesses , knowing that the costs are ultimately passed on to the rest of us in the form of higher prices . "
Jones told CNN affiliate ITN Monday that his advice was directed at those with nothing and who had exhausted all other legal avenues to survive , such as state benefits .
While it was never right to shoplift , Jones said , it was the most acceptable alternative for those in desperate need compared with prostitution , burglary or other criminal offenses .
The Web site for St Hilda 's states that Jones has served as a prison chaplain and that his interests include international justice and fair trade issues .
" I would say to those people that are outraged : Compare how much you are spending on yourself this Christmas compared to how much you have given to people in desperate situations , " Jones told ITN .
In his sermon Sunday Jones called on anyone planning to steal not to take more than they need for longer than they need , saying that he offered his advice with a heavy heart .
He added that his advocacy of shoplifting was a " grim indictment " of society and a plea for help for the most vulnerable .
But Jones ' church bosses failed to back his call .
In a statement on the Web site for the Diocese of York Tuesday , Richard Seed , Archdeacon of York said : " The Church of England does not advise anyone to shoplift , or break the law in any way .
" Fr Tim Jones is raising important issues about the difficulties people face when benefits are not forthcoming , but shoplifting is not the way to overcome these difficulties .
" There are many organizations and charities working with people in need , and the Citizens ' Advice Bureau is a good first place to call . "
Sports broadcasting will enter a new dimension in 2010 ... the third dimension , as ESPN will unveil the industry 's first 3 - D network .
ESPN 3D will showcase a minimum of 85 live sporting events during its first year , beginning June 11 with the first 2010 FIFA World Cup match , featuring South Africa versus Mexico , ESPN and ABC Sports president George Bodenheimer announced .
Other events to be produced in 3 - D include the 2011 BCS National Championship Game , college basketball and football contests , up to 25 World Cup matches and the Summer X Games .
Additional events will be announced at a later date .
" ESPN 's commitment to 3 - D is a win for fans and our business partners , " Bodenheimer said in a statement .
" ESPN 3D marries great content with new technology to enhance the fan 's viewing experience and puts ESPN at the forefront of the next big advance for TV viewing . "
ESPN has been testing ESPN 3D for more than two years , even showing a USC - Ohio State college football game in select theaters and to 6,000 fans at the Galen Center on USC 's campus .
" This is a turning point for 3 - D , " Consumer Electronics Association CEO Gary Shapiro told USA Today .

There are many choices to be made when starting a new project .
In this post I ’ll try to explain our technology choices and the experience we ’ve had so far .
Background
One of the nice things about starting a new project in a startup is the freedom of choice when it comes to selecting platform and tools .
You can spend an awful lot of time mulling between the different choices , but in the end , it is usually not the choice of programming language that kills a startup .
First , a little background .
I ’ve been programming for more than 15 years in C++, VB , C# , Java , Perl & PHP .
The last 5 - 6 years it has been mostly enterprise Java .
When I started at my last job ( another startup ) we had a product implemented in Java that we turned into a SaaS platform .
The core remained in Java and much of the web frontend was implemented in PHP .
I really liked the productivity we got out of PHP as compared to the Java code .
Very fast turnaround times .
But somehow the language / platform does n’t really turn me on .
So many tools , so little time
So I knew I did n’t want to use pure Java or PHP , in the end I ended up choosing between
Ruby +
Rails
Python +
Django
Scala +
Lift
Despite the success of Rails in the past few years , it never really clicked with me .
Granted I have n’t used it for more than a few weeks , but it never really felt natural .
Same with Django .
I ’ve used python on several occasions for scripting tasks , but never really for webapps .
So I ended up with Scala and Lift .
I looked briefly at Scala in 2007 , liking what I saw , but did n’t use it for anything serious .
In the end , what made the difference was :
Well known development and deployment platform ( JVM , Build tools , IDEs , app servers etc ) Java interop , both for use of existing libraries but also as a fallback plan if everything failed .
Lift ’s clean templating .
We did n’t really need any of the real - time features ( ie. comet support ) in Lift , although the Ajax support looked nice .
Status
So here we are , 6 months after development began .
How has it been ?
In short : Not bad .
We have a platform up and running , productivity is pretty good and getting better all the time .
When compared with Java code , our Scala / Lift code is not very verbose , but compared to Rails & Django code I still feel it is ( slightly ) more verbose .
I think this is because of the static typing that ( despite type inferencing ) requires quite a few type annotations .
Otoh , when something type checks , it usually works 🙂
Scala
Pros
Scala the language has a lot of benefits , many of which have already been described in other articles on the net .
Here are some others that I find important :
Very concise , you can skip most types , parentheses , semicolons etc .
Except when using parameterized types ( generics ) .
Here ’s Hello World in Scala ( using the Application trait is considered bad mojo for various reasons but ignore that for this example :-) ) object HelloWorld extends Application { println ( " Hello World " ) }
You can start coding as you would in Java and gradually ease into the Functional Programming paradigm ( if you want )
You can use all existing Java libraries
Very nice testing frameworks such as Specs , ScalaTest & ScalaCheck
You can write very concise , readable code .
E.g we have a dataset to be charted .
It has a number of dataseries each having a number of values .
To get the total of all values , we can just write this method
def sum = series.map(_.sum ).foldLeft(0.0 ) ( _+_ )
which says , for each series , calculate the sum and then add all the results
Lazy parameters make logging code ( which I think is very important , but is responsible for a lot of boilerplate ) very readable .
In Java you usually guard calls to logging to avoid the expensive computation of the string to be logged :
if ( log.isDebugEnabled ( ) { log.debug ( " Here is the XML blob : " +xml ) }
in Scala ( or rather , Lift ) you can , without loss of performance , just write
log.debug ( " Here is the XML blob : " +xml )
The string to be logged will not be computed if debug log statements should not be logged .
Very easy to write meaningful DTOs .
In Java , a lot of boiler plate is needed to make a class wih e.g. 3 properties .
Often I would use an array ( which will be untyped ) or a tuple .
Both suffer from the problem that you ’ll have to know that the 2nd field is the customer id and the 3rd is the total amount .
In Scala you can simply write a case - class and get named fields with typed access : case class MyRecord ( id : Int , custNo : String , amount : Double )
Cons
There are also a number of drawbacks to using the Scala language
Tooling .
We ’re using the Scala 2.7.x plugin for Eclipse .
While it works , there are a lot of bugs that means you ’ll often have to rebuild the entire project for your changes to be seen .
The 2.7.x version is basically abandoned and all work is going on in the 2.8 version which is supposedly much better .
Unfortunately , we ca n’t switch to 2.8 until all the other tools we use are running on 2.8 ( which is not in beta yet )
While type inference works , it ’s not as powerful as in ML ( and probably never will be .
Scala ’s type system has inheritance making it much harder to inference the correct types ) .
It frequently requires you to add some type info .
After a while you figure out where this is needed though .
The Scala compiler is rather slow .
Fortunately , the Eclipse incremental compiler works most of the time .
The Scala book is very well written , but the API documentation is rather sparse .
With most Java code I seldom have to use the source , but for the scala code it seems easier to start with the source .
The syntax can get quite ugly until you recognize the patterns .
This is a problem since the documentation is rather bad .
Parameterized types can can be especially bad I think .
This is an example from the scala - user mailing list :
implicit def TraversableBind [ M[ X ] <: Traversable [ X ] ] = new Bind [ M ] { def bind [ A , B ] ( r : M[ A ] , f : A => M[ B ] ) ( implicit w : CanBuild [ B , M[ B ] ] ) : M[ B ] = r.flatMap(f ) ( breakOut ) }
No binary compatibility between Scala versions .
This means that code compiled with Scala 2.7.3 is not ( in general ) compatible with code compiled with 2.7.5 and needs to be recompiled .
This is not a big deal for our own code , but it does make it difficult to move to another version since all the Scala libraries used needs to be released first .
I think this is also what has slowed down use of the forthcoming 2.8 release : people with sizable apps are waiting for the entire tool chain to be available and since 2.8 is not yet in beta , you need to agree on a version of 2.8 for everything .
Lift
Overall , I like the Lift framework and how it utilizes the Scala language .
The fundamental approach to request handling seem very well thought out and makes it easy to handle both traditional web apps , Ajax , REST APIs etc .
The focus on Lift seems to get things done , not so much to create the perfect web framework abstraction that has all corner cases covered .
This means most code has been battle tested , but sometimes you ’ll wander along an untrodden path and strange things will happen .
Pros
Without a doubt , the best thing about Lift is the community .
Very friendly people , fast response to most questions .
Eager to get newbies up to speed .
The Eclipse incremental compiler , Jetty & the JRebel plugin makes for fairly rapid turnaround times even if it ’s not in the same league as e.g. PHP & Python .
But many changes can be reloaded on the fly without having to restart the server .
Very fast to get a real app up and running .
Prebuilt archetypes for a basic app with authentication and DB access .
Focus on security .
Much effort has been put into making Lift apps secure .
E.g. you cannot repost a form since the field ids are unique
The Lift ORM , Mapper , is fairly simple , but does provide a very quick way to get CRUD functionality up and running .
Very easy to add Ajax functionality ( I ca n’t speak on the Comet functionality )
Pretty good i18n support .
Strings , templates etc. can be locale dependent and the locale can be computed for each request if needed .
The clean separation between UI and code ( it is impossible to have code in templates ) makes it easy for designers to modify the layout and styling with breaking anything .
The focus on getting things done means if there ’s a real use case , new features can be added fairly quickly .
Same goes for bugs in production code .
Cons
API Documentation is very scarce .
Usually , I use the source to figure out how stuff is working , but sometimes you need the big picture in order to get a good understanding .
There is a free book available , but I usually do n’t use this on a day to day basis .
Form handling is very basic .
There is n’t really any form specific code in Lift , so making a real , usable form ( with i18n , validation , etc ) takes some effort .
Lift apps are very stateful .
This is not a problem for us , but for apps that needs to be very horizontally scalable , this is a showstopper .
The problem is not easily solved , since it requires serialization of closures .
The Lift ORM , Mapper , is fairly simple , which means that for more complex scenarios it is somewhat difficult to extend , loosing some of the RAD capabilities
The focus on getting things done means that some areas are not really consistent or complete .
While you ca n’t get code into your templates , it ’s easy to get UI into your code , which is ( almost ) just as bad .
The dynamic part of the UI is done by snippets and they of course need to emit HTML .
But it is easy to put all kinds of style , class attributes as well as other things which belong in the template , into this dynamically generated code .
This makes it difficult for designers to modify the layout and styling without touching the Scala code .
Many complain about this games difficulty but it really comes down skill and wits .
You can't just run into a battle swinging your sword Many complain about this games difficulty but it really comes down skill and wits .
You can't just run into a battle swinging your sword expecting to do well .
You actually have to think about your strategy in the fight .
You also have to know your style of fighting .
If you have great timing , you would be well suited for a regular shield so you can counter attack enemies .
If timing is n't your forte , then you can use a Great Shield for increased defense but no counter ability .
Same goes for the weapons .
You need to recognize your enemies attacks and either block or dodge accordingly .
This game is not that hard if you use your brain and practice .
You have to have good stamina management , and be aware of your surroundings so if you are fighting , you know where you can back up and not fall off a cliff .
If you think this game is too hard , you just are n't trying hard enough , or you just are n't as good as you thought you were at video games .

â€ œThere is something paradoxical in the view that the conservative should be the outsider , â€ admits Roger Scruton , a man who nonetheless embodies the paradox completely .
Scruton has been Britainâ€™s leading intellectual defender of conservative values in politics , art , religion , ethics and culture for nearly three decades , for which he has been rewarded by marginalisation within academia and ridicule in the left - wing press .
â€ œThat is just part of the to and fro of public life , â€ Scruton tells me in the study of his Wiltshire farmhouse , where he lives with his wife and two children , and tends to his hunting horses .
Still , â€ œI donâ€™t feel bitter at all , â€ he insists .
â€ œI had a really interesting time being disliked .â€ 
Scruton is often portrayed as a fox - hunting arriviste , the grammar school boy done good who is now desperate to be posher than posh .
But the coherence of his philosophical work over the years belies such an easy caricature .
â€ œThere is a unifying intellectual endeavour , â€ he says of his work , â€ œwhich is to bring philosophy and culture back together , so that the study of philosophy moves back from being the handmaiden of the sciences â€ “ as itâ€™s tended to be in British empiricism and also modern analytical philosophy â€ “ to being a meditation on the human condition which borders on literature , art , music and the rest .
Thatâ€™s always been my interest , which is why I started by doing research on aesthetics.â€ 
That primary focus is â€œconnected to a sort of cultural conservatism of the TS Eliot type , which moved me at a certain stage in a political direction .
Thatâ€™s to say , I became , like many people of my generation , very disillusioned with the post - war socialist consensus and began looking for other things .
Itâ€™s never been a primary interest , but I became interested in how to articulate the message about some form of intellectual conservatism for the age in which we live.â€ 
Although his work on aesthetics has been primary , it was his third book , The Meaning of Conservatism , which kick - started his life as a public intellectual .
â€ œI only wrote it because Ted Honderich asked me to , â€ he explains .
â€ œPenguin thought that they should publish something on conservatism at the time , which was 1979 , I think â€ “ a long time ago â€ “ and Ted looked around and racked his brains for anybody he could think of who was a conservative .
He hit on me and that launched me on another career , in a way , as a spokesman for a certain position .â€ 
Scrutonâ€™s articulation of conservative philosophy stands in great contrast to the mainstream left - liberal political philosophy of the last fifty or so years , as much in its methods and underlying assumptions as in its conclusions .
â€ œFirst of all , conservatism isnâ€™t goal - directed in the way that socialism is , and some , though not all , forms of liberalism are .
Articulating it is first of all a matter of describing what it is and bringing out that in it which is loveable , acceptable , or in any case jeopardised by unthinking reform .
Thatâ€™s a huge labour of description and evocation .
It must be conducted against a background of professional disillusion with the idea of goals in politics .
We canâ€™t know how to proceed towards some ideal in this world and itâ€™s foolish to try , and the evidence of history is that people who have tried have ended up in situations of mass genocide .
Isnâ€™t it better to look at what we have and see the ways in which it secures equilibrium , satisfaction happiness etcetera for the people who are involved in it ?
â€ œThatâ€™s a much more difficult thing to do , I think , than to articulate a forward - looking socialist doctrine .
If you look at Marx in particular , he says almost nothing about the communist future .
Itâ€™s just an abstraction .
Everything is about how hateful this and this is in the present and anyway history is going to sweep it away .
My view is that is morally irresponsible and that really one must begin from an understanding of the virtues and the defects of the thing that one has.â€ 
However , itâ€™s one thing to evoke and describe , quite another to justify .
How does he do that for conservatism ?
â€ œWell , someone like Rawls is looking for an abstract unifying principle of justification , which he calls justice , and in my view completely distorts the concept of justice in order to do this .
I would say your relation to the social order in which youâ€ ™re brought up is comparable to your relation to your family .
Itâ€™s full of imperfections , tensions and so on but itâ€™s not something for which an abstract justification is needed if it is to go on .
It is the given , to use the Wittgensteinian mode of looking at it .
The important thing is to know how to adjust it , and how , not just to dislike those things that you dislike , but how to love those things which you donâ€™t dislike.â€ 
This way of arguing is essentially Burkean .
As Scruton put it in his memoir , Gentle Regrets , â€ œBurke brought home to me that our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable from our own perspective , and that the attempt to justify them will lead merely to their loss .
Replacing them with the abstract rational systems of the philosophers , we may think ourselves more rational and better equipped for life in the modern world .
But in fact we are less well equipped , and our new beliefs are far less justified , for the very reason that they are justified by ourselves.â€ 
However , canâ€™t one imagine such a way of thinking being used to refuse the franchise to women , or failing to abolish slavery ?
As a conservative , how does one distinguish the things that actually do need changing from Burkeâ€™s â€œjustified prejudicesâ€ ?
â€ œIâ€™m not saying that acceptance of the existing arrangements is the final arbiter of everything , â€ Scruton replies , â€œbut itâ€™s the thing from which you begin .
If you donâ€™t begin from that , there isnâ€™t any possibility of political dialogue , compromise and all the things that make it possible for people to live together .
Again , going back to the family example , of course we live by moral principles as well .
One might discover that oneâ€™s father is after all an embezzler and that must change , and likewise one might discover that oneâ€™s society depends upon immoral ways of using people and that must change .
Itâ€™s reasonable to think that without some totalising principle under which all these adjustments fall .
â€ œYouâ€ ™re arguing as though it ought to be easy to argue these things , and it never is , because after all one is talking not just about moral precepts to do with justice , freedom and so on , one is also talking about competing interests .
One of the great things about the conservative position â€ “ in practical politics as opposed to theoretical philosophy â€ “ is that it has always recognised that political solutions are compromises , in which as many of the contending interests as possible are reconciled with each other , so itâ€™s essentially irenic philosophy .
Itâ€™s not to do with the righteous overbearing the unrighteous and imposing upon them a doctrine which they are rejecting or anything like that .â€ 
How does this apply to a practical example , such as Britainâ €™s House of Lords , in which , until recently , people held political office purely because they were born into nobility ?
â€ œIn a case like the House of Lords , I think that obviously there would be the Burkean arguments that if it ainâ€™t broke donâ€™t fix it .
Itâ€™s been around for a long time , obviously it performed all sorts of functions , we didnâ€™t know how it came into existence , it arose by the invisible hand , all the usual things .
So if weâ€ ™re gong to adjust it we must have a very clear conception of what is wrong with it and whether itâ€™s producing the wrong results and the rest .
â€ œThen a conservative with my way of thinking would also recognise that in a democratic age , people are filled with the idea that people who have gained power or authority without popular election are somehow illegitimately in that position .
Even if you think thatâ€™s wrong , which I do , youâ€™ve got to say that nevertheless they represent a vast number in the population .
Their interests and view of this must be entered into the equation , and whichever compromise emerges would be the best that one could hope for .
That for me is what politics is .
That sort of decision making is totally unlike what socialists think politics is .
For them there are first principles from which you derive your procedures of action , and then you proceed towards your goal and impose that goal on everybody regardless of whether they want it.â€ 
Isnâ€™t the worry that had such a view of politics had been more widespread , then a lot of the things that we now think are perfectly laudable would have been harder to bring about because there would have been a greater presumption against change ?
â€ œSure .
Some things would have been harder to bring about but some unwise changes would have been resisted .
Look at the collapse of the education system .
If conservatives had entered more fully into the compromises , which they didnâ€™t , because the Labour party was determined to exclude that voice , then we wouldnâ€™t have , I think , the breakdown in school education which weâ€ ™re witnessing today.â€ 
The decline of standards in all sorts of areas of life is , of course , another conservative theme which citics like to mock .
But when it comes to matters of what is usually called high culture , and Scruton simply calls culture , the importance of maintaining the highest standards in the arts is one which Scruton defends with some thoroughness .
So why does culture matter so much to him ?
â€ œI came from a background where culture wasnâ€™t very significant .
Lip service would be paid to it , but there werenâ€™t many books around , we never went to the theatre or anything like that .
Music only arrived by accident when my father inherited a piano .
But when I discovered it , it made such an impact on me , I realised , here is another vision of life , this is a call , and Iâ€™ve got to follow this .
This is infinitely more interesting than anything around me .
Iâ€™ve always thought that and then that raises the question , how do you justify that ?
Not just living like that but living off it , from writing , teaching , all those ways in which one can make culture into a way of life .
So Iâ€™ve always had this question , what is the benefit â€ “ not to you who are involved to it , because that is like asking what is the benefit of the person you love , that is your existential commitment â€ “ but what is the benefit to others who donâ€™t have it and maybe donâ€™t want it ?
Why should governments give money to support the arts when itâ€™s a minority taste ?
Shouldnâ€™t they be giving money to support museums of pop music or whatever , and the Arts Council has been very influenced by that .
â€ œYou have to find some way of describing the benefits that my being cultured confers on those who arenâ€™t , and that is a hard task , but not an impossible one .
Itâ€™s like asking , what is the benefit for the mass of people of the priestâ€™s vow of chastity ?
Theyâ€™re not going to vow chastity â€ “ heâ€™s doing this by way of cementing his own personal relation with God .
But what is the benefit for others ?
And we know that actually , anthropologically , there is a benefit .
There is somebody who deliberately absents himself from felicity in order to set an example , to be immune to certain kinds of relationships , to stand as father and advisor to a whole community .
I think that is the role that high culture has played in our society , the theatre in particular , but also concert - gong and the rest .
A lot of people whom it has never directly touched it has indirectly touched , by giving moral and spiritual sustenance to the teacher in the primary school for instance , or to the person who is going to be prepared to set up a little youth orchestra in the village or an amateur theatrical group .
Itâ€™s preparing an elite for a sacrificial role which benefits others , and thatâ€™s the way I look at it.â€ 
As often happens with Scruton , one is sometimes taken aback by the high moral tone of some of his language : a sacrificial role ?
Surely purveyors of culture derive great benefits from their involvement in it ?
â€ œI get a tremendous benefit , but also I lead a studious life and work extremely hard at getting the right word , the right sentence and so on , which I neednâ€™t bother with if I didnâ€™t have that sense that this is of intrinsic value .
And if I didnâ€™t do that but just wrote sloppily I wouldnâ€™t be able to propagate any message and maybe that would have negative impacts on others.â€ 
The question that obviously arises here is whether this view entails a distasteful elitism .
Just as Socratesâ€™s maxim that the unexamined life is not worth living throws into question the value of many ordinary , unreflective lives , doesnâ€™t Scrutonâ€™s view privilege the life of the cultural connoisseur over simpler , everyday folk ?
â€ œCulture is another name for the deepest examination of the human condition , in a way .
Nobody would accuse Socrates of snobbery when he said that , although of course he was addressing upper - class youths in Athens and all the rest .
I think thereâ€™s no reason why someone shouldnâ€™t say this , because it could be true , and one wants to know how , in that case , others can enjoy the benefits of knowing something about themselves and their condition .
â€ œI take the view that this is one of the things religion does for people .
It is a channel through which that tradition of examination of the human condition can pass its wisdom down to ordinary people and illuminate their lives , and I think the loss of religion makes it more obvious just what people lose through not having any culture as well .
The danger is that people will just get lost in a morass of addictive pleasures and not ask themselves the questions about the meaning of their own lives and not make the effort to make themselves interesting to others , so that human relations begin to crumble .
I think weâ€ ™re actually seeing that .
If you look round the society in which we are , itâ€™s not in a happy state .
Although it has everything materially , people are finding it very difficult to make themselves interesting to each other.â€ 
Scruton is well aware that many good , decent people are also uncultured , and argues that asserting the moral value of culture is not at all refuted by this .
â€ œThere isnâ€™t any direct connection between high culture and morality at the level of the individual person .
Thatâ€™s why in the book Culture Counts I wrestled with the thought that it is more like science than we think : thereâ€™s a collective attempt to preserve a kind of knowledge , knowledge about what to feel and the legacy of social emotion .
Of course , you can acquire that and pass it on without yourself benefiting morally from it or being changed morally , just as people can do with science .
Maybe thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about â€ “ this legacy of emotional knowledge is something of vital importance to all of us , especially to those who donâ€™t consciously have it .
That was the thought , and actually itâ€™s quite an original thought , because nobody has tried to justify culture in that way .
â€ œThese are speculative connections and I may be wrong , but one shouldnâ€™t be afraid of entertaining the thought that Iâ€™m right .
Itâ€™s not snobbery .
Itâ€™s like saying , when Christ said on the cross , â€ ˜Forgive them father , for they know not what they do , â€™ that wasnâ€™t snobbery , but he was expressing a massively superior vision to those around him.â€ 
Does his view entail that good , uncultured people depend for their goodness on high culture elsewhere in society ?
â€ œItâ€™s an interesting suggestion .
All we know from our predicament as modern westerners is that there has been this huge educational inheritance which weâ€ ™re somewhat throwing away at the moment , in which science , mathematics , literature , music and fine art , history , and languages have all been mixed together and have fertilised each other .
We canâ€™t say that one bit of it could be extracted and survive without the rest .
But we can look at parts of the world that have had a high culture and lost it , the Middle East being a very obvious example , and see how bereft it leaves people .
There isnâ€™t in the modern Middle East and Islam that ability to compromise , to see the human condition in its totality , to abstract from oneâ€™s own immediate concerns that we have .
Once , of course , all that high culture was there flourishing , especially of course in Persia in the 13th century .â€ 
Scruton even argues that there is a moral benefit to music â€ “ not just programme music or opera , but pure music .
â€ œIâ€™m not the first person to say this , because Plato in the Republic raises this question : how should people sing and dance in order to produce an orderly social condition ?
I would say that music is something which has a tremendous power : it has a power to silence us and to take us along with it .
So thereâ€™s a good question , what is it making us do ?
â€ œOne answer is that the first thing it is making us do is to move in time to it , and adapt our body rhythms , and the emotional rhythms that go with it , to what weâ€ ™re listening to .
This is obviously a way of rehearing all kinds of things that we wouldnâ€™t normally rehearse because weâ€™re too busy doing other things .
So it does matter what kind of music you listen to , because it will implant its movements in your soul .
Thatâ€™s something that Plato said in a completely different idiom , but I think itâ€™s true , and of course the psychologists think this too , because theyâ€™ve done all this empirical research on what happens to children brought up listening to Mozart as opposed to listening to pop music and all the rest , so we know it has a hugely differential effect on their moral and intellectual development .
But I would say as adults , there are great differences between those who enter into a state of frenzy through music and those who , on the contrary , enter a state of meditation .
These are character - forming experiences.â€ 
Scruton is famously , or notoriously , critical of popular music .
He was even successfully sued once by the Pet Shop Boys for suggesting in An Intelligent Person ’s Guide To Modern Culture that â€œserious doubts arise as to whether the performers made more than a minimal contribution to the recording , which owes its trade mark to subsequent sound engineering , designed precisely to make it unrepeatable .
â€ 
I put it to him that in any genre youâ€™ll find there are always some people of great creativity and artistry .
How prepared is he to overcome the initial barriers to appreciating this and give apparently raw or violent styles of music a go ?
â€ œI accept that .
I have actually been listening to quite a bit of heavy metal lately , and Metallica , I think , is genuinely talented .
â€ ˜Master of Puppetsâ€ ™ I think has got something genuinely both poetic â€ “ violently poetic â€ “ and musical .
Every now and then something like that stands out and you can see that people have got no other repertoire and have a very narrow range of expression , but theyâ€™ve hit on something where they are saying something which is not just about themselves .
Pop music is so concentrated on the self and the performer that itâ€™s very rare that that happens , I think .
It never happens with Oasis or The Verve .
It did happen much more of course with the Beatles , and in the old American songbook , Hoagy Carmichael and Cole Porter and all that .
That was a popular music which was about communication of often quite gentle feelings .
So Iâ€™m not as prejudiced as I seem .
I would like to be more prejudiced because it would prevent me from listening to this stuff.â€ 
I was reminded of a Guardian article last year in which intellectuals were asked for their confessions , most of which were no such thing : youâ€ ™re not going to think worse of John Carey , for example , because he admits to liking a nice cup of tea and a sit down .
Scruton alone admitted something that flies in the face of much of what he has stood up for :
He finds Elvis irresistible .
Is that right ?
â€ œI do find him irresistible , yes.â€ 
But you feel you shouldnâ€™t ?
â€ œWell , it is all below the belt with Elvis .
I was slightly tongue in cheek.â€ 
This sense of humour is a side of Scruton that is often missed .
In his latest book , Culture Counts , Scruton devotes several pages to the importance of jokes and comedy .
However , what a lot of people find almost comically impossible in Scruton is the high seriousness his approach generally takes .
We have become too ironic to take ourselves as seriously as Scruton would like us to .
â€ œItâ€™s true that people donâ€™t live up to my expectations .
This is one reason why we laugh .
Laughter is in a great many cases a recognition of our falling short from an ideal .
If we didnâ€™t have ideals , humour would all be black .
I still think that it would be a bad thing for mankind if people didnâ€™t make the effort that I and other people make to paint ideal portraits of the human condition .â€ 
But laughing at falling short of an ideal is still possible if you donâ€™t hold that ideal .
In the Monty Python films , for example , much of the humour is that there is this background of grand narratives â€ “ the quest for the Holy Grail , the life of Christ , and so on â€ “ but the reality of human life is nothing like as noble as these stories we tell of ourselves .
â€ œThat is true .
In fairness to me it should be said that my writing , however high - toned it is , is also quite humorous at times .
Itâ€™s more ironical than jokey , I guess .
I certainly donâ€™t want to look as though Iâ€™m imposing some kind of solemn sermon .
But I only ever say what I think and perhaps what I think is a little bit too demanding .â€ 
One example of this irony is a passage in Gentle Regrets where he talks about how there is something grotesque about someone adopting a conservatism which really should be a matter of inheritance .
The passage gave me the slightly sad sense of a man who had rejected the liberal academic home he would have been most at home in , but who now lives among conservatives who sense he isnâ€™t quite â€œone of usâ€ either .
â€ œThat passage was written slightly with tongue in cheek .
It was a chapter on why I became a conservative and was written with a sufficient irony to make the narrative plausible .
Without in any way exaggerating the problems I had , it is nevertheless the case that it was damn stupid to become a conservative .
Had it not been for the fact that I was convinced of the truth of the position I would certainly have dropped it straight away , because in the culture of those days â€ “ remember this was the seventies â€ “ it just isolated me from the university community and much of the way of life of people of my class , interests and outlook .
So I was being a little ironical and looking at myself from the outside as a comic figure .
I didnâ€™t want to describe myself as a tragic figure.â€ 
Scrutonâ€™s problems with academic life , however , are more than just political .
He finds the whole business of most contemporary Anglo - American philosophy to be sterile and dull .
â€ œI was properly trained in Cambridge and I would never want to dismiss the value of that training and the real achievements of people like Wittgenstein , obviously , who is very much one of my culture heroes , and the analytical method generally .
I think it clarifies so much in philosophy which was unclear and in particular swept away â€ “ well it should have swept away , but alas it didnâ€™t â€ “ the worst kind of phenomenology and Heidegerrian nonsense and all that , and put serious enquiry in the place of it .
â€ œBut the problem is it does have a relentlessly negative effect , because there is no attempt , or very rarely is there an attempt , to give a synthetic view of what the world is for us , what the world is in itself , and to fit the human being into this picture in its full complexity .
That really is all that I meant by saying that youâ€™ve got to put culture back in the picture .
â€ œYou can make a contribution in analytical philosophy without making any connections with the broader culture .
The question that interests me though is whether you can use what you know from analytical philosophy to help understand the broader culture , and I think you can .
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve always tried to do , certainly in my work in aesthetics .
My book on the philosophy of music is very analytical but is totally about the nature and meaning of the music and culture .
I think it benefits from being analytical .
I wouldnâ€™t ever want to repudiate that discipline.â€ 
Interestingly , you hear many similar things being said within academic philosophy these days from people who are very far from Scruton politically .
It would be ironic indeed if the profession that once pushed him away were now moving closer to his way of doing things .
Rather than the prodigal son returning home , home may be moving closer to the son .

Olbermann warns of the consequences of Thursday ’s Supreme Court ruling , including as he describes it , American politicians becoming ‘ prostitutes . ’
“ It is almost literally true that any political science fiction nightmare you can now dream up , no matter whether you are conservative or a liberal , it is now legal .
Because the people who can make it legal can now be entirely bought and sold , ” the liberal talk show host explains .
“ No actual citizens required in the campaign fund raising process .
And the entirely bought and sold politicians can change any laws .
And any legal defense you can structure now can be undone by the politicians who will be bought and sold into office this November , or two years from now .
And any legal defense which honest politicians can somehow wedge up against them this November or two years from now , that can be undone by the next even larger set of politicians who will be bought and sold into office in 2014 or 2016 or 2018 . ”
Then Olbermann ’s prediction for the ultimate fate of our political representation “ Thanks to Chief Justice Roberts , this will now change .
Unless this near mortal blow is somehow undone , within ten years , every politician in this country will be a prostitute . ”
Olbermann ’s ‘ Special Comment ’ continues after the videos below .

“ Russ Feingold told me today there might yet be ways to work around this , ” Olbermann continues .
“ To restrict corporate governance and how corporations make and spend their money .
I pointed out that any such legislation , even if it somehow sneaked past this the last US Senate not funded by a generous gift from the chub group , would eventually wind up in front of a Supreme Court , and whether or not John Roberts was still at its head would be irrelevant .
The next nine men and women on the Supreme Court will get there not because of their judgment nor even their politics .
They will get there because they were appointed by purchased presidents and confirmed by purchased senators . ”
“ Maybe it won`t be this bad , ” Mr. Olbermann offers in his final conclusions .
“ Maybe the corporations , legally defined as human beings but without the pesky occasional human attributes of compassion and conscience , maybe when handed the only keys to the electoral machine , they will simply not redesign America in their own corporate image . ”

“ Let me leave you with this final question : after today , who is going to stop them ?
Good night and good luck . ”
A full transcript of this ‘ Countdown ’ program is available online at LexisNexis .
Here is a story by New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Ethan Bronner in yesterday ’s paper , anticipating the Israeli defense forces ’ official response to the Goldstone Report .
Bronner ’s story is 99-44/100ths hasbara .
He quotes an Israeli general , he quotes Moshe Halbertal .
He even gets B’tselem to chime in against the Goldstone report .
There is no effort , in the New York Times no less , to have anyone stand up for the Goldstone report , one of the most astonishing moral documents of human rights atrocities that has ever been compiled .
[ Close your eyes .
Imagine the Times submarining Seymour Hersh by quoting lots of people defending the My Lai massacre . ]
Let me give you one example of the bias in this piece .
Bronner writes :
The rebuttal will be given to United Nations officials in the coming weeks and its contents will remain under wraps until then .
But officers involved in writing the report [ i.e. , I am serving as a conduit for hasbara ] gave some details .
One concerned the destruction of Gaza ’s sole flour mill .
The Goldstone report asserts that the Bader flour mill “ was hit by an airstrike , possibly by an F - 16 . ”
The Israeli investigators say they have photographic proof that this is false , that the mill was accidentally hit by artillery in the course of a firefight with Hamas militiamen .
The dispute is significant since the United Nations report asserts that “ the destruction of the mill was carried out for the purpose of denying sustenance to the civilian population , ” an explicit war crime .
Now let ’s go over a few facts .
First , I did a search ; and it appears that this is the first reference to the el - Bader flour mill destruction in the New York Times .
That is to say , despite the fact that Goldstone devoted a whole chapter to the flour mill ’s destruction last September , this is the first time Bronner has thought to lift his pen to tell American readers about it .
To repeat : the only source of flour inside Gaza is destroyed by the Israeli military , it is cited by an unimpeachable judge who investigated Bosnia and Rwanda as a war crime , and the New York Times correspondent only sees fit to mention it when Israeli officials confidentially tell him the real story .
Second , read Goldstone ’s own narrative on the el- Bader flour mill , beginning on paragraph 913 of the report .
Goldstone says that after two warnings ( 12/30/2008 and 1/4/2009 ) caused the flour mill ’s 45 employees to have to evacuate , the mill was struck on Jan. 9 at 3 in the morning by an F - 16 .
And that Apaches then struck it several more times with " missiles " that rendered it inoperative .
Then for the next four days , Israeli soldiers occupied the plant–which is in the northwest of Gaza–and evidently used it as a base / machine gun nest .
They left " 100s " of spent 40 mm shells on the roof .
Goldstone got his information from the Hamada brothers , who own the plant and were interviewed four times , and from visits to the plant .
" The Hamada brothers rejected any suggestion that the building was at any time used for any purpose by Palestinian armed groups , " Goldstone wrote .
There was a high wall around the plant , and it was guarded 24 / 7 .
The brothers were issued " Businessman " cards by the Israeli gov’t so as to be able to travel to and fro from Israel , and were in touch with Israeli business associates during the war in an effort to protect their plant .
They would never have gotten such cards , the Hamadas said adamantly , if the Israeli gov’t regarded them as a security risk .
Why does n’t the Times print the Hamada brothers ’ story ?
Why does it believe unnamed gov’t officials ?
Should n’t American readers be given both sides ?
Glioblastoma is a deadly form of brain cancer Scientists have discovered two genes that appear responsible for one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer .
Glioblastoma multiforme rapidly invades the normal brain , producing inoperable tumours , but scientists have not understood why it is so aggressive .
The latest study , by a Columbia University team , published in Nature , pinpoints two genes .
The researchers say that the findings raise hopes of developing a treatment for the cancer .
It means we are no longer wasting time developing drugs against minor actors in brain cancer - we can now attack the major players
Dr Antonio Iavarone
Columbia University
The genes - C/ EBP and Stat3 - are active in about 60 % of glioblastoma patients .
They appear to work in tandem to turn on many other genes that make brain cells cancerous .
Patients in the study whose tumours showed evidence of both genes being active died within 140 weeks of diagnosis .
In contrast , half of patients without activity from these genes were alive after that time .
Master controls Lead researcher Dr Antonio Iavarone described the two genes as the disease 's master control knobs .
He said : " When simultaneously activated , they work together to turn on hundreds of other genes that transform brain cells into highly aggressive , migratory cells .
" The finding means that suppressing both genes simultaneously , using a combination of drugs , may be a powerful therapeutic approach for these patients , for whom no satisfactory treatment exists . "
When the researchers silenced both genes in human glioblastoma cells , it completely blocked their ability to form tumours when injected in a mouse .
The Columbia team is now attempting to develop drugs they hope will achieve the same effect .
Using state - of - the - art techniques , they effectively mapped out the comprehensive and highly complex network of molecular interactions driving the behaviour of glioblastoma cells .
Dr Iavarone said : " The identification of C/ EBP and Stat3 came as a complete surprise to us , since these genes had never been implicated before in brain cancer " From a therapeutic perspective , it means we are no longer wasting time developing drugs against minor actors in brain cancer - we can now attack the major players . "
Nell Barrie , science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " This research is exciting , as it sheds light on the key changes that drive cells in the brain to become glioblastoma cells .
" By finding out exactly how healthy cells turn into cancer cells , scientists hope to find clues for preventing or reversing the process .
" The technique used in this study should help scientists to understand these changes in other types of cancer , leading to new and more personalised treatment approaches in the future . "

Hey pizzaphoto readers :
If you like photos of pizza , make sure to follow me on twitter here .
Pizza :
One of my favorite things to make .
There are so many challenging variables in creating a perfect pizza , many that are nearly impossible to control completely .
Oven temperatures , yeast activity , ambient humidity , protein content in the flour , etc .
As hard as it is , even a failed pizza tastes pretty amazing .
But when the variables all line up , it ’s a truly magical experience .
I ’ve worked in pizzerias in high school and college , taken pizza classes , and spent countless hours reading books and websites in search of the perfect pizza .
And still , after many years of learning and experimenting and eating lots of great pies , I am still working to master many specific parts of the process .
Currently , I ’m working on using wild yeast for a rich flavorful sourdough .
The first attempt worked out great–made the best batch of pizza I ’ve ever made , but the second time the dough lacked the elasticity and strength to hold itself together well , and pulled apart easily while being shaped .
Regardless , we cooked on the grill and the pies turned out very tasty .
Two resources that I ’ve found that have been a good guide : the A16 Pizzeria cookbook ( my favorite pizzeria in San Francisco ) , and S. John Ross ’ Sourdough Bread : How To Begin website .
And I just upgraded to a KitchenAid mixer finally , with 575 watts of dough - kneading power under the hood .
I hope to have a solid grasp on the sourdough by the Spring .
And then its back to the garden to grow those tomatoes …
Here ’s a photo recap of four years of tasty pizzas I ’ve cooked and enjoyed .
By urging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid a public option compromise , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel further alienated the progressive community .
On Monday , the Progressive Change Campaign Committee , which has already released an ad blasting Emanuel for " undermining " the public option , began circulating a petition to " hold Rahm accountable . "
So far , over 1,500 people have signed on .
MOSCOW —
An unprecedented exhibition opened in Moscow Friday of nude prints with scrawled comments apparently written by former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin that make ribald references to his party comrades .
Titled “ Messages from the Great Leader : Stalin ’s Autographs , ” the week - long exhibition shows prints of 19th - and 20th - century art works that Stalin is said to have defaced with messages in coloured pencil .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Ginger bastard Radek , if he had n’t pissed against the wind , if he had n’t been angry , he would be alive , ” he wrote across the leg of a weighty male nude .
The macabre comment was an apparent reference to Karl Radek , the former head of the international communist organisation , the Comintern , believed to have been shot dead by Stalin ’s secret police in 1939 .
Another comment refers to Marxist theorist Georgy Plekhanov , who opposed the October Revolution .
The writer scribbles on a drawing of a nude man , “ Plekhanov , why are you pointing backwards ?
Coward and enemy of the people . ”
Other comments are simply coarse jokes about nudity .
“ Do n’t sit with a bare arse on stones , ” Stalin writes on a drawing of a man sitting on a pedestal .
“ Give the boy some pants . ”
The collection was preserved by people who worked in Stalin ’s security service , said the organisers who include the popular online newspaper gazeta.ru .
But the owner of the collection wants to remain anonymous .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We found them more than a year ago , and we decided first of all to show them and then publish something ( on Gazeta.ru ) , ” said organizer Yury Pankov , who heads a publishing house called Avtograf Veka .
The show is taking place at the Marat Guelman gallery in central Moscow , one of post - Soviet Russia ’s first and best - known private art galleries .
It opens ahead of the 130th anniversary of Stalin ’s official birthday amid controversy about the popularity in Russia of the leader who led Russia to victory in World War II but is also blamed for the deaths of millions .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rebutting any notion the jottings could be fake , the organisers display a certificate signed by a expert from the interior ministry who examined the handwriting and said it was genuine .
Most of the drawings are signed with a flamboyant “ J Stalin ” .
ADVERTISEMENT
The collection “ was stored by family members , people who once worked with Stalin , they were guards .
It ’s the personal archives of workers of KGB , ” said one of the exhibition ’s organisers , Viktor Turshatov .
The prints were issued in the late 1940s , meaning that Stalin wrote the comments at around the age of 70 , Turshatov said .
“ Here there are just some flashes of his subconscious .
Stalin is talking with his former acquaintances , friends , partners , comrades in the party , like a lot of old people talk to photographs , but here he even corresponds with them . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
At a Sotheby ’s auction in New York last week , a letter signed by Stalin was sold for 12,500 dollars .
But the exhibition organisers said they had no idea how much the drawings could be worth .
“ You can only find out the value at open auctions , and so far no one knows , because it ’s a unique collection , ” Turshatov said .
“ There has n’t been such a precedent with the name of Stalin .
Some reports on the exhibition have suggested that Stalin had homosexual leanings , as most of the drawings are of nude men , and the commentator twice makes jokes about masturbation .
“ Stalin and naked guys : what was between them ? ” a story was headlined in daily Komsomolskaya Pravda .

“ We specially showed these works to psychologists .
They did n’t find any expressions of homosexuality , although this material of course does prompt you to have this thought , ” Turshatov said .
And it 's not a pretty sight :
Hawaii public schools are closed most Fridays , rats scurry across bananas in uninspected stores and there may not be enough money to run the next election .
About the only parts of the state untouched by the foul economy are its sparkling beaches and world - class surfing .[..]
" There is community energy and outrage building up , " said James Koshiba , a co-founder of the activist organization and Web site Kanu Hawaii , speaking about the cuts to education .
" The people have to play a bigger role .
Folks wo n't forget how this unfolds come election time . "
— Hawaii now has the shortest school year in the nation after the state and teachers union agreed to shutter schools for 17 days a year , leaving 171,000 students without class on most Fridays .
Negotiations to reopen them collapsed last week .
—
Food establishments often go uninspected , a fact highlighted by an Internet video showing rats roaming freely across produce in a Honolulu Chinatown market .
The state has just nine health inspectors on Oahu to handle nearly 6,000 markets and restaurants .
—
The state Elections Office said it may not be able to afford a pending special election , which would leave half of the state 's population without representation in the U.S. House of Representatives until September 2010 . —
Homelessness is on the rise as mental health , child abuse , welfare and daycare programs run short on cash .
And next year may be even worse because tax revenues continue to plunge with the economy .
Hawaii is far from alone in cutting the size of government during the global financial downturn , with nearly every state resorting to across - the - board cuts , furloughs or layoffs to make ends meet .
This tiny state of 1.3 million residents faces a projected $ 1 billion budget deficit through June 2011 .
But Hawaii stands apart in how its government shrinkage has ripped into what are generally considered to be core functions : education , public health , elections and services for the disadvantaged .
Gov. Linda Lingle warned that government would not look the same after she ordered most departments to slash their budgets by about 14 percent .
OpenRisc Verilog simulation of serial port communication
OpenRisc is an open source microprocessor architecture ; being it open source , one of the key benefits is the possibility to examine it , compile it and make it work .
OpenCores provides an environment to compile the Verilog RTL description of a OpenRisc system ( called ORPSoC ) and run tests using Icarus Verilog , that is a quite mature FLOSS Verilog compiler and event - driven simulator .
Here is what I did to set up the simulation environment , following the guidelines in the ORPS oC v2 page :
Download the OpenRisc toolchain and install it using the provided script
Download the Orpsocv2 system from Subversion repository
Install Icarus Verilog and GTKWave ( using “ sudo apt - get install verilog gtkwave ” on my Ubuntu box )
Open a terminal and setup the environment , which consists only in adding the “ or32 - elf / bin ” directory to the PATH environment variable ( export PATH = ” $ {HOME}/src/openrisc/or32-elf/bin:${PATH} ” )
With the environment ready , I got into the directory “ orpsocv2 / sim /run ” and run :
make rtl-tests TESTS=uart - nocache UART_PRINTF=1 VCD=1
the command launches the “ uart - nocache ” test , printing on the terminal the bytes coming from the UART and dumping the waveforms into a VCD format file .
The following is the output on - screen of the simulation :
Beginning loop that will complete the following tests : uart - nocache ################################################################################

Hello World . real 40.16 user 39.58 sys 0.52 #### #### Test uart - nocache PASSED #### ####
Test results : 1 out of 1 tests passed
What happened ?
Here is a diagram :
A test program ( uart.c ) is compiled using the OpenRisc toolchain ( or32 - elf-gcc ) , and a memory image is generated ( uart- nocache.vmem ) ; the program takes a string “ Hello World .
” and sends it through the UART one byte at a time .
The program image is used in simulation to fill the RAM .
The Verilog RTL sources , including the OpenRisc core , the UART and the testbench that checks the results , are compiled and then simulated ; the software runs and the simulator prints the characters composing “ Hello World . ” that have been sent to the serial port .
It is shown that the simulation took about 40 seconds to run .
After the simulation is completed , it is possible to examine the waveforms of the digital circuit using the graphical software GTKWave to open “../results/uart-nocache.vcd “ ; this is a screenshot of a part of the simulation ( click it to enlarge ) :
In the image it is captured the printing of the “ H ” character , that in ASCII is coded as 0x48 .
The red vertical line shows the instant in which the OpenRisc writes 0x48 to the UART .
The “ Signals ” panel shows that “ dwb_dat_o ” contains the hexadecimal value “ 48480048 ” written in the hexadecimal address “ dwb_adr_o = 9000000 ” that is the zone of memory that contains the UART .
The byte is then transmitted serially ( and slooowly ) up to the most external signal which is “ uart0_stx_o “ , that can be seen as an external pin of a microchip .
This signal is read by a dedicated UART decoder whose purpose is to construct the transmitted data into the “ tx_byte ” register and print the character to the terminal .
Rightmost in the window , in the last line , the character “ H ” can be seen completely reconstructed , and it will be printed on - screen .
I think that these simulations can be really interesting for those who want to learn about digital electronics , hardware description languages and embedded software development .
It is quite easy , and absolutely free , to start toying with this environment , but the concepts are very similar to the digital design of real chips .
I can picture students using this as a base for a thesis about hardware IP design , or verification methodology , or optimization of simulators .

Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
In a strong blow to one of Mexico 's most notorious drug cartels , Mexico 's navy killed a top drug kingpin in a shootout Wednesday at an upscale resort .
Arturo Beltran Leyva , head of the Beltran Leyva cartel , was killed in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca , the navy said .
Six other cartel members died in the gunbattle at a housing complex called Altitudes , navy spokesman Adm .
Jose Luis Vergara said Thursday .
He added that one of the gang members killed himself as authorities closed in .
Three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades , one fatally , President Felipe Calderon said from the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Navy 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedet Angulo Cordova died while being treated for his injuries , he said .
One of the other two navy men was in serious condition , and the other was in stable condition , Vergara said .
The Beltran Leyva cartel is one of the most violent and feared drug organizations in Mexico .
Authorities presented to the media three people -- two women and a man -- who were arrested in the raid .
Their role with the cartel was not made clear .
The arrested women were identified as Catalina Castro Lopez and Gabriela Vega Perez .
The man 's name was not immediately released .
Arturo Beltran Leyva was one of Mexico's top three most - wanted criminals , Calderon said .
" This operation was the result of an intense intelligence effort by the Mexican navy , " he said .
The cartel is allied with the Gulf cartel in its battle against the Sinaloa organized crime syndicate .
The Beltran Leyva group was formerly allied with the Sinaloa cartel , considered the largest drug - trafficking organization in the nation .
The two other major drug organizations in Mexico are the Juarez and Tijuana cartels .
Beltran Leyva was one of 10 suspected cartel leaders named in a U.S. federal indictment in August on drug trafficking and conspiracy charges .
In a press statement at the time Justice Department said Beltran Leyva was " among the most powerful drug traffickers in Mexico . "
Calderon has targeted drug cartels and organized crime organizations since taking office in December 2006 .
More than 14,000 people have died in drug - related violence in that time span , Mexican officials say .
No other details of Beltran Leyva 's death were immediately available early Thursday .
This month , the U.S. Treasury Department added Hector Leyva and other top cartel figures to a list of " specially designated narcotics traffickers , " a move that freezes any assets they have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits people in the United States from conducting business with them .
Arturo Beltran Leyva was already identified as a kingpin in May 2008 .
In the most recent addition , the U.S. government named a total of 22 members of the Beltran Leyva organization and 10 related companies .
A third brother , Alfredo Beltran Leyva , was arrested by Mexican authorities last year and remains in custody .
U.S. authorities allege that the Beltran Leyva organization focuses on smuggling cocaine and heroin into the United States .
Can Experience be Designed ?
First , think of a number between one and ten .
Then take a step back and look at the words “ User Experience Design ” as if you had never seen them .
Look at them closely until you hear them with the vanilla motor voice of Christopher Walken : USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN .
What do you think ?
Sort of preposterous is n’t it ?
No , not me asking you to do these things , but the idea that someone thinks they can control how you feel .
Would you easily accept that your reading experience here and now was “ designed ” by me the writer ?
Is this you reading these lines in your very special personal way ?
Or is this me letting you read my lines my way ?
Experience and Individuality
We naturally assume the way we experience our world is unique .
The idea that our experience has been shaped by someone else threatens our belief in individuality and personal freedom .
Discussions about the individuality of perception often end in childish lines like “ you do n’t know how I taste my espresso , you ’re not me ” or “ you do n’t know how I experience red — maybe I see red more like you see yellow ” .
Pragmatic Approach
Of course it ’s useless to argue .
But a more pragmatic person will say : well , I do n’t know for sure but judging from your reaction I have no reason to believe that each and every person has a different experience drinking espresso or seeing red .
In fact , there are empirical examples that prove that experience can be premeditated :
Rhetoric : Rhetoric is the art of using language as a means to persuade .
Rhetoric is a set of rules how to use language in order to persuade others .
Rhetoric is language design .
And it works .

And it works .
Movies :
Film language is very complex .
Yet movies are designed in a way that can make people laugh or cry , feel scared or happy .
The way they reach their goal is by design .
And they generally achieve their goal .

And they generally achieve their goal .
Branding :
It is undeniable that what you feel about brands has in one way or another been premeditated .
Brands form tribes .
The feelings people have about products are not different from person to person , they ’re different from group to group .
Brands are designed .
And often with more precision than you ’d think .
Experience can be designed .
All design is experience design .
If anything , this is what makes the notion somewhat silly .
Mind Control ?
So if chances are high that different people perceive things in similar ways , is it possible that someone else controls what we think and feel ?
No .
Not everyone will experience your speech , your movie , your product in the same way .
Joe the Plumber will hate that Obama speech no matter how elaborate , your delicate aunt Rose will hate Pulp Fiction no matter how well you explain its coolness , the graphic designer at Ogilvy will not buy that Windows7 box no matter how fantastic the reviews .
You cannot control people through design , but through design you can control to whom you speak .
Experience design is not a remedy that turns products into miracles that everybody likes .
It will help you speak more efficiently to your target group .
To that end products need to be simplified .
The simpler the product the more character it has , and the more likely it is to be rejected or accepted by a group of customers .
To that end you need to know your customers , and you need to test your designs with your customers .
The chances are high that the number between one and ten I asked you to think about at the beginning of the article was the number seven .
If you got a different number , you ’re really special .
The National Iranian American Council is on high alert after a South Carolina Congressman announced this week that he will introduce legislation which would require the deportation of all Iranians living in America .
The Stop Terrorists Entry Program Act ( STEP ) was first introduced by Rep. J. Gresham Barrett ( R - SC ) in 2003 [ PDF link ] .
The updated version , he explained in a media advisory , would bar citizens of Cuba , Iran , Sudan , Yemen and Syria from entry into the United States .
It would further require citizens of those nations who are legally visiting or residing in the United States to be deported within 60 days .
ADVERTISEMENT
And he ’s doing this as a response to an American who killed 12 other soldiers at Fort Hood , and a Nigerian who allegedly attempted to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day .
If the apparent problems with such a proposal are not not abundantly clear , the Iranian - American blog niacINsight puts it another way : “ The American Army major and Nigerian alleged to have committed those attacks would not have been affected by the STEP Act . ”
“ Twice in the past two months , radical Islamic terrorists have attacked our nation and the Administration has failed to adapt its national security and immigration policies to counter the renewed resolve of those who seek to harm our citizens , ” Barrett opined .
The National Iranian American Council was not amused .
“ At a time of increasing repression in Iran , this proposal will impose even greater burdens on Iranians seeking refuge abroad , ” they insisted .
“ Iranian Americans must unite to tell Congressman Barrett that this legislation is offensive to American principles , harmful to US interests and discriminates against Iranians and Iranian Americans . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A letter that it is urging supporters to send to the congressman insists that being born Iranian or having Iranian parents does not make one more likely or more inclined to become a terrorist .
“ The Iranian people stand opposed to acts of terrorism and even took to the streets en masse to express their solidarity with the United States on September 11 , 2001 , and to express their disgust with the heinous acts committed that day , ” the group pleads .
“ Individuals seeking political or religious asylum or emergency medical treatment may be exempt from these provisions , only after an extensive federal screening , ” Barrett insists at the end of his advisory .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The United States is home to over one million Iranian Americans who will be affected by this bill , ” added the Iranian American Council .
“ Their families will no longer be able to visit , their friends will face deportation , and they will be stigmatized and unjustly scrutinized if this bill becomes law . ”
“ The STEP Act is not only damaging to America ’s reputation , it is also extremely offensive to the Iranian American community , ” the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans ( PAAIA ) , according to Salem News .
“ Iranian Americans are hard working , law abiding citizens who have done much to strengthen the economic and social fabric of the United States .
Furthermore , recent events unfolding in Iran following the disputed June 12th presidential elections highlight the fact that the Iranian people seek democratic freedoms and basic human rights .
In fact , it was the Iranian people who held candle - lit vigils on the streets of Tehran in solidarity with the American people in the days following the 9/11 attacks . ”
Middle age , it oft is said , is when your age starts to show around your middle .
And for men , it seems , the moment is marked by the inexorable rise in the position of their trouser waistband .
A survey shows that the last time most men are able to fasten their trousers around anything resembling a natural waist is at the age of 39 .
After that , the only way is up , or down .
" Over achievers " , as they are known in the rag trade , hoist their trousers so high by the age of 57 the waistband can be just 7in ( 17.8 cm ) under the armpit .
The " under achievers " , making up about 20 % , plump for below , fumbling to fasten belts , buttons and zips they can no longer see .
" The changing fortunes of a man 's trouser waistband can often become a metaphor for his life , " said Paul Baldwin , director of menswear buying for Debenhams , which commissioned the survey to chart the force of gravitational pull beneath the male midriff .
Boys wear their trousers around their waist , the thinnest part of the body between the rib cage and hips , until the age of 12 , because their parents buy their clothing for them , concluded the survey of 1,000 males .
But waistbands plunge with the advent of teenage hormones , plummeting to 5in towards the apex of the hips , and far below the underpants position by the age of 16 .
Dressing for work sees a gradual upward creep between 16 and 20 years .
By 27 , the waistband starts returning to the natural waist , a position largely maintained until the age of 36 , and influenced by factors such as career progression , marriage and impressing prospective in - laws .
The critical turning point is 39 and the demise of the washboard stomach .
And by 45 trousers will be worn at least 2in above the waist , rising to 5in by the age of 57 .
The frailties of old age bring some benefits .
With 65 - year - olds , waistbands are 3in above the waist , and for those aged 75 just an inch .
Baldwin said the research would help designers produce better - fit trousers for men regardless of their age .
" However , our hardest task continues to be persuading men to confront the fact that their trouser waistbands have risen .
From our experience men still prefer to assume that their trousers no longer fit because their legs have suddenly grown . "
Thomas Biskup , developer of ADoM and JADE , has been away from the roguelike development scene for a while .
He asked out sources of information to get up to date , and we recommend ASCII Dreams Column @ Play and roguetemple as some popular blogs ; there is also the Roguebasin Wiki with heaps of information .
Let ’s continue with the interview …
Thomas Biskup : Finally time to catch up … 😉
Santiago Zapata :
This is a bit off topic , but can you tell us what kind of projects is Quinscape currently dedicated to ?
Thomas Biskup :
Yes , now is the right point 🙂 QuinScape itself is involved mostly in building web based applications and portals for business applications ( transaction portals , CRM solutions , etc. ) .
We also have a very neat product on the market which basically revolutionizes the way catalogs are build … by completely automating the process .
If you want to design a catalog for e.g. automotive parts or some kind of store you can describe the CI rules to our system and it then covers the layout part – and it ’s better than a human if the design rules are well formulated .
Our software even won a design price for a catalog in a design competition .
More about that here
Personally I lead the Enterprise Solutions business unit of QuinScape which basically means :
We build complex Java enterprise applications .
The past 2.5 years I spent a lot of time with our OpenSAGA project which just went public ( http://www.opensaga.de, no english pages yet but they will follow in a couple of weeks ) which is going to be an open source project covering some very important German standards for e-government applications .
Basically it ’s a semantically high - level model - driven and generative platform for creating complex Java web applications very efficiently .
I ’m the project lead and the design philosophy behind the platform is very different compared to anything I have seen so far – and it has some major compelling advantages to it .
As well as some peculiar points people usually do not like because we are very pragmatic …
e.g. all models are specified in XML , we require precide modeling and we use a kind of intentional programming approach .
Very different but as far as I am concerned the true next step in application development … at least philosophy - wise even if you might disagree with the specific implementation .

SZ : What are your thoughts on the commercial video game industry ?
where is it heading to ?
TB : Online gaming seems to be getting stronger and stronger .
I never caught up with the trend and find the thought of spending hours and days and weeks with games like WoW… frightening .
I never would want to waste my time like that .
But I ’m probably old fashioned because I definitely would love to waste my life playing face to face roleplaying games for hours and days and weeks 😉
Whatever suits you best 😉
I guess online gaming will become stronger and stronger .
And probably also a lot more interesting for folks like me when technology gets more and more immersive .
Personally I ’m quite fascinated by gaming via mobile devices like the iPhone although I envision quite different kinds of games : a mixture between online gaming and solo playing .
Jochen and I have some very interesting ideas for an iPhone SF game lying around but I ’d be surprised if we get around to tackle that any time soon 😉
Even though I believe it would revolutionize gaming and maybe even create a new genre .
Oh well …
Additionally I believe that we will a trend back towards smaller and simpler games you can play for a couple of minutes on your mobile device .
Also not surprising I guess but a good trend as far as I am concerned as smaller games usually require more compelling design ideas to remain captivating for more than one or two games .
SZ : What advantages and disadvantages do you see on developing for the iPhone platform ?
What will happen when iPhones are out of fashion ?
TB : First of all : Despite wanting to love it I currently despise Objective C on the iPhone .
It ’s so strangely antiquated in some ways and feels so much like a step back from modern programming compared to Java even though it has some need features that I fail to enjoy it .
That ’s one problem I have with the iPhone .
I love the device itself and no longer would want to live without my iPhone .
As for developing … for the kind of games I usually love ( ADOM ) it ’s very hard to do something good with it .
The input barrier is pretty high , the screen too small and I yet have to find a good solution for saving the game state when your program gets interrupted in a complex operation ( e.g. while waiting for input in the depths of a PC - monster - interaction ) .
These things currently prevent us from continuing effectively with iADOM .
But we are working on that 😉
SZ : What about other mobile platforms , have you seen DWELLER ?
TB : No , never heard about it .
As far as I am concerned Google / Android and Apple / iPhone will divide the market with MS being a distant third in a couple of years .
I ’d like to use this platform for a prediction : I hereby predict that Google will be giving away free mobile devices including free phone contracts in at most three years ( probably using VOIP or something like that ) .
Thus they will do away with traditional mobile companies in one decisive swoop and grow even more by gaining a dominating market share in the mobile sector .
Google is the one company I can see to rule the market .
They have all the important content , they have a decent platform with Android and they have a lot of experience earning money with add - on marketing and nothing else .
My bet is on Google for the general market and on Apple for the lifestyle market .
Three years at most … remember that 😉
Right now they are just testing the waters .
SZ : Have you thought on developing or assisting the creation a MMORPG based on Adom , or eventually inducing web interactivity on JADE ?
TB : Yes and no .
Once I was asked to participate in the development of a MMORP based on Gary Gygax ’s Legendary Adventures .
Sadly it never worked out .
My current time limits preclude me from partaking in such ventures without being paid pretty well for it .
So there is no big chance for it .
And what do you mean by web interactivity in JADE ?
I have plans for an online store and some kind of centralized hall of fame , etc .
But for now I would be happy to release some kind of technology study .
That would make me sufficiently happy 😉
SZ : Have you thought on may be allowing other developer to use JADE as an engine for their new games ?
TB : No .
I believe in highly specialized DSLs and JADE is specialized on doing JADE .
I do n’t want to think about it being able to do more .
But the JADE engine tries to provide a lot of extension points ( e.g. pretty simple means to add in new items , monsters , etc. ) because I believe there might be some value in that .
SZ : Will Adom eventually be ported out to Java ? is this impossible ?
TB : I believe it ’s impossible .
So it wo n’t happen .
SZ : Do you know about the 7DRL Challenge ?
Have you thought on participating ?
TB : I have heard about it .
But I would n’t want to spend 5 days of my annual holiday on that .
Just to hard with too little to gain .
IMHO you ca n’t create a worthwhile roguelike in such a short amount of time , so why participate at all 🙂 ?
I applaud everyone who participates and there surely are great results but I ca n’t think of a roguelike I would want to play if it has received less than a couple of 1000 hours of work 😉 DND clones are a different story though .
Did I ever mentioned JDND – the prequel to ADOM – I have lying around on my hard disk since 2004 ?
I should release that at some point but as usual about 10 % are still missing to complete the game .
SZ : Do you think it is important to introduce real role playing elements ( as in Adom the RPG ) into videogames ( including roguelikes ) , as opposed to rollplaying ?
how do you think this could be done ?
TB : I find this very hard because real roleplaying IMHO requires the power of your imagination and the ability to express yourself with almost complete creative freedom – something I can hardly imagine in videogames unless we invent something like the Star Trek holodeck .
For me roguelikes are as close as you can get because they force you to rely on your imagination to a large extent ( e.g. due to lack of graphics ) .
Fable was a decent attempt I liked but I yet have to see Fable II .
SZ : I recommend to check Legerdemain , a nice Java roguelike / IF hybrid
TB : Looks very interesting .
Thanks for the recommendation – I will have a look .
SZ : The IRDC 2009 ( Internation Roguelike Development Conference ) is coming up next november 6 at CERN ( Geneva , Switzerland ) would you eventually attend ?
TB : Sadly 2009 has passed … but yes , I might consider to visit such a conference .
Sounds like a lot of fun 🙂
When is the next one ?
So far I could n’t find anything .
SZ : Thank you for the interview , Mr. Biskup !

As a fellow refugee from family Southern nut conservatism - my grandfather led the movement that ( with HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE by Francis Schaeffer as one of its texts ... ) split the Southern Presbyterian Church in two in the late ' 60s / early 70s - I am so appreciative of your work , Mr. Schaeffer .
I long ago left the church and Christianity ; but I feel that religion does n't have to be bad .
We 've all seen many examples of religious belief helping turn a sad life around .
I hope those who need the love and hope offered by a faith can always get it here in a nation that promises religious freedom .
There are ever - growing numbers of us in the South , I think - folks who hate that the church that preached love and fairness in our youth now seems to emphasize hate and money .
We all suffer the uncomfortable feeling of being preached at , prayed for and dismissed at family gatherings .
We try to appreciate that they grew up in this , but , for whatever reason , never had the need to question such a lifestyle .
It 's easier to believe and follow than to think for oneself for many of them .
My family ( daughters and wife ) does n't want to be with other family members due to the situation .
They live in another world - a world of their own arts , schools , newscasts and persecuted worldview - each reinforcing the other .
Some ( many ? most ? ) of such people are n't true believers but merely folks trying to make an easier buck by playing within the system .
Perhaps they recognize , like right wing pols , that merely displaying a right - wing fool ’s faith can be very good for the bottom line , as the gullible true believers are only too happy to part with their money if it involves dealing with anything claiming the faith .
I think my need to save the world came from my Mississippi Presbyterian youth ; the need to do " the Lawd 's work ; " only I want to save the world now by having free and fair elections everywhere .
Go 'head , Mr. Schaeffer !
Have a blessed day ! :-0 shw

Frank , I must be very dense since I fail to see how the sending of 30,000 additional troops into the quagmire of Afghanistan is the best of several bad choices .
In my ignorant way of thining , Obama 's decision to continue the senseless spilling of blood in a pointless and unwinnable war raises questions about his mental competence .

I find it ironic that some dude who admits to being a " former religious Rightwing agitator " has the audacity to lecture me on how I should bow at the feet of Obama , his new savior .
Has Schaeffer substituted one authority figure for another ?
Dr. Altemeyer , University of Manitoba , describes this type of thinking in his ( free online ) ebook " The Authoritarians " .
His studies influenced John Dean for his book " Conservatives Without Conscience " .
Perhaps Schaeffer should refrain from shouting " STFU " at those who never subscribed to right wing thinking in the first place .

Frank , Brad , Sibel :
You , and the work you do , are why I make a monthly Paypal donation to this website .
I am more moderate than you on many particular issues , mostly about tone .
But this website breaks new ground and takes real risks on core issues that others are too timid , or just too conformist , to take on .
You make me think .
You rekindle the passion for this democracy that periodically cools in the face of unrelenting attacks from the cynical , selfish and callous people who only see government service as a personal opportunity .
I am now old enough to eschew easy victories and moments of supreme triumph .
We do not live in the movies .
Obama still seems , to me , too good to be true .
Let us not put all of the burden on him .
We worked very hard to get him where he is .
He will fail , if we fail .
It is not his country alone to put on the right path again .
It is our path , if we have the guts and stamina to travel it .
I very much appreciate this essay .
It is timely to assess , realistically , this past year .
I have children and grandchildren .
We have a president again .
We have hope .
But we have work to do .

Thank you Frank !
I have been deeply disheartened by the talk of how " disappointed " people are in President Obama to the point of actually being sick at heart .
Sure I would have like all his pledges to be immediately fulfilled but I know realistically they take time .
Perhaps most of the American people do not deserve a quality guy like Obama but deserved or not we have him .
To that I say Harah !

Mr. Schaeffer , you may like to look at the rosier side of everything the president has done .
I do not disagree that some of what you say is true but you also have to look at his shortcomings and not dismiss them outright .
Here are some of his shortcomings :
Yes , Obama said he ceased torture , yet there have been reports that secret sites and renditions have continued .
Obama was a Constitutional Law professor yet he has defended the alterations to the trends and precedents established by the Bush administrations that are unconstitutional , like Patriot Act wiretapping , and holding people with no charges and no chance of court hearings ( except when they know they can win the case ) .
The Bradblog continues to report on the administration 's defense of former governor Siegelman 's conviction and allowed a huckster like former Senator Stevens to go free on technicalities .
Obama did not deserve the peace prize yet .
There were other people / organizations who have been actively involved in peace activities for decades or centuries .
Image is not peace .
Drawing down soldiers does not mean withdrawl , does not mean peace and definitely does not mean numbers will not be increased again .
George Bush was not thoughtful and made decisive and very wrong decisions .
Fighting a drawn out conflict / war in Afghanistan is a no win situation .
In Afghanistan Obama may have been thoughful but just as wrong as Bush .
As Obama 's image in the US goes down so will his image abroad as they realize he is not that much different than previous presidents .
Yes in healthcare insurance companies can not deny people for preexisting conditions , but what will happen to the person making $ 100 K / yr who has a preexisting condition and whose rates skyrocket so that they can not be afforded ( no price caps allowed in the Senate bill ) .
This person will fall through the cracks .
( Makes too much to be helped by the government but not too much that this person could afford 30 % or more of income going to health care .
You may call it stopping the job losses .
I would call it continuing the Reagan era idea of trickledown economics .
If the rich are protected and doing well they will allow some of their money to trickle down to the rest of us .
We propped up the rich , and they have not reciprocated .
We should have propped up the poor and those being evicted , which would have balanced the bad books of the banks and avoided massive homelessness and displacement of thousands or millions of citizens .
There are many reasons to be highly skeptical of Obama and his administration .
I would like him to succeed but putting too much faith in politicians is a recipe for disappointment .
His poll numbers are changing because a number of people on the left are disppointed in the presidents actions or inactions of issues that are important to us .

What sophistry .
I'm a 56 year old voter , registered Democrat since I could vote .
I actually do vote every election and am do the boring work of a precinct committee person ( get out the vote , distribute leaflets , etc. ) and I know false arguments when I see them .
I wonder why you are trying so hard .
You start out by insulting everyone , and creating a false equivalence ( the hate - filled Right and the easily distracted Left ) and then create straw man arguments which you easily burn down .
Just one example , of many :
" since all gay rights battles had not been fully won within virtually minutes ... they 'd been betrayed ! "
All of the gays I know are not concerned with what Obama has not done .
They are concerned with what he has done .
Your exaggeration of their position is completely fake .
Here 's what Obama has actually done in this first year for gays :
1 ) On day one , to perform the invocation of his hope and change administration , he invited a right - wing Christian minister who had actively been engaged in public gay hate speech and felt perfectly comfortable lying about it on television .
Obama could have chosen any number of ministers , Christian or otherwise , but he chose one of the biggest dicks in the anti gay movement .
2 ) Changed his public commitment on " do n't ask , do n't tell " from the campaign and post - inauguration promise of ' repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy ' to ' supports changing " Do n't Ask Don't Tell in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces ' .
This was a clear walking back from a firm campaign promise .
He also allowed executive branch spokespeople to go out and publicly announce that there would n't be any action on this in the near future .
3 ) He had made a campaign promise to eliminate the Federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) .
Instead of acting on that promise , he first eliminated the promise from his website .
( This is how it starts . )
His justice department then went on to defend DOMA in court saying first that it would preserve scarce government resources to be able to deny equal benefits to same sex partners and surviving spouses of same - sex marriages .
In the brief they even go so far as to use the laws against incest and child marriage laws to justify the constitutionality of DOMA .
He did n't have to defend the law in court .
Other presidents have filed briefs opposing current laws when they felt they were unconstitutional .
This was a deliberate act .
4 ) And this month the Obama administration refused to follow a federal judge 's order to provide insurance benefits to the wife of a lesbian court employee in San Francisco .
They are actually defying a federal judge in order to enforce their strict interpretation of the law which the judge says is invalid in order to deny benefits to the same sex spouse of a legally married court employee .
They do n't have to defy a judge to continue to enforce DOMA .
They could do what most law abiding people do when a judge tells them to do something .
Is it any wonder that gay activists are organizing a contribution boycott of Obama and the Democratic leadership .
It has nothing to do with what they * have n 't* done .
It 's about actions , not words .
( With Obama , the words are eloquent , but they are still cheap . )
This story could be repeated for issues involving torture , the civil and privacy rights of citizens , the explicit double cross about the importation of drugs ( They said the were for it , then they actively blocked it in Congress , then they said they were still for it .
Their talk really is cheap . ) and more .
Obama 's actions have been so far to the right of center that many people ( yourself included ) can't believe what they are seeing .

My 2 cents Frank ....
It seems that you 're considerably to the right politcally than most of us here at Bradblog ... that 's fine .
I think your political views ( center - right ) make Obama 's decisions fine with you ... again fine .
But your judgements of our disappointments with Obama is very unfair ... Obama 's seemingly clever or cynically creating a expectation for progressives that he had NO INTENTION of delivering on makes me feel had ...
Your judgements about our criticisms of Obama makes me wonder ... when is it fair to call bullshit , bullshit ?
We better be holding Obama 's ass to the fire ... it's what all democratically elected officials should endure .
In my opinion Obama has folded on , sold out and pussy footed those that elected him ... Obama seems to be a corporate lapdog .
Damn right we 'll call him out on that .

... Sally Hill said on 12/21/2009 @ 3:45 pm PT ...
I did n't BEGIN to be disappointed in Obama after he got in office - I was disappointed that he was even elected in the first place .
You seem to have replaced your love for God with your love for Obama - shame on you .
You state that his critics are not appreciative of his successes - I ask what successes ?
- Continued the draw down the misbegotten war in Iraq
We will NEVER leave Iraq - not even Obama will draw down the troops there - I will at least give him credit to know that once we have started that war , we must finish it .
- Thoughtfully and decisively picked the best of several bad choices regarding the war in Afghanistan
You feel that waiting 3 months to make the decision was good enough ?
I 'm not sure we should be in Iraq OR Afghanistan , but for God 's sake - if our men and women are there , we should support them !
NO - he was not successful in dealing with the Afgan war .
-
Gave a major precedent - setting speech supporting gay rights
I really have no input on this issue - it would seem though , the gay 's are not happy with his delayed and half - hearted speech .
- Restored America 's image around the globe
Are you referring to the mocking and testing of US limits that nations around the globe are now engaging in ?
We 've not seen this type of aggressive behavior from nations in a very long time .
- Banned torture of American prisoners
I guess you 've not heard of rendition - a practice that both Bush and now OBAMA CONTINUES to engage in .
- Stopped the free fall of the American economy
Really ?
How so ?
Are you referring to the way we are monetizing our own debt - printing money day and night - and the continued fall of the US dollar ? -
Put the USA squarely back in the bilateral international community
Oh , you mean the way he alienates allies like Israel , Britain , and France , yet embraces Islamic and African nations ? -
Put the USA squarely into the middle of the international effort to halt global warming
oh yeah , that meeting at Copenhagen went SO well - NOT .
- Stood up for educational reform
I must have missed this one entirely .
Perhaps he did that when he placed his daughters in PRIVATE school , rather than in public school .
- Won a Nobel peace prize
For doing what exactly ?
Perhaps the Nobel committee knew he was sending 30,000 troops to Afghanistan - yeah , that 's it ! -
Moved the trial of terrorists back into the American judicial system of checks and balances
Yes , so the terrorists can make a mockery of our judicial system and KSM can walk out of the courtroom a free man with knowledge of many foreign secrets obtained through discovery .
This is exactly what New York needed in the way of added financial burden on a state already going bankrupt .
- Did what had to be done to start the slow , torturous and almost impossible process of health care reform that 7 presidents had failed to even begin
Oh , are you talking about the corrupt backroom deals being made to buy the needed votes for bills are are written in the dead of night behind closed doors that the Senators themselves , let alone the American public have no clue what they contain ?
I have no problem with health care reform , I have a problem with continued corruption and passing a bill ( any bill ) in order to be able to claim victory , no matter what the cost to the American people or what the legislation says .
- Responded to hatred from the Right and Left with measured good humor and patience
Oh , are you referring to wanting to shut down Fox , talk radio , and the Internet because that 's where his dissenter 's are coming from ?
Or perhaps you are referring to the many lies that keep spewing from his lips in good humored response to all that opposition .
- Stopped the free fall of job losses
Yes , yes , yes !
The way he promised that if we were to HURRIEDLY pass that Stimulus bill , unemployment would not exceed 8 % !
Yeah , I noticed it was over 10 % , but I guess you are not counting that ?
Or maybe you are referring to the fact that each one of those jobs he created with that pork ridden stimulus bill costs well over $ 100 K EACH ! -
Showed immense personal courage in the face of an armed and dangerous far Right opposition that included the sort of disgusting people that show up at public meetings carrying loaded weapons and carrying Timothy McVeigh - inspired signs about the " blood of tyrants " needing to " water the tree of liberty " ...
Last time I checked , this was a free country - are you suggesting that it should n't be ?
Are you suggesting that we should not be free to show up in protest at public meetings ?
Are you also suggesting that ONLY the far right showed up ?
You are wrong - moderates as well a far left showed up armed in protest .
- Showed that he could not only make the tough military choices but explain and defend them brilliantly
I must have missed that brilliant explanation .
Of course , every time I try and watch his ping - pong speeches , I 'm lulled to sleep from the boring sound of his droning voice .
He has YET to explain Health Care - simply because I do n't even think HE knows what is in those bills !
He has yet to give a good reason why it took him 3 months to make a decision with such few options .
I think you are picking and choosing the good that you see Obama doing and not focusing on his actions as a whole .
I can deal with most of the policy changes , I can deal with governing from the left , but I sense and feel a growing divide and uneasy feeling with foreign affairs - never have we had so many nations testing and pushing the limits as we have now .
Never have we had so many outspoken rulers mocking and chiding our president until now .
Obama 's inability to deal effectively with foreign nations and rogue rulers makes me quite uneasy and fearful of what the future could possibly bring due to his lack of experience and ability to make quick and informed decisions .

Mr. Schaeffer , I Crazy for God and liked it and respect you for it all .
But I must respond to your list of so - called accomplishments .
And I 'm only scratching the surface here , others have written far better than I ( see Drew Weston in today HuffPo for example )
Continued the draw down the misbegotten war in Iraq -- Not true .
Thoughtfully and decisively picked the best of several bad choices regarding the war in Afghanistan -- Sure - and escalated into Pakistan .
Possibly Yemen soon .
Gave a major precedent - setting speech supporting gay rights --
Guy talks a good game for sure .
Yet DOJ has further litigated against gay rights ( I think Brad blogged on this ) Restored America 's image around the globe -- Really ?
The world thinks he 's full of crap after his bullshit appearance and hissy demands in Copenhagen .
And for receiving Nobel while escalating American Imperialism even further than Bush , if possible .
Banned torture of American prisoners --
Talks a good game .
Still black sites torturing & CIA torturing .
Has not repealed policy .
Stopped the free fall of the American economy -- Yup , no more free fall for banker boys !!!
Put the USA squarely back in the bilateral international community -- Huh ?
Too much for one sentence .
Put the USA squarely into the middle of the international effort to halt global warming -- See above re Copenhagen .
Listen to Democracy Now ! this morning .
Not so much .
Stood up for educational reform -- Huh ?
Hired Arne Duncan who wants to privatize education and also have military schools and is funding these schools for lower grades even as we speak .
Even Obama would n't send his kids to public school in Chicago .
Won a Nobel peace prize -- See above .
An embarassment .
Moved the trial of terrorists back into the American judicial system of checks and balances -- OK .
For 2 or 3 .
The rest are military commissions and stuck in jail .
Oh and he also has initiated " preventive detention . "
Did what had to be done to start the slow , torturous and almost impossible process of health care reform that 7 presidents had failed to even begin -- the biggest corporate giveaway to the Medical Industrial Complex and private corporations ever ( well , except for the recent bank bailouts ) .
Will break the American people who cannot afford forced overpriced payments to private insurers while still having to pay for most of their own health care needs due to high co-pays , deductibles , even further lossening of regulations .
Oh , and women lose even more abortion rights .
Nice touch .
Oh , and let Joe Lieberman look like it was his fault there 's no public option and extended Medicare , when in fact it 's exactly the bill White House wanted from the beginning .
Lied to American people .
Big time .
Responded to hatred from the Right and Left with measured good humor and patience -- that 's a good thing ?
The Right and the Left are not equal .
He should call out the crazy people .
The so - called " left " who want single payer / public option ???
They 're the majority of Americans .
The so - called " left " who want us out of Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan ??
They 're the majority of Americans .
Everyone should take the " left / right " name - calling and shove it , it 's bullshit .
Stopped the free fall of job losses NOT .
Not even close .
Numbers are not falling as fast right now BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS WORK .
Will plunge drastically in January .
The only time Americans will stop losing jobs is when minimum wage in China and Mexico rises to $ 6 an hour and when all wages in U.S. fall to $ 6 .
Showed immense personal courage in the face of an armed and dangerous far Right opposition that included the sort of disgusting people that show up at public meetings carrying loaded weapons and carrying Timothy McVeigh - inspired signs about the " blood of tyrants " needing to " water the tree of liberty " ... ????
Showed that he could not only make the tough military choices but explain and defend them brilliantly Guys a good speaker .
And a liar .

I 've got my own differences with Frank 's position , but I 'll raise them on air next week when I 'm guest hosting the Mike Malloy Show ( from Dallas ! ) and Frank will be one of my guests .
For now then , I can't help but respond to a few of Sally Hill 's ridiculous comments to Frank 's piece .
She said :
You feel that waiting 3 months to make the decision was good enough ?
I 'm not sure we should be in Iraq OR Afghanistan , but for God 's sake - if our men and women are there , we should support them !
Sorry , gotta call bullshit wingnut - ism here .
Fact is , whether you like the decision Obama eventually made , he took an appropriate amount of time in an appropriately deliberative process .
Gen. McChrystal made his private recommendations , and asked for action to be taken in 2010 .
Obama is doing exactly that .
Criticize Obama 's eventual decision all you like , but please spare us the " we should support [ the troops ] ! " bullshit .
Obama has , so far , been FAR more supportive of the troops than Bush ever was , in more ways than there are pixels here to enumerate .
And I have skin this game in Afghanistan .
The troops are not anymore yours to use as political chess pieces than they were for Bush or they would be for Obama now .
NO - he was not successful in dealing with the Afgan war .
Frank never asserted that he was .
Argue his point , if you wish , but you are not welcome to make one up out of whole clothe .
Obama 's success or failure in Afghanistan has n't even begun to reveal itself either way , as I suspect you know .
Or would be , if your partisanship had n't otherwise blinded you so .
- Restored America 's image around the globe
Are you referring to the mocking and testing of US limits that nations around the globe are now engaging in ?
We 've not seen this type of aggressive behavior from nations in a very long time .
Just how delusional are you ?
If there was any question of that , your comment above should clarify it to those who are still in touch w/ reality .
-
Put the USA squarely into the middle of the international effort to halt global warming
oh yeah , that meeting at Copenhagen went SO well - NOT .
Believe it did n't ?
You may be right .
Believe it would have gone better without Obama 's last minute intervention ?
If so , you have no clue what happened in Copenhagen .
- Moved the trial of terrorists back into the American judicial system of checks and balances
Yes , so the terrorists can make a mockery of our judicial system and KSM can walk out of the courtroom a free man with knowledge of many foreign secrets obtained through discovery .
This is exactly what New York needed in the way of added financial burden on a state already going bankrupt .
Your concern for NY 's economy is moving .
That said , did I miss your objections when Bush tried terrorists in the U.S. courts ?
Or when Clinton tried them in NY ?
Or when Guilliani lauded both of them for having done so ?
( See above ref to your sad , blind partisanship . )
As to " walk[ing ] out of the courtroom a free man " , Obama 's already said that 's not going to happen , which is , I should add , to his shame .
If you want to criticize Obama here , it 's for the rigged system of justice that he 's agreed to continue from the Bush Administration , though , to be fair , that administration did n't leave him with many choices , having committed so many war crimes we are left with almost no other options beyond using a rigged judicial system of " justice " or letting all of those held and tortured illegally ( like KSM ) walk free .
- Responded to hatred from the Right and Left with measured good humor and patience
Oh , are you referring to wanting to shut down Fox , talk radio , and the Internet because that 's where his dissenter 's are coming from ?
If you believe he " want[ed ] to shut down Fox , talk radio , and the Internet " , you are either pathetic misinformed , or deranged with tea baggery .
I 'll welcome you to share your evidence of any attempt by Obama to " shut down Fox , talk radio , and the Internet " .
You have none , other than horseshit you 've been fed by Fox " News " who count on suckers like you believing their bullshit .
- Stopped the free fall of job losses
Yes , yes , yes !
The way he promised that if we were to HURRIEDLY pass that Stimulus bill , unemployment would not exceed 8 % !
Yeah , I noticed it was over 10 % , but I guess you are not counting that ?
Uh , feel free to share with us his " promise " to that end .
I 'll look forward to your quote .
( Though I 'll be waiting a life time for it , of course . )
Last time I checked , this was a free country - are you suggesting that it should n't be ?
Are you suggesting that we should not be free to show up in protest at public meetings ?
Your " patriotism " and " love of country " is impressive !
But , um , where was vitriol when Bush was arresting folks for wearing anti-Bush T - shirts to rallies ?
Or even for wearing anti-Iraq t- shirts to State of the Union Speeches ?
Or did you only become " patriotic " recently ?
Feel free to point me to your outraged comments attacking Bush when he did that , and I " ll be free to apologize .
I can deal with most of the policy changes , I can deal with governing from the left Me too .
Wish he would .
Lemme know when that happens .
but I sense and feel a growing divide and uneasy feeling with foreign affairs
Then join the rest of us in the real world , by watching something other than Fox " News " .
never have we had so many nations testing and pushing the limits as we have now .
See above .
Seriously , Glenn Beck wo n't take it personally .
Never have we had so many outspoken rulers mocking and chiding our president until now .
Seriously , have you been on a different planet for the last 8 years ?!
Obama 's inability to deal effectively with foreign nations and rogue rulers makes me quite uneasy and fearful Ah , " fearful " .
There 's the key .
Fox " News " = mission accomplished on that point .
Try turning it off .
The fear may instantly vanish .
Or you can keep cowering under your desk , and duct - taping your windows so those skeery skeery evil turrists do n't getcha !
his lack of experience and ability to make quick and informed decisions .
Well , your man Bush made " quick " decisions anyway .
The informed part ?
Um , not so much .
Thank god in heaven that he 's gone .
And the cleanup from the disaster continues .
Thanks for reminding us ...

But wait !
In tonight 's exciting episode of " Punch the Dirty Fucking Hippies ! "
I 've yet to see a solipsisization of exactly why we 're paying Blackwater to slaughter dozens of exactly 30 random people in Pakistan with a Hellfire MAC missile every time a Pakistani with a grudge drops a rupee on a neighbor they 're not fond of .
( That 's the amazing power of American technology !
Collateral losses from these drone strikes are always 30 people ... exactly !
Who'd have thought that an anti-tank missile retrofitted with a thermobaric warhead would have such precise discrimination ? )
Anyway ... your premise is still as full of holes as it was when you essayed this topic a few days ago .
This is your second attempt at a " Redeem Obama " article , and while it is better thought out than your first attempt you are still avoiding the worst of what Obama has done in your attempts to paper over his failings with what you argue are his " successes " .
I could spend the evening composing a point - by - point refutation of your claims but I 'm tired so for now I 'll just pick one that shows clearly the peculiar set of filters you 're viewing Obama through : " Moved the trial of terrorists back into the American judicial system of checks and balances
( But that was n't good enough for his critics ) "
You misspelled that .
Let me help you ...
" Moved the trial of certain selected accused terrorists back into the American judicial system while simultaneously declaring their guilt in advance over national media ... while also at the same time condemning other accused terrorists to military show trials and / or indefinite detention and forever denying them their day in a real court because the evidence to convict them was either non-existent and / or was obtained by torture . "
Get it ?
You can't trumpet the trials in NYC while at the same time carefully ignoring the people who are being denied trials .
That 's your difficulty in a nutshell .
As for the health care reform health insurance reform corporate feudalism that Obama coerced out of the Senate ... and his and Emanuel 's fingerprints are all over that bloody hatchet ... well you might want to try reading about what your favorite corporate tool ... has actually done to us with regard to his ' promises ' ... ... and then you might begin understand why , in his haphazard attempts to avoid a repeat of the 1994 Dem electoral route by punching the Dirty Fucking Hippies as hard as he can while simultaneously sweet - talking them , Obama is actually insuring that 1994 will happen all over again for Dems .
But that 's okay too , as his real masters will be served no matter what and Obama will be duly rewarded .
No , Obama will " win " only in as much as he will see to it that the corporations are appeased and that the oligarchs are mollified .
That 's his day job and Obama regards we , the people , as only pawns in the multidementional chess games he plays while kowtowing to the elites .

I agree with Terry Cardwell - Obama is doing exactly what he said he would as he campaigned .
Why must everyone continue with the Bush this and Bush that , and a huge mess to clean up .
Yada , yada , yada .
Is this meant to imply that Obama had no clue who the previous president was and what a mess he had made of things ?
You mean to tell me he had no idea of what he was getting himself into ?
Perhaps people forget that the Dems controlled Congress for the last 2 years of the Bush Admin - just who 's mess is he really trying to clean up .... Barney Frank's , Chris Dodd's , and Waxman 's perhaps ?
And Obama campaigned for a job that he seemingly wanted , then he wants to take office and act like he had no idea of the mess Bush and the Dems made and wants to continue to whine incessantly about it .
I 'm thinking he could have stopped campaigning and dropped out of the race if he felt it was just too overwhelming of a job for him , or he felt inept to handle the mess .
Seems to me , he had no clue and was too egotistical to drop out even though it would appear that the job is over his head .
And Frank - what part of my post said I watched Fox ?
What part of my post said Bush was ' my man ' ?
That 's that I thought .
Yes , I do watch Fox - at times , along with CNN and I listen to radio shows across the board , not just conservative talk .
I visit many blogs , not just this one .
I had no clue this blog was in existence when Bush was president or perhaps you would have seen my rantings about his poor decisions and my opposition to his actions - the very same actions that Obama continues to this day .
How could I possibly be against Obama and support Bush ?
They are one in the same , there is no difference in the two administrations .
If you dislike Bush , then you dislike Obama - if you like Bush , then you like Obama .
That 's pretty simple .
I 'm glad you think KSM will get a rigged trial and be found guilty irregardless of procedure .
You have more faith in what Obama says than I .
I do hope and pray that I am wrong and you are right .
The man is guilty , he stated that of his own free will and asked to be put to death for his crimes .
Why in the hell does Holder and Obama feel that they must now try him and in a civilian court no less ?
My guess is it is a back door way to put the Bush administration on trial , what they wanted to do in the first place .
For that , I have no problems , but what goes around , comes around .
At some point , Obama will no longer be president - and there is no telling what crimes the next administration might decide the Obama administration committed .
This is the exact reason why this must not be allowed to happen - why administrations need not speak ill of the previous administrations - for eventually , they will be the previous administration .
Unless Obama plans to be the last administration prior to creating a One World Government and being World President - which I do believe he has already started campaigning for .
Do I believe he accomplished anything at Copenhagen - NO !
I think he made the US look weak and accomplished not a single thing .
Funny , lots of commentators on both CNN and Fox feel the same way I do about his appearance there .
If you want to play semantics , then I 'm wrong , Obama never stated that unemployment would n't go over 8 % - but his administration did publish a report showing a graph of unemployment numbers with and without the stimulus .
I guess any report generated by the Obama Admin does n't necessarily mean Obama supports it .
LOL
" Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create between three and four million jobs by the end of 2010 .
The report also includes a graphic predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus .
Without the stimulus ( the baseline ) , unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010 .
With the stimulus , they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009 . "
Since then , the Obama Admin has indicated that they projected the wrong numbers .
Hummm ... how about that .
And are you disputing the fact that the Stimulus bill was RUSHED through Congress ?
or were you just playing semantics with me on what Obama actually ' said ' ?
I noticed your Alinsky style of attacks , more so toward the end of your response to me .
I 'm an America , if you are an American too , then we are on the same side and there should be no name calling or insults hurled at each other .
Grow up !
Debate the issues and stop trying to intimidate with your insults - it wo n't work .

Perhaps people forget that the Dems controlled Congress for the last 2 years of the Bush Admin - just who 's mess is he really trying to clean up .... Barney Frank's , Chris Dodd's , and Waxman 's perhaps ?
No. Bush 's .
And the Republicans ' .
And Frank - what part of my post said I watched Fox ? ...
Yes , I do watch Fox You do n't say .
And you 're replying to me , not Frank .
I was the one who blasted you in the previous comment , not Frank .
He 's the one who wrote the original article above .
I had no clue this blog was in existence when Bush was president or perhaps you would have seen my rantings about his poor decisions and my opposition to his actions Cool .
Then you should be able to point us to links from all those blog comments you made elsewhere to show us that disdain .
I believe I requested a link in my reply above , to your previous comments expressing your outrage for Bush trying terrorists in American courts .
Got such a link ?
( Along with any of the others I requested , like evidence of Obama trying to shut down Fox , or any of the other substantless allegations you made in your original comment above ? )
I 'm glad you think KSM will get a rigged trial and be found guilty irregardless of procedure .
" Irregardless " is not a word .
Just FYI . ( re : KSM )
The man is guilty , he stated that of his own free will and asked to be put to death for his crimes .
Why in the hell does Holder and Obama feel that they must now try him Um , cuz that 's what we do in this country , according to the U.S. Constitution , that you must also disdain ?
As to what he admitted " of his own free will " , what did he admit ?
What makes you think it was of his own free will as opposed to having done so under repeated torture ?
And , even it was , you 've never heard of someone confessing to a crime they never committeed ?
Really ?
Yes , that 's why we have a judicial system .
If you do n't care for it , please move to Iran or N. Korea , or wherever your sense of morality and justice might find a better match than it does here in the U.S.A .
My guess is it is a back door way to put the Bush administration on trial , what they wanted to do in the first place .
I wish !
But your evidence for them " want[ing ] to do [ that ] in the first place " is what exactly ?
The fact that they did n't ???
there is no telling what crimes the next administration might decide the Obama administration committed .
This is the exact reason why this must not be allowed to happen - why administrations need not speak ill of the previous administrations - for eventually , they will be the previous administration . .
No .
That is why we have a justice system which holds trials in public , so no adminstration can hold someone guilty for a crime they did n't commit ( at least that 's the theory , anyway . )
If Obama commits any crimes he should be held accountable for it .
I can't believe you just announced that all Presidents should be above the law .
Have I mentioned the great fit you seem to be with the governments of Iran and N. Korea ?
I hear the Taliban is looking for fresh leadership ?
Are you available to relocate ?
Do I believe he accomplished anything at Copenhagen - NO !
I think he made the US look weak and accomplished not a single thing .
Funny , lots of commentators on both CNN and Fox feel the same way I do about his appearance there .
Well , then , that 's evidence enough for me !
BTW , what was the agreement Obama was able to broker in Copenhagen ?
Do you have any idea ?
Or will you answer be as utterly bereft of any actual information as this one was in reply to my first comment to you ?
If you want to play semantics , then I 'm wrong , Obama never stated that unemployment would n't go over 8 % - but his administration did publish a report showing a graph of unemployment numbers with and without the stimulus .
" Semantics " , telling the truth , whatever .
As a reminder , you said , in your first reply : he promised that if we were to HURRIEDLY pass that Stimulus bill , unemployment would not exceed 8 % !
Yeah , I noticed it was over 10 % , but I guess you are not counting that ?
So he made no such " promise " ?
And you 're admitting you either lied or got it entirely wrong ?
Good .
That 's the right thing to do .
Please avoid knowing disinformation again here in the future , as that is one of the few posted rules we have here that , when broken , will get you banned .
Beyond that , I have no idea what you are quoting in your graf which includes quotes , so it 's pointless to comment to that .
And are you disputing the fact that the Stimulus bill was RUSHED through Congress ?
or were you just playing semantics with me on what Obama actually ' said ' ?
I do n't think either Frank or I suggested it was n't rushed through .
And thankfully so .
They are to be commended for acting so quickly and judiciously .
Too bad they did such a crappy job in the bargain of writing the actual bill .
I noticed your Alinsky style of attacks , more so toward the end of your response to me .
Who is Alinsky ?
And why do Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh and now Sally Hill keep referencing him or her ?
I suspect that 's another answer I wo n't get from Sally .
As I suspect she does n't know who Alinsky is either , other than what Glenn and Rush has told her about him / her , whoever he / she is .
But yeah , other than that , thanks for noting my Alinsky style of attacks !
If you like those , you should see my Shmolinsky style of wardrobe !

No , that was more of a generic plea for people to stand with him against the rising tide of Obama criticism .
He also lashed out at public school teachers , of all people , for supposedly leading a conspiracy against Obama .
( Then again Obama is spending a lot of quality executive time lashing out at public school teachers by corporatizing schools right and left so I guess Frank 's attack fit that mold . )

comments 8 and 9 are sharp and well aimed .
14 as ever is spot on .
18 is scary sharp and brings most of my points home well .
Frank , I appreciate your changed perspective and efforts to learn more .
We 're all working at that same task .
What most of us here are trying to say nicely is " Learn faster dude .
And help us to learn faster too .
Take a look at past predictions of folk like Matt Taibbi and Elliot Spitzer and Dmitry Orlov .
Then take a look at their accuracy .
Finally please take a much longer look at what they 're saying today .
Obama has changed the tone of the administration 's propaganda .
He 's moving Bush / Cheney agenda more aggressively than they did .
One of the wisest points I 've heard raised in the last month is that Obama is doing exactly what he stated .
That statement is accurate in that he 's doing exactly what realists like Naomi Klein outlined any real Friedman student will do as a died in the wool NeoLiberal .
Where Obama flat out lied is in the statements obviously intended to woo Progressives .
Statements about plans to support labor and rein in out of control robber barons ( naming some of them like Walmart ) , renegotiating NAFTA , bringing back Constitutional Law , bringing meaningful change throughout our system .
Frank .
No meaningful change has taken place .
It 's all gotten worse .
Granted , the ship of state he pledged to turn around is n't going to change directions quickly nor easily .
He is n't turning at all though .
In fact , he 's accelerating in the wrong directions even while Rahm and all argue and slap down the Progressives in their own party as they protect the demagogues like Lieberman and the wingnut Repugs and Dems .
So Frank , please save the strawman arguments for a less well informed crowd .
Brad and all support our literacy well .
Please try to keep up with us all better .
And good luck on Mike Malloy 's show next week .
I wanna see you do well so I can get help relating in some meaningful manner with my still religious right family and friends .
Thank you Brad and all , JN
ps .
Let 's all keep in mind how aggressively and effectively Rahm , Barak and Biden are protecting US war criminals while refusing to fulfill their duty as protectors of Constitutional Law .
Hell they have n't even fired Karl Rove 's handpicked US Attorneys .
pps. comments 25 and 26 rock too .
I keep forgetting all the corporate oligarchic fascist takeovers BushBama 's rushing through .
Probably easier to look up the staff he 's assembled ( when he was n't busy purging real Progressives ) and their careers .
Arne Duncan ?
Tim Geitner ?
Ben Bernanke ?
Leura Canary ?
Rahm Emmanuel ?
His choices for watchdogs of industry from the biggest offenders in industry ?
Monsanto ?
Diebold ?.....
Seriously , why does n't he save us all the hassle and just openly put Rove back in his old office space ?

LOL
It 's become so common place , it must be in your rule book that the Obama camp gives those that are paid bloggers or either just volunteer for the job .
Am I admitting I was wrong ?
Did I lie ?
- NO , but if it makes you feel better to think I was and did , go right ahead , or ban me if it would help .
I gave you a quote from their campaign that backed up what I paraphrased - if you do n't believe it - then do some research , it 's out there .
Why does everyone have to be wingnuts and whatever else you call people just because they have a different opinion ?
I have argued with you just fine without resorting to calling you names or trying to degrade you in any way .
It 's called respect for your fellow American - too bad the nation as a whole no longer sees such an attribute as important .
People 's blogs go into archives after awhile , and I post here and there and when it is no longer intellectual , I drop the blog and go elsewhere - I 'm not loyal to any one blog .
I tried to find a post of mine from just 3 months ago , and could n't remember the blogs name , finally found it , and the whole original post had been removed along with the comments .
I have no idea why you feel I am lying to you , I 've told you , I did n't like Bush any more than I like Obama .
I have real problems with the stunts the Bush Admin pulled .
I have a sneaky suspicion that you know well who Alinsky is , but we can both pretend you do n't if it makes you feel better .
It 's very odd how the same tricks of the trade are used on these blogs when the Obama supporters start loosing the debate .
LOL
At first it bothered me , because it just seemed like a cheap way out - but now that I have come to know the trend and trickery , I find it rather amusing and know that it 's my cue to move along .
Always the same - degrade the poster then plead with them to keep posting .
So if little Johnny goes out on the playground for lunch and Harry , Nancy , and Barack constantly call him names and demean him - you think he is going to continue to go out on the playground at lunch - or maybe he 'll just eat lunch in the cafeteria where the intellectuals eat .
Floridiot - the president is brown ?
Humm ... I had forgotten , but your right !
Since he was raised by his white mother and white grandparents , went to predominantly white schools and ivy league colleges , he just seems white to me , I guess because he acts just like Bush .
I guess that makes me a racist or something .
So how would you go about explaining my awakening when Bush was in office ?
Is he a different color too and I just did n't notice it because of my wingnuttery issues ?
Nahhh , nothing to see here , no real substance , no real debate , just a lot of name calling , and intolerance of an opposing position and opinion .
All these blog owners kill me - they want their hit count up , want people to come and then allow degrading and demeaning posts to visitors .
No integrity .
So long and farewell , maybe someone new will come along that you can call names !
Take care and Merry Christmas !

Nice to see you back , Sally !
Is Beck 's re-run already finished tonight ?
Why is it that when you Obama supporters run out of excuses for him , you resort to correcting people 's typo's , punctuation , spelling , and grammar ?
Dunno .
Go ask an Obama supporter .
LOL
It 's become so common place , it must be in your rule book that the Obama camp gives those that are paid bloggers or either just volunteer for the job .
You mean the Alinsky rule book ?!
If so , and if it talks about how to be paid to be a blogger , please let me know where I can find that book !
Am I admitting I was wrong ?
Did I lie ?
- NO , but if it makes you feel better to think I was and did , go right ahead , or ban me if it would help .
I gave you a quote from their campaign that backed up what I paraphrased - if you do n't believe it - then do some research , it 's out there .
I research all day , dear .
You offered an unattributed quote ( which you now say is " from their campaign " --- who ?
when ?
where ? ) that you say backs up what you paraphrased .
However , it does n't .
So , to repeat , you claimed :
The way he promised that if we were to HURRIEDLY pass that Stimulus bill , unemployment would not exceed 8 % !
And so I asked for evidence of that " promise " , and you were unable to offer any .
So you then posted an unattributed quote from someone , from somewhere , from some time , and claim that it backed up the point you were " paraphras[ing ] " even though it did n't even do that !
The irony here :
You were trying to show how Obama lies , or some such , but had to make up a lie to do it .
( Well , you were told that lie by folks like Beck and Rush , so you did n't have to make it up all on your own .
You just bought into their bullshit enough to repeat it here because you , dear Sally , have been played for a fool by them .
Yet you do n't seem to care . )
Why does everyone have to be wingnuts and whatever else you call people just because they have a different opinion ?
They do n't .
By way of example , I disagree with much in Frank 's original article above .
But I do n't believe he 's a wingnut .
He just has a different --- if informed --- opinion on many things .
You have a different opinion than mine as well , but yours is astoundingly misinformed , and wholly based on partisan , America - hating nonsense that you are gullible enough to repeat on a blog in front of other people , under a pseudonym , which u can then disappear into the night with when you 've failed to cover your already psuedonymous ass .
I have argued with you just fine without resorting to calling you names or trying to degrade you in any way .
It 's called respect for your fellow American - too bad the nation as a whole no longer sees such an attribute as important .
Yes , I know .
They are too busy calling Obama a Marxist and / or a Fascist ( odd contradiction there ) , or making up attacks like " he promised unemployment would n't go higher than 8 % " , and such , to have time to respectfully learn the FACTS before shooting off their mouths and embarrassing themselves .
People 's blogs go into archives after awhile , and I post here and there and when it is no longer intellectual , I drop the blog and go elsewhere - I 'm not loyal to any one blog .
" Go into archives " ?
If you left a comment about your outrage that George W. Bush was trying terrorists in U.S. courts , I 'm sure you can find it , and point us to it .
You did n't , so you have nothing to point to , because you did n't give a damn about issues like unemployment , or health care , or trying terrorists in U.S. court , or defying the constitution when George W. Bush did it , because you are a plain , transparent , sad little partisan who gave a pass to America 's worst President for 8 years , only to come out now and express your " outrage " now that Fox " News " has managed to gin it up in otherwise well meaning ( hopefully ) folks like yourself who have fallen for their partisan , America - hating scams .
I tried to find a post of mine from just 3 months ago , and could n't remember the blogs name , finally found it , and the whole original post had been removed along with the comments .
I have no idea why you feel I am lying to you , I 've told you , I did n't like Bush any more than I like Obama .
I have real problems with the stunts the Bush Admin pulled .
Good .
Then you should be able to demonstrate the evidence for that .
You 've already made three comments on this one article .
I 'm sure you 've got HUNDREDS , if not THOUSANDS , of outraged comments of yours out there you could point me to , displaying your outrage at Bush over the last eight years .
Or at least you could point me to them , had you actually made any .
Again , where 's your outrage over Bush trying terrorists in U.S. courts ?
That oughta be a simple one , given the " outrage " you displayed about a KSM trial here .
I 'm sure you 've got a paper trail a mile long condemning Bush for giving all of those terrorists trials in U.S. courts , right ?
( Of course you do n't .
And we know why .
You have n't said a peep about it until you were instructed to do so by Fox and friends a few weeks ago for the very first time . )
I have a sneaky suspicion that you know well who Alinsky is , but we can both pretend you do n't if it makes you feel better .
Good .
Then let 's " pretend " I do n't ( since I actually do n't , pretending is easy ) .
Now let 's pretend that you * do * know who he / she is , beyond Rush and Beck using his / her name all the time ( I hear them do it too ) .
So now , tell me who he / she is please , and what it is that he / she said that you 've accused me of doing .
And thanks again in advance !
( You wo n't honor that request either , like all the others you 've failed on so far .
You are 100 % FAIL so far in that regard , in case anybody is keeping track . )
It 's very odd how the same tricks of the trade are used on these blogs when the Obama supporters start loosing the debate .
LOL
At first it bothered me , because it just seemed like a cheap way out - but now that I have come to know the trend and trickery , I find it rather amusing and know that it 's my cue to move along .
You 're moving along , dear , because you 've had your ass handed to you , since you were n't able to come up with a single shred of the requested evidence to support a single " argument " you 've made here .
Not one .
I would n't blame you for disappearing at all given your sad performance here .
BTW , if you spent any time actually educating yourself ( watching Fox " News " does n't count as " educating yourself " ) you might have learned a bit about who you 're talking to , and that I 'm not an " Obama supporter " , having voted against him in the last election and all .
Good grief .
Always the same - degrade the poster then plead with them to keep posting .
No pleading here .
Please go away .
Or stay if you like .
But if you stay , be prepared to back up your allegations with any evidence whatsover .
You can't , so you 'll play the whining victim card , ala Ann Coulter , and then quit , ala Sarah Palin .
So long and farewell , maybe someone new will come along that you can call names !
Ouchie , someone got their feelings hurt cuz they could n't back up their positions .
Not even once .
Bye bye , dear !
Do n't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya .
Take care and Merry Christmas !
And a Happy Hanukkah to you !

LOL , Brad .
Thank you for fulfilling my previous request ( you too , Sally !
I wanted to echo two points that I would have made in response to Sally anyway ...
Why is it that when you Obama supporters run out of excuses for him , you resort to correcting people 's typo's , punctuation , spelling , and grammar ?
Where are these numerous Obama supporters that you seem to be referring to ?
And ' irregardless ' STILL is n't a word .

First , ' loosing ' is not what you mean .
You mean ' losing ' , as in you are sorely losing this battle .
The other word , the one you incorrectly used , would be more like ' Brad is loosing the Hounds of Do n't Expect That Faux News Crap To Fly Here on you ' .
Second , your cue to move on is that you have been spanked .

This is an onion article right ?
I can't believe that this is being allowed by you Brad !
But I love Freedom
OK here we go .
Continued the draw down the misbegotten war in Iraq - actually the number of privately contracted troops rose in Iraq .
Thoughtfully and decisively picked the best of several bad choices regarding the war in Afghanistan - actually better options do exist , ( education ) and Im surprised you think escalating war is NOW a good idea as we are going broke .
Gave a major precedent - setting speech supporting gay rights .. as drones attacks are spreading into Pakistan , and White Phospherous is used against Palestinians .
Restored America 's image around the globe
My question is - how does a minority win Presidency after 2 blatently stolen elections ?
Pyschology dear Watson , and you see the emperor in his clothing .
Banned torture of American prisoners
How are you sure ?
Yes , to you and the TV , he may say " torture is banned " , but when you say that as a fact to me you sound like someone who thinks officials found " WMD 's in Iraq . "
You are repeating propaganda .
Stopped the free fall of the American economy
It is n't over yet bud !
Over 10 % official unemployment , 140 failed banks this year , commercial and residential sales still way down , foreclosures up , more taxes with less services , bailouts that 99 to 1 was not wanted so on and so on .
Oh and he is surrounded by the people that help create the problem , sweet ....
Goldman Sachs of America
Put the USA squarely back in the bilateral international community - do n't you see the negative effects of globalism and international " relations " yet ?
Put the USA squarely into the middle of the international effort to halt global warming - While planting a garden is good , the carbon scheme is bad .
We do n't know enough yet about how temperature and C02 interact with each other , and the entire debate has been bought for profits .
( Its corrupted ) Stood up for educational reform
No child left behind ledgislation : not left behind .
The system infact is getting worse and many teachers are facing cuts and layoffs Frank , I date one of them .
Won a Nobel peace prize - Are you SERIOUS ?
Yeah , and he increased the war , on all fronts ; Pakistan , Iraq , Afghanistan .
Moved the trial of terrorists back into the American judicial system of checks and balances - Oh Frank , if only those courts would hear the evidence of nano - thermite in the dust , a high grade military incendiary and explosive .
Please stop supporting the lies of 9/11 Frank , along with playing off of terrorism and fear , it makes you look silly .
Did what had to be done to start the slow , torturous and almost impossible process of health care reform that 7 presidents had failed to even begin I wont start , but in short , I dont want your pills or shots .
Keep your " healthcare . "
If you do n't see the corruption , I wish you the best .
You 'll be paying for it , one way or another .
Responded to hatred from the Right and Left with measured good humor and patience - yawn ... Bush was a " friendly " guy too Frank !
Wake up !
Stopped the free fall of job losses
Not so much .. but hey Im glad your doing good !
Showed immense personal courage in the face of an armed and dangerous far Right opposition that included the sort of disgusting people that show up at public meetings carrying loaded weapons and carrying Timothy McVeigh - inspired signs about the " blood of tyrants " needing to " water the tree of liberty " ...
- So were you praising Bush as he was being pelted by tomato 's and eggs in DC at his stolen inauguration for his courage ?
Maybe there is anger from both sides for reasons ... and maybe I do n't care how big their boots are , get the F out of the middle east Frank !
Showed that he could not only make the tough military choices but explain and defend them brilliantly - Ah , like Hitler !
and then you say this :
Who actually has failed ... ... are the Americans that can't see the beginning of a miracle of national rebirth right under their jaded noses .
It is really scary that you said that Frank .
The same was said during the 30's in Germany as propaganda campaigns during eroding civil liberties , expanding army , and a deteriorating society .
But there were the propagandists Frank , some were paid , others simply misinformed .
The one 's that said how great Hitler was , against all evidence .
Do you belong to either group ?
I do n't celebrate , but cheers .

Frank is nothing if not stirring ... this is the most comments I 've seen posted here in some while .
Praising Obama and rationalizing for him sure did get us riled up .
I 've recently been over reading Andrew Bard Schmookler at www.nonesoblind.org...
particularly regarding the nature of evil and the fact that we should be calling out that nature whenever we see it .
On the single issue of the senate health care bill Obama and his people have fostered stripping out the Public Option , while disingenuously claiming to support that position ... bearing false witness .
By 2014 not having health care will be a crime and a fineable offense ... mandating payments to private health insurers .
The far right has claimed Obama is a Socialist ... well that is true , a Corporate Socialist .
Then again maybe he is paying back the $ 20 million he received in campaign funds form the health care industry .
Quid Pro Quo .... which I believe is illegal or perhaps I missed the abrogation of that law .
Bottom line for me is Obama is the Saruman of our age , a golden tongued wizard of words .
Still ...
I 'm wondering who the Sauron of our age really is ?

For many of them , it just seems an ongoing explanation of their own personal failures .

First time in the 5 years I 've been reading this blog that I 've ever seen an article that was not worthy of this site .
I would refer Mr. Schaeffer to the articles by Ernest Canning on the very site .
After 8 years of Bush , we should all be FAR more perceptive .
While Obama 's rhetoric and charm are beyond dispute , his policies and appointees are 100 % BUSH .
Hell , there 's even a place for Dana Perino in the Obama administration .
That alone tells you all you need to know .
It 's called the ' flat tire ' principle .
You infiltrate an organization or team with someone pretending to be on board , but their real objective is to obfuscate , water down and / or prevent any * real * change or progress .
And in fact , as multi-award - winning journalist John Pilger correctly observes , Obusha 's first job after college was working for CIA front company American International Corp. , who among other things did exactly that -- infiltrate Australian liberal groups with stealth right - wingers .
And that is what we have with Obusha .
Empty words of hope and change while in fact we continue to follow the Neocon " Project for a New American Century " playbook .
We have now expanded the war front into yemen and are militarizing Colombia as we ramp up to hit Venezuela , while we forge documents about Iran 's nuclear objectives ' to justify destroying Iran via proxy ( Israel . )
Cheney 's hand is still firmly on the till .
His spokesperson is now simply a lot more charming and well - spoken than the last one .
But the perfidy remains .

Frank , you still live in a fantasy world of religion and faith .
You must believe what you say because you are sincere .
This is deeply troubling , as faith and critical thinking do not go hand in hand .
They are at extreme ends of the spectrum .
They can never work together because science requires proof .
You have conveniently ignored the evidence that our new president has taken the mantle of our old one , and done little or nothing to change .
Our president has succumbed to every request from those still in power .
He has proven to be either a liar , or a puppet .
I do not see a middle ground as a result of those actions he has taken , and those that he has not .
Faith equals delusion .
It is the easiest way out of reality .

In " Americans Are Hell - Bent on Tyranny " , Paul Craig Roberts , a former member of the Reagan administration , observed : Obama 's dwindling band of true believers has taken heart that their man has finally delivered on one of his many promises --- the closing of the Guantanamo prison . …
In truth , Obama has handed his supporters another defeat .
Closing Guantanamo meant ceasing to hold people in violation of our legal principles of habeas corpus and due process …
All Obama would be doing would be moving 100 people , against whom the US government is unable to bring a case , from the prison in Guantanamo to a prison in Thomson , Illinois .

He 's no leader , unless by leadership you mean the ability to compromise away all decency until you get a " win " .

Well , first I want to thank the now - departed Sally for turning me on to Saul Alinsky ( I googled Alinsky and quickly found the URL that Agent99 supplied at # 38 ) .
As usual , he looks like a very interesting person who made wonderful and powerful contributions to social democracy in the USA .
Of couse , I can imagine that Faux Liars must hate him for his good work for the downtrodden .
As for the OP , well I do believe that Schaeffer is totally and completely off base , and also using bad tricks to argue ( as has already been well stated above by better articulaters than I ) .
I think it must be hard for a " turnaround " like Mr. Schaeffer ( and I respect his " conversion " and his " apologias " greatly ) to come ALL the way to the other side .
The power of that belief that " the Democrats and The Rethuglicans are very different " is great .
The truth that the majority of the House , Senate and White House Democrats and Republicans are owned by the corporate oligarchs and that the differences between them are mostly contrived to maintain the different factions of the population in their separate corners is harder to believe and see .
It was said ( Napoleon ? Marx ? ) that " Religion is what keeps the poor from killing the rich . "
I think that the two party system is what keeps the people from killing the politicians .
Two many people hate ONE SIDE or THE OTHER and believe THEIR side is going to solve the problems when they have power .
The truth is that POWER is in the hands of the corporate state , and that they control the choice of candidates , whether you are eligible to vote , and how your vote gets counted , and that WE THE PEOPLE have almost no power other than to spend our money and be good cogs in the corporate machine .
I am not saying we must abandon the electoral process or either of the parties , but we should be quite aware of the game we are playing , and how badly stacked against us the deck is .

I posted comment # 51 to make clear to any who have not read my articles that Frank Schaeffer and I do not agree on this particular topic .
But so what ?
Diversity of opinion enriches the content of this blog .
It is disturbing when I see some on the Left repeating the acerbic level of discourse that we usually associate with wing - nuts on the Right .
Those who have challenged Mr. Schaeffer 's intellectual capacity or his sincerity are way out of line .
Those who have chastised Brad for including a view that does not square with theirs do not realize that Brad 's goal is to both provide factual content on the vital issues of our time and a broad range of respectful dialogue .
That does n't mean that anyone has to accept what I , Frank or Brad have to say on a given topic .
The provision of sound reasons for rejecting any point posted are a welcome addition , that , like the range of discourse reflected in a comparison of this piece to mine , enriches us all .

Frank ,
I 'm not hearing a whole lot from you defending the points made .
I 'm interested what you think of some of the better researched references made to other writers and facts established that refute your opinions .
Ernest ,
I 'm sorry or not if refuting opinions with contrary and clear facts seems rude .
Most of us are trying to keep level , clear and calm here .
Referring to other blogs ' comments , I think we 're almost all doing pretty well here .
Brad ,
gotta laugh when I see the laser focus of someone telling you this is bull that would never fly at a truth emergency summit .
Talk about cutting through all the chaff and then right through the point .
Gracias Brian R comment58 .
Think it was Orlov who gave BushBama the Gorbachev award .
He 's managing the decline of the empire the same way Gorbachev did .
Was n't it Scott Ritter arguing with Stephanie Miller last month who pointed out that Gorbachev was warned he needed 650,000 troops to invade Afghanistan to get the job done ?
Yeh and look how well Gorby 's strategy worked out when he sent too few with too little armor up against stinger missiles while his own economy was overextended and crashing all around him .
Thank you again Brad for the platform and the group of folk who you 've drawn here to bring out facts and lace them together .
Please continue .

Yes , it sure looks like folks are divided .
It 's not too surprising when you see who owns the media .
Okay , I 'm a bit of a cynic also .
Why is health insurance company stock zooming up ?
But then , who will claim victory if this health bill fails ?
Looking at the Congressional votes for 2009 , the obstructionism of the Republicans is undeniable .
They even tried to filibuster a defense appropriations bill !
If they actually win more seats in 2010 , will they shut down the government ?
Maybe Obama should come out strongly for life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness just to get the Republicans and media to disagree .

Just listening to Norman Goldman subbing for Ed Shultz .
Obama gave an interview yesterday about the health care bill .
In it he said that the public option was just representative of an ideological position or some such shit .
Apparently it is not representative of good policy that will help the American people .

This is one of the most thoughtful and interesting posts I 've seen on the Net for a while from one of the most interesting characters out there right now .
Mr. Schaeffer 's abandonment of his right - wing religio- political views and strong adoption of a view directly counter to everything he once believed in struck me from the moment I first saw him on TV as sincere , passionate , and maybe unique .
I always give him special attention when I hear from him because of this .
He 's clearly intelligent .
This posting contains so much , and is so full of thoughtful , passionate advocacy that I am struck quiet by it - it is a unique voice out there now I do believe - I want to think on what he has said for some time before I decide anything .
I need time to reflect .
Thanks to Brad for hosting this important voice .

Not at all .
To the contrary , that type of response to Frank 's " Obama is wonderful " argument is quite appropriate .
You will find it , for example , in RICHARD FRITZSON 's articulate comment # 9 and in Coleen Rowley 's ( comment # 29 ) short but powerful rebuttal .
You will find that to be the approach I applied in " Beyond Afghanistan " , where I parsed the empty rhetoric used by the President during his Dec. 1 Afghan escalation speech .
You will also see that approach applied by me in Progressives of America - Unite !
Where I draw the line , when it comes to rudeness , can be found , for example , in DAVID LIPSCOMB , comment # 19 : Frank , I would call you an intellectual lightweight , but you are n't that smart .
You can disagree ; link to other articles , present a sustained argument that Frank 's " opinion " is unfounded .
But you do n't need to challenge his intellectual capacity or his sincerity to make that point --- at least not unless you are dealing with someone like Rush Limbaugh who has no integrity and should be called out for that lack of integrity .

I am quite surprised by the number of folks who whole heartedly applauded Mr. Schaeffer .
I agree that every so often in this cynical media we harp on the negative and we need a reminder of the positives .
I believe Mr Schaeffer went too far in his attempt .
I am glad there were plenty of others who disagreed like myself with the content and actions of the administration .
I am also glad they were able to site good sources for their arguements .
I am sorry for those who turned to name calling .
I also thank Brad for identifying the false - fact opiners on the site .
A comment I forgot to mention before was :
After people are overcharged for their insurance to the point they can not afford it , and end up dropping their coverage , will they they be fined / jailed for not having insurance ?
Or will this be a way to gradually get everyone into a government single payer system , because the greedy private insurance companies will price themselves out of the majority of the population .
The problem with this scenario is that it will require many years of depleting the financial resources of the dwindling middle class to reach that breaking point .
The final insurance bill ( it 's not a health care bill because it does little to nothing about pharmaceuticals , health care providers or tort reform , as small as it is ) that goes to Obama ( who will sign anything to claim a victory ) , I hope , will not have the insurance requirement in it or there will be Constitutional challenges to the the law .

This guy ( Obama ) could not lead a horse to water .
He does not have what it takes to be a leader .
His accomplishments consist of : 1 ) Escalating the war in Afghanistan .
That 's it !
As far as I can see this regime is a continuation of the Bush tragedy in sheep 's clothing .
We are still in Iraq and will never leave .
We are escalating in Afghanistan and will never leave .
Iran has lifted itself into a powerful position , Israel is still out of control , there is still rendition , Gitmo is still open , eavesdropping is rampant , the White House is still fighting at every turn to become open and available to real people , private deals are still being made in the White House , GWs cronies are being promoted and the health care bill has become a bail out for the insurance companies .
We are fucked .

irregardless |ˌiriˈgärdlis|
adjective & adverb informal
regardless .
ORIGIN early 20th cent . : probably a blend of irrespective and regardless .
USAGE Irregardless , with its illogical negative prefix , is widely heard , perhaps arising under the influence of such perfectly correct forms as : irrespective .
Irregardless is avoided by careful users of English .
Use regardless to mean ' without regard or consideration for ' or ' nevertheless ' : : I go walking every day regardless of season or weather .

Give him a chance ?

In each and every case Obama has worked mightily to repair and strewngthen a corrupt status quo .
Health care reform ?
Yeah ,
From the begining his goal was to keep the current corrupt and inefficient system and force tens of millions more to by the vile products of the insurance monopolies .
A few tweeks were added to pretend to provide real " change we can believe in . "
The only jobs he protected are on Wall Street .
How can the CEOs and CFOs collevt those multi-million dollar bonuses if their companies were n't paid hundreds of billions in subsidies ?
Meanwhile Larry Lunchbucket suffers !
And Obama just keeps getting advice and policy from the same corrupt crew that got us into this mess ...
Now we know why " Wall Street " gave him more money than any other candidate from either party .
I could go on , but am too disgusted .
Obama is just a Pied Piper for fools who want to ignore his catering to the powers that be .

Hi All : thanks for the comments on my article and for David 's article too .
Meanwhile back on planet earth the US Senate just made history with the first step in meaningful health care reform .
Best , Frank PS .
Re Obama , responses to my pro-Obama piece , and responses to the responses ....
etc. Note that Andrew Sullivan says it well in the Atlantic .
So rather than go back through everything again and again for the Obama critics here it is from Sullivan .
( The Atlantic Dec 23 , 09 ) .
http://andrewsullivan.th...9/12/meep-meep.html#more
By Andrew Sullivan
My own view is that 2009 has been an extraordinarily successful year for Obama .
Since this is currently a minority view and will prompt a chorus of " In The Tank ! " , allow me to explain .
The substantive record is clear enough .
Torture is ended , if Gitmo remains enormously diff
We are 4.37 light years , or 140 million light - seconds , from Alpha Centauri , give or take .
One light second is 300,000 km ; it takes New Horizons about five hours to travel one light second .
So : in very roughly 30 million days , or on the order of 300,000 years ( if it was going in the right direction , which it is n't ) , New Horizons could reach Alpha Centauri .
Actually , I tell a lie .
There are five starships that we know of ; Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , and New Horizons .
But they 're a far cry from the gleaming interstellar transports of science fiction .
New Horizons is the most recent of them .
Launched in late 2006 , it is the fastest human - launched vehicle so far .
It raced past Lunar orbit within nine hours of take - off : nevertheless , it will take around 10 years to reach Pluto ( its proximate target — for a three - hour flyby ) .
It weighs around 478 Kg , and is currently travelling outwards from the sun at around 17 km / sec — about fifty times as fast as a rifle bullet .
( NB : As starships do not in fact exist , no starships were harmed in the production of this essay .
Also , this is just words .
If they upset you , go lie down in a dark room for half an hour then drink a glass of water ; you 'll feel better . )
This is not an essay about whether we could do better if we tried .
I 've written about the problem of space colonization before .
Rather , what intrigues me is the possibility that the entire conceptual framework of the starship is a dangerously misleading dead - end , and that what we need is a new framework for thinking about interstellar travel .
The very word " starship " is a concatenation of two other words — star , and ship .
The first is pretty harmless ; it merely defines the scale factor we 're talking about , as opposed to interplanetary ship , or moon ship , or Atlantic - crossing steam ship .
But the second word comes with a whole freightload of unwanted baggage , and I 'm of a mind that serious futurists or SF writers might want to think about ditching it completely and looking for something new .
The astute reader will have spotted the link to the Apollo Program above .
We have actually built and flown Moon ships ... but we did n't call them ships , and they did n't much look like one of these .
There are several reasons why not .
First and foremost are the scale factors involved , scale factors in both distance and ( because you need to cross that distance ) time , hence velocity ( the change of distance over time ) .
Kinetic energy is the killer ; the kinetic energy of a moving body is proportional to the square of its velocity .
Want to go faster ?
You need to throw bucketloads more energy at your vehicle , or make it much lighter .
The Apollo spacecraft ( or New Horizons ) travel roughly three orders of magnitude faster than a regular sea-going ship , and they also had to haul along the reaction mass to throw out the back to get them up to speed ( for they 're all powered by rockets , relying on Newton 's Third Law to make things balance out ) .
But there 's a more subtle difference .
We have a long tradition of nautical baggage .
Seafaring ships of the great age of exploration were largely wooden , and — with the aid of their human crew — self - repairing ; subject to the availability of raw materials , there was n't much aboard a 16th or 17th century sailing ship that could n't be made on board .
Aside from carpentry , the inhabitants of even a relatively small port could make the necessities to keep a ship at sea on a voyage of years — a smithy , a pottery , a glass - blower , weavers of sailcloth and makers of hardtack .
Shipbuilding was by no means easy ( it was an economic activity born on the backs of the large numbers of peasant farmers and fisherfolk it took to provide the surplus to feed the workers in the shipyards ) but it was n't anything like the Apollo project , which sucked up the labour of a third of a million skilled engineers and technicians for a decade .
The word ship therefore comes freighted with connotations of autonomy and sustainability that are inappropriate to space travel as we know it today .
And one of the most perfidious , misleading , damning , unconscious associations of the word " ship " is the word " destination " .
As I 've said before , the trouble with going into space is that there 's no " there " there when you get to the other end of your voyage .
All you get is rocks , sunlight , and if you 're lucky some slush ( water optional : could equally well be methane or cyanide ) to season your gravity wells .
So if you want to do anything at the other end — anything beyond looking around real good — you need to bring the minimal seeds of the infrastructure with which to build and maintain your biosphere ( if you 're travelling with an entourage of meat puppets ) or your mechanosphere ( if you 're going the Eric Drexler / Hans Moravec / downloading - or - AI route ) .
Which is why I was asking questions like this and this and this about a month ago .
I was feeling my way towards this critical question : which is , " how simple can you make a minimal self - maintaining interstellar transport system " ?
To a first approximation , the best answer I can come up with is " not very " .
We can probably make it mechanically simple , rugged , and lightweight if we can do mature machine - phase diamond - substrate nanotechnology , and if we can figure out how to do one of mind uploading or artificial general intelligence .
Note that I say mechanically simple — there 's a monumental raft of complexity wrapped up in the idea of using a Starwisp for establishing interstellar transportation , but it 's informational complexity rather than straightforward mechanical complexity .
We may use such a system to sidestep the need for learning how to build self - sustaining biospheres and interstellar playpens for bored hominids , and how to equip a group of said hominids with the wherewithal to keep such a mobile playpen from degrading catastrophically , but we face the corresponding monumental challenge of solving the hard - AI problem and developing molecular manufacturing far beyond the flexibility and scope of today 's nanotechnology applications .
Such an interstellar capability is n't going to look much like a " ship " .
It 's going to look more like a DVD balanced on a microwave beam , or a can of beans hanging below a light sail energized by lasers powered by huge orbiting solar power stations .
There wo n't be any biological agencies aboard : just AGIs or something equivalent ported out of a fleshbody 's cranium .
No hands , only nanotech assemblers .
And after a voyage of decades or centuries it 's going to have to stop — somehow braking at the other end — then spend more decades farming rocks , slush and sunlight to build ever - bigger physical structures until it can build the equipment with which to phone home .
If anything , it 's going to resemble a seed pod for a different kind of life , and on arrival it 's going to hatch and grow into a tree , or a forest , or a manufacturing - industrial complex .
Finally , long after arrival , it might have sufficient resources to divert from homeostasis and growth to construct a biosphere , open communications with home , and prepare to download digitized colonists — if the whole uploading concept does n't prove to be chimerical , and if there 's something to be done with the serialized primate core - dumps at the other end .
Note that I 'm fairly optimistic about mature diamond - phase nanotechnology ( or some cognate thereof ) .
The economic benefits of getting it are huge , and there are no obvious lacunae on the technology road map — unlike , say , fusion or manned interplanetary space travel .
I 'm less optimistic about mind uploading , because in neuroscience we are just about at the stage of beginning to figure out how ignorant we are .
And I 'm pessimistic about AGI , because I do n't think we stand a hope in hell of working out how to design an artificial general intelligence until we know , at least in outline , what human general intelligence is .
( And we do n't . )
But I suspect some combination of these technologies will show up sooner or later — barring resource - depletion crashes and / or habitable - biosphere - envelope departures on a planetary scale — and once you 've got two out of the three , a starwisp - driven expansion starts to look feasible ( if energetically expensive ) .
The alternative approach uses generation ships .
That 's what I was talking about earlier .
Which does n't sound much easier , if any , when you contemplate how much we do n't know about environmental engineering and biology .
It also begs some huge sociological — human — questions , and is unlikely to be planned as such .
I expect it'd only happen in the wake of our development of stable , safe space habitats — itself a huge obstacle ( Just look at the history of our first modular space station if you want to get an idea of the problems surrounding life in space ) — and if the energy costs required to launch a starwisp are high ( 56 Gw for about a month to punch a 1Kg payload up to 10 % of lightspeed ; a microwave lens 560 Km in diameter to focus the beam ) , those of a generation ship are going to be astronomically higher .
...
Which leads me to believe that we'd be more realistic if we just ditched the word " ship " entirely from discussions of interstellar travel .
What we need to contemplate are the requirements for of an interstellar transportation system .
Such a system needs to provide not only a mechanism for sending a self - replicating technosphere across interstellar distances ; it needs to be able to produce a habitable space at the destination , and provide a return option ( for data , if nothing else ) .
Waving a magic wand of the variety I discounted in my earlier space colonization essay , even if we postulate that mind uploading is both possible and the way forward , interstellar travel still wo n't be cheap .
Direct communication via modulated laser looks feasible at extrasolar distances , on a reasonable power budget , given adequate pointing accuracy — but the study linked to above has a bit rate of only 0.5 kb /s.
Given their 15w peak power output , they 're talking about 0.03 joules / bit across 1000 AU distance ; or 1.9 joules / bit / light - year .
Even Hans Moravec 's estimate of the computational complexity of the human brain ( cited here only as a starting point for discussion of mind uploading : I think he 's erring on the optimistic side by between three and six orders of magnitude ) suggests you 'd need many years to transmit a compressed uploaded mind at that bit rate !
But we know we can transmit data much faster using lasers over optical fibre .
If we can push the bit rate towards 1 Tb / sec , transmitting a map of a brain with 10 11 neurons and glial cells , each with on average 10 4 interactions with neighbouring cells , and , say , a spare 30 bits / connection ( to summarize its properties ) , for a total of 10 18 bits of data per upload , we can squirt that map at the stars in about ten days .
We 'll need a powerful laser unless we want the error rate to climb .
Using the figure of 1.9 joules / bit / light - year , to send an uploaded mind to alpha centauri is going to cost on the order of 10 19 joules over ten days : an unfeasibly large amount of energy .
( Hint : we 're talking the equivalent of a Hiroshima - sized nuke every second , for a million seconds ) .
However , that figure corresponds to the sort of bit rate we can envisage achieving more or less now .
Improve the data - to - power ratio by , say , a millionfold and things begin to look feasible ( if not exactly cheap ) .
In particular , it 's a lot cheaper than travelling in person ( and anyway , we 've got the honking great big solar power station / maser grid we built to launch the starwisp in the first place ; might as well put it to use ) .
Finally , if we can do the upload thing well enough to provide the brains to run our starwisp in the first place , we can probably make do without building a biosphere at the other end .
In other words : frail fleshbodies need not apply .
( There 's an alternative to shipping around uploads via laser that merits investigation : if we can do uploading , and if we can make memory diamond — which would seem to be a reasonable expectation of a mature machine - phase nanotechnology — then the 80g payload of the reference starwisp ought to be sufficient to carry about 2 x 10 24 bits , which corresponds to 20,000 stored uploads per " passenger ship " .
This might well be energetically cheaper than using a laser to transmit uploads , giving us an unexpected long - haul corollary to Tanenbaum 's law . )
So , to summarize : yes , I think human interstellar exploration ( and yes , maybe even colonization ) might be possible , after a fashion .
But to get there , we 're going to have to master at least two entire technological fields that do n't yet exist , even before we start trying to blast compact disc sized machines up to relativistic velocities .
And that 's without considering the difficulty of how to cram an industrial infrastructure capable of building more of itself , of a machine capable of surviving in deep space — the equivalent of those 300,000 NASA technicians and engineers — into the aforementioned CD - sized machine ...
If we succeed in doing it , it 's going to look nothing like the Starship Enterprise .
Or even New Horizons .
The whole reference frame we instinctively assume when we hear the word " ship " is just so wrong it 's beyond wrong - ness : it 's on a par with Baron Munchausen 's lunar exploits as seen in light of the Apollo Program .
We need a new handle for discussing and analyzing such a venture .
And the sooner we consign the " - ship " suffix to the dustbin of failed ideas , the better .
Climate change conference banner
Copenhagen climate change summit :
The world is COOLING not warming says scientist Peter Taylor ... and we 're not prepared
Natural scientist Peter Taylor is afraid we are not preparing for a global cool - down that could be part of a long - term cycle
In his provocative book Chill , he warns that the world is cooling not warming and that solutions proposed at Copenhagen ignore the risks of a possible return of the Ice Age ...
Like a magician who fools themselves but not audience , the Anthropomorphic Global Warming ( AGW ) lobby have identified the wrong problem and the wrong solution .
Global cooling threatens disaster for humanity in the developed and developing world alike , yet the media and the scientific consensus ignores this peril .
The Climategate controversy revolves around whether warming has been real and why it has not persisted – but it misses the point .
Cycles are involved , not short - term trends , and many respected scientists , especially those in Russia and China , think that a cooling cycle is coming .
The AGW brigade have mistaken the current warm period for a trend caused by carbon emissions .
But the detailed science says it could be natural and part of a cycle .
Behind the scenes at the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change there is no consensus – the dissenting views have been covered over in the summary documents for policy makers – and among UK and EU politicians it ’s even worse , and criminally expensive for the British taxpayer .
The real science points to the sun ’s magnetic cycle as the key driver by unknown mechanisms .
Right now , Nasa is throwing its hands up and saying ‘ we ’ve never seen anything like it and ca n’t tell what it is going to do next ’ .
Many scientists expect a repeat of the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century when the Thames froze every winter – and famine spread through Europe and China .

Natural climate change , especially cooling , is already dangerous for very large numbers of people who are vulnerable to climate changing - the urban poor in the developed world , including the UK , plus the poor nations currently dependent on food aid .
Cooling reduces food surpluses upon which we all depend .
The biofuels programmes aimed at preventing climate change will expose them to greater risk by decreasing the amount of land available and raising costs of food , while this problem coupled with peak oil will affect everyone worldwide and drive up transport and manufacturing costs to levels even the super rich will struggle to afford .
These threats are real and here now , not in 50 years time .
Some dramatic changes are needed but not those proposed the EU , IPCC and UK politicians as they try to hunt down the will - of - the - wisp that is CO2 emissions .
Business as usual is not an option since cooling actually does put humanity at risk .
The apocalyptic scaremongering has made us weary and casual about such threats but we need to act if we are to maintain our humanity .
Our human ecosystems are threatened by the world development model and unintelligent economic growth .
No one yet has found a way to develop economically without massive increase in demand for scarce resources – soil , water , timber , land and food .
However , it can be done – with changes in developed economies , and restructuring development in poor countries – and it will require billions .
We need to showcase the projects that work - the unglamorous grass - roots initiatives that enhance the quality of life – rather than indulge in the theatrical gestures about solving a AGW that does n’t exist .
Copenhagen wo n’t broker a solution – not only has the IPCC hyped the warming and misrepresented the science with regard to CO2 and ‘ warming ’ – but it has also proposed a system of cap - and - trade and technology transfer that means huge profits for banks and brokers .
These useless technology sales coupled with a massive global and unelected bureaucracy that decides which technology and which projects get funded – merely provide jobs for the boys rather than address the issues
What we need is the creation of resilience – the rich world is unstable and will try to buy its way out of problems , by buying food on the world market – the rest of the world is at grave risk of starvation .
Food not energy will be the big issue we urgently need to address in the next few years .
In the developed world we need to systematically restructure and reduce demand and in the developing world , people need to stay in communities on the land and not be forced to seek work in unsustainable megacities
Climategate does not just demonstrate the corruption of science and peer - review ; it also demonstrates the incompetence of specialists who do not understand planetary ecology , especially its cycles .
SERIOUS cold , Justen Ladda said , is when the sponge in the kitchen sink feels like wood or the toothpaste freezes or the refrigerator turns itself off , as it did one particularly frigid day last winter .
Not that Mr. Ladda , a 56 - year - old sculptor who has lived heat - free in his Lower East Side loft for three decades , is bothered by such extremes .
“ Winter comes and goes , ” he ’ll tell you blithely , adjusting his black wool scarf and watch cap .
( Along with fingerless gloves , long underwear and felt slippers , they are part of Mr. Ladda ’s at - home uniform when the mercury dips . )
Mr. Ladda , whose work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art , decided long ago to live without central heating .
Proper temperature control , you see , would require insulating his wooden ceiling , and ruining its fine acoustics .
“ I know this sounds really lame , but I listen to a lot of music and it just sounds better , ” he said .
Also , the rent on his unimproved live - work loft is only $ 300 , well below many people ’s winter utility bills .
But beyond thrift and acoustics , what is perhaps most notable about Mr. Ladda ’s chilly interior is that like , say , tepee - dwelling Mongolian reindeer herders , or perhaps some very rugged environmentalists , Mr. Ladda has come to thrive in the cold .
As Americans across the country wrestle with spouses and their thermostats over how low to go — as they join contests like Freeze Yer Buns , now in its third year , a challenge posed by Deanna Duke , a Seattle - based environmental blogger who calls herself the Crunchy Chicken , to lower the thermostat to around 55 degrees , or follow the lead of the Maine couple trying to live comfortably in a furnace - free house and blogging about it in their Cold House Journal — there are those who are living nearly without heat by choice , and doing just fine , thank you very much .
Indeed , 55 degrees would qualify as sauna conditions for Mr. Ladda and others whose interiors hover around the 30 - or 40 - degree mark in deep winter .

Five weeks after the release of the report of the fact - finding mission on Gaza , there has been no attempt by any of its critics to come to grips with its substance .
It has been fulsomely approved by those whose interests it is thought to serve and rejected by those of the opposite view .
Those who attack it do so too often by making personal attacks on its authors ' motives and those who approve it rely on its authors ' reputations .
Israeli government spokesmen and those who support them have attacked it in the harshest terms and , in particular my participation , in a most personal and hurtful way .
The time has now come for more sober reflection on what the report means and appropriate Israeli reactions to it .
I begin with my own motivation , as a Jew who has supported Israel and its people all my life , for having agreed to head the Gaza mission .
Over the past 20 years , I have investigated serious violations of international law in my own country , South Africa , in the former Yugoslavia , in Rwanda and the alleged fraud and theft by governments and political leaders in a number of countries in connection with the United Nations Iraq oil - for - food programme .
In all of these , allegations reached the highest political echelons .
In every instance , I spoke out strongly in favour of full investigations and , where appropriate , criminal prosecutions .
I have spoken out over the years on behalf of the International Bar Association against human rights violations in many countries , including Sri Lanka , China , Russia , Iran , Zimbabwe and Pakistan .
I would have been acting against those principles and my own convictions and conscience if I had refused a request from the United Nations to investigate serious allegations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas in the context of Operation Cast Lead .
As a Jew , I felt a greater and not a lesser obligation to do so .
It is well documented that as a condition of my participation I insisted upon and received an even - handed mandate to investigate all sides , and that is what we sought to do .
I sincerely believed that because of my own record and the terms of the mission 's mandate we would receive the co-operation of the Israeli government .
Its refusal to co-operate was a grave error .
My plea for co-operation was repeated before and during the investigation , and it sits , plain as day , in the appendices of the Gaza report for those who actually bother to read it .
Our mission obviously could only consider and report on what it saw , heard and read .
If the government of Israel failed to bring facts and analyses to our attention , we cannot fairly be blamed for the consequences .
Those who feel that our report failed to give adequate attention to specific incidents or issues should be asking the Israeli government why it failed to argue its cause .
Israel missed a golden opportunity to actually have a fair hearing from a UN - sponsored inquiry .
Of course , I was aware of and have frequently spoken out against the unfair and exceptional treatment of Israel by the UN and especially by the human rights council .
I did so again last week .
Israel could have seized the opportunity provided by the even - handed mandate of our mission and used it as a precedent for a new direction by the United Nations in the Middle East .
Instead , we were shut out .
As I stated in response to a recent letter from the mayor of Sderot , I believed strongly that our mission should have been allowed to visit Sderot and other parts of southern Israel that have been at the receiving end of unlawful attacks by many thousands of rockets and mortars fired at civilian targets by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza .
We were prevented from doing so by , what I believe , was a misguided decision by the Israeli government .
In Gaza , I was surprised and shocked by the destruction and misery there .
I had not expected it .
I did not anticipate that the IDF would have targeted civilians and civilian objects .
I did not anticipate seeing the vast destruction of the economic infrastructure of Gaza including its agricultural lands , industrial factories , water supply and sanitation works .
These are not military targets .
I have not heard or read any government justification for this destruction .
Of course the children of Sderot and the children of Gaza have the same rights to protection under international law , and that is why , notwithstanding the decision of the government of Israel , we took whatever steps were open to us to obtain information from victims and experts in southern Israel about the effects on their lives of sustained rocket and mortar attacks over a period of years .
It was on the strength of those investigations that we held those attacks to constitute serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity .
The refusal of co-operation by the government of Israel did not prevent us from reacting positively to a request from Gilad Shalit 's father to speak personally to our mission at its public session in Geneva .
No one who heard his evidence could fail to have been moved by the unspeakable pain of a parent whose young son was being held for over three years in unlawful circumstances without any contact with the outside world and not even allowed visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The mission called for his release .
Israel and its courts have always recognised that they are bound by norms of international law that it has formally ratified or that have become binding as customary international law upon all nations .
The fact that the United Nations and too many members of the international community have unfairly singled out Israel for condemnation and failed to investigate horrible human rights violations in other countries cannot make Israel immune from the very standards it has accepted as binding upon it .
Israel has a strong history of investigating allegations made against its own officials reaching to the highest levels of government : the inquiries into the Yom Kippur war , Sabra and Shatila , Bus 300 and the second Lebanon war .
Israel has an internationally renowned and respected judiciary that should be envy of many other countries in the region .
It has the means and ability to investigate itself .
Has it the will ?

WHILE the economic downturn has hit advertising , the internet has been busy building market shares .
Global ad spending is estimated to fall by over 10 % this year , according to ZenithOptimedia , a media firm .
The internet will account for 12.3 % of all advertising spending in 2009 , up from 10.1 % last year , and double what it was in 2005 .
Online ad spending in Denmark , a country with near universal broadband penetration , overtook TV spending in 2008 , and is forecast to be almost a third of the ad market by 2012 .
In America , television advertising still dominates , though advertisers are moving from newspapers to the internet .

THE most effective calls to arms are unambiguous .
John Kennedy , rallying America to confront the menace of global communism , said : “ Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty . ”
Winston Churchill , in his first speech as prime minister , said he had “ nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat ” .
He described his aim in four words ( “ Victory at all costs ” ) and his strategy in monosyllables ( “ to wage war by land , sea and air ” ) .
It worked .
Barack Obama 's speech at West Point on December 1st was more equivocal .
At its heart were two sentences : “ [ A ] s commander - in - chief , I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan .
After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home . ”
His critics seized on the apparent contradiction .
If winning the war in Afghanistan is in America 's vital national interest , how can the president promise to start pulling out on a fixed date , when he has no idea whether America will have won by then ?
The White House insists that this is not a problem .
A quick surge of extra boots and rifles will allow America to “ seize the initiative ” .
General Stanley McChrystal 's brave men and women will disrupt , dismantle and defeat al - Qaeda and its “ ruthless , repressive and radical ” Taliban allies .
The new , larger force ( which , with NATO allies , will amount to more than 140,000 ) will crush the insurgents and secure population centres .
America will train and equip the local army and police .
As soon as possible , the Afghan government will assume greater responsibility for its own security .
By the summer of 2011 , the country will be calm enough for American forces to start to pull out .
They will not do so irresponsibly , however ; the pace of withdrawal will “ tak[e ] into account conditions on the ground ” .
It may be that Mr Obama 's strategy will work .
After a long period of painful trial and error , American forces became quite adept at counter - insurgency in Iraq .
Given enough men and money , they can probably do the same in Afghanistan .
And Mr Obama 's plan to “ support Afghan ministries , governors and local leaders who combat corruption and deliver for the people ” may produce an Afghan state that is slightly less dysfunctional than the current one .
But Mr Obama 's speech this week will not persuade many people that he has the unwavering resolve to win this war , for he wore his doubts on his sleeve .
He listed all the strongest reasons for fighting .
He reminded Americans of the attacks of September 11th 2001 , which were plotted from Afghanistan , and raised the prospect of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into terrorists ' hands .
But he also dwelt on the limits of American power and patience .
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will soon have cost more than a trillion dollars .
Because of the recession , many Americans are “ out of work and struggl[ing ] to pay the bills ” .
America “ has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan , ” stressed Mr Obama ; it will only do “ what can be achieved at a reasonable cost ” .
It is good that he understands these constraints , of course .
It is also good that he has doubts — what intelligent person does not ?
Al - Qaeda may be vile , but it does not pose the threat that the Soviet Union and the Nazis did .
Nonetheless , a televised address to the world is not a college lecture .
As he put it himself , the soldiers he is sending into battle need “ a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of [ their ] service . ”
Mr Obama has yet to convince both enemies and allies that he has the fortitude for a fight .
Afghan villagers , however much they may dislike the Taliban , will not tell American soldiers where they are hiding if they think the Americans will soon be gone and the Taliban will soon be back in charge .
The Taliban will find it easier to recruit new warriors if people think Mr Obama is a quitter , and the Pakistani government will continue to hedge its bets .
Mr Obama insisted that “ America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan 's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent . ”
Many Pakistanis are understandably sceptical .
A war leader can't please everyone
The speech revealed how hard Mr Obama is finding it to shift from campaigning — which involves promising people lots of good things — to governing .
He tried to stroke anti-war Democrats , some of whom think that American soldiers will fare no better in Afghanistan than the Soviets did , and all of whom would rather the money was spent on health care .
Hence his insistence that : “ the nation that I am most interested in building is our own . ”
But he was never going to please the anti-war crowd with a speech announcing the war 's escalation .
( “ Have you drunk Bush 's Kool - Aid ? ” asked Michael Moore . )
And in trying to please everyone , he has pleased hardly anyone .
“ Never before has a speech by President Barack Obama felt as false , ” complained Gabor Steingart of Der Spiegel .
“ [ His ] magic no longer works .
The allure of his words has grown weaker . ”
This matters .
Congress will give Mr Obama the funds he needs .
Republicans , though they berate him for dithering , will vote for the war because they believe it necessary .
Democrats will gripe and mope , but they will not destroy Mr Obama 's presidency over it .
Public opinion , though , is less predictable .
The latest YouGov poll for The Economist finds Americans evenly split over whether to send more troops to Afghanistan and deeply pessimistic about the outcome : only 35 % think America will eventually prevail .
According to Gallup , 55 % disapprove of the president 's handling of the war , and only 35 % approve .
Perhaps Mr Obama can rally the nation behind him and strike fear into America 's foes .
But the evidence is not encouraging .

A few weeks ago , I told you guys our site would be featured for our teapot blowing article on a major British show .
Well folks , the show aired yesterday , but I was kind of disappointed by the exposure the blog got .
It looks like they saved the html file of the article locally , removed the blog ’s header and most of the stuff around it , and only kept the pictures that interested them .
I think that was inappropriate of them after asking us to get written permission for them from all people who sent in pictures for the post .
Unfortunately for all our participants , only reader Keaton got his face exposed to the British masses .

Emissions of controversial pesticide are heading northwards .
A computer simulation of the environmental fate of DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) has revealed that substantial quantities of the pesticide are still being released from the world 's oceans , despite widespread restrictions on its use during the 1970s .
Residues of the pesticide DDT may be heading northwards .
Corbis
The calculations show that although remaining DDT use today tends to be in the southern hemisphere , its concentrations are actually growing in the northern hemisphere as it moves through the world 's oceans and atmosphere .
An estimated 1.5 million tonnes of DDT were used worldwide between the 1940s and 1970s , both as an agricultural insecticide and to control disease - carrying insects such as mosquitoes – the chemical was a key weapon in the war against malaria , for example .
But DDT is toxic to a wide range of aquatic life , and its eggshell - thinning effects also had a drastic impact on many bird species .
Concerns about its environmental toxicity led to a series of countries banning the agricultural use of DDT through the 1970s .
There has been a drastic decline in DDT 's use since then , but its legacy is still very much with us , say Irene Stemmler and Gerhard Lammel of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , Germany .
DDT is continually re-entering the atmosphere from the ocean , before being dissolved again in a recurring cycle .
" DDT is simply sitting there , waiting for the next cycle , " Lammel says .
Growing concentration
The scientists created a computer model to simulate the circulation of DDT between ocean and atmosphere between 1950 and 2002 .
This revealed that since the 1970s , the re-emission of DDT from the ocean has become greater than from the three known modern releases of new DDT : its continued use in some countries for malaria control ; degrading storage canisters ; and other pesticides that contain DDT as a contaminant .
The emissions from the ocean are small enough not to pose a direct risk to humans .
" Cruise passengers will never suffer from this , " Lammel says .
A greater concern , however , is that DDT is migrating towards northern latitudes .
That 's because the pesticide evaporates more rapidly from warmer , southern waters , thus increasing concentrations in cooler seas over time .
This is of ecological concern because marine organisms concentrate DDT by factors of millions as it moves up the food chain , reaching levels where it can have toxic effects on fish , for example – or the animals that eat them .
The scientists point out , however , that until recently there has been very little monitoring of DDT in the marine environment , which makes it difficult to verify their model .
Long legacy
DDT wo n't be with us forever .
Some of it , Stemmler and Lammel found , settles into the deep ocean where a portion is buried in sediments , while some is destroyed in the atmosphere by sunlight .

But both of these are slow processes .
" You have loss mechanisms , but if they 're slow , you can't shed it very quickly in the deep ocean or bury it in sediment . " says Robbie MacDonald , a geochemical oceanographer at Canada 's Institute of Ocean Sciences , in Sidney , British Columbia , who was not involved in the study .
" It 's going to take the oceans quite some time to turn [ emissions ] down . "
The results are published in Geophysical Research Letters1 .
MacDonald likens the persistence of DDT to filling a giant reservoir , only to discover that it takes a long time to empty .
" You would think this compound would have gone away by now , " he says , " but it 's still cascading through these reservoirs .
People frequently ignore that .
When you control emissions , [ people ] expect instant gratification , but you do n't get instant gratification . "
There is another aspect which niggles slightly and that is the deafening silence that generally meets the news of aid workers being killed or taken hostage .
There is not only a relative silence from governments , media or the public but even from the humanitarian sector itself .
Compare the death in Afghanistan of aid workers to that of soldiers who , by and large , are armed to the teeth and sent to Afghanistan to kill or be killed .
I do n't dispute military interventions - not my business - but it is quiet incredible that the media is so keen to eulogize the military as ' fallen heroes ' and ignore those who risk ( and give ) their lives desperately trying to make a difference on the human level without resorting to state of the art munitions and military occupation .
Make it compulsive for all aid staff to follow a two - three days security awareness course .
The course is to be re-done , as a refresher , every two years .
Everyone going into high risk area , should get a separate and customized security briefing .
Every agency and NGO should comply with the MOSS ( Minimum Operational Security Standards ) , and ensure the MOSS guidelines are strictly adhered to .
MOSS compliance is to be verified by an independent external team .
Security compliance should become part of the normal audit cycle .
Complaints about security deficiencies should be handled with the same priority as theft , harassment or embezzlement .
Every agency and NGO should employ a " Dirty Harry " team , with one and only one task : to try and bypass the security systems in order to expose deficiencies .
And most importantly : as you can not reduce the thread , but can only decrease the risk to your staff members : reduce the amount of people we employ in security - risky areas .
Resist donor pressure and the aidwork - inherent - testosterone - craze by wanting to rush into any emergency operation , without thinking " are we really needed there ? " .
In a post reminding everyone on the plight of his two colleagues taken hostage in Darfur , fellow blogger Paul Conneally states
But I want to make it even more black and white :
We , the aid community are left clueless what to do with this increased risk we face .
The only thing we seem to be doing is piling up those sandbags even higher .
Buying more bomb - blast film , bullet - proof jackets and mine - resistant Kevlar layers for our vehicles .
Measures which should be taken , but proven to be insufficient .
I will make a prediction for 2010 : there will be no end to the killing of aidworkers .
And unless the aid community drastically changes its approach toward the risks now inherent to aidwork , one year from now , we will be looking back at the year 2010 and say " This was a bad year .... " .

Drivers who leave more than one pay - and - display ticket on their car windows will be fined
Drivers who ' pay and display ' to park their cars are being fined if they leave earlier tickets showing on their windscreen .
Council traffic wardens are exploiting a legal loophole to penalise motorists who have paid but simply forgot to remove a previous stub from their dashboard or window .
If wardens , or parking attendants , can see more than one ticket , they can fine the motorist .
Penalised : Complaints from motorists over fines for petty infringements , such as displaying a disabled badge upside down , have soared in recent months
Critics have accused greedy council chiefs of seizing on ' pernicious ' technicalities to punish drivers unfairly , in spite of pledges from ministers that town halls should not use their parking powers as a moneymaking scheme .
At present , 265 councils have powers to enforce parking and keep the proceeds under a system known as ' decriminalisation ' which handed over control from the police to local authorities .
The clause imposing a fine on drivers showing multiple pay and display tickets is contravention number nine in a list of parking offences .
' Loophole ' : Council traffic wardens are issuing fines to motorists who fail to remove previous pay - and - display tickets from their dashboards or windows
For example , the City of London Corporation 's website says : ' It is a requirement that only a single ticket is displayed .
If more than one ticket is visible , the civil enforcement officer will issue a penalty charge notice and it is unlikely that we will withdraw it . '
The fines can range from £ 120 in the heart of London to £ 70 outside the capital with a 50 per cent discount if paid within 14 days .
Parking expert Barrie Segal , who runs the AppealNow website , condemned the latest example of councils using their powers to fleece motorists .
Outrage : Critics hit out at the penalties , calling councils ' greedy '
He said : ' This type of enforcement is pernicious .
No traffic has been blocked or delayed and no pedestrian has been endangered and yet the council will issue a parking ticket .
' It is this type of enforcement which convinces motorists that it is not about traffic congestion , traffic flow or safety but just old - fashioned greed to line the council 's coffers . '
Most motorists simply forget to remove old pay and display tickets , he noted .
Last year councils raised £ 328 million in parking fines , three times the amount collected by speed camera partnerships .
Complaints from motorists over fines for petty infringements , such as displaying a disabled badge upside down , have soared in recent months .
Motorists have also been fined when their pay and display ticket has fallen off the windscreen or dashboard .
Such fines are routinely upheld by appeal adjudicators , even if the driver produces the voucher afterwards .
Motorists can also be fined for parking more than 19.6in ( 50 cm ) from the kerb .
The AA criticised the councils ' interpretation of the rules .
A spokesman said : ' It is one thing if somebody is being clever and plastering their windscreen with old pay and display tickets , it is rather different when somebody was in a hurry and forgot to remove an old voucher .
There has to be some sense of proportion . '
The Department for Transport said the rule was intended to make sure all motorists were treated fairly .
A spokesman said : ' Where parking spaces are in short supply , " no return " restrictions may be in place to stop people from monopolising a parking space for a long period of time .
' It is specifically in these cases that rules apply to prevent people from adding a second ticket to extend the amount of time they can park beyond the maximum allowed . '
Kabul , Afghanistan
PRESIDENT OBAMA’S decision on a timetable for withdrawal of American troops only makes official what everyone here has known for a while : the clock is ticking in Afghanistan .
The Taliban have long recognized this , and many captured militants have reminded their interrogators that “ you have the watches , but we have the time . ”
As we quicken the pace , the top American commander here , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , has repeatedly noted that there are many issues to focus on : building more competent Afghan Army and police forces , adopting more effective anticorruption measures and reintegrating “ moderate ” Taliban and other insurgent fighters into Afghan society and politics .
But perhaps the most difficult issue is largely outside of General McChrystal ’s control ( and got short shrift in President Obama ’s speech at West Point ) : undermining the Taliban ’s sanctuary in Pakistan .
Thus far , there has been no substantive action taken against the Taliban leadership in Baluchistan Province , south of the Pashtun - dominated areas of Afghanistan .
This is the same mistake the Soviets made in the 1980s , when they failed to act against the seven major mujahadeen groups headquartered in Pakistan .
This sanctuary is critical because the Afghan war is organized and run out of Baluchistan .
Virtually all significant meetings of the Taliban take place in that province , and many of the group ’s senior leaders and military commanders are based there .
“ The Taliban sanctuary in Baluchistan is catastrophic for us , ” a Marine told me on a recent trip to Afghanistan ’s Helmand Province , across the border from Baluchistan .
“ Local Taliban fighters get strategic and operational guidance from across the border , as well as supplies and technical components for their improvised explosive devices . ”
These are not the biggerest of Lego spaceships nor an impossible balancing act .
It 's just Lego Star Wars perfectly photographed using a very clever , and deceitfully simple technique .
This is how the expert Finnish photographer Avanaut did it :
In his own words :
There 's been some questions about how I do the snowshots .
I 've given some verbal information about the technique , but I guess , a photograph about my setup is needed .
So , I made the photos above and below ( in the gallery ) just for the occasion .
The setup is simple really :
All I use is an old transparent CD storage box , some water and my trusty old A4 lightbox for lighting .
For the bottom of the box I have a piece of gray Lego baseplate cut in form and hotglued on a piece of acrylic sheet to give it some weight .
Legos float because of all the air trapped inside individual pieces .
Anything I want to shoot is then easily mounted on the baseplate and inserted inside the CD box .
Photographing " snow " in this scale is difficult , and to amp up the challenge I wanted it to fly around .
The answer was not to use faster shutterspeed but to slow the snow down .
I had a wacky idea to submerge everything in water , it slows down everything that moves .
The water also causes light to reflect from solid surfaces in a way that sometimes helps hiding the miniature scale .
This is an old concept I 've been toying with for ages .
For the snow I use ground plaster of Paris — reacted , not unused gypsum powder !
It is a passive material that does n't stick to anything .
Lighting is done with the lightbox freehand as you can see from the photo below .
I shoot a lot of frames because the " snow " is impossible to control exactly .
And then some Photoshopping is in order , but not always , sometimes none is needed .
The billboard is intended to challenge the stereotypes of the Christmas conception story , but it has been described as offensive to Christians
An unholy row has broken out in New Zealand over a church billboard aimed at " challenging stereotypes " about the birth of Jesus Christ .
A dejected - looking Joseph lies in bed next to Mary under the caption , " Poor Joseph .
God was a hard act to follow " .
St Matthew - in - the - City Church in Auckland , which erected the billboard , said it had intended to provoke debate .
But the Catholic Church , among others , has condemned it as " inappropriate " and " disrespectful " .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Within hours of its unveiling , the billboard had been defaced with brown paint .
The church 's vicar , Archdeacon Glynn Cardy , said the aim of the billboard had been to lampoon the literal interpretation of the Christmas conception story .
" What we 're trying to do is to get people to think more about what Christmas is all about , " he told the New Zealand Press Association ( NZPA ) .
" Is it about a spiritual male God sending down sperm so a child would be born , or is it about the power of love in our midst as seen in Jesus ? "
The billboard was defaced within hours of its unveiling
He told NZPA that the church had received e-mails and phone calls about the controversial image .
" About 50 % said they loved it , and about 50 % said it was terribly offensive , " he said .
" But that 's out of about 20 responses - this is New Zealand . "
But Lyndsay Freer , spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Auckland , said the poster was offensive to Christians .
" Our Christian tradition of 2,000 years is that Mary remains a virgin and that Jesus is the son of God , not Joseph , " she told the New Zealand Herald .
" Such a poster is inappropriate and disrespectful . "
The family values group Family First said any debate about the Virgin birth should be held inside the church .
" To confront children and families with the concept as a street billboard is completely irresponsible and unnecessary , " Family First director Bob McCroskrie told the news website stuff .

( CNN ) --
An anti-abortion activist charged with gunning down a Wichita , Kansas , doctor cannot use the " necessity defense " at trial , a judge ruled Tuesday .
Scott Roeder , 51 , is set to stand trial January 11 on one count of first - degree murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller , who was shot to death at his church May 31 .
Tiller ran a women 's clinic in which he performed abortions .
Tiller , 67 , was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late - term abortions .
He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain .
Under a necessity defense , a defendant argues an action was justified because breaking the law was more advantageous to society than following it .
Several anti-abortion activists facing criminal charges have attempted to use the defense but none has been successful .
In an Associated Press interview last month , Roeder admitted killing Tiller and said he plans to argue at this trial that the shooting was justified .
" Because of the fact preborn children 's lives were in imminent danger , this was the action I chose , " he said . " ...
I want to make sure that the focus is , of course , obviously on the preborn children and the necessity to defend them . "
Roeder 's comments prompted prosecutors to file a motion asking Sedgwick County Judge Warren Wilbert to bar Roeder 's attorneys from using the defense .
Wilbert noted that the Kansas Supreme Court , in a previous case regarding blocking entrance to an abortion clinic , ruled the necessity defense cannot be used when the harm the defendant claims to be avoiding through his or her actions is a constitutional and legal activity , and the defendant broke the law .
That precedent , Wilbert said , required him to rule that the necessity defense is not a viable defense in Kansas or in the Roeder case .
Defense attorney Mark Rudy pointed out to Wilbert that the defense team has not yet acknowledged what their tactic might be .
Roeder , however , filed a 100 - page motion on his own behalf , Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said Tuesday , on the necessity defense , acknowledging it previously has been unsuccessful .
Prosecutors also asked Wilbert to bar Roeder 's attorneys from claiming his alleged actions were justified because he used force in the defense of another -- the unborn .
Wilbert said that would require further argument -- particularly an offering from defense attorneys regarding the evidence they plan to present in support of that premise at trial .
" I will leave the door open on the issues surrounding use of force in defense of another , " the judge said , adding he does not mean it's " wide open . "
Under the law , such a defense can only be used if a defendant was preventing unlawful conduct .
Foulston argued that Tiller posed no threat that would justify his shooting .
" Dr. Tiller was not an aggressor , " she said .
Roeder is also charged with two counts of aggravated assault for threatening two church members .
Dressed in a coat and tie , he conferred with his attorneys and listened intently to the arguments on Tuesday .
In a June interview with CNN's Ted Rowlands , Roeder would not admit that he killed Tiller , but said that if he is convicted , " the entire motive was the defense of the unborn . "
Roeder 's attorneys also argued Tuesday that the trial should be moved outside Wichita because extensive pretrial publicity in the case could have tainted the jury pool .
Foulston , meanwhile , noted that Roeder , who has talked often to the media , brought some of that publicity on himself .
Wilbert said 300 jury summonses have gone out in the case , and he was optimistic that some impartial jurors could be found .
However , he said he would revisit the issue later if the court experienced difficulty in picking jurors .
Rudy also asked that the judge prohibit prosecutors from excluding potential jurors because they have anti-abortion beliefs .
The judge said he was confident that some individuals who are anti-abortion would still be able to make an impartial decision , but suggested the issue be examined on a juror - by - juror basis if the court recognizes a pattern of exclusion during jury selection .
" I can't make a pretrial ruling and just make a broad - brush approach , " he said .
Wreckage of first plane taken to Antarctica in 1912 is a once in a blue moon find
A 'lost '
British - made aircraft that was taken to Antarctica by explorer Douglas Mawson has been found lying under the ice - a once in a million find thanks to global warming , a low tide and a blue moon .
Sir Douglas , who was born in Yorkshire in 1882 but later became an Australian citizen , took the fuselage of the aircraft to the frozen continent in 1911 to use as a ' tractor on skis ' to pull his sledges .
But the plan to use what he described as his ' air tractor ' failed because the engine could not withstand the sub- zero cold and the Vickers monoplane was abandoned on the ice when Mawson left Antarctica .
The rusty cast iron joints of a aircraft buried in the Antarctic ice in 1921 were found on New Year 's Day
Now a team of Australian scientists have found the aircraft lying under a sheet of thin ice , its whereabouts exposed by the work of nature .
' Historically low tides prompted by a blue moon - the second full moon in a calendar month - and the unprecedented melting of the ice led to its chance discovery , ' said Australian conservationist David Jenson .
' It was probably one chance in a million that these conditions just allowed us to spot it .
' One of our heritage carpenters was actually just wandering along the edge of the harbour ... and he spotted the piece of the metal amongst the rocks .
' You talk about once in a blue moon - well , this was true . '
hiding history : Rocks in Commonwealth
Bay where the iron joints were discovered
The Vickers plane was the first aircraft to come off the company 's factory production line in Britain - eight years after the Wright brothers ' first flight .
Mawson , described as ' a visionary ' by Mr Jenson , planned to fly the aircraft over Antarctica once it had been taken by ship to Australia .
But his dreams ended during a demonstration flight in Adelaide in October 1911 when the plane crashed and the wings were so badly damaged they could not be repaired .
' Mawson sacked the pilot and sent him back to England , ' said Mr Jenson , adding that the damaged wings were removed and Mawson took the fuselage to the Antarctic with him to use as a tractor .
Sledge runners were fitted to the undercarriage and Mawson planned to use the front propeller as the power to drag the aircraft along , with loads , also on sledges , being towed along behind on the ice .
How it was :
An unidentified man stands by a Vickers airplane used during an Antarctic Expedition in 1912
But the whole idea failed .
Powerful winds meant that even if the entire aircraft , with wings , could have been taken to the continent it would not have been able to fly and while the ' air tractor ' did manage to tow a load up an ice plateau , the engine seized .
' It developed an internal disorder ' was the way Mawson described it .
The aircraft was abandoned and later hauled to Cape Denison where the expedition 's photographer managed to take a picture of it before he sailed home .
Mawson almost died when he missed a rescue ship , but eventually made it back home .
The name " Blue Moon " actually refers to the rare occurrence of a second full moon appearing in a single month
Mawson did return to Cape Denison in 1931 and was surprised to see his ' air tractor 's ' steel fuselage deep in snow .
Modern explorers wondered whether they would ever be able to find it again - the last sighting in 1975 revealed it was almost totally buried in ice - but nature has now revealed its presence .
Here ’s one of my 2009 New Year ’s Resolutions a couple of weeks early : I hereby resolve not to consume the products of any company that advertises during the BCS Games for the entire month of January .
Advertisement
For purposes of this resolution consume is defined broadly .
I ’m not buying a car , a taco , a beer or insurance from the advertisers .
I ’d ask anyone who ’s disgusted with the current state of college football in America to join me .
Take a stand for one month to express your outrage over college football ’s refusal to consider the wishes of their fans and institute a playoff .
We ’re approaching 2009 and the dawn of yet another season of BCS controversy .
The state of Texas is contemplating becoming a Republic again , there are four games no one gives two shits about and ESPN has ponied up $ 495 million for the rights to air the BCS games from 2011 - 2014 .
Next year your team could be the one getting screwed .
About this time of year everyone complains about the BCS but no one ever comes up with a solution that actually makes sense to end the BCS .
That 's because most solutions involve not watching the games , not buying the tickets , or relying on college football presidents and the companies that make money off the BCS to come to their senses .
Plainly , for true college football fans , none of these are viable options .
So we all end up pissed with nothing to show for it .
At least until now .

I 've spent an awful lot of time thinking of ways that actual fans ( who are n't billionaires ) can have an impact on bringing about a playoff .
And this is my idea — boycott the BCS advertisers .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
After New Year ’s you ’ll have seven days to gear up for the BCS Championship Game between Oklahoma and Florida on January 8 .
There will be five BCS games in all and thanks to the continued allegiance of college football fans , all five of these games will garner high ratings .
Last year ’s Ohio State - LSU game brought in 23.1 million viewers .
This year ’s game will bring in even more viewers .
And these numbers are one of the reasons why ESPN was willing to pay $ 495 million to steal away the broadcast rights from Fox .
Posting viewership like this enabled
Fox to sell almost all of the advertising spots for their games before the match - up was even announced .
How much did those spots sell for in 2008 ?
Try a reported $ 500,000 for the non - title games and up to $ 950,000 for the title game spots .
So there ’s huge advertising money out there to support these games .
Why ?
Because even if fans do n’t particularly like the way college football selects their national champion , they ’re still going to tune in to watch the games .
Particularly men ages 18 - 49 who are the most difficult to reach for advertisers .
Bingo , a flawed system still brings in a lucrative payoff .
Advertisement
That ’s why calls for fan boycotts of the game have been so ineffective in the past .
No matter how convoluted , communistic , or unfair the college football finale is , no fan will give up the chance to watch this game .
College football fan outrage does n’t trump college football fandom .
Fair enough .
I hate the BCS but you can bet I ’m going to be sitting down and watching these games .
So asking fans to boycott the games themselves either by not traveling to them or not watching them on television is a losing proposition .
But , here ’s the deal , if we ’ve learned anything in the modern media landscape it ’s that advertising determines whether or not programming continues .
If a program is n’t doing well enough in the ratings it gets pulled , because advertisers want to reach viewers .
This is pretty basic stuff .
Clearly ratings are n’t going to be an issue for BCS games .
Millions are going to watch no matter who plays .
But advertisers also want their products to be well - received .
They do n’t want to antagonize consumers by helping to promote causes , ideas , or beliefs that their consumers find offensive .
Keep in mind it was n’t a threatened boycott of listening to Don Imus ’s radio show that was an issue after his controversial comments , it was one advertiser after another publicly announcing that they did n’t want to continue to be associated with his program and were consequently pulling their advertising dollars .
Bang , Imus crumbled and his radio show ( and its television simulcast ) came to an end .
At least for a while .
You can agree or disagree with the decision to pull his show , but what you ca n’t dispute is that it was pressure from consumers against advertisers that brought about the show ’s demise .
And it was the public indignation regarding Imus 's advertisers that got me really thinking , college football fans could do the same thing to BCS advertisers .
Advertisement
Only there are tens of millions more people who watch college football than ever listened to Don Imus on the radio .
Plus , these tens of millions of BCS haters spend billions and billions of dollars on the products advertised during BCS games .
Even a small minority of consumers choosing to switch away from their usual product selections for a month will be felt by these companies .
That ’s why I ’m encouraging fans not to support all the advertisers who buy commercial spots for the BCS games .
But even that ’s not enough .
Instead support their competitors , the companies who were n’t willing to help prop up an illegitimate way to crown a college football champion .
After all , in today 's age most products are fairly fungible .
Not only will you be taking from the pockets of the BCS advertisers , but you 'll be enriching their competitors .
Eventually those companies are going to notice .
Advertisement
Who are these advertisers ?
Well , we do n’t know them all yet .
That ’s because Fox and ABC do n’t release the names of their advertisers prior to the games .
Not even when you call the companies and ask nicely .
The individual companies can announce , however , and that 's especially the case when they buy naming rights sponsorships for bowl games .
Here are four big targets .
1. FedEx -
For the month of January do n’t even consider FedEx as your delivery service of choice .
As both the named sponsor for the BCS Title Game and the Orange Bowl , it 's hard to find a company that is more supportive of college football 's communistic
If you already have an account with FedEx consider switching next January to a company that does n’t support the BCS as much as they do .
Basically any competitor .
2. Tostitos - I eat Tostitos all the time while I 'm watching college football .
But , they ’re dead to me for the month of January .
And , fortunately for me , there are a billion other companies that make chips and are n't screwing up a playoff .
3. Citi- Is n't the sponsor of the Rose Bowl almost bankrupt anyway ?
In fact , is this sponsorship , shudder , being paid for by taxpayer dollars via the bailout ?
4. AllState -
Go to one of the other insurance companies if you 're looking for insurance .
Trust me , the companies are n't much different anyway .

This is just a start but it's the four most egregious advertisers helping to keep an illegitimate system afloat .
Join me in taking the ultimate capitalistic stand against a totalitarian system , spend your money on their competitors who do n't foist an unfair and illegitimate national champion upon us .
And join the facebook petition in the process .
( Note : I originally wrote this as a ClayNation column for CBS .
It was set to run on December 31 , 2007 and then , the day it was set to go up , I received word that the editors at CBS decided this boycott idea might anger their own advertisers and so they would n't publish it .
I respected their position but it made me realize just how much in bed with the BCS every major media company truly was .
Nothing changes with college football because the power structure does n't want anything to change .
That 's only going to get worse .
Unless fans like you and me actually take control of the process . )

Northern Territory police say a would - be burglar has been electrocuted while breaking into an outback petrol station .
Duty superintendent Michael Murphy says the owner of the Jabiru petrol station found the 24 - year - old man dead inside the roof about 11 pm Sunday .
He says the man 's body was found hanging and entangled in the cables .
" It appears the male has entered through the roof space into the ceiling cavity , obviously activated the alarm and I believe at this stage has either panicked or he 's tried to terminate the alarm by cutting cables with a pair of secateurs , " he said .
" He 's inadvertently grabbed a live power cable , cut that and obviously ... had fatal injuries from electrocution . "
He says it is the second time in a week that someone in the Northern Territory has been electrocuted by roof cabling .
" We 've [ also ] seen the tragedy of the death of a 23 - year - old man at Palmerston , who died from what appears to be electrocution as well , " he said .
" Have qualified people deal with electrical cables , anything that requires adequate training - get your qualified people to engage in that sort of thing , do n't do it yourself because there 's inherent dangers with it . "
Ryan Kesler is the lone American on the current Canucks roster but that does n't mean hockey was any less important growing up .
Hockey runs in his family and his dad was his coach so it 's something that was pretty hard to escape .
As a first round pick , all eyes were on the talented centre from Livonia , Michigan but it was n't always that easy .
He went from having no team to now being picked to play for one of the most significant teams of his career , Team USA in the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympic Games .
Kesler shares his tales from his road to the NHL .
How old were you when you got your first pair of skates ?
Four ?
But I do n’t really remember .
My first skating lessons were mini might with my dad - my dad taught me .
Livonia Eddie Edgar Arena .
I do n't remember if I was any good but I just remember not being the biggest guy on the ice .
The Livonia Knights when I was 5 years old .
What can you remember about this photo ( pictured left ) ?
That was the Livonia North Stars and I think was six or seven .
I know that the haircut was definitely not my idea - for sure it was my dad .
Growing up the rink was ...
Cold .
How did you get into hockey ?
It was probably my dad and my brother ’s idea intitially because they were both involved in it .
I know later on , I kept doing it because I wanted to do everything my older brother was doing so that ’s probably why I started .
What is your favourite childhood hockey memory ?
Skating in my backyard rink .
No one knew how to skate around where we lived so my brother and I were the only ones who would use it but not my sister , we did n’t let her .
Me and my brother actually got along , we were best friends , we ’re like Hank and Danny - we never fight .
What was hockey like growing up in your hometown ?
It was big where I was .
The Detroit area is a pretty good area for hockey so it ’s kind of like a Canadian city that way .
It was very competitive .
What is your proudest hockey moment ?
So far , probably my first NHL game .
It was against the Toronto Maple Leafs in Toronto .
I played against Mats Sundin and then I ended up playing with him so that was pretty cool .
I remember I had a breakaway and missed with Ed Belfour in net but I did n't score that night .
What advice would you give someone aspiring to get into the NHL ?
Just work hard .
If you work hard , it does n’t matter about skill that much , it ’s about hard work .
What was the biggest obstacle to get to where you are today ?
I was going to quit hockey when I was 15 because I did n’t make any teams and I got cut from all the teams .
But I did n’t end up quitting because my dad took over a team and I wanted to play for him .
Having my dad as my coach , he was harder on me big time - I was the whipping boy .
I could n’t get away from him because I had to drive home in the car with him but he was probably one of my better hockey coaches - maybe my best one .
He never liked when I was inconsistent , like when I had one good game and one bad game - he did n’t like that .
I just remember at the game , I had to try my hardest and try my best and it ’s helped me here .
Do you ever still get the feeling like this is unbelievable that you 've made it here ?
Yes , it ’s very humbling when you sit back and look at how many people actually do make it and I ’m a lucky one so it feels great .
Hamlet Introduction
If extraterrestrials were to visit Planet Earth , we 'd probably put a copy of Hamlet in their welcome basket .
It 's that good .
Well over 400 years after William Shakespeare wrote the play between 1599 and 1601 , readers and audiences are still connecting with it .
Shakespeare was a groundbreaking pioneer in his time and wrote plays that were totally different from anything the world had ever seen before .
He explored the human spirit and what happens when it is challenged .
He also tested the limits of language , inventing new words and phrases .
( You want an example ?
How about : " eaten out of house and home " or " one fell swoop . " )
Hamlet , in particular , has a lot of " most famous " things in it : it 's Shakespeare 's most famous play about Shakespeare 's most famous character ( that would be Hamlet ) , and it contains Shakespeare 's most famous line : " To be or not to be , that is the question " ( 3.1.64 ) .
The play tells the story of Prince Hamlet .
But Hamlet 's no party - boy prince .
When the action begins , we discover that his dad ( the King of Denmark ) has been murdered by his own brother and Hamlet 's uncle , Claudius .
Ouch .
Talk about sibling rivalry .
And it gets worse : not too long after the murder , Claudius married Hamlet 's mom , Gertrude .
So , what 's a prince to do ?
If you 're Hamlet , not much of anything .
He 's got a big to - do list ( and only five acts to complete it ) , but he just can't figure out how to get himself moving .
Honestly , we understand .
It 's hard enough to make it through our to - do list , and our biggest item is " Laundry . "
In comparison , Hamlet 's to - do list is epic .
For starters , there are the obvious things : hang out with Dad 's ghost , feign madness , dump girlfriend , accuse Mom of treachery , plot the convoluted details of your elaborate revenge .
Then , of course , there 's the big item : kill Uncle / Stepdad / King .
Whew .
No wonder he drags his feet .
Hamlet is such a complex character that playing him is the actor equivalent of going to the Olympics .
Check out the super - famous roster :
Shakespeare did n't come up with this story all on his lonesome .
( Do n't call the plagiarism brigade just yet : most of Shakespeare 's plots are borrowed , and people in the 16th century did n't think about " originality " in the same way we do . )
The story of Hamlet dates back to at least the 9th century .
It centers on " Amleth " ( sound familiar ? ) , a young man who fakes being crazy in order avenge his father 's murder .
Saxo the Grammarian included the tale in a 12th century text and later , François de Belleforest translated the story from Latin into French in Histoires Tragiques ( 1570 ) , which is where Shakespeare may have found it .
The story did n't end with Shakespeare , either .
Other people followed in Shakespeare 's footsteps and further adapted the story , including legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa ( in The Bad Sleep Well ) , Disney ( in The Lion King ) , The Simpsons , and tons of English students on YouTube .
And who knows ?
Maybe your adaptation will be next .

Edit , 1/22 : My blog post about getting out of jury duty .
Guaranteed or your money back .
I did get dismissed from jury duty last week after they interviewed me for 30 seconds , but after I ’d sat there doing absolutely nothing for 12 hours over 2 days .
I learned a lot of interesting stuff about the process from watching and listening to everything go down , and from all the folks who emailed or twittered their jury duty stories to me , so thanks to you guys .
I ’m writing a short blog post about it which I ’ll put up tomorrow .
There ’s not enough you ’re so white jokes out there so here ’s a few .
My buddy Noah contributed the Mos Def line so shout - out to him ( I ’m so white I use the term “ shout - out ” ) .
Best I found on Google was something like you ’re so white , the government takes away money instead of giving it to you … which is all right , though I think it ’s more interesting to contrast it with what banks do , which is the exact opposite ( this is from a Louis CK bit ) – when you ’re rich , banks give you more money , and when you ’re poor they charge you low - balance fees .
Yeah I just sucked all the humor out of it all , but at least I hope you found my comic funny today .
Apparently this here ’s a zero-sum comedy site .

The Psychological Immune System
We get over bad moods much sooner than we predict , thanks to the covert work of the psychological immune system .
One of the most incredible things about the human mind is its resilience .
Let ’s face it , life can be pretty depressing at times , and yet people generally push on much the same as they always have , sometimes even with a spring in their step and a smile on their face .
How come one day it seems like the world is going to end and the next there ’s hope ?
And how come our bad moods lift so unexpectedly , like a brick sprouting wings and disappearing into the clear blue sky ?
The reason is that we all have a secret weapon against bad moods : a psychological immune system .
When we experience events that send us into an emotional tailspin it kicks in to try and protect us from the worst of it .
The difference between our physical and psychological immune systems is that we know all about the physical .
When we get a cold , we can see and feel our body ’s defence systems activating .
Not so for the psychological immune system .
Strangely we seem not to notice it working away to reduce our negative emotions , our secret weapon is also a secret from ourselves .
How bad will rejection make you feel ?
Daniel T. Gilbert of Harvard University and colleagues explored this surprising phenomenon in a series of classic social psychology studies ( Gilbert et al. , 1998 ) .
They set up a situation almost all of us would be familiar with : going for a job interview and getting rejected .
First they led participants to believe they were going for a job interview but , beforehand , in amongst a load of other irrelevant questions , asked them how they would feel if they did n’t get it .
Of course there was no job to get and they were duly told they did n’t get it , then asked , again subtly , how they felt now .
What Gilbert and colleagues were interested in was the difference between how people predicted they ’d feel and how they actually did feel .
In other words : do people understand they have a psychological immune system and that it will do its best to improve their emotional state after the rejection ?
There was also a little twist in the tail : half the participants were told they were being evaluated for the job by one person and the other half that they were being evaluated by three people .
This meant that for the half that were evaluated by one person it was easier to rationalise a rejection since when there ’s only one person deciding it ’s easier to imagine the decision had more to do with that person ’s individual preferences .
Being rejected by three people , though , feels like a more considered judgement for the candidate .
Not as bad as you think
Here ’s what the experimenters found .
People predicted that if they were rejected they would feel about 2 points worse on a scale of 1 to 10 compared with their mood when they started the experiment .
Immediately after rejection those for whom the rejection was easy to rationalise only felt 0.4 of a point worse on the scale , not 2 points worse .
And after 10 minutes they felt just as happy as when they started the experiment .
The immune system had done its work and people ’s predictions were way off .
The news was n’t quite so good for the participants in the difficult to rationalise condition , but it still was n’t as bad as they expected .
Instead of a 2 point drops on the scale of 1 to 10 , they experienced a 0.68 drop immediately and 1.25 point drop after 10 minutes , once the rejection had really sunk in .
The strain was much greater for the psychological immune system in this condition and it did n’t do so well .
Still , neither groups felt as bad as they thought they would .
And this pattern is repeated again and again across other psychology studies .
When we ’re hit by one of life ’s frequent kicks to a tender zone , the psychological immune system starts its work , rationalising what has happened and , over time , stopping it hurting as much as we expected .
In the same paper Gilbert and colleagues report studies on people getting dumped by their partners , told their personalities are deficient and academics failing to get tenure .
The pattern repeats : people think it ’s going to feel bad , but generally it ’s not as bad as they expect , and people recover quicker than they predict .
The merciful unconscious
The very fact that we do n’t seem to notice our psychological immune system is probably the only reason it works at all .
After all , in order to feel better we have to conveniently forget some important facts , such as how much we wanted the job we did n’t get , loved the partner who walked out or were enjoying the ice cream we just dropped .
But the good news is when life deals out its cruellest blows , our unconscious will be working overtime to find the upside .
That ’s why life often does n’t turn out to feel as bad as we think .
Soon enough most of us are on our merry way again with a bounce in our step , all thanks to the merciful but covert work of the psychological immune system .
State lawmakers are taking aim at what some of them see as a menace to California ’s environment : free parking .
There is too much of it , the legislators say , and it encourages people to drive instead of taking the bus , walking or riding a bike .
All that motoring is contributing to traffic jams and pollution , according to state Sen.
Alan Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) , and on Thursday he won Senate approval of a proposal he hopes will prompt cities and businesses to reduce the availability of free parking .
“ Free parking has significant social , economic and environmental costs , ” Lowenthal said .
“ It increases congestion and greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Republicans opposed the measure , saying the Legislature should not be meddling in how much people pay to park .

“ If local governments want to entice people to shop or do business in a particular area , that is entirely their business .
Not the state ’s , ” said Sen. Tom Harman ( R- Huntington Beach ) .
The bill , supported by the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) and the Sierra Club , provides financial incentives for cities and counties to stop providing free parking on the street and at government offices and to reduce the amount they require businesses to provide .
Cities that take such action could get more state money for parking garages and transit programs and bonus points in competing for state grants .
When a store provides free parking , the cost to maintain , clean , insure , secure and light the parking lot is passed on to shoppers in higher prices for goods , said Justin Horner , an analyst with the NRDC .
Free street parking is paid for by the entire community in the form of higher taxes , he said .

Lowenthal said that when businesses pay for their employees ’ parking , more of them drive to work .
“ It ’s nice that we ’ve been treated to this luxury , ” Lowenthal said .
“ The problem with free parking is it ’s not free . ”

It is with bittersweet feelings that I announce that as of January 1 , 2010 , I will no longer be President of the James Randi Educational Foundation .
On that date , skeptic , podcaster , and all - around good guy D. J. Grothe will take the helm .
The JREF has a press release online with more information .
This was a very difficult decision for me .
But I 'm leaving the Presidency so I can concentrate on some future TV projects I 've been developing .
This has been a dream of mine for more than a decade , and something I 've worked on very hard , so it 's an opportunity I simply could not pass up .
With that in mind , I discussed this with Randi and the other members of the JREF Board of Directors , and we all agreed it was for the best .
Not to rationalize this too much , but if this does work out it means I 'll be able to promote skepticism , science , and critical thinking to a much larger audience .
This will ultimately benefit the JREF itself , too .
I 'm really happy D. J. accepted the role of President in my stead .
He is a beloved member of the skeptical community .
His podcast , Point of Inquiry , is among the best in the business .
He is a thoughtful , intellectual , interesting , and warm person , and will be an outstanding example of leadership when he takes the JREF reins .
With D. J. involved , the future of the JREF is stronger than ever .
And this is n't to say I 'm severing all ties with the JREF !
Far from it .
I strongly believe ( if I may use that word ) in the mission and goals of the Foundation , and I have no desire to just walk away .
I 'll stay on in an informal capacity to advise , impart my rich wisdom , and tell Randi puns .
You have to stick with your strengths .
And to belay the obvious question : I can't disclose any more details about the TV stuff right now .
Sorry , but I really can't .
Rules is rules .
Trust me , when I have news I can report I 'll be singing it from the rooftops .
The past 15 months have been quite the whirlwind , what with TAM 7 , TAM London , Randi 's health announcement , and so much more .
The JREF stands solid and tall in the world of skepticism and critical thinking .
Being a part of it , representing it , and working with Randi himself has been more than an honor .
It 's been , well , amazing .
And finally , I want to thank everyone who has been involved with the JREF : the staff ; the circle of magicians , scientists , and skeptics we contact for advice and help ; the JREF Board of Directors for accepting me into the fold in the first place , and Randi his own self .
Without him , it would just be the EF .
And that 's just silly .
And , of course , the JREF community at large across the planet .
You are the ones who have made us who we are : a global force of rationality and reason .
You know as well as we do that the struggle against the forces of unreason will never end .
Without your support , your energy , and your enthusiasm , our ability to stand up for sense and science would grind to a halt .
Presidents will come and go , but you will always be there , and that means more to us -- more to me -- than can be said .
Thank you all .

Veteran astronomer Ned Wright is already considered pretty smart .
But soon he ’ll be getting wise .
That ’s WISE as in Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , the NASA spacecraft set for launch on December 11 that will provide the most comprehensive examination of the sky ever recorded in infrared radiation .
Wright , of the University of California , Los Angeles , leads the $ 320 million robotic mission , which for at least nine months will map the sky in four bands of infrared wavelengths .
These wavelengths , ranging from 3.3 micrometers to 23 micrometers , are absorbed by Earth ’s atmosphere and ca n’t be seen from the ground .
The mission is expected to catalog hundreds of millions of infrared - emitting bodies , including hundreds of dim , previously unknown asteroids and comets that cross Earth ’s orbit .
WISE will also give a detailed census of thousands of failed stars , called brown dwarfs , and millions of distant galaxies that glow unusually brightly at infrared wavelengths .
WISE is expected to dramatically boost the number of known debris disks — composed of pulverized rocky remnants of planet formation — around young stars and to turn up more of the dusty cocoons that serve as birth sites for stars .
Dust will be easily detected because it absorbs the visible and ultraviolet light from these hatchlings and reradiates the light in the infrared .
The craft is also likely to find the nearest known brown dwarfs — Jupiter - sized balls of gas that are not quite massive enough to keep burning like stars do .
Wright calculates that WISE may find as many as 100 brown dwarfs within a mere 20 light - years of Earth .
By imaging hundreds of thousands of asteroids in the main belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , WISE will provide the first complete census of the number and sizes of these rocky bodies and new information about their composition , Wright says .
“ I ’m very excited because we ’re going to be seeing parts of the universe that we have n’t seen before , ” he notes .
Wright views the mission as the successor to the Infrared Astronomical Satellite , which in 1983 became the first craft to survey the entire sky in the infrared .
WISE is 500 times more sensitive than IRAS was at the mid-infrared wavelengths of 12 micrometers and 23 micrometers , meaning that the new craft will record much fainter infrared sources and pinpoint their locations with much greater accuracy .
Researchers still use data generated by the now - defunct IRAS to guide high - resolution observations by large infrared telescopes .
In the same way , WISE , which relies on a relatively small 40 - centimeter telescope , is expected to provide an avalanche of data to help target searches by much larger telescopes , such as the recently launched European Space Agency ’s Herschel telescope and especially the James Webb Space Telescope , the proposed infrared successor to the Hubble Space Telescope .
“ IRAS was the gift that just kept on giving , and I think WISE will do the same , ” comments Charles Beichman of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
“ When you make a breakthrough of hundreds to thousands in sensitivity , great things will follow .
When you do that over the whole sky , it will be referenced for decades to come . ”
The craft will settle into a polar orbit around Earth , allowing WISE to sweep out a circle that will slowly precess , or change its angle of inclination .
That orbit will enable WISE , which takes a snapshot every 11 seconds , to scan the entire sky in six months .
The craft will then begin a second , partial scan of the sky that will last three months .
A tank of hydrogen ice will keep WISE chilled to 15 degrees above absolute zero , reducing infrared emissions from the craft that could interfere with detection of faint infrared sources from space .
Wright expects the first images to be released a few months after launch , but he says the first detailed maps wo n’t be available until sometime around April 2011 .

A karácsonyi készülődés akkor is egy kicsit sűrűvé teszi az életet , ha egyébként nem kapjuk be a konzumfrászt , és nem rohangálunk bevásárlóközponttól bevásárlóközpontig , ha nem vergődünk a városi dugóban , és ha nem kapunk szénmonoxid mérgezést az áruház pinceparkolójában , mire ki tudunk végre jutni .
Van néhány hasznos ötletem --- ráadásul mind rövid --- , amelyet érdemes átfutnia , ha Ön is szeretné elkerülni , hogy a nagy készülődésre több idegsejtet áldozzon , mint amennyi az éves erre szánt kerete .
Jöjjön tehát a 10+1 hasznos tipp .
1. Döntse el , mennyit fog költeni
Ez nem csak akkor fontos , ha nagyon be kell osztania a pénzt .
Mindenképp döntse el , milyen összeget szán az idén ajándékokra és egyebekre ( beleértve a karácsonyi menüt is ) , tervezze meg --- ehhez bőven elég 30 - 60 perc --- , és írja le .
Ragaszkodjon ehhez a kerethez , illetve határozza meg előre , hogy legfeljebb mennyivel térhet el tőle .
Kiegészítés : vásároljon néhány tartalék ajándékot ( pl. bonbont ) arra az esetre , ha váratlan látogatója érkezne az ünnepekre .
Ezt se felejtse ki a büdzséből .
Mindig kiderül , hogy a nagy családi összejövetelre sok év után most először jön el valaki , aki már rég nem volt ott .
2 . Már a vásárlás után csomagolja be
Ha mindent egyszerre akar majd becsomagolni , a végére nagyon elege lesz .
Pedig csomagolni jó --- ilyenkor is jobb azokra gondolni , akiket megajándékoz , mint arra , hogy már éjjel 2 óra , és még mennyi teendője van .
Ha rögtön aznap este becsomagolja az ajándékot , amikor megvásárolta , akkor az egész éjszakás maratoni csomagolási őrület kipipálva .
És meglátja , a csomagok is szebbek lesznek , hiszen több ideje és energiája marad minden egyes darabra .
Jobb lesz a kedve , kreatívabb lesz .
Ja , és az sem fordulhat elő , hogy a legváratlanabb pillanatban fogy ela csomagolópapír .
3 . Ne december 24 - én csomagolja ki az égőket
Velem már többször előfordult , hogy már ott állt a fa a nappaliban , amikor kiderült , hogy nem működnek az égők .
Ilyenkor elég stresszes kivakarózni a feny őtüskéből , és kirohanni a legközelebbi --- még nyitva tartó --- üzletbe , hogy megvegye azt az ízlésének valószínűleg egyáltalán nem megfelelő , ámde működőképes égősort , amit ezután gyorsan felszerelhet a fára .
Ha néhány nappal az ünnep előtt kipróbálja az égőket --- persze a gyerekek ne lássák --- , nem érheti ilyen meglepetés .
4 . Amit csak lehet , rendeljen meg online
Egyre több jópofa webáruház van , és egy kis odafigyeléssel hamar ki tudja választani , melyik a megbízható , és ki az , aki majd húsvétra szállítja ki azt , amit most rendel meg .
Ne sajnálja a szállítási költséget : utazásra és parkolásra többet költene , mint amennyit a webáruházak elkérnek a kiszállításért .
És akkor még nem is beszéltem az idejéről .
Én amit lehet , online vásárolok .
A plázákat nem szeretem .
Offline csak vásárokba szeretek járni , ahol el is lehet beszélgetni a kézm űvesekkel .
Ha már vásárolok , szeretem jól érezni magam .
5. Pihenjen rá az ünnepre
Már most kezdjen el egy kicsit többet aludni , hogy az ünnepet ne a fa alá ájulva töltse .
Karácsonykor nagy a jövés - menés ( ez is a szép benne ) , de ha nem elég kipihent , akkor ezt nem fogja élvezni .
6. Töltsön fel elég akkumulátort
Karácsonykor --- főleg , ha gyerekek , unokák is vannak a családban --- sokat fog fényképezni , videózni .
Az ünnep előtt néhány nappal töltse fel az akkumulátorokat , hogy ne kelljen bosszankodnia , amikor valamelyik lemerül ( legyen kéznél másik feltöltött darab ) .
Apropó , fotózás , videózás .
Ingyenes fotózási tippek , főleg gyerekfotózáshoz , >>> itt .
Ingyenes videó és videóvágás tippek >>> itt .
7 . Ne szégyelljen ordítva énekelni
Az autót azért találták fel , hogy azt csináljunk benne , amit akarunk .
Ha már beszorult a dugóba , ne bosszankodjon , kapcsoljon be valami jó zenét , és bátran eressze ki a hangját .
Jobb , mint dühöngeni .
És a többiek úgyse hallják .
( Igen , ilynekor én is ...)
9. Családi képeslapok
A családnak szánt képeslapokat ne boltban vásárolja meg , inkább saját kezűleg készítse el .
Ha vannak gyerekei , jobb módszert nem is találhatna arra , hogy őket is lélekben felkészítse az ünnepre .
Az enyémek már hetek óta festenek , só-liszt gyurmáznak .
( Utóbbiakból kiváló ajándékkísérőket lehet gyártani . )
Persze az étkezőasztal csupa mocsok estére --- de kit érdekel ?
10 . Képeslapok üzletfeleknek
Ha az üzletfeleinek is szeretne képeslapot küldeni , ne hagyja az utolsó napra a megírásukat , mert nem lesz rá ideje .
Naponta írjon meg 5 - 10 ( ha sok partnere van 10 - 50 ) darabot , így még időben végezhet .
A kollégák is segíthetnek .
Extra tipp :
Ha Ön is legalább annyira utálja ezerszer leírni a nevét , mint én , használjon Ön is aláírás bélyegzőt .
Bélyegezni bárki tud , akinek épp nem ég a keze alatt a munka --- bízza a kollégáira .
Figyeljen arra , hogy fényes papírra csak különleges , gyorsan száradó festékkel bélyegezzen .
Hogyan lehet aláírás bélyegzője akár még ma ?
Írjon alá egy sima fehér lapra egy vékony hegyű , lehetőleg fekete filctollal egy kicsivel nagyobb méretben , mint amekkorában egyébként szokott .
Szkennelje be az aláírást , legyen a kép 300 dpi-s , és mentse el bmp formátumban .
Küldje el a belyegzo ( kukac ) belyegzoexpressz.hu címre vagy
Lépjen be a Bélyegző Expressz webáruházba , és töltse fel egy kiválasztott bélyegző grafikájaként .
A többit megoldjuk .
10+1 .
Érezze jól magát !
Az egész ünnep ezért van .
Ezt ne feledje !
Utóirat :
Hétfőn , december 14 - én leszek 40 éves .
Figyelje a postafiókját , mert hatalmas buli lesz , sok ajándékkal !
De csak egy napig .
És nem , nem csak az kap ajándékot , aki vásárol .
Mindenki kap !
Most tényleg gondolja meg , hogy érdemes-e csak azért lemaradni --- például --- a hétfői ajándékesőről , mert nem kap róla időben értesítést .
És ha az jön ki , hogy nem akar lecsúszni erről a lehet őségről , és Ön még nem regisztrált olvasója a Bélyegző Expressz blognak , akkor gyorsan regisztráljon itt .

Customs officials said China had come through a weak trading period China 's exports rose 17.7 % in December , state media have reported , suggesting the country has overtaken Germany as the world 's largest exporter .
The rise , compared to a year earlier , breaks a 13 - month decline in trade as a result of the global downturn .
Xinhua said total exports for 2009 were $ 1.2tn ( £ 749bn ) , but total foreign trade over the year was down 13.9 % .
Correspondents say the figures will lead to new demands from China 's competitors that it revalue the yuan .
Last year saw a continuing decrease in China 's trade as the global economic downturn led to a fall in demand for its products .
But in the last few weeks of the year , there was a far greater rise than forecasters had expected , with foreign exports reaching $ 130.7bn , up 17.7 % on the previous December .
China 's General Administration of Customs ( GAC ) said exports overall in the year were $ 1.2tn , down 16 % from in 2008 , while imports were 11.2 % down from a year earlier at $ 1.01tn .
The politically sensitive total trade surplus was down 34.2 % to $ 196.1 bn .
The figures suggests China will surpass Germany 's export total for the whole of 2009 , although this will not be confirmed until Germany 's full - year data is published in February .
Yuan demand A spokesman for GAC said the increase was " an important turning point " for the country .
Many of China 's exporters are low - cost manufacturers " It is safe to say now that Chinese exporters have come right through the period of weakness , " Xinhua quoted statistician Huang Guohua as saying .
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai says many of China 's producers are low - cost manufacturers who assemble equipment such as i-Pods using foreign components .
The latest figures are being seen as an indication that those manufacturers have proved resilient in the downturn and are benefitting as their customers restock , says our correspondent .
But the figures are likely to lead to renewed complaints from China 's trading competitors that its currency is undervalued , he added .
Led by the US , they say it is unfair that China has been able to make its good cheaper by keeping the yuan weak , but Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has said China " will not yield " to foreign demands that it revalue the currency .
Beijing has long said that it will not allow the yuan to trade freely until its domestic economy was strong enough to pick up any resulting decline in exports .
The slowing decline in Chinese trade has also been taken as a sign that the country 's stimulus package is working .
Beijing raised tax rebates on exports several times in 2009 , increased tax refunds and improved export credit insurance .

Precision Cosmology
Lecture description :
In his " little ride " from Earth into the far reaches of space and time , Max Tegmark demonstrates the success of new technologies such as orbiting space telescopes and super computer number crunching that enable scientists to test their theories of the universe .
Tegmark remarks , " 30 years ago , cosmology was largely viewed as somewhere out there between philosophy and metaphysics .
You could speculate over a bunch of beers about what happened , and then you could go home , because there was n't a whole lot else to do . "
But " now we 're so spoiled , with a few clicks of the mouse , we can zoom out ' til the whole galaxy is just a little dot , and other dots are not stars but other galaxies . "
Tegmark illustrates not just our planet 's place in space , but the layout of the entire known cosmos as well , relying in particular on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , and NASA satellite maps , which help animate 3D renderings of the universe over time .
Scientists are closing in on a " consistent picture of how the universe evolved from the earliest moment to the present , " expanding , cooling and clumping over its 14 - billion - year history .
Tegmark pays tribute to MIT colleague Alan Guth , whose inflation theory predicts not just a really big universe , but an infinite one , with parallel universes .
As fantastic a concept as this appears , Tegmark says , " I feel inflation is testable . "
Scientists can increasingly take the measure of a vast cosmos , with real numbers .

Einstein's Cosmic Speed Limit
Video description :
In its first year of operations , NASA 's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has mapped the entire sky with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in gamma-rays , the highest - energy form of light .
On May 10 , 2009 a pair of gamma-ray photons reached Fermi only 900 milliseconds apart after traveling for 7 billion years .
Fermi's measurement gives us rare experimental evidence that space - time is smooth as Einstein predicted , and has shut the door on several approaches to gravity where space - time is foamy enough to interfere strongly with light .

A New Age of Exploration : From Earth to Mars
Lecture description :
Studies of astronauts in flight , training on Earth , and on long engagements at the International Space Station , reveal " significant physiological deconditioning , " Newman says .
Microgravity produces musculo - skeletal loss , especially in the vertebrae and leg bones , as bipeds become " more like snakes , using a swimming type of motion . "
Muscles also atrophy from 20 - 30 % .
It 's possible some of this loss could be restored once on the moon ( where people are 1/6th their weight ) , or on Mars ( 3/8th their Earth weight ) .
But Newman wants to do something about these conditions before humans reach these destinations .
She 's working on such countermeasures as unique spaceflight exercises , special drugs , human augmentation , next - generation spacesuits , and creating artificial gravity .
She shows a nifty , pedal - powered artificial gravity device on which an astronaut spins , to combat deleterious physiological effects .
Newman says it takes the brain around 30 days to adapt to zero gravity , and to switch back to Earth gravity .
Our astronauts do n't get the hang of being home right away .
Says Newman , " The funny thing is when a crew comes back , and they let go of their toothbrush and it just falls down . "

A Trip to the Moon
Lecture description :
There are just 12 people who have walked on the moon .
Harrison Schmitt was one of them .
He was the only geologist in the astronaut corps and in March 1970 and became the first of the scientist - astronauts to receive a crew assignment as backup crew for Apollo 15 .
During the Apollo 17 flight , Schmitt probably took a photograph of the Earth called The Blue Marble , one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence .
After the completion of Apollo 17 , Schmitt played an active role in documenting the Apollo geologic results and also took on the task of organizing NASA 's Energy Program Office .
In August 1975 , Schmitt resigned from NASA to seek election as a Republican to the United States Senate representing New Mexico .
He served one term and , notably , was the ranking Republican member of the Science , Technology , and Space Subcommittee .
In this lecture Schmitt shares his own experiences of " a trip to the moon " and weaves in with this engaging and personal account a discussion of some of the policy challenges facing space exploration , now and into the future .
He looks back at his own personal explorations in space and describes what it feelslike to be in space .
As he puts it : " Being there is the essential human ingredient . "
The talk is followed by questions from the audience .
The Lessons of US - Russian Cooperation in Space

Formula 1 could be heading for more controversy surrounding double diffusers this season , amid predictions from leading teams that some of their rivals have pursued ' extreme ' solutions in the area of car design .
With the opening rounds of the 2009 championship overshadowed by protests and an FIA appeal court hearing about the legality of the twin floor concept , there had been hopes that the subsequent clarity of the rules would help the sport avoid a repeat this time out .
However , amid suggestions that teams have exploited the rules even further , there are now fears that there could even be more protests in the weeks ahead .
McLaren engineering director Paddy Lowe said at the launch of his team 's 2010 challenger on Friday that his team had pushed the diffuser regulations as far as it felt was possible .
" This is the first car in which we have had a clean sheet of paper to really exploit the interpretation [ of diffusers ] that was developed last year for a design of floors , " said Lowe .
" You will see we have produced a fairly extreme incarnation of that but we wo n't be alone in that .
We believe you will see some pretty extreme solutions on our competitors ' cars as well . "
The potential for these extreme solutions has led to Ferrari voicing fears that not every team is operating within the interpretation of the regulations that it feels is in place .
" We were and still are convinced that the double diffuser concept was illegal , " Ferrari technical director Aldo Costa told Gazzetta dello Sport .
" We feel there may still be interpretation over this , as the rules leave the door open to many possibilities .
It 's up to the FIA to supervise , but we are rather worried . "
Piero Ferrari added : " I expect a Ferrari worthy of the title , unless someone interprets the rules differently . "
Lowe is more confident , however , that the rules are clear enough - and that the matter will not require intervention from the FIA .
" We think the interpretation is very clear , " he said .
" In certain aspects we have sought guidance from the FIA and they have come out with very clear interpretation , understanding and guidance - and we think that has been made available to all the teams .
" We are hoping for a much cleaner start to the season then we had a year ago in terms of the teams ' collective understanding of the basis from which we go racing . "
No railway journey in the world could present more astonishing contrasts than that which takes the traveller across the South American continent from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso .
For hundreds of miles over the rolling pampas of Argentina not a single hill is to be seen — nothing but waving grain and luxuriant pasture as far as the eye can reach .
So little difficulty has railway building given to the engineers that for 175 miles — from Vedia to Mackenna — the rails of the Buenos Aires and Pacific main line run dead straight and practically dead level .
Gradually , however , the line is rising , although at Mackenna , 236 miles out of the Argentine capital , the level attained is only 774 ft. above the sea .
The great plain , green and brown in colour , stretches away to the horizon .
Clusters of trees round the estancias , or farms , and herds of cattle , driven by swarthy gauchos , are the only relief to the monotony of the scenery .
Cattle - raising and wheat - growing are the preoccupations of the estancieros .
The rise of the line begins slowly to grow more perceptible , but as yet giving no hint as to what lies ahead .
On reaching Villa Mercedes , 428 miles from the capital , the train has risen to 1,683 ft. above the sea .
In the province of San Luis , immediately beyond , hills begin to appear .
But not until we are approaching Mendoza do we notice that far off to the west there is rising , as it seems , sheer out of the plain the vast mountain barrier that runs the whole length of the South American continent , the great chain of the Andes .
Well may so immense an obstacle as this have held up the railway builders who desired to link up the railway systems of Argentina and Chile .
For many years there had existed a rough trail , following the bends of the Mendoza River through winding valleys and rocky gorges , fording turbulent glacier - fed streams , over the wind - swept pass of Cumbre , and down the gorge of the Aconcagua River , along the brink of dizzy precipices , under overhanging cliffs , zigzagging sharply downwards , until at length the Pacific coast was readied .
This trail led over a summit of more than thirteen thousand feet above the sea .
How could a railway ever hope to achieve the same feat ?
But better communication became imperative .
The fertile country round Mendoza — one huge vineyard which annually makes four million barrels of wine — needed an outlet to the Pacific coast , but little over 200 miles away , as compared with 650 miles to the Atlantic .
The track over the Andes was improved , and post services were organized which by the " eighties " had brought Mendoza within four days of Valparaiso .
But they were still four days of hard travel , part of the way in coaches , and the remainder , over the 13,000 ft. summit , on mule - back , with primitive and inadequate rest - houses at the end of each stage where the nights had to be spent .
THE INTERNATIONAL TRAIN leaving Antofagasta .
The Antofagasta ( Chile ) and Bolivia railway system links the Chilian port of Antofagasta with Western Bolivia , the Argentine , and with Peru .
As far back as 1854 railway communication had been proposed by a man named Wheelwright , who had been responsible for building the first railway in South America , between the towns of Caldera and Copiapo , in Chile .
But he was regarded as a visionary , and no interest was taken in his idea .
In 1869 the brothers Clark , who had conducted a survey for an international telegraph line between Argentina and Chile , also became convinced that their route by way of Juncal and Uspallata could be made to serve railway purposes .
So they decided , in 1872 , to submit a scheme to the two Governments , and were successful .
Argentina granted the necessary concession in 1873 and Chile in 1874 .
Owing to financial difficulties — construction through such country was bound to be extremely costly — it was a long time before work began .
Not until 1887 did the engineers get to work on the Argentine side , and two years later on the Chilian ; the first seventeen miles on the Chilian side were opened for traffic in 1893 .
Then followed a complete suspension of work .
The total length of line to be built , to connect the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway at Mendoza with the Chilian State Railways at Los Andes , was 154 miles .
At last , in 1896 , a new company was formed in London , called the Transandine Construction Company , and a concession was obtained from the Chilian Government to purchase the section of line already built , and to carry the remainder through to completion .
The railhead advanced rapidly ; the section from Los Andes up to Juncal was opened for traffic in 1906 , the next stretch up to Portillo in 1908 .
A tunnel was bored through the crest of the Cumbre ridge , 2,600 ft. below the pass , but 10,450 ft. above sea level and just under two miles long .
Then the Chilian and Argentine sections were linked , and the Transandine Railway , a triumph of railway engineering , was opened throughout its length .
It is not so much the height attained on the journey that makes the Transandine Railway remarkable ; ten thousand feet up is remarkable enough , but , further to the north , in Peru and Bolivia , railways pursue their lengthy courses at well above that figure , and at least five railway summits exceed the 15,000 ft. mark .
The outstanding feature of the engineering of the Transandine line is the extreme rapidity with which the summit level is attained .
FOR MOUNTAIN SERVICE .
This British - built tank locomotive operates on the Antofagasta ( Chile ) and Bolivia Railway .
It was built for oil fuel , working with a capacity of 1,478 gallons of fuel .
The coupled wheels are 3 ft. 8 in. diameter , the diameter of the cylinders is 19 in . , and the stroke is 24 in .
The working pressure is 180 lb. per sq. in .
At Mendoza it is necessary to change trains .
The Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway has brought us across Argentina in the spacious rolling - stock possible on the wide Argentine gauge of 5 ft. 6 in .
For the transit of the Andes the gauge has been reduced to three - fifths of that figure — a gauge of one metre .
Notwithstanding this limitation , and the arduous grades to be surmounted , the Transandine Railway authorities provide a wonderfully comfortable deluxe train of six coaches — three of them saloon cars with long observation windows , and furnished with armchairs , a restaurant car , a kitchen car , and a baggage car .
A powerful tank locomotive is at the head of the train .
It is equipped for rack - and - pinion working , as well as ordinary propulsion by adhesion — a sign of the severity of the inclinations over which the train is to pass before the summit level has been surmounted .
Leaving Mendoza , the train makes directly for the foothills of the Andes , and passes for twelve miles through the fertile Mendoza valley .
This fertility seems strange at first , because the country on this side of the Andes is practically rainless .
But the melted waters of glaciers come pouring down the Mendoza river , and careful irrigation on an extensive scale is responsible for this verdure .
This garden at the foot of the Andes is itself 2,470 ft. above sea-level .
The leaves and fruit of the vineyards are a delight to the eye which will be remembered when the train has climbed to the barren heights .
Directly the railway finds the gorge in the mountain wall by which it is to penetrate deep into the heart of the range , the verdure is left behind .
Little except bare rock will be seen for many miles , save where it is overlaid , at the higher altitudes , with snow and ice , and the occasional appearance of scrub and stunted trees on the lower mountain slopes .
Yet the scenery is one of constantly increasing magnificence , in which distance and the dignity of the great peaks play their part equally .
At Cacheuta , twenty - three miles from Mendoza , the line has already climbed 1,600 ft .
Here are thermal and sulphur springs , and a fine hotel which , in common with the railway , suffered from some most unwelcome attentions by Nature in the early part of 1934 .
High up in an inaccessible and almost unknown valley of the Andes — the facts were verified by a reconnaissance from the air afterwards — a great glacier burst , and made a huge dam across the valley , behind which there accumulated an immense lake .
At length the pressure of the water on the wall of ice became greater than this natural dam could hold back .
Bursting , it let loose a terrific wall of water which rushed into the gorge of the Mendoza river , where the torrent carried all before it .
THE RAILWAYS OF SOUTH AMERICA , which have conquered the barrier of the Andes , are shown on this map .
Miles of the railway were wiped out .
Massive steel bridges were wrenched from their bed - plates and carried away like corks , in some cases to be deposited a mile or more from their original locations .
The hotel and baths of Cacheuta were similarly overwhelmed .
Months elapsed before the railway could once again carry the trains ; over certain sections complete reconstruction was necessary .
There are times , too , when earthquake and fire as well as flood trouble the railway in this part of the world .
Active volcanoes are found in the main chain of the Andes not far away from the route ; and the liability to disastrous earthquakes down the whole length of the narrow strip of country between the Andes and the Pacific coast is well known .
The journey arouses all the sensations associated with the conquering of an untamed world .
Upwards and onwards the train travels , crossing and re-crossing the Mendoza so as to negotiate the turns and twists of the valley among the mountains .
Thirty - three miles from Cacheuta we come out into the broad plain of Uspallata , set in the heart of the mountains 5,630 ft. above the sea .
To the west rises the mountain barrier , ever increasing in height , snow - capped and cloud - wreathed .
Nature 's disintegrating work is seen in the vast slopes of detritus at the foot of every mountain slope ; there is no vegetation to affect this constant process of erosion , or to cover up its results .
Still the railway climbs steadily .
The maximum gradient on the adhesion section is limited to 1 in 40 , but that is quite steep enough for our panting locomotive .
The line twists and turns , arduously , cautiously .
Suddenly there appears ahead a rock - strewn ridge , apparently barring the way ; but the engineers have found a path .
Crossing the abyss , high above the rushing waters of the river , and utilizing a ledge blasted out on the side of the gorge , they have laid their track under the very nose of the obstacle .
The ledge widens and the climb to Las Vacas has been achieved .
At length the greatest giants of the Andes come into view .
It is from Las Vacas , up a lateral valley , that we catch sight of Tupungato , rearing its snowy head to a height of 21,550 ft. ; and just beyond Puente del Inca there comes into view the greatest of all the mountains in the Western Hemisphere , Aconcagua , whose proud summit , 23,080 ft. above the level of the sea , falls short of Everest by only a little over six thousand feet .
At Puente del Inca Nature also has some engineering work of note to display .
This is the bridge , or puente , from which the railway station takes its name .
A natural and not an artificial wonder , this arch of stone clears the gorge of the Cuevas with a span of 70 ft. and a width of 90 ft. , 65 ft. in height above the water .
The level of the railway , at exactly one hundred miles from Mendoza , has now risen to 8,915 ft. above the sea .
Steeper climbing lies ahead , and the steel track now appears intermittently between the ordinary running rails , for the making of the steeper ascents .
Leaving Puente del Inca , the train mounts the Paramillo de los Horcones , the Paramillo itself being the moraine of an immense glacier that existed in prehistoric times .
Swinging across the Horcones river by a fine steel bridge , the track enters the narrow gorge of the Cuevas , where rack - and - pinion working is more continuous .
At its steepest the gradient increases to 1 in 16 .
So we are brought up to Las Cuevas , 108 miles from Mendoza , and 10,338 ft. in altitude .
The arduous labours of the locomotive are at an end .
In this distance of just over a hundred miles it has lifted our train through a difference in level of just under 8,000 ft.
AMONG THE SNOW - CAPPED PEAKS of the Andes the track of the Central Railway of Peru attains the amazing height of 15,806 ft. above sea-level on the branch line between Ticlio and Morococha , a stretch of which is seen here .
The mountains now close in ahead of the line , higher than ever .
Steeply up from Las Cuevas rises the old post track , now a motor road , finding the lowest possible level for crossing the crest of the ridge at the Cumbre Pass , 12,796 ft. above the sea .
Here is found the boundary between Argentina and Chile , with the great bronze figure of Christ and below it the inscription :
" Sooner shall these mountains crumble into dust than the people of Argentina and Chile break the peace which they have sworn to maintain at the feet of Christ the Redeemer . "
But the railway traveller sees nothing of this unique boundary post , except a distant peep , right on the skyline , from the western end of the tunnel .
For his train is thousands of feet below , in the heart of the rock , being carried through from one watershed to the other by the Cumbre Tunnel , which is but 90 yards short of two miles long .
The crossing of the frontier is , however , made audible by the clanging of the bell which the train passes in the middle of the tunnel
It was Koebel , in his book , " Modern Argentina , " who was so impressed with the wonder of this journey that he wrote , on reaching the summit level , " All this while — shades of the Conquistadores !— one has watched this stupendous scene , the greater part of which has never known the foot of man , from the depths of an easy chair !
One has gazed on the tormented river , over five or six courses of a meal , and has peered downwards into the yawning gorges through the comfortable vapour of coffee steam and cigar smoke . "
We emerge from the tunnel on the Chilian side at Caracoles Ahead of us the valley drops profoundly , and we see wide sweeps of the line far below , over which presently we shall be travelling .
The greatest difficulties were experienced in the engineering of the next section of the line westwards , owing to the fact that the Pacific slope of the Andes is so much steeper than the eastern slope .
In no more than forty - four miles , from Caracoles to Los Andes , the line must descend 7,615 ft. , down the gorge of the Aconcagua river .
Between Caracoles and Portillo is some of the grandest rock scenery in the world , and on this side of the Andes diversified by vegetation , growing more and more luxuriant as we descend .
The railway line curves and twists on itself , by means of some remarkable spiral location work .
Rack - and - pinion is freely used , and at as steep an inclination as 1 in 12 - 1/2 , one stretch of which is nearly a mile in length ; 1 in 40 is again the ruling gradient , but in much longer continuous sections ; while the tunnels on the Chilian side add up to a total length of 4,600 metres , which is nearly twice the length of tunnelling on the Argentinian side .
In 1922 , to provide better protection against avalanches , many massive masonry shelters were put in hand , and these have added 3.000 metres to the total amount of tunnelling on the line .
THE HIGHEST STATION IN THE WORLD on a standard gauge railway is at Ticlio , 15,610 ft. above sea-level , in Peru , on the Pacific side of the Andes .
On the approach line to Ticlio eight tunnels were necessary in a stretch of less than two miles .
To speed up the working over these steep inclinations between Caracoles and Los Andes , steam has now given place to electricity A powerful articulated electric locomotive of the 1 - C - C - 1 type — with two groups of six - coupled driving wheels , and a pair of carrying wheels at each of the two outer ends — takes charge of the train .
Considering the steepness of the descent the travelling is remarkably fast , as with a train of 150 tons weight the electric locomotives , using the rack , are able ever to mount the 1 in 12 - 1/ 2 gradient at 9 - 1/2 miles an hour .
The six coaches of our luxury train from Mendoza to Los Andes fall comfortably within the 150 - ton limit .
On the rack section the electric locomotives exert a tractive effort of 22,500 kilogrammes and on the adhesion sections a maximum of 10,500 kilogrammes .
Current is supplied from large hydro-electric plants near Santiago , and is at a pressure of 44,000 volts , 3 - phase , 50 cycles .
Just before Portillo the train skirts the Inca Lake , set among the mountains at a level of over 9,000 ft. — a mysterious sheet of water the contents of which never increase nor decrease in quantity .
The valley below Portillo is framed with mountains of almost indescribable beauty and majesty , rising sheer from the floor of the valley to the sky , one behind the other , from fertility at the lower levels to snow - draped summits of vast height .
And so , ever downwards , we travel through Juncal and across the extraordinary chasm of the Aconcagua River at Salto del Soldado — the " Soldier 's Leap " — until Los Andes is reached .
Here the narrow - gauge journey is at an end , and we change into one of the trains of the Chilian State Railways , on a gauge of 5 ft. 6 in. , like that of Argentina .
Our metre - gauge train , which started its journey at Mendoza , 2,518 ft. above sea-level , has carried us up to a maximum height of 10,452 ft. in the Cumbre Tunnel , and has then dropped us to 2,669 ft. at Los Andes .
From Los
Andes the journey is swiftly made down to Valparaiso , no more than eighty - two miles distant ; electric haulage is again provided .
Our first introduction to the Pacific is at the popular seaside resort of Vina del Mar — the Brighton of Valparaiso — and a few miles farther the city of Valparaiso is reached .
The total length of the journey , from Buenos Aires has been 888 miles ; it has occupied a day and a night as far as Mendoza , and another whole day for the 238 miles threading the Andes from Mendoza to Valparaiso .
ZIGZAGGING TO GAIN HEIGHT , the Central Railway of Peru winds its way through the Rimac Gorge on the Callao - Oroya route .
Passenger trains on this line are run three times a week .
By changing at Llai - Llai , we may turn southwards for Santiago .
Santiago and Llai - Llai are both stations on the remarkable longitudinal main line of the Chilian State Railways , which , starting at Puerto Montt in the south , travels the whole length of this curiously shaped country , on the slope between the Andes and the Pacific , for a distance of no less than 2,750 miles , to Pintados in the north .
Between Puerto Montt and Calera , the junction for Valparaiso , the gauge of 5 ft. 6 in . is in use , but north of that point the gauge contracts to one metre .
No country , with the possible exception of Norway , could have so strange a configuration as Chile , nearly 3,000 miles long , yet nowhere wider than 180 miles , and in places dwindling to a width of sixty miles only — and full of railway problems .
As we travel northwards through Chile , the character of the country changes .
In the south there is much forest land ; in the centre , assisted by irrigation , the land is largely arable ; in the north it becomes a desert region .
But it is in the arid north that the wealth of Chile largely lies .
For it is here that there are the great nitrate deposits , and high up in the Andes other minerals , copper and silver in particular , exist in immense quantities .
It is in search of these minerals that railways have been laid on " the roof of the world . "
Travelling north by the longitudinal trunk of the Chilian State Railways , we intersect , at Baquedano , the first of a series of railways which start at sea level on the Pacific coast , two in Chile and two more in Peru , climb , in a couple of hundred miles or less , to heights of 13,000 ft. and more , and drop down into lofty valleys in the heart of the great chain of the Andes .
In two instances a lake is reached on which there plies a railway steamer service , over a route 120 miles in length , the whole of which is 12,500 feet above the sea .
LAUNCHING A SHIP ON TOP OF THE ANDES .
The railway company operates a steamer service across Lake Titicaca .
The photograph shows the launch of the " Inca . "
This ship was built in Hull , sailed to South America , and was then transported in parts to be reassembled on the lake .
The railway thus intersected at Baquedano is the Antofagasta ( Chile ) and Bolivia Railway .
It is in a veritable desert that the two lines meet
This is the centre of the great nitrate country , where no rain falls .
and not a blade of grass is to be seen for many miles ; all the water has to be brought from long distances , and the only signs of life are at the colonies which surround the nitrate factories .
It was in 1873 that the first stretch of line was begun from Antofagasta inland , to bring nitrate down to the coast for shipment .
To - day the Antofagasta Railway controls 1,821 miles of line , including a main trunk line through the heart of the Andes to La Paz , the capital of Bolivia , 729 miles away .
The international trains over this route , connecting Peru with Bolivia , and also with the Argentine by the recently constructed route down from Uyuni to La Quiaca , where connexion is made with the North Central section of the Argentine State Railways , include restaurant and sleeping cars and every modern luxury .
AFTER THE LAUNCH , The " Inca " on Lake Titicaca , 12,500 ft. above sea-level .
The steamer 's Journey across the lake to connect up the railway is one hundred and twenty miles long .
When the track of the Antofagasta Railway first began to find its way up into the mountains , it was on the extremely narrow gauge of 2 ft. 6 in. , on which , nevertheless , the locomotives and rolling stock were developed to a size which astonished all those who travelled over the line .
As the Antofagasta authorities gradually assumed control over the railways in the highlands of Bolivia which were all of metre gauge , as well as of the northern end of the metre - gauge Chilian longitudinal railway , the difference in gauge proved so troublesome that eventually the decision was reached to widen all the 2 ft. 6 in. gauge lines to metre gauge .
This herculean task required immense preparations , for it was not possible to stop the traffic while conversion took place .
In the company 's workshops at Mejillones 61 locomotives , 103 coaches and 2,140 wagons had to be reconstructed for the wider track — in itself a costly job .
Mixed gauge had already been laid over certain sections , that is , both 2 ft. 6 in . and metre ; and the final operation , for which the main line was closed for six days in July , 1928 , was that of converting the gauge over 180 miles of line , which , despite the waterless and chiefly uninhabited country , mostly at between 10,000 and 13,000 ft. altitude , was successfully accomplished in this amazingly short time .
REMARKABLE ENGINEERING
FEATS were accomplished when bridges were wedged between cliffs so that the Transandine Railway could be carried over mountain torrents .
This picture shows the bridge at the " Soldier 's Leap , " almost dwarfed by the cliffs .
Some of the steepest climbing , partly at 1 in 30 , is immediately after the start from Antofagasta .
In the first eighteen miles the line has already climbed 1,820 ft. ; on reaching the junction at Baquedano , fifty miles in , it is 3,380 ft. up .
For nearly a hundred miles farther the arid nitrate lands are traversed , at steadily increasing altitudes , till the town of Calama is reached , 149 miles from Antofagasta .
From the nitrate region we now pass to that of copper .
The Antofagasta Railway has handled up to a million tons of the former commodity in a single year ; up a short branch just beyond Calama are the mines and smelting plant of the Anaconda Copper Company , which can deal with some 40,000 tons of ore and produce 600 tons of pure copper in a day .
At San Pedro , 197 miles from the start , are the great reservoirs , blasted out of solid rock , of the waterworks which supplies the city of Antofagasta , the nitrate fields , and all the railway stations up the line in this waterless country .
Nearly £ 2,000,000 was spent by the railway on this project alone , and including the pipe lines from the mountains to the reservoirs , the water travels 235 miles in all from the source to Antofagasta .
ANOTHER ENGINEERING TRIUMPH .
The Challape Bridge , near Matucana , on the Callao - Oroya route .
The bridge , built in 1909 , has ten spans and a total length of 356 ft .
We have now turned the 10,000 ft. level , and presently the railway cuts through a lava bed over a quarter of a mile wide — a reminder that the two great mountains St. Pedro and St. Pablo , here skirted by the line , are both volcanoes , one of them partly active .
Still climbing , we reach the summit level of the Chilian section of the line at Ascotan , 12,976 ft. above the sea , attained without any help from rack and pinion or other similar devices .
The sharpest curves are of about 400 ft. radius , A little farther on , the railway skirts a lake , twenty - four miles long , winding at the same time round the lower slopes of snow - capped mountains the flanks of which are brilliant with all kinds of metallic hues — a weird scene indeed .
But most astonishing of all , perhaps , is that after the line has ascended to the 12,000 - ft. level , near Ascotan , it never drops below this altitude for more than five hundred miles !
From Ollague , 274 miles from Antofagasta , a branch is thrown off in a westerly direction to reach the rich copper mines at Collahuassi .
Near Montt it reaches an altitude of 15,817 ft.— practically equal in level to the top of Mont Blanc , and the highest railway summit in the world .
This is the only branch of the Antofagasta line on which snow gives any serious difficulties .
For we are now so near to the Equator that even at 15,000 ft.
the line is free from snow over a great part of the year .
Proceeding from Ollague we cross into Bolivia and reach the important junction of Uyuni , where the line from Argentina , previously referred to , comes in from the south - east .
As far as Atocha it belongs to the Bolivian Government .
AT HIGH ALTITUDES the railway is exposed to the ravages of the cyclone .
This illustration shows the effect of a storm on a signal standard on the Transandine Railway .
At Rio Mulato , 448 miles from Antofagasta , a branch is thrown off to the ancient city of Potosi — another line of airy aspirations .
At Condor the altitude is 15,705 ft .
In this broken , wind - swept , and often snow - covered area of Bolivia , construction was very difficult , but the 108 miles of line between Rio Mulato and Potosi were successfully built , and the line has since been extended for 175 miles to Sucre , the political capital of the country .
The Bolivian section of the Antofagasta line now passes through many tin-mining settlements , by way of the town of Oruro to Viacha , which has humorously been called the " Crewe " of Bolivia , although little more than a train - shed in wild and open country .
For it is the meeting - place between several railways .
From the Pacific coast there has climbed the Arica - La Paz Railway , over a summit 13,963 ft. high at Jeneral Lagos , and there is also the railway from Guaqui , on Lake Titicaca , to La Paz .
The city of La Paz , 12,143 ft. above the sea , the virtual capital of Bolivia , has a dramatic rail approach .
Continuing the journey , we leave La Paz by the 60 - miles line to Guaqui , which forms part of the system of railways operated by the Peruvian Corporation .
This has to employ electric power in order to climb out of the depths of the valley , and does so by adhesion on the extraordinarily steep gradient of 1 in 16 .
By this means the railway climbs 1,500 ft. in six miles , with numerous S - curves , to El Alto , overlooking the whole of the La Paz valley , and with a magnificent view .
A SEVERE LANDSLIDE , which caused the Purhuay river to change its course in 1925 and flood the lines of the railway in Central Peru , caused a prolonged stoppage of traffic .
Sixty miles from La Paz we find ourselves on the shores of an inland sea .
It seems almost incredible that a body of water of such enormous size can exist at a height of 12,500 ft. , but here lies Lake Titicaca , perfectly real , and easily the largest sheet of navigable fresh water in existence at such an altitude .
The railway - owned steamer lying alongside the quay at Guaqui sets out on a twelve - hour voyage , 120 miles in length !
There are three of these vessels at work , covering an itinerary of some 1,350 miles ; the biggest of them , the " Inca , " driven by twin - screws and triple - expansion steam engines , is a capacious 700 - ton craft , 228 ft. long and 30 ft. in the beam .
How she sailed from Hull , where she was built in 1905 , to the top of the Andes might well mystify the landsman .
In fact , she was carried piecemeal over the railway , and reassembled on the lake .
This is surely the most phenomenal voyage that the world has to offer .
Leaving the steamer at Puno , we find ourselves on one of the two trunk lines that Peru sends up from her Pacific coastline into the Andes .
Both are on the standard 4 ft. 8 - 1/2 in. gauge , which makes their engineering through the mountains all the more remarkable .
The line running for 326 miles up from Mollendo , on the coast , to Puno , is the Peruvian Southern .
First of all it climbs 107 miles to the important and beautiful city of Arequipa , where it has attained 7,500 ft.
A DOUBLE - HEADED FREIGHT TRAIN crossing the slender Challape Bridge .
This illustration gives a vivid impression of the barrenness of the mountain country traversed by the Peruvian Central Railway .
Arequipa lies at the foot of three snow - capped giants of the Andes , Chachani , Misti , and Pichu - Pichu , all between 20,000 and 18,150 ft. high ; circling their western flanks , the railway makes its way through the heart of the western Cordillera , finding its summit level at Crucero Alto , 14,666 ft. up .
From here falling grades , for the most part , ensue to Juliaca , 30 miles from Puno , where an important branch diverges to the north - west .
It leads for 210 miles to Cuzco , the Inca capital of historic memories .
Crossing the eastern Cordillera of the Andes at La Raya , 14,153 ft. above the sea , this railway descends into the great watershed of the Amazon , and finishes at the comparatively modest altitude of 11,000 ft .
But the most remarkable of all the railways in the Andes is the one the description of which has been reserved until last .
It is the Peruvian Central , which starts its course at Callao , on the Pacific coast , and in no more than 172 miles has climbed to the astonishing altitude of 15,604 ft. at the Galera Tunnel .
Of this ascent , 12,873 ft. are crowded into the 118 miles from Chosica to the summit , which works out at an unbroken average of 1 in 48 - 1/ 2 .
So rapid is the rise that it is necessary for the railway company to carry cylinders of oxygen in the trains , for the relief of passengers who may suffer from mountain sickness .
The steepest of the gradients on the Peruvian Central reach the very considerable inclination of 1 in 25 , often for long distances together .
Even then the only possible way of getting up the precipitous valleys on this side of the Andes is by means of zigzagging to and fro on the mountain - sides , with a succession of reversing stations at the elbow of each zigzag .
Up these zigzags the engine alternately pushes and pulls its load , till the summits are reached .
There are altogether twenty - one zigzags on the line .
Of bridges thrown across lateral gorges there are some amazing examples .
Of these the most outstanding is Verrugas , which has a height of 252 ft. above the chasm that it spans , and is 575 ft. long .
It is of a double cantilever type , supported on two trestle towers of steel , and replaced a previous structure that was washed away after a cloudburst .
Ten miles farther up the line is the great Challape steel viaduct , also carried on spidery steel trestles .
Longer still is Chaupichaca Viaduct , of a similar type , but 426 ft. long , and including two very large lattice girder spans .
At last the train reaches Ticlio , which , at an altitude of 15,610 ft. , is the highest station on any standard gauge railway in the world .
Shortly afterwards it passes into Galera Tunnel , the highest point in which is 15,694 ft. above sea level .
The tunnel is 3,860 ft. long .
From Ticlio the Marococha loop travels even higher , reaching at La Cima the record altitude for the standard gauge of 15,806 ft .
This is the second highest railway summit in any part of the world .

« Qu’est - ce qu’être français ? »
Vous avez deux mois et demi .
Le ministre de l’Immigration , Eric Besson , invité dimanche du Grand Jury RTL / Le Figaro / LCI , a proposé aux associatifs et politiques de plancher sur le sujet , en annonçant la tenue d’un « grand débat sur les valeurs de l’identité nationale » .
Soit une série de réunions dans les préfectures et sous - préfectures , animées par « le corps préfectoral et les parlementaires » , auxquelles prendront part les « forces vives de la nation » , et qui commenceront le 2 novembre , précise ce lundi le ministère .
Par « forces vives » , le ministre entend les « mouvements associatifs , enseignants , élèves et parents d’élèves de l’enseignement primaire , secondaire et supérieur , organisations syndicales , représentants des chefs d’entreprises , élus locaux , représentants des anciens combattants et des associations patriotiques » .
Ce débat « devra permettre de valoriser l’apport de l’immigration à l’identité nationale , et de proposer des actions permettant de mieux faire partager les valeurs de l’identité nationale à chaque étape du parcours d’intégration » , annonce le ministre .
« Instruction citoyenne » et « Marseillaise »
Sans attendre , Eric Besson a égréné quelques mesures qu’il entend pousser .
« Je pense par exemple qu’il serait bon [...] que tous les jeunes Français aient une fois dans l’année l’occasion de chanter la Marseillaise » , a - t - il cité .
Ou encore des séances de formation pour l’instruction civique pour les adultes volontaires .
Une expérimentation sur ce type d’« instruction citoyenne » doit être lancée dans le Rhône et les Bouches - du - Rhône début 2010 .
La discussion devrait se conclure par « un grand colloque de synthèse » « avant le 28 février 2010 » , soit un gros mois avant les élections régionales ...
L’occasion de remettre en avant ce marqueur fort à droite qui avait largement servi Nicolas Sarkozy durant la campagne présidentielle de 2007 , lui permettant notamment d’empiéter sur les platebandes du FN .
Et ce alors que l’électorat traditionnel de droite a pu être franchement déboussolé , ces dernières semaines , par un certain nombre de polémiques ( Frédéric Mitterrand , Jean Sarkozy ) .
Même du côté associatif , le calendrier pose question .
« Un débat sur l'Identité nationale me semble utile mais on ne peut que s'étonner du moment choisi , juste avant les régionales » , juge ainsi Pierre Henry , le directeur général de France terre d'asile , interrogé par Libération .fr .
« La mise en scène de ce sujet , à un moment où la majorité ressort le marqueur identité nationale - immigration - sécurité , pose problème . »
« Vieille soupe nationaliste » pour l'opposition
Mais c'est surtout la gauche qui insiste sur les arrière - pensées électorales du gouvernement .
Secrétaire national du PS , Jean - Christophe Cambadélis dénonce une « grosse ficelle » à l’approche des régionales .
« Empêtré dans une gestion calamiteuse de l’immigration , confronté aux déficits publics , bousculé par les sondages , les licenciements , la vie chère , Monsieur Besson se propose de faire un colloque sur l’identité nationale » , résume le député de Paris dans un communiqué , regrettant que le ministre «et le gouvernement prennent les Français pour des gogos » .
Les Verts raillent aussi une « vieille soupe nationaliste » , appelant « médias et citoyens à ne pas tomber dans ce piège et à ne pas prêter attention à cette mise en scène aux relents nauséabonds et vains » .
« Comme à chaque veille d’élection depuis 2001 , le gouvernement ressort l’épouvantail de l’immigration » , blâme la porte - parole , Djamila Sonzogni .
Au - delà de « la recette électorale » mijotée par la droite , François Bayrou accuse le ministre de s’emparer d’une notion , l’identité nationale , qui « n ’ aux politiques » .
« Rien n’est pire que d’en faire un sujet d’affontement politique surtout quand , par ailleurs , on laisse abîmer l’image de la France .
Et , encore pire , dans faire une utilisation partisane » , condamne le président du Modem , ajoutant que « la nation appartient à tout le monde » .
Pierre Laurent , numéro deux du PCF , fustige un « retour du pétainisme le plus nauséabond » : « pour masquer l’échec de sa politique , Nicolas Sarkozy a décidé de faire une nouvelle fois monter en ligne son petit ministre des sales besognes pour redéfinir “ ce que c’est qu’être Français ? ” »
La droite cite Trenet
« Ce n’est pas le retour d’un débat sur l’identité nationale qui devrait surprendre , mais plutôt l’effacement progressif de cette identité » , rétorque Frédéric Lefebvre .
Le porte - parole de l'UMP va jusqu'à convoquer Charles Trenet : « La défense de notre modèle culturel et de la “ Douce France ” » passent « par la redéfinition de notre identité nationale . »
Ce débat « arrive avant les régionales , ok .
On aurait attendu les régionales , ce serait arrivé avant les cantonales , puis les sénatoriales , puis les présidentielles , les législatives » , justifie pour sa part Dominique Paillé , porte - parole adjoint .
Rapporteur de la mission parlementaire sur la burqa – dont Eric Besson a dit , dimanche , qu’elle était justement « contraire aux valeurs de l’identité nationale » – Eric Raoult ( UMP ) soutient aussi l ’idée d’un débat sur l’identité nationale .
Le député de Seine - Saint - Denis y voit « une bonne nouvelle pour notre pays » , arguant que « l ’identité nationale n’est pas un tabou » .
Les historiens divisés
Accusant le ministre de concevoir la question par le plus petit bout de la lorgnette , l’historien Patrick Weil juge « insupportable » sa « volonté d’encadrer quelque chose qui a toujours été très divers et fluide » .
Une définiton impossible ?
« Etre français , c’est se rattacher à des traditions extrêmement différentes » , explique - t - il à l’AFP .
« On peut se sentir Français en relation avec Jeanne d’Arc , Louis XIV , Danton ou Robespierre , de Gaulle ou Clemenceau .
Il n’y a pas une seule façon d’être Français . »
Est-ce à Besson de trancher ?
Certainement pas , argue encore le directeur de recherche au CNRS , auteur de l’ouvrage Qu’est - ce - qu’un Français ?
Histoire de la nationalité française depuis la Révolution : « Ce n’est pas au pouvoir politique de décréter qu’est - ce que c’est qu’être Français . »
Max Gallo , qui s’était prononcé en faveur de l’élection de Sarkozy , nuance : « Il y a une identité nationale qui est ouverte , qui s’élargit , se modifie , se colorise mais il y a aussi des fondamentaux qui jouent dans la vie politique et qu’il est bon de rappeler » , a -t - il développé sur RTL , se disant « satisfait que la question cruciale de l’identité nationale soit posée » .
« Il faut écarter tout de suite l ’idée que l’on fait un clin d’oeil à l’extrême droite ainsi que celle que l’identité nationale est fixée une fois pour toute » , ajoute Gallo .
Pour l’historienne Esther Benbassa , « la question , telle qu’elle est posée par Eric Besson , semble désuète » , voire « racoleuse , vieux - jeu » .
Bref , à contre - temps de « toutes les évolutions actuelles et historiques » .
« Face à une mondialisation galopante , les identités sont multiples .
L’identité nationale , c’est un concept qui ne parle pas aux gens , sauf à ceux d’extrême - droite » , affirme Esther Benbassa à l'AFP , y voyant une tentative de « restaurer des idées galvaudées » .
Most ominously , independent voters  who embraced Mr. Obama ’s presidential campaign and are an increasingly critical constituency  seemed to have fled to Mr. Brown in Massachusetts , as they did to Republicans in races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey last November .
It is hard not to view that as a repudiation of the way Mr. Obama and Democratic Congressional leaders have run things .

“ This is a giant wake - up call , ” said Terry McAuliffe , the former Democratic National Committee chairman who lost a bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in Virginia last year .
“ We have to keep our focus on job creation .
Everything we have to do is related to job creation .
We have to do a much better job on the message .
People are confused on what this health care bill is going to do . ”
Even before the polls closed , the White House was suggesting the outlines of a recovery strategy , a combination of a more populist tone and an embrace of greater fiscal responsibility .
Mr. Obama has signaled that he intends to take a more populist stance on financial regulation legislation in Congress , seeking to position Democrats as defenders of the people against Wall Street , and to cast Republicans as defenders of bonus - laden bankers .
And on Tuesday night , the White House brokered a deal that could lead to a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts and tax increases to address the nation ’s fiscal condition .
For months , Mr. Obama ’s advisers had warned that the perception that budget deficits and the national debt were spiraling out of control was alienating independent voters already turned off by partisan battling .
David Axelrod , a senior adviser to Mr. Obama , said he did not view the results as a repudiation of the White House ’s agenda , but he acknowledged that the administration needed to do a more effective job of signaling concern about the problems gripping Americans .
“ We are the party in power , and as such there ’s an element of responsibility assigned , ” he said .
“ I think people need to know that their challenges and their concerns are the focus of our work every day . ”

Clipper City Heavy Seas Winter Storm Maryland , 7.5 % ABV
This seasonally available ESB delighted the hop - heads among us .
Very rich caramel malt is offset by a punch of orange - marmalade flavor — this beer reminded us a bit of Campari .

We loved the bitter brightness of this warming beer .
*****
Great Divide Hibernation Ale Colorado , 8.7 % ABV
This robust Old Ale tastes like toasted hazelnuts and coffee with cream .
It 's a little oaky and has hints of maple syrup and tobacco — it would be good with a cigar , if you 're into that , and it tastes great with spicy slices of salami .
****1/2
Anchor Brewing Our Special Ale California , 5.5 % ABV Each year Anchor brews a different version of this beer , and the 2009 version is quite tasty .
It 's dry with a sturdy hop backbone — we tasted a bit of juniper and a hint of fennel along with flavors that reminded us of gingerbread lattés and cinnamon rolls .
The finish is clean and it's quite drinkable — a sixpack would be a nice contribution to a holiday party .

****
Put a Few of These Under the Tree
Delirium Noel Belgium , 10 % ABV
This rich and thick Belgian Strong Dark
Ale tastes like apricots soaked in dark rum .
There 's very little bitterness , though it does have a hint of delicate rosemary flavor .
As we sipped this , we were reminded of black cherry pie and banana , along with toffee , dates , and brown sugar .
This is n't our favorite beer of this style — we'd rather have a Rochefort 8 — but it did remind us how fitting a Belgian dark ale is for the season , whether or not it comes in Christmas packaging .
***1/2
Brooklyn Winter Ale New York , 6.1 % ABV

This ruby - colored beer surprised some of us ; we loved its rich toffee flavor , hints of oatmeal , velvety poached pears , and nutmeg .

Serve with with mild creamy cheese .

***1/2
Deschutes Jubelale Oregon , 6.7 % ABV
This dark copper - colored ale is a hoppy winter warmer , with floral notes and hints of cloves , along with the occasional lemon zing .
It 's quite dry and earthy , but not heavy .
As it warms , this beer tastes like buttery caramel and roasted nuts .
This is not our favorite beer from Deschutes , but that says more about the high quality of the brewery 's other offerings than it says about this beer .
***
Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale Tadcaster , UK , 6 % ABV
This winter warmer is a bit crisper and brighter than many of the others , and some found it a little weak .

The flavors reminded us of unsweetened chocolate , toasted almonds , and blackberry jam .
***
Spiced Beers for Santa
Great Lakes Christmas Ale Ohio , 7.5 % ABV
Almost like a mulled beer , this spicy brew has nutty walnut flavors , hints of cloves , nutmeg , cinnamon , and a bit of molasses .
We tasted a little black pepper , ginger , and citrus zest , and enjoyed it with a slice of dry aged cheese .
This beer might work in a beer float with a little vanilla ice cream , if Santa has time to sit down for dessert .
This beer was the favorite of a few tasters who were really looking for something festive .
***1/2
Sebago Slick Nick Winter Ale Maine , 6.2 % ABV

***
Dark and Smoky
Magic Hat Howl Vermont , 4.6 % ABV
This black lager is crisp and dry , with hints of anise , cloves , and toasted chilies , but it 's a little too smoky to drink unaccompanied .

***
Sweetwater Festive Ale Georgia , 8.6 % ABV
This dark brown beer tastes of dates and bacony smoke , with dark roasted coffee flavors and even a hint of teriyaki .
It would probably go nicely with roasted meat and creamy cheese , but it 's not the kind of thing we 'd sip on its own .
**1/2
Skippable
Pike Auld Acquaintance Hoppy Holiday Ale Washington , 5 % ABV
This beer tastes like it has the whole fruitcake in it : cinnamon and candied cherries ( as well as those mysterious candied green fruits , ) a hint of watermelon , orange peel , and nutmeg .
The hops are pungent and bright , and you can taste the coriander that was in the brewing vessel .
The spices — and a bit of green pepper flavor — were a little heavy for some of our tasters , who felt that this beer was just a bit off balance .
**1/2
Saranac Maple Porter New York , 5.3 % ABV
The first taste of this is dry and coffee - like , but it opens up into a big maple candy flavor .
The tasted reminded us of Vanilla Coke and Bailey 's Irish Cream , and some were disturbed by the synthetic - seeming maple scent .
It might be good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . **
We 'd Rather Get a Lump of Coal
Full Moon Winter Ale Colorado , 5.6 % ABV Coors ( who makes Blue Moon ) should be ashamed of itself for calling this winter seasonal an abbey ale ; this sweet and watery brew is a bit like beer - flavored soda .
The flavors get a little muddy and metallic at the end , with none of the richness of a true Belgian dubbel . *

On October 29 , the Australian web site zik.com .ua reported that : " Western Ukraine was hit by a severe epidemic of unidentified influenza , tentatively diagnosed by doctors as viral pneumonia .
The number of dead has climbed dramatically .
Doctors advise Western Ukrainians to stay home and use preventive medicine . "
On October 30 , Jane Burgermeister 's theflu.com reported that : " More than 30 people have died in the Ukraine as a result of a mysterious new virus that has an affinity for the lungs , " according to Swiss reports .
Ukraine 's Health Ministry said the virus ' origin is unknown and showed " no signs of mutating to become more virulent . "
So far , 40,000 people were reported sick and 951 hospitalized .
On October 30 , healthfreedomalliance.org reported that Ukraine 's Health Minister , Vasyl Knyazevych , said two laboratories diagnosed 11 of 33 samples tested as " highly influenza A / H1N1 . "
As a result , he considered declaring a nationwide quarantine , even though western areas alone were affected .
Since October 19 , 30 deaths , including one child , from " acute respiratory infections , " were reported , at first called SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome , a serious form of pneumonia caused by a virus ) .
Influenza A virus affects birds and some mammals like pigs .
WTO Fear Mongering The WTO says Swine Flu is similar to seasonal strains .
Most cases are mild , and many people recover unaided .
Yet it called the virus " unstoppable " and , on June 11 , declared its highest phase 6 alert , saying : " The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic . "
On July 13 , it stopped just short of mandating mass vaccinations to halt the pandemic 's spread .
On its November 1 " Pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 " update , it said " more than 199 countries and overseas territories / communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 , including over 6,000 deaths . "
On November 3 , it reported the outbreak in Ukraine , " confirmed ( as ) H1N1 ( based on ) samples taken from patients in two of the most affected regions , " and concluded that " most ( Ukraine influenza ) cases are caused by the H1N1 virus .
Infectious disease expert , Dr. Donald Lau , disagrees , saying : " The statistical probability of this being the same H1N1 virus ( is ) infinitesimally small . "
He believes a highly virulent new strain is to blame .
Public health authority , Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz sees a deadly connection between governments and the drug cartel over dangerous , toxic vaccines .
On You Tube , he recently warned that : " These vaccinations contain highly unstable viruses that easily mutate , because they are ' live active ' laboratory mutants that are being administered .... People shed these ' live ' viruses up to three weeks following vaccination .
That means if you have n't been vaccinated , and you get near someone who has and then sneezes , you can get their H1N1 laboratory infection . "
He explained that anyone contracting H1N1 , from vaccinations or other Swine Flu-infected persons , risks combining it with other internal or environmental viruses , creating a lethal mix that can kill .
He expressed great concern about vaccines used to transmit dangerous viruses , capable of mutating into deadly ones , believes this may be happening in Ukraine , and thinks America and other nations may be next .
Ukraine Reports of Overhead Aerosol Spraying On October 31 , Kiev newspaper editors got dozens of calls about light planes doing aerosol spraying during the day .
In refuting the claims , the district 's Emergency Response office said " no permission had been granted for small aviation aircraft to fly within the city limits . "
Yet eye - witness accounts from Lviv , Ternopil , and other Ukraine cities said the same thing .
On November 8 , the South African web site fto.co.za reported that last June 26 : " Suspicious aircraft were forced to land .
A US operated ( Russian - made long - range heavy transport ) AN - 124 changed its call sign from civilian to military which then triggered a response from the IAF ( Indian Air Force ) upon entering Pakistani air space ( forcing ) the plane to land in Mumbai while ( a ) second one was forced down by Nigerian fighter jets that also arrested the crew . "
" According to reports , China 's People 's Liberation Army Air Force contacted the Indian and Nigerian intelligence officials about the presence of these US operated Ukrainian aircraft amidst growing concern that the United States was spreading ' biological agents ' in the Earth 's atmosphere , which some Chinese officials believed to be an attempt to ( commit ) mass genocide via the spread of H1N1 swine flu . "
These aircraft " were carrying ' waste disposal ' systems that could spray up to 45,000kg ( nearly 100,000 pounds ) of aerial type mist from sophisticated .... nano pipes " in the planes ' wings - called chemtrails .
" Then last week , ( aircraft ) sprayed ( an unknown ) substance over Ukraine days before the ( mysterious ) plague outbreak . "
Quarantine and Martial Law Declared On October 30 , president Viktor Yushchenko quarantined nine regions , ordered mobile military hospitals established throughout the country , and was expected to declare martial law .
Reports from western Ukraine said a " severe outbreak of UNIDENTIFIED Influenza , ( is ) suspected by doctors to be a form of viral pneumonia . "
On November 4 , in a nationwide address , Yushchenko cited : -- an " emergency epidemic situation in the country , " caused by " infections of viral origin , including A / H1N1 flu ( that are ) rapidly spreading across Ukraine ; " -- " People are dying ; the epidemic is killing doctors ; " -- " three pathogens of viral infections came to Ukraine at the same time : two of them are seasonal flu and the third is the A / H1N1 ; according to virologists , such a combination of infections due to mutation may produce a new , even more aggressive virus ; " --
" It is generally known that the only way to prevent any infection is vaccination ; " Dr. Viera Scheibner , the world 's foremost vaccine expert , calls it the worst way as vaccines often cause the diseases they 're designed to prevent ; -- " in early October , " it was known that " viral infections in the west of the country " were spreading ; --
" The current Constitution after alterations in 2004 makes the Government solely responsible for conducting state healthcare policy ....( by ) my decree I put " the National Security and Defense Council ( in charge ) of decision - making ; " -- " Failure to comply with its orders will immediately result in application to the law enforcement authorities . "
In other words , Yushchenko declared martial law .
He also ordered a crackdown on political protests , the arrest of public health officials opposed to mass Swine Flu vaccinations and quarantines , arrests of anyone not complying , and a ban on all infection medicines except Swine Flu vaccines .
By November 6 , Deputy Health Minister , Zinovy Mytnyk , said " 633,877 people ( were ) suffering from flu and acute respiratory infections , " and " 95 " had died .
On November 7 , healthfreedomalliance.org updated the totals to " 871,037 Influenza / ARI ( acute respiratory infection ) cases , 39,603 hospitalized , and 135 deaths , and asked if Baxter released a bioweapon in Ukraine , saying " Evidence appears to suggest " it .
It cited a February 24 bloomberg.com report that " Baxter Sent Bird Flu Virus to European Labs by Error ( containing ) contaminated ( virus ) samples .... "
The problem was discovered when inoculated ferrets in a Czech lab died .
Austrian health minister , Sigrid Rosenberger , confirmed that Baxter supplied batches " infected with a bird flu virus . "
Company spokesperson , Christopher Bona , blamed " human error . "
Others were skeptical , including Austrian journalist Jane Burgermeister .
On June 10 , she filed sweeping criminal charges with the FBI in addition to earlier April 8 ones with the Vienna State Prosecutor 's Office against Baxter AG , Baxter International and Avir Green Hill Biotechnology AG , " for manufacturing , disseminating , and releasing a biological weapon of mass destruction on Austrian soil between December 2008 and February 2009 with the intention of causing a global bird flu pandemic virus and of intending to profit from that same pandemic in an act that violates laws on international organised crime and genocide . "
Baxter operates Biosafety Level 3 ( BLS - 3 ) labs that take strict precautions to assure against accidental H3N2 ( human influenza ) and H5N1 ( bird flu ) co-mingling contamination .
Letting it happen suggests something more nefarious than an accident .
BLS - 3 personnel are trained in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents and are supervised by competent , experienced scientists .
In addition , these labs have specially engineered design features for added safety .
By combining H3N2 and H5N1 viruses , " Baxter produced a highly dangerous biological weapon with a 63 per cent mortality rate .
The H5N1 virus is restricted in its human - to - human transmissibility , especially because it is less airborne . "
" However when .... combined with seasonal flu viruses ( easily transmitted by air ) , a new flu virus is created which is unknown to the human immune system and which will have a severe impact on an unprotected population .
A deadly virus of this kind could spread around the world in a short time and ( potentially ) infect millions ( or ) even billions of people . "
Baxter ( via Avir ) " distributed ( 72 kilos of ) contaminated ( live bird flu ) vaccines using false concealment and false labels to 16 laboratories in Austria and .... other countries at the end of January / beginning of February , potentially infecting at least 36 - 37 laboratory staff , who ( were ) treated preventively for bird flu and ordinary flu . "
On the same day , 18 Avir employees were as well at Vienna 's Otto Wagner Hospital .
Burgermeister cited a Baxter - Avir 2006 contract with Austria 's Health Ministry for 16 million vaccine doses in case a bird flu pandemic was declared .
This " laboratory incident shows that national and international authorities are not able to fulfill their obligations to ensure the safety of the Austrian people , " and indicates they engaged in a cover - up .
" If a pharmaceutical company can breach laws - and almost trigger a bird flu pandemic , which ( potentially could spread worldwide ) - without being made accountable for it .... then there is , de facto , no rule of law on Austrian territory . "
She also contends that Baxter 's production system , " namely , the use of 1200 liter bioreactors and vero cell technology , " meets " the technical criteria to be classified as a secret dual purpose large - scale bioweapon production facility ( able to produce ) a huge amount of contaminated vaccine material .... rapidly . "
" If ( this ) material were added to the 1200 liter bioreactors , it would replicate and infect the entire batch of vaccine material in ( it ) .
Contaminated material could ( then ) be distributed among sections of the population using false labels and secretly marked batches ( able to ) infect millions of people . "
Burgermeister accused high - level Austrian Health and other Ministry officials of knowledge and support of this practice .
Otherwise , controls would have prevented it .
In June , she named drug producers Baxter , Novartis and Sanofi Aventis ; world agencies , including the WHO , UN , and CDC ; and high - level officials in Austria , other European countries , and America .
Did Baxter Release a Bioweapon in Ukraine ?
Baxter has a facility in Ukraine .
Given the above evidence , it may be behind the current outbreak .
A November 1 David Rothscum infowars.com article headlined : " Has Baxter International released a biological weapon , " in citing an earlier Huffington Post report on a man named Joseph Moshe , a Mossad biological warfare expert .
True or not , he warned , on an August radio program , about " a biological weapon .... being made by Baxter International ( 's Ukraine facility ) that would be spread through vaccine and would cause a plague upon its release . "
Having reported this two months before the outbreak lends credence to his story .
In August , Ukraine was almost influenza free .
On October 30 , earthtimes.org said only two cases of Swine Flu had been reported .
According to fto.co.za , on March 26 , reports were that " thousands of Ukrainians refused " to be vaccinated , because of fears about " diphtheria , mumps , polio , hepatitis B , tuberculosis , ( and ) whooping cough among others .
Health officials said ( this ) could lead to disease outbreaks .... "
Perhaps unleashing a " biological weapon " is how to convince them and millions elsewhere .
Rothscum confirmed Moshe 's credentials , noting that " massive numbers of microbiologists have been dying bizarre deaths . "
Among them : -- Stephen Lagakos , Professor of Biostatistics and AIDS researcher at Harvard 's School of Public Health , died in an October auto collision ; -- Malcolm Casadaban , reknown molecular geneticist , died of plague in September ; -- Wallace Pannier , noted germ warfare scientist , died in August of respiratory failure ; -- August " Gus " Watanabe , former Eli Lilly and Company Executive Vice President of Science and Technology and former head of its Research Laboratories , died of apparent self - inflicted wounds from a .38 - caliber handgun ; a note left behind cited depression over his daughter 's death ; -- Caroline Coffey , Cornell University post - doctoral biomedicine researcher , died in June from massive cuts to her throat ; and -- Nasser Talebzadeh Ordoubadi , a Mind - Body - Quantum medicine pioneer and discoverer of an antitoxin treatment for bioweapons , died in February of " suspicious " causes .
On November 7 , theflucase.com asked :
Is the Ukraine outbreak " the plague ?
A mutated virus ?
Or is the plague the cover for introducing a mutated virus ? "
Citing the South African web site fto.co.za. , it wondered if the Ukraine Swine Flu strain " might have mutated ( to ) pneumonic plague . "
It reported Ukraine 's Deputy Minister of Health saying his nation has a different H1N1 strain than the rest of the world because of how many were infected so fast .
Other officials disagree and suggest this one may have mutated to something else because it " has a much bigger rate of filling the lungs with blood ....
The plague or virus in the Ukraine has 10 times the mortality rate ( attributed to ) normal swine flu . "
However , unconfirmed reports are that " people are going on as normal .... they also say this is fear mongering " to promote voluntary vaccinations .
" Everyone is waiting for the gene sequences which will confirm whether this has been hyped up , a real mutated H1N1 , or just bad ( Ukraine ) health services . "
Perhaps exaggerated illness and death reports to stoke fear and be a pretext for what followed .
Ukraine is now under martial law .
Civil liberties are suspended .
By government edict , anyone may be criminally prosecuted .
Scheduled January elections may be delayed or cancelled .
Public demonstrations are banned .
Political opponents are prohibited from traveling in quarantined areas .
Borders are partially closed .
Mandated vaccinations are coming .
WHO fear - mongering is hyping the danger .
A month before the outbreak , it took part in a bioterrorism plague exercise .
On November 7 , Lake of the Hills , IL police conducted their own against pneumonic plague as part of the McHenry County Department of Health 's emergency planning .
Burgermeister suggests that Baxter , the : " WTO and the international corporate crime syndicate that funds them may have decided they could go ahead with their plan to trigger a pandemic in Europe and the USA because the public awareness of the dangers of the vaccine has become too great , not least as a result of WHO and Baxter being caught contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus in February . "
Opposition to Vaccinations in Europe Across the continent , opposition is widespread .
Few are showing up to get it .
On November 7 in Paris , a public demonstration against them was held .
As of November 5 , less than 0.1 % of the French population was inoculated despite a mass vaccination campaign .
90 % of Greek health workers oppose them .
Reports from Portugal say vaccine centers are nearly empty , and doctors and nurses wo n't take them .
Sources expect a " revolution " if they 're mandated .
A mid-October Der Spiegel article reported an " open rebellion " among general medical professionals and child physicians across Germany over dangerous Swine Flu vaccines .
Dieter Ludwig , drug commission chairman of the German medical profession , said health authorities colluded with drug companies to promote them .
In Denmark , most public officials and healthcare workers wo n't take them , citing the danger and saying H1N1 is no different from seasonal flu .
Throughout Scandinavia , sentiment is the same with up to 75 % opposition .
In Sweden , as few as several thousand have gotten them .
Across the continent also , in the Netherlands , Spain , Belgium and elsewhere .
Also large segments of the US , Canadian and UK populations voice strong opposition .
Open protests are occurring in Austria .
In other countries as well .
Millions know the toxicity and wo n't touch them .
Ukraine 's outbreak may be a counteroffensive to force them , first there , then globally .
Ukraine Outbreak Spreads
On November 6 , innworldreport.net headlined , " Pneumonic Plague Outbreak in China Follows Outbreak in Ukraine . "
The town of Ziketan ( population 10,000 ) reported two deaths and a dozen others infected .
The " area inside a 17 - mile radius " was quarantined to contain it .
The " highly contagious disease , one of the most virulent and deadly diseases on earth , ( is ) usually fatal within 24 hours .
It attacks the lungs and kills nearly everyone who catches it unless treated rapidly with antibiotics . "
On the same day , Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko called the panic over Swine Flu artificially created by drug companies .
He urged people not to panic , and said authorities are monitoring the situation in neighboring Ukraine .
Ten deaths were reported in the Minsk , " preceded by flu - like symptoms . "
Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty disseminates US propaganda in 20 countries , including Russia , Ukraine , Iran , Iraq , and Afghanistan .
On November 4 , it headlined , " Swine Flu Fears Spread from Ukraine to Afghanistan , " then reported , true or false , incidences showing up in Iran , Belarus , Turkmenistan , Serbia , and other Balkan countries .
" Afghanistan has declared a nationwide public health emergency and closed all educational institutes for three weeks . "
On November 2 , the Chinese web site sina.com reported that authorities in a southeast Bulgarian district declared an A / H1N1 epidemic , according to local media accounts .
The " sick rate " rose " to 200 per 10,000 people , " and in some towns is approaching epidemic levels .
A later report said 210 per 10,000 .
Two deaths were reported , and Bulgaria 's chief health expert , Tencho Tenev , said " at least two million Bulgarians , or 30 percent of ( the ) population , could become infected with the flu virus over the coming months . "
On November 9 , thebirdflupandemic.com headlined , " Russia , Belarus and Bulgaria On The Verge Of A Flu Epidemic As Cases In Ukraine Near 1 Million . "
Same day Ukraine reports said 1,031,597 people are sick with flu - like symptoms , 52,742 have been hospitalized , and 174 people have died .
On November 6 , Russia 's Chief Health Official , Gennady Onishchenko , said most regions in the country " are on the verge of a flu epidemic . "
" Disturbing reports are beginning to surface in western Europe .
In Austria , special army units based in Korneuburg ( where Baxter 's facilities are located ) , have been conducting pandemic emergency exercises and quarantining patients in hospitals .
Are they expecting something to happen ? "
WHO " Whole - of - Society Pandemic Readiness Guidelines for Pandemic Preparedness and Response in the Non-Health Sectors " Prepared in April 2009 , the same month Swine Flu was reported in Mexico , it was revised in July and now easily accessed coincidently with the Ukraine outbreak .
Its aim is : " to prepare the whole of society , beyond the health sector , for pandemic influenza .... including public and private sector organizations and essential services . "
The flucase.com says it " outlines how WHO will take over a country 's essential services , including water and sanitation ; fuel and energy ; food ; health care ; telecommunications ; finance ; law and order ; education ; and transportation under the pretext of a pandemic emergency . "
The " guidelines " state : " National inter- ministerial pandemic preparedness committees should map out the central government 's roles , responsibilities , and chain of command and designate lead agencies , " answerable to the WHO that 's perhaps enforceable during a " health emergency . "
It may work like this .
Vaccine law attorney , Alan G. Phillips says : " .... underlying laws .... allow states to mandate vaccines in an emergency .... throw out exemptions , ( and ) impose quarantines and isolation outside of our homes . "
US laws are similar .
They can mandate vaccinations and let states isolate and quarantine influenza victims if authorities call the disease infectious and life - threatening .
Under the 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness ( PREP )
Act , the HHS Secretary may declare any disease an epidemic or national emergency requiring mandatory vaccinations , quarantine , or other protective measures .
It 's a short step to empowering WHO with authority over most nations in short order .
Its " guidelines " also want Defense Ministries to designate military assets to enforce vaccinations and quarantines under pandemic conditions .
They also say : " Ministries of Justice should consider what legal processes could be suspended during the pandemic and make alternate plans to operate courts " while it continues .
According to theflucase.com : " leaked ( French ) documents show that the Minister of Justice has ordered the suspension of the most basic rights , and people can be incarcerated for up to six months without having to appear before a judge in a pandemic emergency . "
Might America and other nations order similar measures under a " pandemic emergency , " real or bogus .
Internal 2006 IBM Document Reveals Advance Knowledge of a Planned Pandemic Titled , " Services & Global Procurement pan IOT Europe , Pandemic Plan Overview , " it was distributed to upper - level management in France .
It predicted a " 100 % chance ( of a ) planned ( pandemic ) occurring within the next 5 years , " covering quarantines and operational procedures to be taken after an official WTO announcement .
This document suggests what many believe - that governments and the drug cartel , in collusion with the WTO , orchestrated the current crisis , choosing Ukraine as the lead target .
The situation there deserves close monitoring because of what may happen globally .
Advance Pandemic Warning and Early Preparations Replikins , Ltd. is a small Boston - based biotech firm that " develops and markets .... predictive products and vaccines .... based upon the company 's discovery of Replikins , a new group of peptides related to the rapid replication function in viral and other diseases ( capable of ) predicting the emergence of virulent strains of particular diseases . "
On April 7 , 2008 , a year before the reported Mexican H1N1 outbreak , it published a " FluForecast " stating the following : " Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has recently increased to 7.6 ( plus / minus 1.4 ) , its highest level since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic ....
A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating the rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of a specific strain .
The current increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of ( seasonal ) H3N2 , for instance . "
" The current H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the US and Austria ....
However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast software in all three previous pandemics , namely 1918 H1N1 , 1957 H2N2 , and 1968 H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 ( Avian Flu ) , have not yet been detected in the currently evolving H1N1 . "
In an October 24 , 2007 press release , the US Treasury Department discussed the " preliminary results of the industry - wide pandemic flu exercise ....
More than 2,700 organizations registered to participate anonymously ( which ) began in September and ran for three weeks . "
Involved were banks , insurance companies , securities firms and exchanges , and state and federal regulators .
" The exercise simulated a pandemic wave with a peak absenteeism rate of 49 percent .... President Bush directed Treasury in May 2006 to coordinate with the banking and finance sector to better prepare its response to a pandemic crisis . "
On December 12 , 2007 , FEMA Region I ( for New England ) hosted a joint federal - state exercise " to strengthen contingency plans for an influenza pandemic .
Operation PANEX 07 is the first functional exercise of its type in this country designed to determine best practices for a coordinated multi-agency response to an outbreak . "
Participating agencies included the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , and Defense ( DOD ) " in partnership with their counterparts in the six New England states . "
On July 28 , 2009 , CNN reported that the Pentagon will " establish regional teams of military personnel to assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant outbreak of the H1N1 virus this fall , according to Defense Department officials ....
The plan calls for military task forces to work in conjunction with ( FEMA ) . "
Consider the implications .
On October 23 , Obama declared a H1N1 national emergency .
The Pentagon will be in charge if conditions warrant it .
Civil liberties may be suspended .
Martial law may be declared .
Mandatory toxic , dangerous vaccinations may be ordered , known to cause auto immune diseases ranging from annoying to debilitating to life - theatening .
The situation in Ukraine bears watching .
It may signal what 's soon heading everywhere .

It looks like a giant sculpture draped in steel mesh rising out of a dense urban landscape .
But the 70 - foot - tall structure at the southern gateway to Portland 's light - rail line is a federally funded renewable energy project that could influence urban transportation and development for years to come .
In addition to serving as a link between Union Station and Portland State University ,
includes a substation and communications building at Southwest Jackson between Fifth and Sixth avenues .
It is designed to operate mostly on solar and wind power .
The substation provides power to about one - third of the Portland mall light rail .
The signals /
communications building is one of two in the downtown area that runs all communication between trains and traffic signals on the mall , including closed - circuit television .
" This is something we 've never really done , " TriMet architect Bob Hastings said .
" It 's the first of its kind anywhere on a transit system . "
Federal stimulus dollars provided funding for the steel structure and the coiled metal drapery that will envelope all but the south side , which will support the substation 's future solar array .
Construction started Dec. 14 and is expected to be completed by Feb. 12 .
TriMet is still putting together funding for the most innovative piece of the $ 1.2 million project : the solar panels and small wind turbines that will spin atop the transit rail posts .
The agency 's goal is to have everything up and running by fall .
The 50 - kilowatt solar array will cost $ 750,000 , and the turbines are estimated to cost about $ 250,000 .
The two elements will be paid for with public funding , energy tax credits and PGE 's renewable energy fund .
Together , the solar panels and 22 turbines will produce 75 to 90 percent of the power needed to operate the site , with energy that goes unused during peak production times sold back to PGE .
PSU plans to participate by monitoring and studying the substation 's renewable energy data .
The hope is that TriMet 's south terminus will become a model for other cities interested in tapping renewable energy sources for public transportation projects .
" Wind energy in an urban environment is such an untapped field , " Hastings said .
The wind turbines , which stand just under 4 feet tall , are designed and built by a local company ,
.
They will spin on a vertical axis atop the steel poles that support the wires for light rail .
" I love the idea that we can get energy even at night , " Hastings said .
" They 'll spin like a top , very quietly , with no big rotors to harm the birds . "
manufactured the secure -- yet striking -- steel curtain that will cloak the substation and communications building .
Liberty Steel Erectors installed the metal framework ; what looks like a gigantic old - fashioned fireplace curtain will be hung next week .
Neither building is designed to house employees , but TriMet workers will use the buildings periodically to monitor and maintain the equipment .
The innovative design grew out of an issue TriMet often encounters : Strict city design guidelines prohibit the agency from covering its equipment with unsightly prefabricated buildings , cyclone fencing and razor wire .
Mindful of the highly visible location , TriMet wanted the structure to be special .
So the agency hired local architecture firm
to come up with a design that would be both stunning and functional .
" We wanted it to be iconic , " said David Byrne , the firm 's project manager .
" This was an opportunity to be more expressive rather than just cladding the building in facade materials . "
The firm recently won a 2009 merit award from the American Institute of Architects for the design .
The institute praised the firm 's creative approach to urban renewal despite tight funding and design restrictions .
" They did a gateway treatment for downtown , stretching everybody 's understanding of what this could be , " Hastings said .
" This is a small facility , but it could have a large impact . "

Install0us is an application used by iPhone users to browse , download and install millions of pirated applications .
After becoming uneasy over its legal status , its creator has taken advice from a lawyer .
The conclusion is that the risk is too great and development of the software will stop .
Of course , others already have plans to fill the gap .
With the new Apple Tablet announcement just hours away , there are already millions of individuals desperate to get their hands on this super - cool device .
In common with the iPhone it ’s rumored that Apple ’s tablet will acquire an App Store of its own , and might even be backwards compatible with the tens of thousands of apps already available .
Of course , just as was the case with the iPhone , a resourceful hacking community is standing by to tear the tablet apart too , forcing it to run their own software designed to do tricks that Apple never intended .
The holy grail – running pirate software .
The original Installous application was created by a coder named Puy0 .
For use on jailbroken iPhones , the web - browsing , downloading and installing application was used by hundreds of thousands of iPhone users to obtain free applications .
After completely rewriting the original Installous code , Puy0 subtly renamed Installous to Install0us , left his home at the infamous Hackulo .us forum , and moved to his own forum at Install0us.com .
This move caused a bit of a split in the community , with some people moving to join Puy0 at Install0us .
Although it may have appeared otherwise , in common with a web browser viewing a torrent index , Installous and Install0us only ever showed web pages which in turn provided just links to copyright works , but even this providing this functionality was enough to give Puy0 legal concerns .
Puy0 has now revealed that for some time he has been searching for a specialist copyright lawyer to find out what the legal position is with Install0us .
After a three month search he finally found a good one and entered into a discussion – the outcome was n’t good .
The conclusion is that if it came to court , it would be very difficult for Puy0 to defend his position and that of Install0us .
With this in mind , the decision has been taken to discontinue the Install0us project .
The forums will close along with the repositories used to access the software and everything will be deleted .
“ The bad news is , however , Install0us 3 will not and cannot ever be released .
It all must end here .
This is extremely disappointing for all of us , considering the time and energy we have spent on it , ” explains Puy0 .
“ Call me a coward , but as I said , hiding under covers is not a life for me .
Moreover , these days in my country piracy is a hot subject among politicians …
I do not want to be flamed in a trial for something that I do as a hobby , and I do not want to involve any people with me in this .
I am sincerely sorry to the people who followed me thinking we were legit , my honest mistake , ” he concludes .
Sites like that carry links to the downloadable apps will still be viewable through existing versions of Install0us , at least for now .
The longest - established and famous Appulous index , which runs on a single server , is maintained by an individual who has n’t been active in the community in over 6 months due to an extremely busy personal life .
This means that those who maintain the index have had no idea how long the project would continue for and have been living month to month .
i Phone app cracker most_uniQue told TorrentFreak that the solution was found with the creation of a new project .
Launched just one week ago , Apptrackr.org has the same layout and features as Appulous , but operates on multiple servers with active admins .
Apptrackr also acquired the database from Appulous , so it carries links to all the same apps as Appulous .
Of course , the community is super - resourceful and replacements for lost projects are never usually far away .
TorrentFreak can exclusively reveal that the admins at Hackulous have confirmed that a replacement for Install0us is currently under development .
“ Installr ” will be released in the near future .
« Maintenant que le plat est servi , il est très facile pour nous de manger .
Mais préparer ce plat n’a pas été un jeu d’enfant .
Je me souviens de notre première réunion , où je ne comprenais absolument rien au langage employé , et il y avait une tension palpable entre ceux qui défendaient l’adoption du logiciel libre au Brésil et ceux qui estimaient que nous devrions continuer comme avant , garder les mêmes habitudes , acheter , payer l’intelligence des autres et , grâce à Dieu , c’est le parti du logiciel libre qui l ’a emporté dans notre pays .
Car nous devions choisir : ou nous allions dans la cuisine préparer le plat que nous voulions manger , avec l’assaisonnement que nous voulions y mettre , et donner un goût brésilien à la nourriture , ou nous mangerions ce que Microsoft voulait vendre aux gens .
Et , c’est tout simplement l ’idée de la liberté qui l ’a emporté . »
Ainsi s’exprimait l’été dernier rien moins que le président de la République d’un des plus grands pays au monde , dans un discours dont vous comprendrez aisément pourquoi nous fait l’effort de traduire et sous - titrer sa vidéo ( j ’en profite pour saluer et remercier chaleureusement notre petit équipe de traducteurs lusophones ) .
Il s’agissait donc du président brésilien Lula , venu inaugurer le 24 juin 2009 à Porto Alegre le dixième Fórum Internacional Software Livre .
L’allocution , prononcée sans notes s’il vous plaît , dure une vingtaine de minutes et va bien au delà du simple extrait ci-dessus .
Le logiciel libre a évidemment besoin de toutes ces petites fourmis qui développent et qui diffusent .
Mais
Il a également besoin de ces hommes d’États éclairés et éclairants .
Ce n’est qu’un discours mais il a valeur de symbole .
Merci à ce pays , à son président et à tous ceux qui le conseillent et travaillent autour de lui .
L’Histoire retiendra que vous fûtes parmi les pionniers à avoir compris en si haut lieu l’importance d’aborder ce nouveau millénaire en offrant aux gens le plus d’opportunités possibles pour qu’ensemble s’épanouissent leur créativité .
Nous sommes tous des Brésiliens libres ?

Discours inaugural du président brésilien Lula
Fórum Internacional Software Livre – 24 juin 2009
( Traduction , sous - titrage et édition vidéo Framalang : Michaël Dias , Thibaut Boyer et Yostral )
Je veux saluer notre cher camarade Marcelo Branco , coordinateur général du 10ème Forum international du logiciel libre .
Je veux saluer les camarades des institutions publiques brésiliennes qui sont ici .
Je vois en face de moi la Banque du Brésil et le Serpro .
Je veux saluer les invités étrangers .
Je veux saluer ce petit enfant qui est là-bas sur des genoux et qui doit se demander ce que nous faisons là et pourquoi ses parents l’ont amené ici .
Un jour , il le saura …
Et je veux saluer une personne qui est ici en particulier , Sérgio Amadeu ( responsable des premières actions en faveur du logiciel libre au gouvernement brésilien ) .
Car maintenant que le plat est servi …
Je veux également saluer le camarade Tigre , notre président de la Fédération de l’Industrie du Rio Grande do Sul .
Maintenant que le plat est servi , il est très facile pour nous de manger .
Mais préparer ce plat n’a pas été un jeu d’enfant .
Je me souviens de notre première réunion , à la Granja do Torto , où je ne comprenais absolument rien au langage qu’employaient ces personnes , et il y avait une tension palpable entre ceux qui défendaient l’adoption du logiciel libre au Brésil et ceux qui estimaient que nous devrions continuer comme avant , garder les mêmes habitudes , acheter , payer l’intelligence des autres et , grâce à Dieu , c’est le parti du logiciel libre qui l ’a emporté dans notre pays .
Car nous devions choisir : ou nous allions dans la cuisine préparer le plat que nous voulions manger , avec l’assaisonnement que nous voulions y mettre , et donner un goût brésilien à la nourriture , ou nous mangerions ce que Microsoft voulait vendre aux gens .
Et , c’est tout simplement l ’idée de la liberté qui l ’a emporté .
Je voudrais vous raconter quelque chose ici , pourquoi , dans mon esprit , c’est le choix du logiciel libre qui l ’a emporté .
Vous savez que je n’ai jamais été communiste .
Lorsqu’on me demandait si j’étais communiste , je répondais que j’étais tourneur ajusteur .
Mais j’ai des camarades extraordinaires qui ont participé à la lutte armée dans ce pays , des camarades qui ont appartenu aux partis et aux courants idéologiques les plus différents qui soient , tous des camarades extraordinaires .
J’avais un frère plus âgé qui , toute sa vie , a essayé de me faire adhérer au Parti , et mon frère m’amenait tous les documents qui avaient été écrits et édités depuis 150 ou 200 ans .
Mon frère voulait que j’apprenne Le Manifeste par cœur , il voulait que je lise et relise Le Capital , il voulait que je critique tout cela , et moi , je disais à mon frère : « Chico , tout cela a été écrit il y a si longtemps .
N’est - il pas maintenant temps pour les gens de commencer à produire de nouvelles choses ? »
Et quand le Mur de Berlin est tombé , j’ai été heureux car cela allait permettre à la jeunesse de pouvoir réfléchir , écrire de nouvelles choses , élaborer de nouvelles théories , car on avait l’impression que tout était déjà construit et que plus rien ne pourrait être différent .
Le logiciel libre est un peu cela , c’est - à- dire donner aux gens l’occasion de faire de nouvelles choses , de créer de nouvelles choses , de valoriser l’individualité des personnes .
Car il n’y a rien qui ne garantisse plus la liberté que de garantir votre liberté individuelle , que de permettre aux gens d’exprimer leur créativité , leur intelligence , surtout dans un pays nouveau comme le Brésil , où la créativité du peuple est probablement , sans aucun mépris pour les autres peuples , la plus importante du XXIe siècle .
En effet , je pense que notre gouvernement a déjà fait beaucoup , mais notre gouvernement aurait pu faire plus .
Nous sommes un gouvernement très démocratique .
Je ne crois pas qu’il y ait un gouvernement au monde qui exerce la démocratie comme le fait notre gouvernement .
Je ne le crois pas .
Je ne crois pas qu’il y ait au monde quelqu ’un qui débatte autant , qui discute autant que notre gouvernement .
Et cela complique parfois les choses , n’est - ce pas , Tarso ?
Nous devons parfois écouter une fois , deux fois , trois fois , car , comme je suis un analphabète à propos de l ’Internet … mes enfants sont des experts pour moi .
Car Internet est une chose fantastique , Olívio , c’est la première fois que les petits enfants sont plus malins que les grands - parents .
C’est la première fois .
Autrefois , du fait que vous étiez plus vieux , vous vouliez vous imposer sur tout , n’est - ce pas ?
Le fils ne pouvait parler quand vous étiez en réunion , vous ne pouviez pas intervenir dans une discussion d’adultes .
Aujourd ’hui , non .
Aujourd ’hui , il y a deux adultes en train de discuter avec un gamin à côté d’eux , et les adultes disent : « Comment est-ce qu’on change de chaîne sur la télé ? » , avec deux télécommandes que les gens ne savent pas utiliser correctement .
Et le gamin de huit ans y va , il bidouille , il tripote …
Louer la maison , payer le loyer , l’électricité , l’eau ( sur Internet ) …
Je pense donc que nous sommes en train de vivre une période révolutionnaire pour l’humanité , où la presse n’a plus le pouvoir qu’elle avait il y a quelques années , l’information n’est plus une chose exclusive où les détenteurs de l’information pouvaient faire un coup d’État , l’information n’est plus une chose privilégiée .
Le journal du soir est maintenant dépassé face à Internet , l’émisssion de radio , qu’elle soit en direct ou enregistrée , est dépassée face à Internet .
Le journal du soir a l’air très vieux face à Internet , et il a l’air si vieux que tous les journaux ont créé des blogs pour informer ensemble , avec les internautes du monde entier .
Et bien , ces choses , nous ne savons pas jusqu ’où vont aller toutes ces choses , nous ne le savons pas .
Je sais que chaque fois que je discute avec vous , j’imagine que si ma génération était aussi intelligente et créative que la vôtre , nous serions bien meilleurs que ce que nous sommes aujourd ’hui , car l’appareil public est une chose compliquée .
Il est plein de vices , de règles , vous savez , qui datent de l’époque impériale .
Et vous , vous faites bouger ces choses .
Un bureaucrate , lui , a un manuel , et le manuel dit seulement ce qu’il peut faire ou ne pas faire .
Si vous lui présentez quelque chose de nouveau , il reste interdit .
Il n’est pas capable de dire : « Bon , j’ai ici quelque chose de nouveau , je vais essayer d’agir » , non .
Il dit s’il peut ou pas .
Et tout cela a pris du temps pour que le gouvernement commence à créer les conditions pour arriver à la situation d’aujourd ’hui .
Le logiciel libre est donc une possibilité pour que cette jeunesse réinvente des choses qui ont besoin d’être réinventées .
De quoi a - t’on besoin ?
D’opportunités .
Nous pouvons être certains d’une chose , camarades , c’est que dans ce gouvernement , il est interdit d’interdire .
Dans ce gouvernement …
Ce que nous faisons dans ce gouvernement , c’est discuter .
Les chefs d’entreprise savent combien nous discutons , sans animosité , ni agressivité , sans chercher à combattre l’interlocuteur , non !
Il s’agit de débattre , de renforcer la démocratie et de l’amener jusqu ’au bout .
Car ce pays est encore en train de se découvrir lui-même , car durant des siècles , on nous a traités comme si nous étions des citoyens de seconde zone , nous devions demander l’autorisation pour faire des choses , nous pouvions seulement faire ce que les États - Unis nous autorisaient à faire , ou ce qu’autorisait l’Europe .
Et notre estime de nous est en hausse aujourd ’hui .
Nous apprenons à nous aimer nous - mêmes .
Nous sommes en train de découvrir que nous pouvons faire des choses .
Nous sommes en train de découvrir que personne n’est meilleur que nous .
Les autres peuvent être semblables , mais meilleurs non , ils n’ont pas plus de créativité que nous .
Ce dont nous avons besoin , c’est d’opportunités .
Cette loi qui est là , cette loi qui est là , ne cherche pas à corriger les abus d’Internet .
Elle souhaite en réalité censurer .
Ce dont nous avons besoin , camarade Tarso Genro , c’est peut - être de modifier le Code Civil , c’est peut - être de modifier certains choses .
Ce dont nous avons besoin , c’est de responsabiliser les personnes qui travaillent sur le numérique , sur Internet .
C’est de responsabiliser , mais pas d’interdire ou de condamner .
C’est l’intérêt de la police de faire une loi qui permette d’entrer chez les gens pour savoir ce qu’ils sont en train de faire , et même de saisir les ordinateurs .
Mais ce n’est pas notre intérêt , ce n’est pas possible .
Je voulais donc , mon cher Marcelo , vous dire qu’aujourd ’hui , je ne sais pas ce qu’en ont pensé mes camarades , pour moi , aujourd ’hui a été un jour magnifique , magnifique , car j’ai un conseiller spécial , qui s’occupe de la question numérique , un ami de Marcelo , j’ai …
Le gouvernement a dix ministres qui parlent d’implantation numérique .
Implantation numérique sont les mots les plus « sexys » du gouvernement , vous savez ?
Les mots les plus « sexys » , tout le monde les prononce .
J’avais donc besoin d’un coordinateur qui parle un langage rien que pour moi , et j’ai mis le camarade César Alvarez , qui est un habitant d’ici , du Rio Grande do Sul , un supporter du club de foot l’Internacional , qui vient juste de faire match nul contre le Corinthians mercredi , pour le plus grand plaisir des gaúchos .
Olívio Dutra est conseiller et je lui ai demandé d’en parler avec les dirigeants de l ’International : « le score est de zéro à zéro , c’est bon pour nous , Olívio , il n’y a aucun problème ! »
Mais avec cette coordination , nous essayons d’avancer .
Je voulais seulement vous dire une chose Écoutez , il ne me reste plus qu’un an et demi de mandat , plus qu’un an et demi .
C’est important que vous observiez ce que nous avons fait et qui a besoin d’être perfectionné .
Et il faut que vous observiez ce que nous ne sommes pas encore parvenus à faire , et que vous nous aidiez à le faire .

Lessons from America 's Lost Decade
As the United States takes the measure of Barack Obama ’s first year in the White House and looks beyond to what could be a difficult new decade , it might be useful to first stop and extract some lessons from the 2000s , which proved to be a lost economic decade for many Americans .

For the first time since the Great Depression , the United States experienced zero job growth in a decade .
Zero .
And zero is actually worse than it sounds since none of the preceding six decades registered job growth of less than 20 percent .
By comparison , the 1970s , which are often bemoaned as a time of economic stagflation and political malaise , registered a 27 percent increase in jobs .
Yet , in part because of that relatively slow rise in jobs – down from 31 percent in the 1960s – American voters turned to Ronald Reagan and his radical economic theories of tax cuts , global “ free markets ” and deregulation .
Reagan sold Americans on his core vision : “ Government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . ”
Through his personal magnetism , Reagan turned taxes into a third rail of American politics .
He convinced many voters that the government ’s only important role was funding the military .
Yet , instead of guiding the country to a bright new day of economic vitality , Reagan ’s approach accelerated a de-industrialization of the United States and a slump in the growth of American jobs , down to 20 percent during the 1980s .
The percentage job increase for the 1990s stayed at 20 percent , although job growth did pick up later in the decade under Democrat Bill Clinton , who raised taxes and moderated some of Reagan 's approaches while still pushing " free trade " agreements and deregulation .
Hard - line Reaganomics returned with a vengeance under George W. Bush – more tax cuts , more faith in “ free trade , ” more deregulation – and the Great American Job Engine finally started grinding to a halt .
Zero percent increase .
Despite the painful statistics of the past three decades , Reaganomics remains a powerful force in American political life .
Anyone tuning in CNBC or picking up the Wall Street Journal would think that these economic policies had enjoyed unqualified success .
Though the downward economic spiral can be traced over the past three decades , the facts are especially stark for the 2000s , the so - called “ Aughts ” or perhaps more accurately the “ Naughts . ”
“ For most of the past 70 years , the U.S. economy has grown at a steady clip , generating perpetually higher incomes and wealth for American households , ” wrote the Washington Post 's Neil Irwin in a Jan. 2 , 2010 , review of comparative economic data .
“ But since 2000 , the story is starkly different . ”
As the Post article and its accompanying graphics show , the last decade ’s sad story was n’t just limited to the abysmal job numbers .
U.S. economic output slowed to its worst pace since the 1930s , rising only 17.8 percent in the 2000s , less than half the 38.1 percent increase in the despised 1970s .
Household net worth declined 4 percent in the last decade , compared to a 28 percent rise in the 1970s .
( All figures were adjusted for inflation . )
Even Worse
As grim as those numbers were , the overall economic legacies of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush may be even worse .
Not only did the Great American Job Engine grind to a halt in the past decade , but the dire economic numbers were accompanied by massive increases in federal debt , part of a risky right - wing strategy to hamstring the government ’s ability to ever address domestic problems in the future .
When Reagan took office , the total federal debt was still under $ 1 trillion ( $ 909 billion ) .
By the end of the 12 - year Republican reign of Reagan and George H.W. Bush , the total debt had quadrupled .
The rise in the red ink leveled off under Democrat Bill Clinton .
Amazingly , he left office with the federal budget in the black by $ 236 billion and with a projected 10 - year budget surplus of $ 5.6 trillion .
The budgetary trend lines were such that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan began to fret about the challenges the Fed might face in influencing interest rates if the entire U.S. government debt were paid off , thus leaving no debt obligations to sell .
But Greenspan ’s nervousness was soon quieted .
In 2001 , George W. Bush seized the White House after blocking a full counting of legally cast votes in Florida , with the help of five Republican partisans on the U.S. Supreme Court .
Then , though lacking a popular mandate – Bush also had lost the national popular vote to Al Gore – Bush governed as if he had won by a landslide .
He pushed through a new round of tax cuts weighted in favor of the wealthy and , after the 9/11 attacks , launched two open - ended wars on borrowed money .
By the time Bush left office in 2009 , the annual deficit had gone to $ 1.3 trillion ( from a $ 236 billion surplus ) .
Total federal debt had risen almost $ 5 trillion to $ 10.7 trillion .
And the projected 10 - year budget outlook called for $ 8 trillion more in red ink .
Despite this record of economic failure – trillions more in debt but no net increase in jobs – many Americans appear to have learned no lessons from either the Bush - II presidency or the legacy of Reaganomics .
Any thought of raising taxes , addressing long - term problems like health costs , or investing in a stronger domestic infrastructure remains anathema to large segments of the population .
Indeed , across the news media , it is hard to find any serious – or sustained – criticism of the Reagan / Bush economic theories .
Far more blame is heaped on Obama for not having fully turned around the financial and economic crisis that he inherited .
Less than a year into Obama ’s presidency , voters in Massachusetts may be on the verge of electing a conservative Republican in a special Senate election , according to some polls .
That result would enable the GOP to filibuster every significant Obama initiative , from health care to job programs .
Many pundits anticipate more Republican victories in congressional elections next November .
Who ’s to Blame ?
Some of the fault for these Democratic political troubles can fairly be laid at Obama ’s door , though surely not all .
Fearing a new Great Depression , Obama did continue Bush ’s policies for bailing out large banks whose greed and recklessness contributed to the 2008 financial meltdown .
Obama also alienated his “ base ” by rejecting calls for investigating Bush - era national security crimes , expanding the Afghan War , and accepting compromises on health - care reform .
Tactically , Obama was played for a sucker when he let health - care negotiations with “ moderate ” Republicans like Olympia Snowe of Maine drag on past his initial deadline of August .
By slow - rolling the process , the Republicans bought time to organize right - wing populist opposition to the reform package and then marched the GOP ( Snowe included ) in lockstep behind a Senate filibuster of the legislation .
The unified Republican filibuster forced Obama and the Democratic leadership to make deals with conservative Democrats and Sen. Joe Lieberman , an Independent who seemed to enjoy bedeviling the legislative process .
To get Lieberman ’s support , the public option and other popular elements were jettisoned , causing many on the Left to denounce Obama as a sell - out .
Because of all the legislative delays , the health - care bill now hangs on the outcome of the Massachusetts election to fill the late Ted Kennedy ’s Senate seat on Jan. 19 .
More generally , few Americans appear to be paying any heed to the lessons of the past three decades .
Instead , many are simply reprising the same mistakes .
Republicans and the Right are determined to protect the Reagan - Bush legacies by blocking Democratic domestic legislation that might take the country in a different direction .
To stop that possibility , they continue to whip up anti-tax , anti-government furies .
Meanwhile , the Democrats still come across as flaccid protectors of an Establishment that many Americans understandably hate .
And the American Left mostly sits in the bleachers booing all the players , rather than getting into the game .
As this new decade dawns , the U.S. political process seems resistant to the one of most obvious lessons of the past three decades : Simply put , Reaganomics did n’t work .
As George H.W. Bush once commented – when he was running against Reagan in the 1980 primaries – it is “ voodoo economics . ”
Yet , the fact that the United States has embraced “ voodoo economics ” for 30 years and refuses to recognize the statistical evidence of Reaganomics ’ abject failure suggests that the larger lesson of this era – and especially this past lost decade – is that the U.S. political process is dysfunctional .

DropZap is a fun puzzle game in the same vein as classics like Tetris and Puyo Pop .
Can anyone tell the difference between all of these block clearing games anyways ?
Luckily for developer Amir Michail , he ’s embodied DropZap with elements that differentiate it enough from those other puzzle games that we can safely say DropZap has a unique identity all of its own .
The premise is pretty simple across DropZap ’s four game modes .
Each one involves the player clearing blocks by shrinking them out of sight .
Players pick where they want their blocks to go and the game handles all of the math .
After every move , another line is added to the bottom of the game board so the player needs to select where to drop each block carefully , or it may be their last .
The mechanic in DropZap that separates it from all the classics is that dropping a block adjacent to another does n’t necessarily clear it right away .
Blocks do n’t rely on orientation or color to disappear .
They rely on size .
When you drop a block , it zaps the row and column of blocks it lands by .
Zapping a block shrinks it one size .
Only the smallest blocks disappear when zapped , so it takes time to chip away at some of the larger blocks .
That ’s when the player has to rely on combinations of cascading blocks .
When you clear one block and the next drops , the next block also zaps the row and column it lands in .
Of course , these mechanics lend themselves to a much slower paced puzzle game .
Action mode adds a move timer to balance this .
Basically , if you take too long to select your next move , another line of blocks will pop up as punishment .
While this does balance the pacing issues for some puzzlers who like things fast , it ends up feeling too much like speed chess where the player is n’t considering their moves .
Both Standard and Action modes have “ Relentless ” flavors as well .
The regular modes require the player to clear 50 blocks before the puzzle restarts and the move on to the next level .
Relentless modes remove the levels and just see how long the player can last with one game board .
Relentless adds further variety to the game , but at its core , DropZap is the same across all of these modes .
It ’s easy to call DropZap one of the best puzzle games in the App Store despite its somewhat uninspiring appearance .
It ’s fun , addictive , and puts a fresh spin on dropping blocks to clear other blocks , and honestly , that ’s achievement enough for $ 0.99 .
DropZap is compatible with the iPhone and iPod Touch .
It requires the iPhone OS 2.2 or later .
A small expedite fee was paid by the developer to speed up the publication of this review .

Advertisement A dog caused confusion in an animal home when he failed to respond to basic commands - until staff realised he could only understand Polish .
Staff at the RSPCA centre in Oldham , Greater Manchester , originally thought Cent the collie was deaf .
But when they looked into his history they realised he came from a Polish family and so did not " speak " English .
So staff brushed up on Polish commands and , four months on , they say Cent is now bilingual and ready for a new home .
" When he came in he was n't responding to the basic commands , " said care assistant Karen Heath .
Polish dog commands
Sit - siad
Come here - do mnie Heel - noga Stay - zostan Fetch - aport " We could n't understand why at first but when we 've looked at his records and his history he has come from a Polish family .
" So obviously we 've gathered from that he does n't understand the English language , so therefore he wo n't understand our basic commands . "
Staff turned to the internet for phrases
Cent could recognise - although they are unsure of the pronunciation .
" We 've learnt a few basic ones which are sit - siad - and come - do mnie - and he seems to understand what we 're saying , " added Ms Heath .
" Obviously , maybe he 's having a chuckle because were pronouncing it a bit wrong ... but we 've got to work alongside that to teach him the English versions of them as well . "
Cent has been in the kennels for about four months and needs a new home .
But staff have assured would - be adopters that they do not need to speak Polish .

Clearly , there are no easy answers for Congo .
Many analysts say the country has become a sinkhole of foreign aid , with little progress despite billions of dollars poured into it .
The central government based in the capital , Kinshasa  essentially on the west coast of Africa  remains dangerously weak while war continues to rage hundreds of miles away in the thickly - forested east .
Congolese soldiers often do not receive their pay , decimating their loyalties , while various armed groups , motivated by ethnic , commercial and criminal interests , haunt the hills , preying upon civilians at will .
This has been the situation for years , and the United Nations peacekeepers have an especially difficult task because the two main tenets of their mission  protecting civilians and helping the Congolese Army wipe out rebel forces  often collide .
Recently , the peacekeepers have had to confront this predicament because of the intensity of military activity .
A joint Rwandan - Congolese offensive in January against rebel holdouts spurred brutal reprisal killings .
Then came the United Nations - backed military offensive , also intended to sweep away rebels , in which the peacekeepers helped plan the maneuvers , resupply Congolese soldiers and transport them to battle zones .
Again , hundreds of civilians were killed and thousands displaced .
According to human rights groups , it was the Congolese Army that did much of the killing .
“ Human Rights Watch documented the deliberate killing by Congolese soldiers of at least 270 civilians , ” the organization said in a November report .
It also said many of the victims were women and children , and some had been chopped to death by machete .
In November , the United Nations cut off support to a Congolese brigade blamed for massacring civilians .
But many human rights groups wanted the United Nations to go further , which was also the advice of the United Nations ’ own lawyers .
Kim Peek :
, the autistic savant who inspired the Oscar - winning film , has died , aged 58 . father Fran said that his son had suffered a major heart attack on Saturday and was pronounced dead at a hospital in Salt Lake City , Utah , the town where he had spent his life .
was probably the world 's most famous savant .
Described as a confounding mixture of disability and genius , his astonishing ability to retain knowledge inspired the writer Barry Morrow to write , the 1988 movie starring Dustin Hoffman that won four Academy Awards .
Born in 1951 in Salt Lake city , was diagnosed as severely mentally retarded and his parents were advised to place him in an institution and forget about him .
Thirty years later , he was classified as a " mega - savant , " a genius in about 15 different subjects , from history and literature and geography to numbers , sports , music and dates .
By the time of his death he had committed more than 9,000 books to memory and Nasa made him the subject of MRI - based research , hoping that technology used to study the effects of space travel on the brain would help explain his mental capabilities .
He would read eight books a day , taking just ten seconds to read a page .
He could read two pages simultaneously , his left eye reading the left page and his right eye reading the right page .
But throughout his life he still needed 24 - hour care .
Despite his great mental agility , his motor skills remained limited ; he could not perform simple tasks such as dressing himself or combing his hair .
His father Fran became his sole carer afterparent divorced in 1975 .
Fransaid that care of his son was a 30 - hour - day , 10 - day - a - week job but he did it devotedly , encouraging Kim to make the most of his abilities .
Butremained deeply introverted .
It was not until he met Dustin Hoffman , when the Hollywood star was researching his role in Rain Man , that he could look into another person 's face .
He was 37 at the time .
Dustin Hoffman advised Frannot to hide his son away .
said of that meeting : " Dustin Hoffman said to me , you have to promise me one thing about this guy , share him with the world .
And pretty soon it got so that nobody was a stranger to him , they were people , and so was he " .
He took Hoffman 's advice , putting his son on stage in front of thousands of people for whom he answered , almost always correctly , the most obscure questions they could test him with .
He thrived on his new found fame .
Mr Morrow said of him : " I love the way he 's flowered , it belies the myth that people do n't change , especially people with developmental disabilities .
" Four years before his death , said : " I was n't supposed to make it past about 14 , and yet here I am at 54 , a celebrity ! "
We geeks seem to have a peculiar attachment to quantifying things .
It 's why our games involve complicated character sheets , or score sheets or little plastic thingies for putting wedges in .
I 'd go so far as to say that , were any of us inclined to get into a bar fight , we 'd first try to calculate the other guy's hit points .
Allowing , of course for the effects of alcohol ( +2 Courage , - 3 Wisdom , Roll D20 for effects on HP and Charisma ) .
Way back in 1958 , the MIT chapter of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity used pledge Oliver R. Smoot to measure the Harvard Bridge in Massachusetts , coining the smoot as a unit of measurement in the process – one smoot equaling 5 feet , 7 inches .
Smoot ( the man ) lay down on the bridge , his position was marked , and he moved on ( or was moved on – eventually , he was so tired from the movement that his frat brothers carried him ) , until the bridge was established as being 364.4 smoots , plus or minus an ear , in length .
Appropriately , Smoot would later become chairman of the American National Standards Institute .
But not everything is measured as easily as lying down a few hundred times in a row .
In much the same way as baseball now uses the WHIP statistic , or NBA analysts are so interested in quantifying defensive play , we at GeekDad feel it 's our duty to introduce some new and pass on some existing ways of quantifying your world .
Think of us as the Bill James of nerdiness .
This is by no means an exhaustive list ; they 're just some of my favorites .
Feel free to mention your own favorites in the comments .
Milliwheaton ( Twitter followers )
Assistant Editor Matt Blum turned me on to the milliwheaton ( and inadvertently inspired this post ) – although , he points out , Dork Tower creator John Kovalic appears to be the originator of it .
In the comic , a milliwheaton is 500 followers ( calibrated , they say , the day Secretary for Geek Affairs Wil Wheaton hit 500,000 followers ) .
However , at time of writing , Wil Wheaton had 1,479,459 followers , making a milliwheaton considerably higher .
Do we recalibrate ?
I say we wait until he hits an even 1.5 million , and every half million after that .
I would be remiss , however , if I did n't mention that Twitter followers were previously measured in Coultons , based roughly on the same idea .
Milliscobles ( Tweeting activity )
Yeah , another Twitter one .
Hold on , this one gets complicated , so I 'm going to let Followcost.com explain :
" A person 's follow cost is calculated in terms of milliscobles , named after technology personality and prolific Twitterer Robert Scoble .
One milliscoble is defined as 1/1000th of the average daily Twitter status updates by Robert Scoble as of 10:09 CST September 25 , 2008 .
At that time , Scoble had tweeted 14,319 times in 675 days , for an average tweets per day of 21.21 .
Thus , one milliscoble is defined as 0.02121 tweets per day . "
Got that ?
Me neither .
Apparently overall , I rate 181.21 milliscobles , though I 've been up to shenanigans on Twitter lately , and have pushed my rating for my last 100 updates to 335.49 milliscobles .
And I honestly do n't know if that 's good or bad .
Let 's move on from the ubiquitous blue bird .
Here are nine more you should know :
Megafonzies ( coolness )
We do n't know if Professor Hubert Farnsworth , inventor of the Finglonger , coined the term ' Megafonzie . '
We can assume that one Fonzie is the amount of coolness generated by Arthur Fonzarelli but his coolometer tells us that two kids acquiring a lot of swag by dishonest means rates 40 megafonzies .
Maybe I 'm a goody - two - shoes , but that seems discordant to me .
Millihelens ( beauty )
One millihelen is enough beauty to launch one ship .
I could make a ' she floats my boat ' joke here , but I 'm bigger than that .
Incidentally , another definition of the Helen is in terms of the number of women that one woman will , on average , be more beautiful than – one Helen being the quantity of beauty required to be more beautiful than 50 million women ( the number of women estimated to have been alive in the 12th - century BC ) .
Warhols ( fame duration )
1 Warhol equals 15 minutes of fame ,
So if you 've been famous for three years , that 's just over 105 kilowarhols .
I 'm going to go out on a limb and say that there 's a critical point – varying from celebrity to celebrity – where that person has outstayed their welcome , and uh … becomes synonymous with a feminine hygiene product ( and the bag it came in ) .
In keeping with nuclear physics , I 'm happy for this to remain as k=1 ( where 'k ' is for ' Kanye ' ) .
Thaum ( magic )
In Terry Pratchett 's The Last Continent , the thaum is the unit used to quantify magic .
One thaum is the amount of mystical energy required to conjure up one small white pigeon , or three normal - sized billiard balls , and can be measured , up to one million thaums , by a thaumometer .
If there is more magic than that around , measuring it should not be your primary concern .
Sheppey ( distance )
I have to include Douglas Adams ' co-creation ( with John Lloyd ) here – It 's from The Meaning of Liff , their dictionary of things there are n't any words for yet .
All the words in the dictionary are British place names ( the Isle of Sheppey is off the Kent coast ) .
One sheppey is the closest distance at which sheep are still picturesque , and is about seven - eighths of a mile .
Hyneman ( mustache density )
I nearly called this the Burgundy , but a ) Hyneman is geekier , and b ) Ron Burgundy 's was too well trimmed to be a good indicator of density .
One hyneman is the density of Jamie Hyneman 's mustache in the first episode of Mythbusters .
My attempted beard from earlier this year could only really be measured in millihynemans , which is why I do n't have it anymore .
Emmett ( power )
1 emmett = 1.21 gigawatts , or the amount of power required to operated the flux capacitor in a modified DeLorean DMC - 12 .
GeekDad note – when describing the emmett , it 's pronounced ' jigga ' watt .
There was briefly some debate as to whether this should be called a ' lloyd ' or a ' docbrown ' ,
But for simplicity ( and to honor the character rather than the actor – though do n't get me wrong , Christopher Lloyd rocks ) I 've gone for ' emmett . '
DDN ( diaper difficulty number )
I 'm proposing , seeing as we 've probably all argued with our spouses at some point over who has changed the " worst " diapers , a way of settling this argument .
I figure there are five factors at play here , and for the purposes of this exercise , we need only talk about , um … number two :
Odor - ranked one to 10 , where one is barely noticeable and 10 is concentrated evil .
Viscosity - Again , ranked one to 10 but I can't emphasize this enough – if you 're reading this at lunch , skip to the next one .
Ready ?
OK .
Dry and solid , good .
Sticky and liquid , bad .
Extrapolate from there .
Leakage -
Not always a factor , depending on the quality of the diaper , and how quickly you get to it , but if all you have is the emergency cheap one and you have to get through a shopping center to the change room , you 're probably going to have to score high .
Anything that requires a full change of clothes ?
Bonus points .
If you need to change clothes too , you automatically win the argument .
Baby movement – Depending on how giddy our little guy is , he might cooperate , he might kick , or he might try to escape halfway through .
Score one to 10 accordingly .
Location – I 've never had to change my son on a moving train , or in a moving car .
My wife has .
Score zero if the change occurs on a clean , level , ample - sized change mat .
Increase your score accordingly .
Once you have your scores , weight them accordingly – I 'll take a foul odor over leaky and liquid , for example , so I 'd multiply the odor number by 0.75 and the other two by 1.25 – add them up , and there 's your DDN .
Argument solved .
You ’re welcome .
Frinks ( geekiness )
I 'm sure I 'll take a lot of flak for this , but take it as a suggestion , at least – a standard unit of geekiness called the frink , and that it be measured on the ' Hoyvin - Glayvin ' scale .
Simpsons fans wo n't need to ask why .
To figure out where you fall on the Hoyvin - Glayvin Scale , I 've compiled a handy reference :
0 Frinks – thought the JockDad April Fool 's Prank was a good direction for this blog .
10 Frinks – believes Greedo fired first .
20 Frinks – you 're the family friend who " knows " computers .
30 Frinks – on Twitter , but only following Ashton and Oprah .
40 Frinks – you do n't hate sci - fi , but do n't have an opinion on things like Kirk vs. Picard either .
50 Frinks –
You 're the family friend who actually does know computers .
You probably watch the Battlestar Galactica reruns , too .
60 Frinks – Solidly geeky .
Almost stereotypically so .
70 Frinks – Geeky enough to know geeks do n't like fitting into stereotypes .
80 Frinks –
You 've probably attended several cons , contemplated which dice to bring to the game , and own at least one Starfleet / Colonial Fleet / Galactic Empire uniform .
90 Frinks –
It 's been a long time since you told a joke that did n't reference C# , Linux or the Dune saga .
100 Frinks – Are n't you Dr. Sheldon Cooper ?
Many thanks to fellow GeekDads Matt , Kevin , Chuck and Z for the help on this list .
Is French flattery of stars just holding on to past ?
The age of flattery that flourished at the court of Versailles was supposed to have ended when the tumbrels rolled in the Revolution 200 years ago , but Hugh Schofield wonders whether it really did .
Johnny Hallyday has been active since the 1960s
It was the films that got me thinking .
Once a month or so , I manage to overcome my reservations and go back and watch one of the new releases from the production factory which is French cinema .
And every month I emerge numbed and exasperated and vowing never , ever to go through the experience again .
Take one picture I saw recently - which unsurprisingly has not made it beyond French shores - called Le code a change ( The Code Has Changed ) .
It was supposed to be a bitter - sweet comedy of manners dissecting the lives and loves of a group of invitees to a dinner party .
What we got was two hours of inconsequential , plotless twaddle , all set in a world suspiciously similar , one suspects , to the one inhabited by the director and her close friends , but not by anyone else outside of the Paris in - crowd .
Or take the comedy Le Vilain ( The Villain ) which has just come out .
It is billed as an offbeat caper in which a bank robber takes refuge with his mum , only to find that she is a bit of an odd 'un herself .
It had some well known actors and the cinematography was no doubt exemplary , but my 14 - year - old daughter and I both agreed , on emerging , that there was one minor drawback : it was n't funny .
' Obsequiousness '
Now having a go at French film is an easy game so that is not the point of this essay .
My point is that - in both these cases - what we had been led to believe was that these films were actually pretty remarkable .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's biggest problem at the Elysee , so they say , is the yes - men who only tell him what they think he wants to hear
It was not just the listings magazines or the internet puff sites that gave them a big hand .
It was the serious critics in Le Monde , Le Figaro and elsewhere , who used adjectives like hilarious , tender , burlesque , complex , original .
In fact , when one looks around , one realises that there is an unusual level of flattery - one might even say obsequiousness - in French public life , especially when it comes to culture .
If you have ever watched French television , you will get the picture .
A typical mid-evening programme is a chat show on which the invitees are members of the small , unchanging - and therefore ageing - club of national celebrities .
Behind in rows of seats , a youthful audience hand - picked for telegenic good looks bursts into applause at every anecdote or hackneyed clip from the archives .
At the more serious end of the market , the annual literary season is in September , when there is a rush of new publications and the big book prizes like the Goncourt are announced .
Here , too , listening to the reviews is like being beaten about the head with a powder puff .
Nothing is ever mediocre , let alone bad .
Everything is uplifting , exquisite , crafted , delicate , challenging , or that most irritating of French words : " engage " , which means " committed " , though to what is never spelled out .
One could take this further and look at the way politics too is infected by the sycophancy bug .
Conservatism Certainly as far as the presidency is concerned , there is never any shortage of what the French call flagorneurs which means toadies or , more obscenely , leche - culs ( lecher means to lick ) .
One realises after a while that the French view their stars almost as members of the family
Nicolas Sarkozy may be reviled by the Paris intelligentsia - which he is - but at the Elysee , so they say , his biggest problem is the yes - men who only tell him what they think he wants to hear .
So what is this all about ?
Is it all just a relic from the ancien regime : those lower down the pecking order fawning on those above ?
Well , up to a point .
Actually , when it comes to French culture , I think it is more complicated .
The French collude in the over - praising for two reasons , one good , one bad .
The good reason is that they are genuinely fond of their culture .
I may not have found Le Vilain funny , but a lot of people in the audience were in stitches .
One realises after a while that the French view their stars almost as members of the family .
They enjoy going to see them in the same way they enjoy catching up with the latest family gossip .
That kind of conservatism is actually quite refreshing after the brutal neophilia ( the constant need for the new and the culling of everything that is familiar ) that one associates with British culture .
The bad reason is that it is all about self - protection .
Succumbing to sycophancy , after all , is a way of reassuring oneself that all is good in the world , when clearly it is not .
Seen like that , the French are merely deluding themselves that their culture matters the way it once did : sticking their fingers in their ears , if you like , and whistling to Johnny Hallyday .

The return of the swine flu , this time with a vengeance , has officials bracing for a flu season much worse than the normal ones when 5 percent to 20 percent of the population gets sick , with some ending up in hospitals and others even dying .
Last week ’s declaration of a national emergency by the president , after a panel he appointed projected that the H1N1 virus could infect half the U.S. population this fall and winter , has resulted in a new push by labor and its allies for guaranteed sick days .
At a rally backing a paid sick days measure in New York City , Mike Fishman , president of 32 BJ Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , said , “ When union doormen get sick , they can take off because they have sick days .
But if you are a security officer in the city you are going to be at work if you are sick , because you cannot afford to take the day off without pay . ”
Unions see the fight for paid sick days as integral to any national strategy to protect public health during the swine flu epidemic .
Federal statistics show that almost 40 percent of all flu cases are transmitted in schools and workplaces .
The Centers for Disease Control says sick workers should stay home and remain there for 24 hours after their fever subsides .
Unions are quick to point out , however , that the CDC recommendation is impossible to carry out because half of all workers in the nation are not able to take even one paid sick day when ill .
Only a third of all workers who have sick children are able to take a paid day .
“ I see it all the time , ” an emergency room nurse at Cook County Hospital in Illinois said .
“ Mothers and fathers are worried to death when they come here , not just about the fever their child has but about how much pay they are going to lose and whether they might lose their job altogether because they have to take care of that child . ”
Last May President Obama said , in one of his weekly radio talks , “ We urge employers to allow infected employees to take as many paid sick days as necessary . ”
Unions believe that with the lack of state and federal standards mandating paid sick days , the president ’s good intentions will not go far enough to solve the problem .
They are coming forward with solutions on various levels .
Cincinnati Federation of Teachers Local 1520 recently won a contract that allows members to take sick time for exposure to contagious disease and use five days of sick time in advance in any given pay period .
Unions say , however , that regulatory changes are needed .
Such changes in regulations were proposed recently to protect federal workers from the spread of communicable diseases by expanding sick leave .
Under the proposed changes , federal workers could use sick time to care for themselves or a family member due to exposure to a communicable disease , whether or not they display symptoms .
Federal employees would also be able to use in advance up to 30 days of sick time due to their own exposure , or 13 days for a family member ’s exposure .
The proposed policy is the type of policy unions all over the country will begin bargaining for , say officials at the AFL - CIO .
San Francisco guarantees paid sick days for its workers , and unions , like SEIU in New York , are joining with community allies to fight for similar policies elsewhere .
The Labor Project for Working Families has set up a web site to help unions get involved in local campaigns for paid sick days , at www.working-families.org.

A New York SEO company can supply you with expert insight into the many web marketing techniques that will help your business succeed .
In this article , we ’ll take a look at how one company in particular has used its highly specialized SEO tools to help its clients obtain winning results with their SEO campaigns .
You can too , use some of these tips to increase your conversion rates and personal injury lawsuits .
The first step is knowing what SEO is and what it is not .
SEO is the umbrella term for search engine optimization , which means that it involves the use of various search engine strategies to improve the ranking of a website ’s pages on Google or any other search engine to ensure higher placement .
This can also involve implementing various marketing strategies to enhance website visibility in search results .
So it can be useful to put SEO marketing strategies in terms that are easy to understand for your audience .
This means that if you are a personal injury lawyer , your client ’s advertising and marketing should be designed to target people who are looking for an attorney .
Similarly , if you are a builder with a website and a blog , you could consider employing a keyword - optimized advertising campaign that would be targeted at people who are looking for new building materials .
For lawyers , there are plenty of uses for SEO .
As a matter of fact , most online clients have never heard of the term , so a successful advertising campaign should be based on this simple strategy .
For personal injury attorneys , SEO plays a crucial role in ensuring that their clients are seen by as many potential clients as possible .
By creating advertisements and marketing strategies that are useful and effective , they can increase their business , increase their client base , and help their business grow and thrive .
Another reason why it ’s important to have a good understanding of SEO marketing is that it can help you reduce costs .
One of the more significant benefits of an SEO marketing campaign is that it requires only a fraction of the money needed to conduct a traditional marketing campaign .
Therefore , it ’s vital that you take a good look at what your potential clients are looking for and design your marketing strategies accordingly .
Just as lawyers , building contractors , and other professionals should have a basic understanding of SEO , it ’s also necessary for them to be familiar with the tools and resources available to them .
If you ’re not well versed in SEO techniques , you ’ll need to find a resource to teach you the ins and outs of effective search engine optimization .
As mentioned above , the good news is that there are many quality tools available to help you learn the basics of search engine optimization .
These days , if you have trouble locating someone who can teach you SEO , there are plenty of tools on the market that can help you quickly master the art of search engine optimization .
These tools allow you to see just how much the search engines like Google value your website ’s placement .
Once you ’re familiar with the value of a page on the search engines , you can leverage your website ’s rankings in order to increase your client base .
When it comes to building personal injury cases , SEO is extremely helpful because it allows you to focus on your main goal instead of simply “ making money . ”
An easy way to think about it is that the objective of this kind of marketing campaign is to get as many viewers as possible to view your client ’s website .
If you can convince more people to view your website , then the likelihood that you ’ll succeed is very high .
In order to achieve these goals , an SEO marketing campaign will need to be focused on several strategies .
Keyword - optimization is the first step .
The next step is in - depth research about the particular area in which your client practices law , and the overall situation or cause of that cause .
Then , after you ’ve done your research , you should conduct a search on Google for the specific topic of your website and the name of your client ’s law firm .
client , as well as people who might be in a position to make a substantial contribution to the case .
Another very important component of a successful SEO campaign is optimization for the content on your website .
Using keywords within your website content will increase your chances of being ranked high in search results .
On Saturday , the Sun-Sentinel 's Steve Gorten remarked in his blog that Florida coach Pete DeBoer has finally parted the Booth " will - he - or - wo n 't - he " seas , amid yet another push - back in the prized winger 's projected return to the lineup - now set for late January :
" ... Obviously David Booth is a wild - card factor [ to the club 's success ] whether or not he comes back . "
- Coach DeBoer
Gorten then wisely made abundantly clear that the coach did not say # 10 is out for the year , only observing the team is beginning a softening of their approach , perhaps more realistically , to the status of David Booth , at least publicly .
Does this pave the way for an announcement in the near future ?
I do n't necessarily see it that way ; time is on the organization 's hands , as today represents the mid-point of the season .
For the moment , I completely agree with the guesstimation offered up at On Frozen Pond :
I would n't be surprised to see them burn off the final two weeks of February and bring Booth back after the Olympic break in March -- if at all .
- Miami Herald 's George Richards
Putting aside the sheer lousiness of the entire situation regarding Florida 's leading goal scorer from a year ago , the question at some juncture must turn to the business aspect of the club : just what will GM Randy Sexton and his front office staff do to replace that lost offense for the remainder of a season which is by no means cooked ?
The answer is in the details , and not so veiled .
Once more , back to Pistol Pete via the Sun-Sentinel :
The group we have if we can remain healthy ... I think we 're really close to winning some games .
- DeBoer
And there you have it .
Of course , it 's the coach 's job to win with what he 's given by management , and his comment is strictly party - line talking - point .
But is it remotely factual ?
Generally speaking , the club is healthy ; only Booth , rookie defenseman Dmitry Kulikov , and plugger Kenndal McArdle remain out .
Cory Stillman has returned , which may reignite a second line which has been dreadfully AWOL since he was lost so many weeks ago .
Nick Tarnasky taken his place on a formidable checking line with Victor Oreskovich and Gregory Campbell .
However , Kamil Kreps and Campbell continue to literally shoot blanks ( a combined 19 SOG , 1g - 1a over their past five ) , backup goaltender Scott Clemmensen has suffered massive consistency issues , and Rostislav Olesz continues to impersonate Rostislav Olesz .
If that second line can pick up where it left off upon Stillman 's inital absence - and the Horton - Weiss - Frolik triumvirate can keep their fire stoked - then DeBoer might have himself some substance to those words .
It 's a mighty large " if " , though .
So many close games , so many " it 's frustrating " comments seeping from the dressing room after another third period meltdown .
The Panthers were never going to win the conference simply because of David Booth 's presence , much less squeak into the postseason , without a dedicated , talented core around him .
But he 's so much a part of the puzzle , what does management do to fill that hole ?
Ransacking Rochester will only be effective for so long ( if .500 hockey can be termed " effective " ) .
Welcome to the future , where you can read up on what anyone you have ever known is having for lunch !

Social networking may be fun and even useful at times , but it ’s also amazingly pointless most of the time .
Â
Of course , this has led to every university and corporation trying to get in on the fun .
A site involving badger AI that randomly attacked your profile could be fun , indeed .

It would sort of be like those zombie and vampire games people play on Facebook , but only less annoying .
Pain is not just a physical sensation .
It is related to both the body and the mind .
The way in which pain is felt has to do with emotions , personality , lifestyle , genetics and previous experiences .
Although there are so strong pains that do not even let you think , one of the most famous is the toothache , if you have one of those better or try and go with one of the dentists in Tijuana Mexico .
One way to deal with chronic conditions , or almost any other type of physical ailment , is to modify the mental perception of pain .
This allows to increase the threshold of tolerance and , therefore , to diminish the need to resort to medicines that can generate secondary effects and even addiction .
This is why the Harvard Medical School recommends a series of mental techniques to help fight pain .
Scientific studies confirm that mindfulness is effective in dealing with pain .
1.- Mindfulness
This technique basically involves concentrating on the present without making any judgment .
For many , the first impulse in the face of pain is to try to “ take it away ” in any way .
In the case of mindfulness to control pain , however , what is sought is to approach the sensation and learn to know it by “ observing ” it objectively .
The idea is to focus on the moment you are in , avoiding past and future worries .
This is done by considering elements such as the following : where does what it feels start ?
Does it change as time goes by ?
How can you describe it ?
2.- Deep breathing
This technique is fundamental for the rest of the alternatives that can be used to help manage pain .
It consists of inhaling deeply for a few seconds and then exhaling .
Words or phrases can be used to help maintain concentration and rhythm of breathing .
For example , every time you inhale , you can say : “ welcome relaxation ” .
As you exhale , “ goodbye negativity . ”
Visualizing a place that is associated with tranquility also helps .
3.- Meditation and visualization
In this case , the process begins with attention to breathing following the technique referred to above .
This is done in an atmosphere of total relaxation , without distracting stimuli or noise , with background music that invokes that feeling .
Additionally , we think of a place that is associated with tranquility , peace and pleasure .
A beach , with the sound of the waves .
Birds singing in a bucolic landscape .
If the mind is distracted and begins to think about other things , it brings back the image that evokes tranquility .
4.- Concentration and positivism
Choosing an activity that you enjoy is another option .
It can be anyone who generates taste and pleasure : reading poetry , hiking in green spaces , cooking , gardening .
The objective is to concentrate in an absolute way on what is being done and pay attention to the minimum details , noticing how the senses react and what are the sensations that they feel .
When the person is not well , he usually thinks only of what he can not do .
Directing that attention to what can be done helps stop thinking about pain .
Keeping a diary and regularly writing down the reasons or things you ’re grateful for is a way to do it .
Concentrating on an activity that you enjoy , such as gardening , can alleviate the ailment .
5- Generate the relaxation response
It is the antidote to the stress that generates pain .
It allows to control the increase in the heart beat and the reactions of the organism , which becomes alert when stressed .
In this case , the first thing is to close the eyes and relax all the muscles of the body .
Next , attention is paid to breathing .
If the thoughts start to appear , you have to resort to the word “ recharge ” to return to concentrate on breathing .
In this process , 10 to 20 minutes are spent .
Subsequently , the return of thoughts is allowed .
Finally , the eyes open .
Extended discard support means that Linux now supports ATA TRIM , which can increase SSD lifespan and throughput .
New additions to the Linux kernel include HA solution DRBD and drivers for HP , LSI and VMware storage hardware .
The new kernel version , expected in early March , also includes many minor improvements to the code for the Btrfs , Ext4 and ReiserFS file systems .
At the end of last week , Linus Torvalds released the fifth pre-release version of Linux version 2.6.33 , with the final release expected in 4 to 5 weeks time .
At this stage in the development cycle , it is usually predominantly more minor changes and fixes which find their way into the main development tree .
Kernel hackers do , however , make occasional exceptions for drivers .
Linux 2.6.33 -rc5 sees the addition to the kernel of a V4L / DVB driver which supports the Mantis chip - set used in a range of TV cards .
However , the changes to the V4L / DVB subsystem in Linux 2.6.33 are the subject of a future article in the " Coming in 2.6.33 " series .
Following on from the first article in the 2.6.33 series , which looked at networking changes , this article examines file systems changes and changes to the kernel 's storage subsystem .
Trimming
For several months , some sections of the kernel have included a rudimentary discard infrastructure , which allows drivers for mass storage adaptors to determine whether storage areas on a disk are free – as a result , for example , of deleting a file or formatting a partition .
This has been revised and extended in 2.6.33 .
The result is that the Libata subsystem now also supports discards and can forward information on free storage areas to mass storage devices using the ATA TRIM command .
This is especially useful for SSDs ( Solid State Drives ) , as sending the internal controller information on free storage areas , allows the controller to optimise internal garbage collector .
This increases both SSD performance and SSD lifespan .
For the discard infrastructure to achieve maximum impact , the storage subsystem needs to send the free area information to other parts of the kernel .
The Btrfs file system has been able to do this since Linux 2.6.32 and appropriate code has also now been added for Ext4 .
Since this has not yet been fully tested , this function will for now remain deactivated by default .
The new discard support in the code for the FAT file system is also optional .
Replicated
After leaving DRBD ( Distributed Replicated Block Device ) , largely developed by Vienna - based company Linbit , out in the cold in 2.6.32 , kernel hackers have finally merged the replication solution , used predominantly in high availability environments , into Linux 2.6.33 .
DRBD can be roughly understood as a network - based RAID 1 device .
The drive or drives on one system , designated as the master , are mirrored on a slave system , in real time .
Should the master fail , the slave takes over with no downtime .
In order to ensure that data remains synchronised at all times , the master considers write access to be complete only when the slave has also completed the write .
A detailed explanation of DRBD can be found a LWN . net article and in documentation on the DRBD website .
Over recent months and years , a number of groups have worked on solutions for limiting the maximum amount of data which individual processes or groups of processes can write to or read from drives .
These solutions affect various points within the kernel .
The ' blkio controller cgroup interface ' ( blkio for short ) , which links into the CFQ ( Completely Fair Queuing ) I/ O Scheduler , has come out with its nose in front .
This does not represent the failure of other approaches , however , rather it is intended to offer a foundation for further enhancements and functions made possible by some of the competing solutions .
Background information on this topic can be found in a LWN .
net article and in the documentation for the blkio framework .
Optimised
Developers have removed the anticipatory I /O scheduler ( AS ) , which , according to the commit comments , offers only a subset of the functions offered by the CFQ scheduler .
The latter , which has long been the standard in many distributions , is now also described as being suitable for desktop and server environments .
Like the process scheduler , almost every Linux version contains numerous changes optimising the CFQ I/O scheduler for specific application scenarios .
Details can be found in the links in the ' Minor gems ' section at the end of this article and in the main git pull request from block subsystem maintainer Jens Axboe .
Improvements have been made to the code for migrating software RAIDs managed using mdadm to a different level .
The MD subsystem now also supports write barriers .
These ensure that data and file system journals are written in the sequence expected by other parts of the kernel .
This should ensure better file system integrity in the event of a crash , but can palpably reduce throughput , as MD maintainer Neil Brown notes in his main git pull request .
Support for write barriers in the device mapper ( DM ) has also been extended ( git pull request ) .
This now offers a ' merge target ' ( e. g. 1 , 2 ) , which can restore systems to a previous snapshot following , for example , a problematic system update ( LWN.net article ) .
Drivers
The IDE subsystem drivers are now officially classed as deprecated .
Users are advised to switch to the Libata subsystem PATA drivers , which have long been in the kernel and are no longer classed as experimental ( 1 , 2 ) .
In 2.6.33 , these contain numerous minor enhancements and corrections , some originating from Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz , who , until a few months ago , maintained the IDE subsystem .
The SCSI subsystem contains two new drivers : 3w - sas for the LSI 3 ware 9750 and vmw_pvscsi for the virtual hardware seen by guest systems under some VMware hypervisors .
New smart array controllers from HP can now be addressed both by the block subsystem 's cciss driver , which has seen various enhancements in 2.6.33 , and by the new hpsa driver .
The latter , being part of the SCSI subsystem , like all other SCSI and Libata drivers provides a standard device ( / dev/sdx ) for access .
Other new entries in this week 's kernel include the pm8001 driver for SAS / SATA HBAs containing the PMC Sierra SPC 8001 chip .
Miscellaneous
A few further file system and storage code related changes :
According to main developer Chris Mason 's main git pull request for 2.6.33 , Btrfs , the experimental ' next generation file system for Linux ' - elect , saw primarily minor enhancements and fixes in 2.6.33 .
Ext4 , which is based on the Ext2 and Ext3 file system code , can now mount Ext2 and Ext3 file systems .
This allows environments which require the smallest possible kernel image to save a little space .
Distributed file system Ceph was put forward for merger into 2.6.33 .
Torvalds has , however , chosen to omit it for now , explaining that this was partly due to time constraints and partly because there was not enough noise from kernel developers and distributors in favour of it .
Background information can be found in this article on LWN.net .
Although the ReiserFS code has long lacked an official maintainer , one developer has still taken the trouble to significantly reduce use of the big kernel lock ( BKL ) in the ReiserFS code .
This should make the file system more scalable and in some cases a little more fleet of foot .
Some of the more important changes in nilfs2 are described in the git pull request from nilfs2 maintainer Ryusuke Konishi .
Virtual File System ( VFS ) now correctly implements O_SYNC .
Once again , further details can be found on LWN.net .
There has been major restructuring work on the XFS file system code to replace XFS ' own tracing code with code which uses the kernel 's own tracing structure .
This is itself relatively new , but has been developed substantially over the last year .
Minor gems
Many further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below , which contains the commit headers referring to the respective change .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commit in the web front end of the Git branch for the kernel sources maintained by Linus Torvalds at kernel.org .

Snowboarder Kevin Pearce remains in critical condition at the University of Utah Hospital after a head injury sustained while training in the halfpipe at Park City , Utah , for this week 's Olympics qualifier at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area .
Pearce was completing a cab double cork -- a twisting double back flip maneuver he 's landed before -- when he caught his toe - side edge while landing .
Though Pearce , 22 , was wearing a helmet , he hit his head above one of his eyes and was knocked unconscious .
“ Kevin sustained a severe traumatic brain injury .
He is currently in intensive care and in critical condition , but stable and has not needed to undergo surgery at this time .
He is intubated and being kept sedated , " Holly Ledyard , a neurointensivist who is one of Pearce 's doctors , said in a statement issued Saturday and posted on the Facebook page family members created .
" The focus over the next week will be watching for any swelling in his brain and keeping his brain pressure normal .
Kevin has a long recovery ahead of him , ” said Ledyard .
Outposts will post updates on Pearce as information becomes available .

Sales of previously owned homes nationwide plunged steeply in December , raising concerns that the housing recovery could lose steam after government policies intended to support it expire in the spring .
For now , California appears to be bucking the downward trend .
U.S. sales in December fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.45 million units , down 16.7 % from November , the National Assn. of Realtors said Monday .
It was the biggest drop in the 42 years that the group has been measuring home sales and comes after first - time home buyers raced to close on their purchases before a federal tax credit of up to $ 8,000 for first - time purchasers was set to expire Nov. 30 .
Congress in early November extended the deadline to April 30 and expanded the credit to include up to $ 6,500 for some buyers who already own homes .
The renewal did n’t pull in as many buyers in December , with first - time buyers declining to 43 % of all buyers in December from 51 % in November , according to a survey by the Realtors group .

“ People bought homes in October and November thinking that the tax credit would expire at the end of November , and therefore the decline in December is just a reflection of that , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ It does highlight a broader point that the housing market is on government life support , and when it is taken off that support , it weakens . ”
A slew of federal policies -- including the tax incentives for buyers , low interest rates driven down by Federal Reserve actions and increased access to mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration -- bolstered the nation ’s housing recovery last year .
But those props eventually will end :
The tax credits expire in April , many economists expect interest rates to rise again this year and the FHA is tightening its lending standards .
The question remains whether home sales and prices will fall without the government ’s help .
Lawrence Yun , chief economist of the Realtors association , said home sales were likely to pick up again in April once the new deadline approached , but the outlook beyond that was unclear as a potential new wave of foreclosures and stubborn unemployment could stymie any recovery .

“ By early summer , the overall market should benefit from more balanced inventory , and sales are on track to rise again in 2010 , ” Yun said in a statement .
“ However , the job market remains a concern and could dampen the housing recovery -- job creation is key to a continued recovery in the second half of the year . ”
The national median price for all previously owned homes was $ 178,300 in December , 1.5 % higher than in December 2008 .
The median is the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less .
Sales for the full year increased 4.9 % to 5.16 million compared with 2008 , the first annual gain since 2005 .
Housing in California appears to be faring better than the rest of the nation despite higher unemployment .

Sales of previously owned homes in the West fell 4.8 % in December from November , compared with a decline of 19.5 % in the Northeast , a 25.8 % drop in the Midwest and a decline of 16.3 % in the South , the national group said .
In California , resales rose 4 % from the previous month , according to figures released last week by the California Assn. of Realtors .
A separate report by the research firm MDA DataQuick of San Diego , which tracks sales of all homes , also showed the Southern California , San Francisco Bay Area and statewide housing markets gaining ground in December .
“ Particularly in California , there is a lot of investor demand for a lot of the foreclosed properties and short sales , ” or homes sold for less than the value of their mortgages , Zandi of Moody ’s Economy.com said .

“ It goes to a different psychology in much of the California market , ” he said , “ where I think home buyers are conditioned to believe that if they buy in times like these , when prices are low , they will be rewarded in the long run . ”
Glenn Kelman , chief executive of the online brokerage Redfin , said the Los Angeles area posted strong sales in December as well as the first two weeks of January .
“ The December uptick in rates freaked out buyers a little bit and got them moving again , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ If rates keep going up , at some point buyers wo n’t be motivated ; they ’ll just be scared off .
But at least for the first half of January , we saw more people than we ever have ask to go on their first home tours with us , which is an early but fairly reliable indicator of strong demand . ”
Robert Kleinhenz , deputy chief economist for the state Realtors group , said another reason for the state ’s progress was that buying a home has become increasingly affordable relative to household income in the state over the last few years .
According to the group ’s affordability index , 64 % of households could afford to buy a home at the end of the third quarter of last year compared with a historic low of only 26 % in the second quarter of 2006 .

“ We had much steeper price declines than what occurred nationally , and I think that has been continuing to drive sales , ” he said .
“ Our affordability factors are much , much better than just a few years ago , and , relatively speaking , that improvement was far more dramatic here in California . ”

This is a surprise .
Professor Mike Hulme of the University of East Anglia suggests that the “ I.P.C.C. has run its course ” .
I agree with him .
We really need to remove a wholly political organization , the United Nations , from science .
Republished from New York Times Reporter Andrew Revkin’s Dot Earth :
Dot Earth : Insights from Mike Hulme at the University of East Anglia , which was the source of the disclosed files .
Hulme , a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia and author of “ Why We Disagree About Climate Change , ” has weighed in with these thoughts about the significance of the leaked files and emails .
In November 2009 , Hulme was listed as “ the 10th most cited author in the world in the field of climate change , between 1999 and 2009 .
( ScienceWatch , Nov/ Dec 2009 , see Table 2 ) .
Hulme Key Excerpt :
[ Upcoming UN climate conference in Copenhagen ] “ is about raw politics , not about the politics of science . [… ]
It is possible that climate science has become too partisan , too centralized .
The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures ; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science .
It is also possible that the institutional innovation that has been the I.P.C.C. has run its course .
Yes , there will be an AR5 but for what purpose ?
The I.P.C.C. itself , through its structural tendency to politicize climate change science , has perhaps helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production – just at a time when a globalizing and wired cosmopolitan culture is demanding of science something much more open and inclusive .
Full Hulme Statement :
The key lesson to be learned is that not only must scientific knowledge about climate change be publicly owned — the I.P.C.C. does a fairly good job of this according to its own terms — but the very practices of scientific enquiry must also be publicly owned , in the sense of being open and trusted .
From outside , and even to the neutral , the attitudes revealed in the emails do not look good .
To those with bigger axes to grind it is just what they wanted to find .
This will blow its course soon in the conventional media without making too much difference to Copenhagen — after all , COP15 is about raw politics , not about the politics of science .
But in the Internet worlds of deliberation and in the ‘ mood ’ of public debate about the trustworthiness of climate science , the reverberations of this episode will live on long beyond COP15 .
Climate scientists will have to work harder to earn the warranted trust of the public – and maybe that is no bad thing .
But this episode might signify something more in the unfolding story of climate change .
This event might signal a crack that allows for processes of re-structuring scientific knowledge about climate change .
It is possible that some areas of climate science has become sclerotic .
It is possible that climate science has become too partisan , too centralized .
The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures ; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science .
It is also possible that the institutional innovation that has been the I.P.C.C. has run its course .
Yes , there will be an AR5 but for what purpose ?

There 's speculation the US confectionery giant Hershey plans to bid for Cadbury .
But is there a transatlantic sweet tooth divide , and might we end up with more " American - tasting " chocolate ?
Chocolate maker Cadbury is defending itself against a £ 10bn hostile takeover bid from the American produce giant Kraft Foods .
The British firm has urged shareholders to reject Kraft 's bid , and is now in talks with fellow confectioner Hershey , with which it has business links .
But why should we care ?
Brits love chocolate .
We munched through £ 3.5 bn worth of the stuff last year .
So it is no wonder the prospect of an American takeover of a company considered by many to be our chocolate - maker in chief , is souring taste buds on this side of the Atlantic .
People get very patriotic about chocolate
Tim Richardson British contemporary tastes in chocolate date back to the early 1900s .
The Cadbury favourite , Dairy Milk , was first produced in 1905 and has remained relatively unchanged ever since .
Chocolate , more than most foods , provokes an emotional response and childhood memories make us loyal to brands , says Tim Richardson , author of Sweets : A History of Temptation .
As a nation , we hold these loyalties dear , and have a " long and distinguished history with chocolate " , says Sarah Jayne Stanes , director of the Academy of Culinary Arts .
As a result , Brits have become " snobbish " about their guilty pleasure , says Ms Stanes , and this fostered an intense chocolate patriotism that could be threatened by an American takeover .
And for many a loyal British chocoholic the word " Hershey " will set the alarm bells ringing .
Grittier Anyone who has performed a chocolate taste test will know that compared with its British counterpart , American chocolate has a distinctly different flavour .
To many , Hershey 's chocolate has a more bitter , less creamy taste than its British equivalent , and seems to have a grittier texture .
It all comes down to what exactly chocolate is .
In the UK , chocolate must contain at least 20 % cocoa solids .
In the US , on the other hand , cocoa solids need only make up 10 % .
A Cadbury Dairy Milk bar contains 23 % cocoa solids , whereas a Hershey bar contains just 11 % .
US chocolate has 10 % cocoa solids Much of Europe would scoff at either definition .
The continental preference is for richer , darker chocolate , with a significantly higher cocoa solid count .
Many European chocolatiers make chocolate with upwards of 40 % cocoa solids , a world away from our elevenses bar from the newsagent .
But the cocoa content is n't the only thing which separates British chocolate from its American namesake .
The chocolate making process differs from the grinding of the first bean .
Though confectioners keep their recipes a firm secret , it is believed that American chocolate typically uses South American beans , whilst British makers favour West African cocoa .
There are also variations on the type of powdered milk used , which can impact the flavour .
A typical Hershey bar also has more sugar than a bar of Dairy Milk , and , crucially perhaps , its ingredients list contains the additive PGPR , which can act in place of the more expensive cocoa butter .
American candy bars are typically cheaper than in Britain , which might go some way to explaining the differences .
Pod to palate
But with a Hershey takeover of Cadbury a possibility , could the Americans view the UK as a potential market for its own brand of chalky - tasting chocolate ?
Mr Richardson says sweet - toothed Brits should relax - the likelihood of America dabbling with Britain 's tried and trusted confectionery tastes are remote .
Another expert , David Jago , of consumer research analysts Mintel , says there may not be much to gain by marketing Hershey in the UK , as " many UK consumers have relatively little idea what US chocolate brands such as Hershey 's taste like " .
Rather , a Hershey takeover could lead the Americans to take advantage of Cadbury 's international presence , says Mr Jago .
The American trip from pod to palate is altogether different than in the UK .
But for now Cadbury remains in British hands , and our chocolate will remain just as we like it .

The U.S. jobless rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 10 % in November , the first decline in three months , but the government ’s broader measure of unemployment tumbled even more , falling 0.3 point to 17.2 % .
The comprehensive gauge of labor underutilization , known as the “ U - 6 ” for its data classification by the Labor Department , accounts for people who have stopped looking for work or who ca n’t find full - time jobs .
Though the drop is a sign of improvement , the rate ’s continuing divergence from the official number ( the “ U - 3 ” unemployment measure ) indicates the job market has a long way to go before growth in the economy translates into relief for workers .
The 10 % unemployment rate is calculated based on people who are without jobs , who are available to work and who have actively sought work in the prior four weeks .
The “ actively looking for work ” definition is fairly broad , including people who contacted an employer , employment agency , job center or friends ; sent out resumes or filled out applications ; or answered or placed ads , among other things .
The U - 6 figure includes everyone in the official rate plus “ marginally attached workers ” — those who are neither working nor looking for work , but say they want a job and have looked for work recently ; and people who are employed part - time for economic reasons , meaning they want full - time work but took a part - time schedule instead because that ’s all they could find .
In the coming months , the U - 6 measure may be an important signal for the labor market .
Even though it posted a decline this month , the official jobless rate is likely to rise or at least hold steady through the first half of next year as more people return to the job market .
That means Americans who now fall into the U - 6 category , for stopping their job searches due to discouragement , will eventually fall into the U - 3 category as they restart their job hunt .
A U - 6 figure that converges toward the official rate ( even an official rate that ’s above 10 % ) could indicate improving confidence in the labor market and the overall economy .
This month indicates a start toward convergence , but real progress could be months away .
The Second Wave is Already Ashore
The second wave of ARM resets and foreclosures might come sooner than you think .
According to Whitney Tilson and Glenn Tongue of T2 Partners , the experts on this subject , about 80 % of option ARMs are negatively amortizing .
Meaning these so - called top - tier borrowers are heading further into the hole .
Once their rates reset , they could be in serious trouble .
And that could be happening very soon :
The chart above , which should look familiar , shows the two peaks in this long - term housing conundrum .
The first mountain is comprised of subprime ARM resets .
And the second is mostly constructed of option ARM resets .
We appear to be in the eye of the storm .
That alone shook our nerves when we first discovered it .
But it was a different chart in Tilson and Tongue ’s most recent presentation that really got us startled …
It ’s also the reason I ’m predicting the dollar spike in 2010 .
Instead of resetting as expected after the first five years , many option ARMs are so negatively amortized that they are hitting their automatic reset cap .
That means they are resetting early … like right now — with unemployment reaching quarter - century highs every month , and a massive number of homeowners about to receive mortgage bills for two - three times what they are used to paying .
It takes anywhere between three - 12 months for most homes to actually go into foreclosure .
It ’s tough to say exactly when the storm will come .
But my guess is the second half of 2010 .
A 90 - second clip from a home movie of Marilyn Monroe in the ' 50s , apparently smoking a large joint , has surfaced after the friend who shot the footage found it in her attic .

The best part is n't even the appearance of the joint — it 's Marilyn laughing and making " stoned " faces afterward .
Not since Anna Faris in Smiley Face has a bombshell actress looked so convincingly stoned on screen :

Back in August , I have a talk at Gnomedex , a conference about the intersection of technology and people .
It 's thrown by my old buddy Chris Pirillo .
My talk was on skepticism , and I posted some video from it a month ago .
However , the audio quality was n't great .
The good news is Chris posted the official stream from the conference , and the video and audio quality are great !
So here 's that video .
Phil !'s ZSH Prompt
In which one geek demonstrates his zsh prompt , which ( he hopes ) should serve as an example of some of the more complicated aspects of zsh .
A while back , Slashdot had an Ask Slashdot question about shell prompts .
I responded , posting a link to an earlier Kuro5hin post I had made on the subject .
Unlike that Kuro5hin post , the Slashdot post garnered some attention , so I decided to write up how my prompt works .
Since then , I 've expanded my prompt to take advantage of a lot of zsh stuff , so it should also provide examples to people curious about that sort of thing .
For the impatient , I have a screenshot and the prompt command .
For those wanting more detail , I go into it below .
My shell is zsh .
I got the initial idea for this prompt from the " termwide " prompt in the Bash Prompt HOWTO , but had to modify it to work with zsh .
Since then , I 've added other features ( some of which I 've also seen in other termwide - based prompts ) and taken more advantage of zsh 's facilities .
This prompt is now fairly zsh - specific .
Let 's start at the beginning .
function precmd {
There are a number of prompt variables I want to be set before each prompt , so I change them in the special zsh function named precmd .
This is run before the prompt is displayed .
local TERMWIDTH (( TERMWIDTH = $ {COLUMNS} - 1 ) )
local tells zsh that the given variable should be scoped to the current function .
I do n't really like cluttering namespaces .
The (( ... ) ) construct tells zsh to carry out mathematical operations .
I set the terminal width to one less that the actual width because zsh 's right - hand prompt leaves one character to its right and I want things to line up .
### # Truncate the path if it 's too long .
PR_FILLBAR= " " PR_PWDLEN= " " local promptsize= $ {#$ {(%):---( %n@%m:%l ) ---( ) -- }} local pwdsize= $ {#$ {(% ) :-%~}} if [ [ " $ promptsize + $ pwdsize " - gt $ TERMWIDTH ] ] ; then ( ( PR_PWDLEN=$TERMWIDTH - $ promptsize ) ) else PR_FILLBAR = " \$ {( l. (( $ TERMWIDTH - ( $ promptsize + $ pwdsize ) ) ) ..$ { PR_HBAR} . ) } "
fi
This little section is the one that does the width adjusting .
The variables that determine string length are ... interesting .
Working from the inside out :
$ {[ varname ] : -[ string ] } returns the value of $ {[ varname ] } normally , but uses [ string ] instead if $ {[ varname ] } does n't exist .
$ { :-[ string ] } is a quick way to do variable - related things to fixed strings .
returns the value of $ {[ varname ] } normally , but uses [ string ] instead if $ {[ varname ] } does n't exist .
is a quick way to do variable - related things to fixed strings .
$ { ( [ flags ] ) [ varname ] } uses the flags to alter how the value of the variable is handled .
The percent sign causes prompt expansion to be done on the variable .
uses the flags to alter how the value of the variable is handled .
The percent sign causes prompt expansion to be done on the variable .
So $ { ( % ) :-%~} does prompt expansion on the literal string " % ~ " .
( To get just this effect , print - p " % ~ " would work , too . )
does prompt expansion on the literal string " % ~ " .
( To get just this effect , would work , too . ) $ { # [ varname ] } gives the length of the value of the variable .
zsh appears to handle the pound sign before applying the ( % ) flag , so I had to nest the ( % ) flag in order to get things to happen in the right order .
If adding the current directory would make the prompt wider than the terminal , I just set $ PR_PWDLEN to the length it should be and let zsh truncate it .
The actual prompt contains the string %$ PW_PWDLEN <...<%~%<< .
When zsh encounters a prompt escape of the form % [ num ] < [ str ] < , it will truncate the next part of the prompt until the next %<< or the end of the prompt , whichever comes first .
If truncation is necessary , zsh will remove the beginning of the string to be truncated and add the [ str ] supplied so that the entire resulting string will be [ num ] characters long .
( Note that there 's also the % [ num ] >[ str ] > sequence , which does the truncation at the end of the string . )
If the combination of invariant prompt and current directory is not wide enough to fill the terminal ( this is usually the case ) , I use another variable flag - - one a bit more complicated .
The general form of the left - hand padding flag is $ {( l. [ len ] ..[ pad1 ] ..[ pad2 ] . ) [ varname ] } .
This pads or truncates $ {[ varname ] } so that the result is exactly [ len ] characters long .
If padding is needed , the shell will use [ pad2 ] once , then as many iterations of [ pad1 ] as are needed .
If you do n't need [ pad2 ] , it can be omitted , as can [ varname ] .
I omit both , so the effect is that [ pad1 ] is repeated to a length of [ len ] .
The quoting is done so I can put variables inside the flag statement .
Here 's a truncated path .
### # Get APM info . if which ibam > / dev/null ; then PR_APM_RESULT=`ibam -- percentbattery` elif which apm > / dev/null ; then PR_APM_RESULT=`apm` fi
If apm or ibam is present , I 'll need its output .
I could do this in the prompt itself , but calling programs from within the prompt clobbers the value of $ ?
( return code of the last command run ) , so I call all external programs in precmd ( ) , where they can't do any damage .
}
And that 's the end of my precmd ( ) function .
Next is preexec ( ) , which is only somewhat related to my prompt , but it 's here anyway .
preexec( ) is run after you press enter on your command but before the command is run .
setopt extended_glob preexec ( ) { if [ [ " $ TERM " == " screen " ] ] ; then local CMD = $ { 1 [ ( wr ) ^ ( *=* |sudo | -*) ] } echo -ne " \ek$ CMD\e\\ " fi }
I use screen for a lot of things .
My preexec ( ) sets the screen window title , if I 'm running in a screen .
I have fun with variable expansion to get what I want in the title , which is the name of the program I 'm currently running :
Subscripts for arrays can have flags that affect their behavior , just like variables can .
The ' ( w ) ' flag causes a regular variable to be treated as an array , with each element of the array being a whitespace - separated word of the variable 's value .
The ' ( r ) ' flag changes the way the index works .
It returns the first element of the array that matches the pattern supplied as the index .
In the pattern ( which uses extended globbing ) , '^ ' negates it , so I get the first element that does n't match .
It skips variable assignment , ' sudo ' , and program options .
The -e option to echo is n't strictly necessary in zsh , but I use it out of habit .
I 've attached to a running screen session , which has a window list in the caption .
You can see that the current window , 8 , is at a prompt , window 9 is running xemacs , and 7 is showing something with less .
setprompt ( ) {
The stuff that only needs to be set once is set in a separate function , which I 've decided to call setprompt ( ) .
### #
Need this so the prompt will work .
setopt prompt_subst
prompt_subst is not set by default .
It allows variable substitution to take place in the prompt , so I can just change the contents of certain variables without recreating the prompt every time .
### #
See if we can use colors .
autoload colors zsh / terminfo if [ [ " $ terminfo [ colors ] " - ge 8 ] ] ; then colors fi for color in RED GREEN YELLOW BLUE MAGENTA CYAN WHITE ; do eval PR_$ color= ' % {$ terminfo [ bold ] $ fg [ $ {( L ) color} ] %} ' eval PR_LIGHT_$ color= ' % {$ fg [ $ {( L ) color} ] %} ' ( ( count = $ count + 1 ) ) done PR_NO_COLOUR= " %{$terminfo[ sgr0 ]
%
} "
This section determines whether or not to use color in the prompt .
I use terminfo codes to be as portable as possible across different terminal types .
And the zsh termcap module provides an associative array for all of the terminfo entries for the current terminal .
' sgr0 ' removes all attributes ( bold , underline , etc. ) from the text .
' bold ' turns on bold text .
' colors ' lists the number of colors the current terminal supports .
The colors module provides a function called colors , which creates associative arrays $ fg and $ bg , which contain the terminal - appropriate ANSI escape codes for setting the forground and background colors , respectively .
Since the arrays are indexed by the lowercase versions of the color names , I use the ( L ) flag in the parameter expansion for $ color to lower - case the value of that variable .
I 've noticed that colors seems to always populate the arrays regardless of the color support of the terminal , which is why I have the test for the number of supported colors .
I fear it may only do ANSI colors as well , but I have yet to use zsh on a terminal that did n't use ANSI escapes for setting the colors .
The escape codes are surrounded by %{ and %} .
These are zsh prompt escapes that tell the shell to disregard the contained characters when determining the length of the prompt .
This allows zsh to properly position the cursor .
Prompt with colors removed .
### #
See if we can use extended characters to look nicer .
typeset - A altchar set - A altchar $ {( s..)terminfo[ acsc ] } PR_SET_CHARSET= " %{$ terminfo[ enacs ] %} " PR_SHIFT_IN= " %{$terminfo[ smacs ] %} " PR_SHIFT_OUT= " %{$terminfo[ rmacs ] %} " PR_HBAR=${altchar[q ] :--} PR_ULCORNER=${altchar[l ] :--} PR_LLCORNER=${altchar[m ] :--} PR_LRCORNER=${altchar[j ] :--} PR_URCORNER=${altchar[k ]:--}
Some terminals use fonts that have extended character support .
If they do , there should be terminfo entries to : a ) enable use of the line - drawing character set ( enacs ) , b ) enter ( smacs ) and leave ( rmacs ) the alternate character set , and c ) describe the mappings of line drawing characters ( acsc ) .
The last needs some additional explanation .
The VT100 used the alternate character set with certain lowercase characters to make line - drawing characters .
For instance , " q " was a horizontal line .
The acsc terminfo string is a series of character pairs , with the first in the pair being the vt100 character and the second being the character to get the same result in the current terminal .
A zsh associative array is a natural way to get at the appropriate line drawing characters .
Associative arrays must be declared before use , so that 's what the typeset - A does .
( - A is for defining an associative array . ) set - A [ arrayname ] assigns values to the array , with keys and value alternating .
( key , value , key , value , etc. )
This is exactly how the entries in terminfo are arranged , but we need spaces between the entries .
The ( s.[ pattern ] . ) flag causes a variable to be split on every occurence of [ pattern ] .
In my case , there is no pattern , so it matches everywhere , splitting between every character .
$ {[ varname ] : -[ string ] } returns , this time with an actual [ varname ] .
So if the terminal does n't support line drawing characters , the prompt will fall back to simple dashes .
Prompt without line art .
### # Decide if we need to set titlebar text .
case $ TERM in xterm * ) PR_TITLEBAR =$ '%{\e ]0 ;%(!.-=*[ ROOT ]*=- | . ) %n@%m : %~ | $ {COLUMNS}x$ {LINES} | % y\a%} ' ; ; screen ) PR_TITLEBAR =$'% {\e_screen \005 ( \005t ) | %(!.-=[ ROOT ] =- | . ) %n@%m : %~ | $ {COLUMNS}x$ {LINES} | %y\e\\%} ' ;; *) PR_TITLEBAR ='' ;; esac
There are several things going on here .
Most generally , I 'm setting the titlebar text in terminals that support it .
xterm and xterm - alike terminal emulators support a particular escape sequence to set their titlebar contents .
screen uses a different escape sequence to set its hardstatus line .
( And I have my . screenrc set up to display the hardstatus in xterm 's title bar - - details to be linked . )
I 'm also using a special zsh prompt escape . %( [ char ] .[ true str ] . [ false str ] ) is a conditional expression .
If [ chr ] is an exclamation point , zsh will use [ true str ] if the current uid is that of root and [ false str ] otherwise .
Since I want to be root as little as possible , I want zsh to yell at me a lot to remind me if I am .
Finally , the whole string is inside $ '...' delimiters .
This causes the string to be parsed like echo -e would do it ( so I can put in " \e " instead of literal escape characters ) .
No other expansion is done , which is also what I want --$ COLUMNS and $ LINES should only be processed when the prompt is displayed , to deal with changing window sizes .
Note the title bar .
Here 's the same thing , but inside a screen .
Here , the additional screen information is also present in the titlebar .
( There 's also my screen caption at the bottom , but that 's unrelated to my shell prompt . )
And finally , here 's the titlebar if I 'm root .
( Do n't worry about the other changes ; I 'll get to those . )
### # Decide whether to set a screen title if [ [ " $ TERM " == " screen " ] ] ; then PR_STITLE =$ '%{\ekzsh\e\\ %} ' else PR_STITLE ='' fi
This is the compliment to my preexec ( ) function .
It sets the screen title to " zsh " when sitting at a command prompt .
### # APM detection if which ibam > / dev/null ; then PR_APM='$ PR_RED $ {$ {PR_APM_RESULT [ ( f ) 1 ] } [ ( w ) - 2 ]
} %%( $ {$ {PR_APM_RESULT [ ( f ) 3 ] }[ ( w ) - 1] } ) $ PR_LIGHT_BLUE : ' elif which apm > / dev/null ; then PR_APM='$ PR_RED$ {PR_APM_RESULT
[( w ) 5 , ( w ) 6 ] /\%
/%%}$ PR_LIGHT_BLUE :' else PR_APM ='' fi
This is for laptops or other computers with batteries .
I assume that if apm or ibam is installed , it 's meant to be used .
These will result in the battery percentage and time left ( either to charge or discharge ) being displayed in the prompt .
With ibam , that information is on two separate lines .
The percentage is on the first line , so I use $ {PR_APM_RESULT [ ( f ) 1 ] } to get just that line .
The ( f ) flag causes the variable to be treated as an array , with each line being a separate element .
Then $ {...[ ( w ) - 2 ] } returns the second - to - last word on that line .
Similar indices retrieve the last word on the third line .
apm is a bit simpler .
Everything is on a single line , so we just grab the fifth and sixth words on that line .
When two indices are separated by a comma , the result is the range of elements between those two , inclusive .
This just happens to be a two element range .
Then substitution is performed to remove the space between them and to double the percent sign , so that prompt expansion witll leave a single , literal percent sign .
$ {[ varname ] / [ pattern ] /[ replacement ] } replaces the first occurrence of [ pattern ] with [ replacement ] .
$ {[ varname ] / [ pattern ] //[ replacement ]} replaces every occurrence .
Prompt on my laptop , showing 50 % battery and just over two hours to finish recharging .
( No , no indication of AC status ; that 's planned .
( I usually know which it is . ) )
President Barack Obama is still trying to portray himself to the American people as both an agent of change and a man of peace .
Truth be told , he is neither .
After one year in office it is now crystal clear that he simply is not the leader that he appeared to be ; that the persona he tried to project was merely an illusion .
And now Americans find themselves trying to cope with the reality that real change is not coming and the march to perpetual war will continue .
By now most Americans are sick and tired of hearing any more about health care reform because Mr. Obama and his cohorts in Congress have totally corrupted the process ; but I must bring it up once more as it is one of the prime examples of Mr. Obama 's key policy reversals .
No matter how much he tries to deny it , during his campaign , he made numerous references to his support for a strong public option in health care reform .
He never was able to sell his reform plan to a skeptical American public because he never explained in plain , understandable terms what it meant to them .
From the time he entered the White House , you could clearly see that he was backpedaling on the issue of the public option and trying to make it go away and finally it did .
Progressives know that the public option was the centerpiece and the most critical part of health reform because it would guarantee competition within the insurance industry .
Now he has thrown the public option under the bus and disclaimed it .
Could it be that he just does n't have the stomach to go up against the mighty insurance companies and their lobbyists ?
Better yet , that he never had the intention to confront them on this critical issue ?
During the campaign , we heard him make many statements about how he would deal with the Washington Establishment and bring real change to the way our government operates .
He would no longer allow the powerful special interests and lobbyists to dominate the legislative agenda in Congress .
Well , sad to say , nothing whatsoever has changed and cozy relationships between special interests and our elected representatives in Congress have reached new heights .
Under current toothless campaign finance rules , clear conflicts of interests are condoned because the handouts are called campaign contributions ; let 's call them what they actually are bribes .
Our president is giving Corporate America a free pass .
As much as he rails against the " too big to fail " banks he is failing to demand strong regulations to put an end to their financial abuses that caused the economic crisis .
Geithner , Summers and Bernanke , tools of Wall Street , continue to rule economic policy while Paul Volcker and any number of other economic heavyweights sit on the backbenches .
Mr. Obama has not called for any kind of legislation to put curbs on the outsourcing of American jobs overseas , even while our once solid manufacturing base is being disseminated .
It 's been reported that President Obama and key staff members all read , " Lessons in Disaster " before he made his decision on committing more troops to Afghanistan .
This excellent narrative by author Gordon M. Goldstein of the decisions and actions of the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations , leading to the buildup of our military involvement in Vietnam , shows how each of these presidents dealt with the enormous power and influence of the U.S. military during that time .
JFK stood up to the generals and admirals , Johnson did not .

Peter
Thiel , the PayPal co-founder who struck gold when he invested $ 500,000 in Facebook five years ago , is facing a second consecutive year of losses at his hedge fund Clarium .
The onetime Silicon Valley star 's hedge fund is down 16.4 percent through November , according to performance data reviewed by The Post .
That leaves the former PayPal CEO just four weeks to turn around Clarium 's fortunes -- an unlikely feat .
Clarium 's assets also remain down , though so far they are holding steady at $ 1.6 billion as of Nov. 30 .
Last summer , Clarium boasted assets of $ 7.3 billion before things turned sour .

Decision - making in authoritarian regimes can be a lot more complicated than it looks .
The idea that dictators simply dictate is often wide of the mark : they may not care much about public opinion but they do have to juggle with conflicting demands inside their own power base , and sometimes they can't even be sure their instructions will be implemented .
Syria is one country where the inner workings of the regime can seem baffling .
A diplomat in Damascus once told me that although Bashar al - Assad 's position as president seems secure , nobody knows how much power he really has .
A report published by the International Crisis Group ( ICG ) earlier this week – mainly about Syrian foreign policy – sheds some light on this intriguing puzzle .
In Syria , it says :
Many decisions witness a contest between various lines of thought that coexist within the regime , each reflecting a slightly different worldview , diverging private interests or personal rivalries .
Some decisions ultimately reflect a balance between diverse institutional power centres ; others , a more decisive victory by a particular one ...
Further confusion arises from the fact that officials occasionally take initiatives or make pronouncements that are inconsistent with the authorised line – in an attempt to influence it ; as a means of drawing attention to themselves ; in order to express frustration ; or , quite simply , out of ignorance .
In theory at least , the president 's decision is final but much of the time he sits back , waiting to see which way the wind will blow .
One Syrian official told the ICG :
Overall objectives are set by the president with input from those around him .
Then , it 's up to others to suggest how to achieve them .
For instance , if the minister of foreign affairs makes an interesting proposal , the president will give him some leeway – but only up to a point , because he still has to contend with other tendencies .
Moreover , the leadership tends to maintain multiple , parallel channels on any given issue .
But , in the end , the president always remains in a position to arbitrate and distribute roles .
The balancing and real decision - making takes place at the top .
No one else is even fully in the picture .
Even the most loyal official , familiar with the workings of the system , can find this confusing .
But then there are others who think they know what the policy is – and try to subvert it .
In an opaque , compartmentalised and heavily bureaucratised system such as Syria 's it 's by no means certain that decisions , once made , will stick .
" Follow - through often is lacking , as the process creates considerable room for either active or passive obstructionism , " the ICG says .
" Policies frequently are adjusted or rectified , even after apparently final decisions are made . "
One recent example was Syria 's association agreement with the EU , which both parties spent years negotiating .
Then , just as it was about to be signed , Syria unexpectedly put it on hold – possibly because of objections from local business interests .
This chopping and changing happens at a national level too .
A Damascus lawyer told the ICG : " There are several centres of power .
Much - needed legislation can be enacted and then , within a few months , is amended and amended again .
The reason is that the legislation interferes with the interests of people influential enough to step in and have their way " .
Clearly , Syria is not a one - man dictatorship and a senior official quoted in the report sees this as a positive development , a " sign of a dynamic debate " .
Dynamic it may be , but it 's still a closed debate , conducted mainly in private , by those in the loop .
The rest of the country is excluded .
On the domestic front , this opacity is likely to slow down the pace of reforms or limit their extent .
In order to succeed , such reforms will need buy - in from the public as well as the regime 's insiders and the only way to achieve that is through open debate that helps ordinary Syrians to understand the rationale behind them .
Internationally , the opacity makes Syria one of the most difficult countries for negotiators to deal with .
Martin Indyk , an assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration , told a congressional committee last year :
Just about every leader that has attempted to deal with President Bashar al - Assad has come away frustrated .
The list includes Colin Powell , Tony Blair , Nicolas Sarkozy , Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah .
The cause of their frustration is the disconnect between Assad 's reasonableness in personal meetings and his regime 's inability or unwillingness to follow through on understandings reached there .
It is unclear whether this is because of a lack of will or a lack of ability to control the levers of power .
This was echoed by a foreign official who has worked closely with the regime and is quoted in the ICG report as saying :
In dealing with Syria we always need to ask ourselves , ' Are they reluctant to do this or simply can't they do it ? ' …
We should not take any promise as a given , if only because many are beyond their capacity .
This is a systemic problem .
Syria is an authoritarian system of a particular kind , in which the ruler is n't necessarily obeyed .
Besides , the system is largely inefficient .
People step on each other 's toes ; institutions lack capacity ; and things are disorganised .
And even when the president speaks , it 's difficult to know whether he 's telling people what he really thinks or what he thinks they want to hear .
A Turkish official interviewed by the ICG said : " Bashar has two lines of speech , one for the region and one for the west .
He does n't say the same thing on BBC and al - Jazeera .
It 's double - talk .
Here [ in the Middle East ] it is acceptable .
His interlocutors must understand this is not unusual in the region .
Americans might think it devious .
He sees it as being polite " .

' But for whatever reason , everything clicked once the games started and being trackside finally felt natural .'

Photo by Trent Nelson / Salt Lake Tribune
I 'll just tell you the truth .
For the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City I was assigned to the sliding sports at the Utah Olympic Park : Bobsled , skeleton , and luge .
As the games drew near I covered all of the World Cup events thinking that by the time the Olympics started I would have these unique sports all figured out and the photo angles all nailed .
Unfortunately , my pre-Olympic work was a disaster .
I did n't get a single memorable frame and I soon began to dread going to the bitter cold track , frustrated by the unfamiliarity of it all .
But for whatever reason , everything clicked once the games started and being trackside finally felt natural .
I hit all the right notes and one of my luge photos is now on permanent display at the Utah Olympic Park .
More important than anything I could say about myself is this :
Photography , the act of making art while taking pictures , is riddled with failure .
As a photographer you will fail .
You will disappoint your editors , clients , readers , and even your parents .
But that 's how you learn technique and develop style .
So when it happens embrace it .
In the middle of the Olympics I put together this series of photos to mock my own pre-Olympic slump and it was published it in my photo column ( RIP ) .
The response was overwhelmingly positive and one of my favorite memories from the past decade .
All that from failure .

The recent
revelations
of misrepresentation by CRU scientists about research on climate change should come as no surprise .
Scientists , like all human beings , are sometimes tempted to lie or cheat , and occasionally they succumb to those temptations .
Actually , scientists do n't do too badly .
According to a recent analysis of surveys of scientific misconduct :
In surveys asking about the behavior of colleagues , fabrication , falsification , and modification [ of data ] had been observed , on average , by over 14 % of respondents , and other questionable practices [ such as " dropping data points based on a gut feeling " and " changing the design , methodology , or results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source " ] by up to 72 % .
That 's probably a better track record than sociologists or economists could muster .
I shudder to think what the corresponding percentages would be for politicians or journalists .
But it 's not good enough .
Scientists are worthless if their data and reasoning cannot be trusted entirely .
They have in effect signed a contract with society , pledging honesty and objectivity .
When a scientist is caught in a lie , it should rarely , if ever , be forgiven or forgotten .
So why did the scientists at CRU indulge in such reckless , career - shattering antics ?
To try to understand this , we must consider why and how scientists lie .
The Wikipedia article on scientific misconduct is just the tip of a vast ocean of reportage and analysis of the subject .
I shall use a simplified anatomy here .
Why do scientists lie ?
In order of decreasing disingenuousness , the main motives are :
Profit : Sometimes there 's money in it -- a lot of money .
This may be why , according to Fanelli 's report , " surveys conducted among clinical , medical and pharmacological researchers appeared to yield higher rates of misconduct than surveys in other fields " [ 1 ] .
Laziness and ease of perpetration :
It 's so much easier to just make up data than to perform all those tedious measurements .
And in most cases , no one is going to question you about it .
Career pressure :
This is the most common reason .
The data is n't going your way and you may fail to get your thesis accepted , or not get tenure , or miss a promotion , or lose your grant or your job .
Pride : Scientists are as hungry for praise and prestige as other mortals .
And no one likes to be forced to admit he 's wrong .
So , when someone contradicts your earlier work , you may be willing to cut a few corners to defend yourself , or to prevent your opponent 's paper from being published .
Ideology : Many feel that if a cause is worth dying for , it 's worth lying for .
As we shall consider below , liberal intellectuals are particularly susceptible to this weakness .
Next , let 's consider the methodology .
Aside from plagiarism ( which is not relevant here ) , scientific lying follows the same three methods of concealment that are used in all scams :
Lying : the fabrication of nonexistent data or the falsification of data by manipulating research materials , equipment , processes , or the data itself .
Hiding : omitting data that does not fit your conclusion and / or ignoring or suppressing conflicting data from other sources .
Another form of hiding is shouting down the opposition by seeking the greatest possible media exposure [ 2 ] , repeatedly claiming a dubious or nonexistent consensus for your views , or contriving to prevent the opposition from publication in technical journals by malicious refereeing .
Misdirection : massaging the data with biasing statistical or processing techniques , choosing the model or graphic plot that best suits your conclusion , misinterpreting data or suppressing alternative interpretations , forming unfounded assertions or extrapolations , etc .
This is a vast field in itself , one in which the CRU and their IPCC brethren seem to have broken new ground .
The psychology of these motives and activities may be inexcusable , but is nonetheless understandable .
More often than not , it begins with self - deception .
For although Polonius ' advice to Laertes --
This above all : to thine own self be true , / And it must follow , as the night the day , / Thou canst not then be false to any man ( Hamlet , I , iii )
-- is often wrong , its opposite is true .
If you begin by deceiving yourself , you will go on to deceive others .
And self - deception is easy ; contrary to the old adage , the road to hell is paved with rationalizations .
To try to explain the CRU 's primrose path , I must remind you that most scientists think of themselves as intellectuals , who , as the phrase " trahison des clercs " implies , are not above advancing themselves or their pet causes by doing a little lying .
Moreover , most intellectuals are liberals , many of whom -- perhaps because of their lack of the moral restraint that religion imposes -- are willing to twist the truth for the sake of their ideology .
The steps of this process go something like this :
1. Intellectual liberals believe that human beings are fundamentally good and that they are constantly evolving into something better .
Moreover , they believe that intellectuals ( i.e. , themselves ) are the best and wisest of humans and therefore the predestined leaders of mankind .
2 . They also tend to believe that there are simple and drastic solutions to all of the world 's problems .
These solutions generally entail the creation of an all - powerful world government , staffed mainly with intellectuals .
3 . Therefore , they tend to unquestioningly follow a charismatic leader who proposes sweeping reforms that will lead to a better world , with the intellectuals themselves in line for key positions .
4 . They also tend to become bigots , in the Chestertonian sense of being unable to imagine any sane and honest person disagreeing with them .
Therefore , all their opponents must be fools or liars .
Moreover , the public -- the " common man " -- is a vast mob of idiots who must be manipulated for their own good .
5 . Therefore , bending the truth a little so as to make it more blatantly obvious to the limited mentality of the public , or silencing the wrongheaded opposition so as not to confuse the simpleminded public , or crying " wolf " about a supposedly dire emergency so as to galvanize the lethargic public into immediate drastic action , are legitimate and even noble tactics .
This sort of rationalization has seduced scientists before .
The early enthusiasts of evolution occasionally felt obliged to emphasize the results of the research so as to catch the public eye .
One thinks of Haeckel altering his embryo drawings and Kammerer inking the legs of his toads , not to falsify , but ( as they told themselves ) to make the truths they were convinced they saw easier for others to see .
I have not read the CRU e-mails in detail , but I suspect that the shenanigans recounted therein are consistent with this form of rationalization .
Of course , this does not exclude the admixture of baser motives , such as increased grants to refine and expand research , key positions in the climate control branch of the ultimate world government , and perhaps a few Nobel prizes in addition to the peace prize IPCC shared with Al Gore in 2007 [ 3 ] .
How should we respond to this incident ?
I think we must protest as loud and as long as we can , even striving to make an eponym of it , i.e. " climategating the data . "
But in the end , I think the perpetrators will get away with this suberfuge .
Many times in the past , scientists have covered up major embarrassments and managed to maintain their self - proclaimed prestige and influence [ 4 ] .
The whitewash is already being brushed on , a sacrificial lamb or two will be demoted or transferred , and politicians will ignore the matter and continue to insist that the AGW crisis is unquestionably urgent .
Obama 's climate czar , Carol Browner , has already shrugged off the scandal as irrelevant .
Our only hope is that we can make our congressmen nervous enough about possible future scandals to induce them to defer cap - and - trade legislation and treaty ratifications until evidence for the urgency is more firmly established .
We must also try to dispel the notion that a universal consensus exists by citing prominent dissenters such as Freeman Dyson ( arguably the finest scientific mind alive ) , who stated in his latest book :
My first heresy [ is ] that all the fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated .
Here I am opposing the holy brotherhood of climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens who believe the numbers predicted by the computer models ...
By way of contrast , we should emphasize the fact that the CRU scientists caught with their graphs down are not mere members of the pro-AGW faction ; they are the leaders and instigators of that movement .
On the other hand , we must avoid the blunder of believing that the entire case for AGW has been demolished .
What is needed is a thorough investigation of the case , examining all the critical data for evidence of corruption .
The CRU miscreants might say , like Browning 's Mr. Sludge , " I cheated when I could ... but there was something in it , tricks and all ! "
The basic " greenhouse ' " mechanism has been under scrutiny for over fifty years and appears to be valid .
The ability of human activity to significantly affect global energy balance is obvious from satellite photos and was demonstrated by the effect of halocarbons on the ozone hole [ 5 ] .
And since our prodigal use of Earth 's resources , if unchecked , might well lead to eventual uninhabitability , some of the measures proposed by AGW advocates , such as economical energy / materials usage and replacement of fossil fuels with renewable ones , are simply prudent planetary housekeeping .
I therefore recommend that , while fighting against nonsensical schemes like cap - and - trade and avoiding extreme measures that would endanger our already precarious economy , we become judiciously cooperative about reasonable and gradual approaches to energy conservation , supportive of honest efforts to learn more about climate trends , and even receptive to measures for controlling and counteracting them .
NOTES
[ 1 ]
It 's worth noting that " Nobel fever , " which has bred more than its share of ethical lapses , concerns both money and pride .
[ 2 ]
One should always be suspicious when scientists issue a press release about a discovery before publishing a refereed paper .
It may be a fiasco of self - deception , like cold fusion , or it may just mean that their grant is up for renewal .
[ 3 ]
In view of recent recipients such as Carter , Gore , and Obama , the Nobel peace prize is becoming an embarrassment .
Perhaps future awards should be announced in the Harvard Lampoon .
[ 4 ]
Predictions about the surface of the moon are a classic case in point .
In the 1960's , the high - visibility cosmologists ( Kuiper , Gold , Sagan , etc. ) were in virtual consensus about the moon being covered with meteoritic debris , while one lone geologist ( Jack Green ) predicted that the main constituent would be volcanic rock ( e.g. , Geotimes , May 1970 ) .
Although subsequent lunar missions proved that Green was right , the cosmologists wiped the egg off their faces and maintained their celebrity while Jack Green , who also predicted the presence of water in lunar rock fifty years before its recent discovery , was conveniently forgotten .
Republic of Malawi recognizes the Republic of Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state , says the note verbale sent by the Republic of Malawi Foreign Ministry to Kosovo MFA via the General Consulate of the Republic of Kosovo in New York .

Looking at the different Maker blogs , I could see that there was an emergent set of information standards forming ad hoc by a popularity - driven process of selection as well as limitations - chiefly in graphics as people generally can’t produce their own drawn illustrations so resort to photos and video .
The people who first started publishing recipes for making things on sites like the Make blog and Instructibles had no preconceived notion of the format of presentation for those recipes .
So what they have been creating to date is a mashup of metaphors and examples they remember from DIY / hobby books , TV shows like This Old House , cooking shows , and so on .
And yet there ’s an emergent consistency in these as people react to each presentation in terms of open popularity voting and critique and adapt their future presentations to that .
But this process has no goals and people are n’t really put as much attention into the critical task of showcasing technique - disseminating knowledge - as they are in demoing their own designs .
So I envisioned this community that made producing this kind of Maker knowledge and collecting it in a database - while making a living on its publishing in print and in the creation of kits - their vocation .
The knowledge would all be open source , but publishing and kit - bashing would be for - profit , letting people make a living and providing a means to subsidize the free dissemination of the knowledge on - line and through outreach activity .
Eric Hunting meditates and strategizes on the way forward from here to there .
“ I ’ve been thinking more on this lately - particularly as I ’ve recently been working on an article on characterizing / defining Post - Industrial design .
This is a topic that seems very prone to spiral into abstraction - especially when the goal is as grandiose as gathering all industrial knowledge into a central repository of some sort .
Perhaps we can ground the discussion a little by defining how we might represent any artifact in terms of a body of information .
For the moment we ’ll resign ourselves to a characterization for human use and leave the machine encoding to another level as we need to grasp this in human terms before we can seriously figure out how to work our machines into the knowledge loop .
Any manufactured artifact is - more or less - fully characterized by the following collection of information ;
- Design
- annotated design images , digital models , physical models
- samples - in the form of stored examples , photographs
- detailed description
- cultural / historical cross-reference ( see science historian James Burke )
- technical / performance specifications
- standardization parameters ( technical specifications that are standardized across a collection of artifacts )
- design discussion record ( for designs that are group or community projects ) - designer / design community ( contacts , forums , references , etc . )
- Production Recipe
- drawn plans - CAD , drafted , etc .
-materials and components catalog
- materials source guide
- cross -reference to materials production
- tool catalog ( including software tools )
- cross - reference to tool designs
- step - by - step production process instructions
- technique cross-reference
- firmware ( here defined as software embedded in or integral to the function of the artifact )
- Use Guide
- optional kit assembly instructions
- user feedback record
- repair guide
-materials and components catalog
- technique cross-reference for artifacts that are tools
- user group community
- Software Family ( cross- reference index to software artifacts made to compliment the artifact )
- Post - Use Guide
- disassembly instructions
- disposal / recycling instructions
- recycling technique cross-reference
-upcycling technique cross-reference
- impact analysis record
- Artifact Instance
- package / kit/etc .
- Spime ( borrowing the term from Bruce Sterling , here defined as the collective media and information network associated with any product and supporting its feedback channels , knowledge cross-references , interdependencies and ‘ prosumer ’ communities )
Commentary :
For each set of the above information you have variations and iterations .
A variation of a design is an adaptation or modification of a design to suit customization / personalization or some variation in application .
An iteration of a design is an improvement of the design .
So we might represent the ‘ lineage ’ of an artifact as a tree where each trunk is a line of iteration and each branch a variation branching off into a line of iteration from a point in the parent line of iteration .
In some cases lines of iteration split into competitive parallel branches .
At other times divergent variant branches can converge to become future iterations of other variant branches or even the main design branch .
Not also that some of this information flows in time independent of the iteration .
For instance , the user feedback records of an iteration grow as long as that iteration remains current , and form part of the reference information used to make subsequent iterations and form part of its ‘ spime ’ .
All subcomponents and all processed materials can be characterized as artifacts , interfacing into the hierarchy of other artifacts through the components / materials catalogs .
Even things we think of as ‘ materials ’ like lumber , plywood sheeting , steel sheet , plastic stock , etc. all have ‘ designs ’ that determine their form factor and have often been standardized .
The A4 sheet of paper is a specific design of sheet paper .
In some cases components can be specified to be cannibalized to serve as a material .
( this is upcycling )
In some cases iterative evolution of processed materials and components can force an iterative evolution in the artifacts they are used in .
Raw materials can also be characterized ‘ like ’ other artifacts with the exception that they have no design , just samples / examples , a range of specifications defining quality , and a range of natural sources .
Their ‘ recipes ’ are about extraction , not fabrication .
This is not exclusive to just stuff in the ground .
Some raw materials - like lumber - are ‘ grown ’ and so employ technique in their extraction and management of quality .
Basically , you can say that lumber production is a ‘ mining ’ technique that extracts carbon from the ground and air and turns it into wood .
In the old fashioned manner its like strip mining .
Fell timber harvesting and tree farming are the more renewable approaches that have different technique .
Now , let ’s consider the characterization of a technique .
A technique represents a body of knowledge for how to use a spectrum of tools to produce a spectrum of products .
An individual technique belongs to a family of technique embodying a roughly common spectrum of fabrication or performance .
In some cases there is no product , but rather performance .
For instance , instructions for how to dance produce a performance but not a product - unless you ’re an anthropologist and consider dancing primarily a courting technique .
The problem we have here is generalization .
There are large families of techniques using large families of tools and a large spectrum of possible products .
And so to illustrate a technique we must use simple artifacts as models and reference other artifacts as examples .
The technique is adapted according to the specifics of recipes for different artifacts .
Ultimately , all artifacts that use a technique in their production back - reference to the description of the technique as a potential example .
But not all examples of a technique represent good models of a technique to learn it from - which brings us to the other fly in our ointment ; skill .
A skill is a learned technique arrived at through practice / performance .
Skill is the ultimate goal in the communication of a technique - at least from the human perspective .
We have only a rudimentary notion today of how to characterize a skill in the machine sense other than to say that it represents a mechanism for the translation / interpretation of a generalized fabrication process to the design specifics of a particular artifact .
I ’ve dubbed this ‘ Taylorization ’ . ( after Frederick Winslow Taylor ) and characterize it as the intermediate representation of a production process relative to the topology of a production system prior to ‘ compilation ’ into the control language of individual machines .
Thus I characterize ‘ machine skill ’ as a system / network of ‘ Taylor programs ’ .
But let ’s not get too deep into that dark jungle right now …
For now , let ’s speculate on how a human characterization of technique might break down .
- Technique
- back - reference to family of technique
- description –cross -reference to science and engineering principles –cross-reference to integral technique –cultural cross-reference - tool catalog –cross - reference to tool artifacts - materials / components catalog –cross - reference materials characterizations
- illustration ( images , models , performance / demonstration ) –cross - reference to artifact examples - developer community –developer discourse record
- Model Process Recipes ( many iterations )
- tool catalog
- materials catalog
- step by step demonstration –illustration / demonstration / media –cross -reference to artifact example recipes –cross -reference to integral techniques
- Impact Analysis
- waste product characterization
- waste handling instructions
- cross -reference to recycle techniques and upcycle artifacts
Now , there ’s an open question here as to whether one characterizes fabrication families of technique by their predominate tools or the predominate materials .
Neither choice is particularly good because there ’s so much overlap .
The best approach might be to build upon that categorization described by Neil Gershenfeld in characterizing the tools of the fab lab ; additive , subtractive , molding / forming , synthesis / stochastic ( as in chemistry ) , reprographic ( including photographic and lithographic ) , and algorithmic .
( ie. software )
This is still not ideal - there is still much cross -over between these families - but this may be a good starting point .
Though they do evolve with their predominate tools and materials spectrums , techniques generally do not iterate , though whatever knowledgebase we use to manage their information will , constantly , as both the technique and our ways of illustrating / demonstrating / performing it evolve .
Techniques do , however , generate variations in extremely great numbers as tools evolve , new tools spawning new technique with them .
Techniques can also be nested , a given technique a possible composite of multiple other techniques .
Easy to see how characterizing all this for autonomous machines is rather daunting .
So here we have an admittedly rough but relatively complete break - down of the types of information that make up the definitions of artifacts and techniques .
So what do we do with it ?
On the face of it , things do n’t look too complicated but , the way things work today , at each line - item the specific information blooms into clouds of diverse data , representation metaphors , and media forms .
In order to realize the goal of collectivizing our civilization ’s industrial knowledge we need to standardize on these things in some way to produce a common knowledgebase format that is at once easy to put in a digital form that ’s easy to disseminate and easy for people to use , adapt , and translate to different languages .
Once we have some workable and nominally restrictive standards , we can start figuring out how this can be converted into a machine form - adding a machine - knowledge level to this database .
This is what I intended to be the primary task of the ToolBook cooperative .
Looking at the different Maker blogs , I could see that there was an emergent set of information standards forming ad hoc by a popularity - driven process of selection as well as limitations - chiefly in graphics as people generally can’t produce their own drawn illustrations so resort to photos and video .
The people who first started publishing recipes for making things on sites like the Make blog and Instructibles had no preconceived notion of the format of presentation for those recipes .
So what they have been creating to date is a mashup of metaphors and examples they remember from DIY / hobby books , TV shows like This Old House , cooking shows , and so on .
And yet there ’s an emergent consistency in these as people react to each presentation in terms of open popularity voting and critique and adapt their future presentations to that .
But this process has no goals and people are n’t really put as much attention into the critical task of showcasing technique - disseminating knowledge - as they are in demoing their own designs .
So I envisioned this community that made producing this kind of Maker knowledge and collecting it in a database - while making a living on its publishing in print and in the creation of kits - their vocation .
The knowledge would all be open source , but publishing and kit - bashing would be for - profit , letting people make a living and providing a means to subsidize the free dissemination of the knowledge on - line and through outreach activity .
Using the sort of breakdown I ’ve described here and guided by the objective of a ‘ brand identity ’ for their published media and its management and distribution on - line , this community would deliberately and actively cultivate evolving standards of knowledge representation and organization as they cultivate this knowledgebase .
Which , of course , brings us to the Vajra Maker incubator community concept - a definitive place with shared resources and a shared culture focused on this task like they were building a new open Alexandrian library of technology on the Internet - where the barbarians can’t burn it down this time around .
This is a really big task and I think this might be what it takes to actually pull it off .
Maybe it takes a kind of casual monastery . ”

For these reforms to succeed , there needs to be effective regulatory authority to prevent insurers from engaging in abusive practices and subverting the new rules .
The bill passed by the House would provide for that authority and lodges it in the federal government , though states could take over the exchanges if they met federal requirements .
The Senate bill would leave most of the enforcement as well as the running of the exchanges to the states .
Yet many states have a poor record of regulating health insurance , and some would resist passing legislation to conform with the new federal law .
Under the Senate bill , the federal government can step in if a state failed to set up an exchange .
But it ’s hard enough to get reform through Congress ; to try to repeat that process in 50 state legislatures would be asking for trouble and guaranteeing delay .
Accelerating the timetable of reform ought to be a priority .
Although the legislation calls for some important interim measures , the Senate bill defers opening the exchanges and extending coverage until 2014 .
By comparison , when Medicare was enacted in 1965 , it went into effect the next year .
For Congress to put off expanding coverage to 2014 would be asking for a lot of patience from voters .
It would also give the opponents of reform two elections to undo it .
President Obama would have to run for re-election in 2012 defending a program from which people would have seen little benefit .
To speed the process , the legislation ought to give states financial incentives to adopt the reforms on their own as early as mid-2011 .
A state like Massachusetts , which already has a working exchange , could move expeditiously to qualify for federal money .
The final deadline for the federal government ’s expansion of coverage should be no later than Jan. 1 , 2012 .
Let the moderate Democrats who oppose the public option say they stopped a government takeover .
Liberals should be prepared to give up what is now a mere symbol for changes in the bill that would deliver affordable insurance more effectively and quickly to the millions of Americans who desperately need it .

Vimperator
Vimperator
Vimperator is a Firefox browser extension with strong inspiration from the Vim text editor , with a mind towards faster and more efficient browsing .
It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser , as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in .
For example , it has a special Hint mode , where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only .
Also most functionality is available as commands , typing : back will go back within the current page history , just like hitting the back button in the toolbar .
However , Vimperator does not try to be a 100 % Vim clone , it rather brings Vim ’s ideas to the 21st century .
This means making use of new graphical capabilities but also of faster computers .
Furthermore , great care is taken into making its command line interface more consistent and easier to use , while still being a powerful extension for advanced users .
But Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well .
If you are a web developer , you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support .
Or if you want to extend Vimperator , you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory .

NOTE : Vimperator will stop functioning with Firefox 57 !
Firefox 57 will change its add - on ecosystem to be exclusively based on WebExtensions .
While this offers ( some ) compatibility with extensions written for Chrome and Microsoft Edge , it removes the possibility to do many advanced stuff which Vimperator does .
Additionally , it would require a full rewrite of Vimperator , which nobody has volunteered for .
Therefore we will stop supporting any Firefox version later than Firefox 56 .

BAMAKO , Mali —
For a year and a half , Bara Kassambara kept his mouth shut .
Every day , all of his coworkers paused for prayer time .
There were frequent Bible studies , and constant talk about Jesus .
Kassambara attended the required events , but otherwise quietly focused on his work : bringing clean water to rural Mali .
“ I think many people at World Vision just believed that I was a Christian , ” said Kassambara , a Muslim in a predominantly Islamic country .
Fluent in English and with years of development work on his resume , World Vision hired Kassambara to work on the West Africa Water Initiative — a project to provide safe drinking water to stave off water - borne diseases that run rampant in the region .
It was a rare hire for World Vision , Kassambara said ; he only got the job because it was a temporary position .
When World Vision stepped down as lead agency on the project in late 2008 , Kassambara took a similar job with another organization .
[ Passport : Inside the faith - based discrimination controversy ]
“ The goal of World Vision is clearly written : to promote Christianity worldwide , ” Kassambara said .
“ I knew this was going on .
I knew the rules of the game .
If their goal is to promote Christianity , why should they hire a Muslim ? ”
World Vision , based outside of Seattle , is one of the largest recipients of development grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development , the federal government ’s foreign aid arm .
The organization received $ 281 million in U.S. grants in 2008 , up from $ 220 million in 2007 and $ 261 million in 2006 , according to World Vision documents .
Those grants , amounting to about a quarter of the organization ’s total U.S. budget , came in the form of both cash and food .
The organization employs about 40,000 people worldwide .
Charity Navigator , which ranks charities based on efficiency , lists World Vision as a “ super - sized charity , ” with $ 1.1 billion in expenses in 2008 , and gave it four stars — the best possible ranking .
Throughout Mali , Christians and Muslims alike praise World Vision for bringing food and clean water to hungry people — the organization " extends assistance to all people , regardless of their religious beliefs , " according to its website .
Malians credit the organization with staving off starvation and helping rural villages develop agriculture .
If the group ever leaves Mali , people there say they would be devastated .
World Vision officials say the organization does not proselytize , just that they decline to separate their work from their faith .
" We do want to be witnesses to Jesus Christ by life , word , deed and sign , ” said Torrey Olsen , World Vision ’s Senior Director for Christian Engagement .
That would n’t be possible , he said , unless the organization ’s workers were Christians .
Under U.S. law , World Vision points to civil rights protections that allow religious organizations to hire employees based on their faith .
This is an uncontroversial protection of religious freedom , given that churches obviously need Christian staff to carry out their missions , just as synagogues need Jews and Mosques Muslims .
But such religious institutions are typically funded by their followers .
The controversial question is whether it ’s a violation of the First Amendment to exclude on the basis of religion when U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill , a practice that became increasingly common during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations .
As a candidate , President Barack Obama promised to end such discrimination .
So far , he has not .
And so for now in Mali , World Vision ’s hiring practices mean that for many of the best qualified candidates , most jobs are off - limits .
Kassambara said he did n’t deny being a Muslim when asked , but kept quiet about his faith because a job with a stable , well - funded employer like World Vision is a rarity in this landlocked nation , one of the world ’s poorest .
There are few decent jobs here , and the government struggles to keep its most educated citizens from moving abroad .
World Vision only hires non-Christians if a qualified Christian ca n’t be found .
According to its website , “ World Vision U.S. has the right to , and does , hire only candidates who agree with World Vision ’s Statement of Faith and / or the Apostle ’s Creed , ” referring to an oft - quoted Christian doctrinal statement .
Fabiano Franz , World Vision ’s national director for Mali , said that jobs held by non-Christians are considered temporary .
“ There ’s no encouragement for a career here if you ’re not a Christian , ” he said .
Franz argued that separation of church and state is an American concept that does n’t translate well to many other cultures .
In Mali , and in other countries throughout the world , he said , faith is integrated into daily life .
An attempt to separate faith and practice in Mali , he said , would be foreign and confusing to those receiving aid .
“ If you ’re a committed Christian , you should n’t have this separation between your faith and your work , ” he said .
“ We ’re very clear from the beginning about hiring Christians , ” Franz said .
“ It ’s not a surprise , so it ’s not discrimination . ”

It previously read " World Vision hires only Christians under its $ 250 million in US government foreign aid grants . "
As noted in the story , the organization gives preferential treatment to Christians , but hires non-Christians for temporary positions as needed , and about 20 percent of World Vision International 's staff is non-Christian .
Also , World Vision asked GlobalPost to point out a ) that World Vision does not infringe upon the rights of its non-Christian employees to worship freely in the workplace around the world ; and b ) that while the West Africa Water Initiative referenced in the article received grant money from USAID , World Vision 's participation was privately funded ( the organization 's hiring policy is the same for both publicly and privately funded projects ) .

Thank heaven for little boys .
In a 1999 painting he commissioned , Michael Jackson strikes the same pose as Michelangelo ’s statue of David with rippling abs , bulging pecs and smooth , marble - white skin — surrounded by a bevy of male cherubs .
The work , by artist David Nordahl , is just one of hundreds of private portraits the Gloved One ordered up over the years that depict him in an idealized light .
They were revealed last week in a book about Jackson ’s life .
In the larger - than - life canvases , Jackson emerges as King Arthur , a superhero , even an angel — all drawn to his specifications .
“ He thought it was great with a little ‘ tongue - in - cheek ’ flavor , ” said Nordahl of the oil - on - canvas work “ Michael . ”
The artist painted hundreds of works for Jackson and reportedly earned $ 150,000 for the larger canvases .
Jackson spent millions building up his private collection .
Nordahl made Jackson a Peter Pan - like figure in “ The Storyteller ” and added his sister Janet to the lower - left foreground in the shape of a fairy .
The paintings can be seen in “ Michael Jackson Opus : The Ultimate Celebration of an Icon , ” a 450 - page tome published this week by Kraken Opus .
Nov. 17 , 2009  -- President Obama is showing durability against significant economic and policy challenges , maintaining majority approval for his job performance in the face of broad unemployment , a controversial health plan and continued doubts about his work on the war in Afghanistan .
The trick 's in personal appeal , a strong base of support , weak opposition and a teaspoon of sugar in some of the medicine the president 's prescribed .
Click here for PDF with charts and questionnaire .
The last is notably so on health care reform .
Negatives abound : Fifty - four percent of insured Americans think it 'll increase their own costs ; among all , 56 percent think it 'll raise overall costs , six in 10 think it could shut down many private insurers and 61 percent oppose covering abortions in federally supported plans .
For all that , sweetened by other , more popular elements , the plan 's holding essentially at an even split , 48 percent in favor , 49 percent opposed .
Obama , for his part , has a 56 percent job approval rating overall , better than on any individual issue tested in this ABC News / Washington Post poll save one – 60 percent for his handling of international affairs .
That makes his current foray to Asia look well - timed , playing to a strength while he 's got difficulties at home .
Continued personal popularity helps ; 61 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of Obama overall , his lowest since before the 2008 election and down 18 points from his peak when he took office , but a positive rating nonetheless .
Intensity , while diminished , also is still with him ; " strongly " favorable views of the president exceed strongly unfavorable ones by 12 points .
Obama 's solid in his base – an 84 percent job approval rating among Democrats , falling sharply to 50 percent among independents and a mere 18 percent among Republicans .
Notably , he and his party continue to benefit from a floundering opposition , with , for example , a 16 - point margin for the Democrats over the Republicans in trust to handle the nation 's main problems .
Tellingly , Americans by 2 - 1 , 61 percent to 31 percent , say leaders of the Republican Party are mainly criticizing Obama without presenting other ideas , rather than offering alternatives to his proposals .
Independents , the center of politics , hold this view by 54 - 37 percent .
And the ranks of independents are broad :
They again account for a plurality of Americans , 39 percent in this survey , while Republicans , in the tank all year , make up just 21 percent of the population .
Republican Problems , More Trust Obama
Other measures underscore the difficulties facing the GOP , which has lost allegiance steadily since 2004 , starting with fallout from the Iraq war and growing disenchantment with then - President Bush .
The Democrats in this poll outnumber the Republicans by 10 points as the party that " better represents your own personal values " and by 15 points as being " more concerned with the needs of people like you . "
Those attributes help soften the blow for Obama on a variety of issues , none more hazardous than the economy .
Even while just 37 percent think his stimulus has helped , the public nonetheless trusts Obama over the Republicans in Congress to handle the economy by a 15 - point margin , 52 to 37 percent .
The GOP has n't capitalized on his potential vulnerability .
It 's similar on health care , an issue on which Obama has just 47 percent approval overall and , as noted , several specifics produce significant levels of public concern .
For all those , Obama leads the Republicans in Congress in trust to handle health care by 13 points , 50 percent to 37 percent .
HEALTH – The " public option " component of reform is an example of how details matter .
Overall 53 percent in this poll favor a government - backed alternative to private insurance in general , a modest majority down a bit from 57 percent last month .
But support rises sharply , to 72 percent , if the option is limited to people who do not receive insurance from an employer or through the existing Medicare or Medicaid programs , as called for in the House - passed version .
Another popular element of the plan is the employer mandate – that is , requiring all companies with a payroll of at least $ 500,000 either to offer health insurance to their employees or pay money into a government fund that would provide assistance buying insurance to people who can't get it from work .
Sixty - six percent of Americans like the idea .
These are among the elements that counter some significant concerns about reform .
Six in 10 think it's at least somewhat likely that a government plan would force many private insurers out of business because they could n't compete , although fewer , 30 percent , think this is " very " likely .
It matters : Support for reform overall is 34 points lower among those who think a public option would damage private carriers .
Concerns about impacts on cost , in particular , are substantial .
As noted 54 percent of Americans who currently have insurance think changes in the system will raise their costs , and among all adults 56 percent think reform will boost the costs of the health system overall .
Both are strong predictors of opposition to the current reform plans .
( Cost concerns peak among seniors . )
Abortion Coverage and Health Care Reform
Moreover , 37 percent think changes in the system will make their own care worse – a new high , up 5 points from September – while many fewer , 19 percent , think their care will improve .
And there 's an even broader division on the impact on health insurance coverage – 13 percent think it 'll improve , 39 percent worsen .
These , however , leave substantial numbers , 42 and 46 percent , respectively , who think their quality of care and extent of coverage will be unchanged , and in those groups support for reform is substantial , 63 and 67 percent .
There 's also a fairly even split on whether support for reform will make care for " most people " better or worse ( 34 percent vs. 38 percent ) , another factor that mitigates some of reform 's negatives .
Views on abortion coverage also underscore how details matter .
Sixty - one percent say insurance policies bought using government assistance should not be allowed to include coverage for abortions .
But if the insurance companies use private funds , not public money , in providing abortion coverage – the workaround some Democrats have proposed – support for allowing that coverage gains very sharply , up 21 points to 56 percent .
KNOWLEDGE , SUPPORT and VOTE – Given the complexities , it 's perhaps surprising that a majority of Americans , 55 percent , feel they have a good basic understanding of the changes being proposed to the health care system .
And this sense of knowledge works in favor of advocates of change : Support for the reform proposed by Obama and Congress rises to 56 percent among people who feel they understand the proposals , compared with 38 percent support among those who find the changes too complicated to understand clearly .
That said , views continue to break sharply along partisan and ideological lines ; overall support , 75 percent among Democrats , drops to fewer than half of independents , 45 percent , with 52 percent opposed .
Among Republicans a mere 13 percent support the proposal ; not only are 85 percent of Republicans opposed , but are 73 percent " strongly " so .
That helps opponents lead in intensity – among all Americans 39 percent strongly oppose reform , vs. 30 percent strong support .
The direction of that intensity is reflected , modestly , in a measure of vote impact :
Twenty percent say they'd be much more likely to oppose a candidate who backed health care reform , vs. 13 percent much more apt to support one .
Republicans overwhelmingly rate it as a strong negative , but it's also a factor among independents :
Twenty - three percent much more apt to oppose a reform backer , 11 percent much more apt to support one .
Obama Approval : Economy , Afghanistan , Deficit
OTHER ISSUES – Holding the line on health care is far from Obama 's only challenge .
He 's got a precarious 51 percent approval rating on handling the economy , and remains lower on dealing with two other top issues – Afghanistan , 45 percent approval , with 48 percent disapproving ; and handling the deficit , 42 percent approving while 53 percent disapprove .
On handling terrorism , 53 percent approve , but disapproval is up by 7 points to a new high , 41 percent .
There 's also the public 's general woe , fueled chiefly by the economy .
Forty - four percent say the country 's headed in the right direction overall , but a majority , 55 percent , says it 's still seriously off on the wrong track , a number that 's held steady since August after a spate of relative optimism in the spring and early summer .
It could be far worse – " wrong track " is down from a record 90 percent in October 2008 .
But it 's a reflection of the public 's continued economic pain and the hazard that poses for Obama , his in - power party and indeed all incumbents .
Just 38 percent in this poll say they 're inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress ; 50 percent instead are inclined to look around for someone else .
That " look around " number has been higher , peaking at 58 percent before the 1994 elections in which the Republicans took control of the House .
But it 's also been as low as 41 percent .
It 's a reminder that for all the other issues facing the country , as goes the economy , likely goes 2010 .

Shell has become embroiled in a major row with the World Bank and green energy companies after allegations that it is unfairly refusing to honour warranties on solar power systems sold to the developing world .
A widespread breakdown of its equipment in Sri Lanka and elsewhere has left the oil firm accused of abandoning a responsibility to impoverished communities while damaging the prospects of the wider renewable power sector in a world desperate to reduce carbon emissions following the Copenhagen climate change summit .
The rural electrification business under which the Shell systems were sold has now itself been passed on – as have most other parts of the group 's solar business – but critics say that Shell , which made profits of $ 31bn in 2008 , has a continuing role in ensuring former customers are not left vulnerable .
" Shell exited solar on a global basis , seemingly without due consideration to how after - sales service and warranty replacements would be provided , thereby damaging the very local solar industries it had earlier helped to create , " said Damian Miller , a former Shell manager who now heads his own solar business , Orb Energy .
" In Sri Lanka , poor customers with average earnings of $ 1,500 - $ 2,000 a month have bought Shell 's solar systems .
The system is equivalent to 30 % of their annual income , " he added .
" They could only afford a system because they could get a loan from microfinance institutions or other banks .
But now there are reports of thousands of Shell 's [ branded ] solar panels failing in the field and Shell seemingly is not replacing them . "
The World Bank , which provides financing packages to the developing world , said it too was very worried about a situation in which about 700 solar systems appear to have failed and local suppliers risked going out of business .
Anil Cabraal , an energy specialist at the bank 's Washington headquarters , has written to Shell asking for action .
" I would like Shell to honour these commitments .
We are not talking about millions of dollars here but hundreds of thousands , " he told the Observer .
The company argues that it is being unfairly targeted and is doing all it can to sort out the problem .
It points out that its Shell Solar Sri Lanka business has been transferred to a third - party purchaser , Environ Energy , along with all liabilities .
The Anglo - Dutch oil group says the bulk of its former solar module manufacturing operation has also been switched to a new owner , Solar World .
" In October 2007 , Shell sold Shell Solar Lanka Ltd to Environ Energy Global PTE Ltd .
Specifically in order to protect customer interests , the terms of the transaction explicitly covered the management of all past , present and future liabilities , including warranty issues , " said a Shell spokesman in the Hague .
" Environ Energy Global understands that resolution of this issue rests with Environ , but [ its ] own management team in Sri Lanka continues to approach Shell .
We have asked Environ Energy Global to clarify responsibilities with [ its ] own management team in Sri Lanka . "
The situation has been complicated by the fact that Environ claims Solar World will not replace any modules unless it has the appropriate warranty documents .
Environ claims those papers were destroyed by Shell prior to the handover to Solar World , although Shell told the Observer this was not true .
The woman told that she was too stupid to keep her baby boy
The Moses basket sits beside the bed , its new blankets carefully arranged awaiting its owner 's arrival .
Piles of newborn baby clothes - mostly in shades of blue - lie neatly folded on a chair .
Like any new mother , Kerry Robertson spent weeks excitedly preparing for her first child 's arrival - and yet 13 days after his birth , all the carefully arranged baby paraphernalia remains unused .
And yet today Kerry and her partner , Mark McDougall , 25 , will finally be able to lay their son Ben down to sleep in the basket they bought for him with such hope .
Loving mother : Kerry Robertson , 17 , was told she would not be able to bring up her baby son Ben because she has mild learning difficulties
Kerry , who has mild learning difficulties , and Mark went on the run from their home in Fife , Scotland , last November after British social services said she was not clever enough to raise a child .
They hoped that by escaping to Ireland they would be left alone to be a family together .
But when Ben was four days old , social workers caught up with them , marching into the maternity ward and forcing them to hand him over .
Only after a court hearing last Friday were the parents told they will get their child back - albeit under supervision .
Today , Kerry will move into a mother and baby unit where the 17 - year - old will be under constant surveillance - but that is undoubtedly the lesser of two evils for the couple , given that they feared they might lose custody of the child they fought so hard to keep .
' To say it 's been a roller coaster is an understatement , ' says Mark .
' Witnessing them take Ben from Kerry made me cry .
He was sleeping in her arms after his feed and looked so peaceful .
' I tried to argue with them , but they said no .
It 's only after they 've read medical reports from the hospital , in which the midwives and medical staff said we are loving parents , that it appears they 've decided we can have Ben back after all .
' Kerry will be able to care for Ben all day , every day and I 'll be allowed to stay at the unit as often as I like .
' Needless to say , we can't wait to be reunited with our beloved son . '
This is n't the only battle the couple have fought to ensure Kerry leads a normal life .
She has been brought up by her grandmother since she was nine months old , with the care overseen by Fife social services .
But she says that , as an adult , there were no signs of the problems to come until social services heard she was pregnant and getting married .
Devoted : Kerry and partner Mark McDougall , 25 , pose proudly with their baby son .
The couple fled to Ireland after social services said Ben would be taken away
Last September , in an unprecedented step , the couple 's white church wedding was halted just 48 hours beforehand , in a row over whether Kerry was intelligent enough to marry .
Shortly after , Fife social services told the couple they believed that , because of Kerry 's learning difficulties , her unborn baby would be taken into care .
The claim that Kerry is too stupid to get married or have a baby is something she and Mark , an artist , vehemently refute .
' Social services are ruining my life , ' she says .
' First , I was stopped from getting married and then they took my baby . '
Kerry and Mark say she has never even had a formal psychological assessment .
And the couple point out that before Kerry became pregnant herself , she worked as a childcare worker with children at a local school - and in fact , with considerable irony , holds a certificate in child care .
Kerry says : ' It 's true I did n't get many qualifications at school , but I never had very good teaching .
' I did study for my childcare qualification , I can read and write .
I send texts , go on the internet and do everything for myself .
' I usually cook for us .
I chose most of the clothes for our baby and sorted out all the piles of nappies , tubs of baby creams and toys .
I wanted everything to be ready for him when we brought him home . '
Indeed , upon first meeting , Kerry strikes you as no different to many other young woman .
Slim and quirkily dressed , it 's clear that , like anyone of her age , she loves to experiment with make - up and clothes .
Nevertheless , she is painfully shy - it is Mark 's belief that it is this which gives social workers the impression her learning difficulties are worse than they are .
' Social services are ruining my life .
First , I was stopped from getting married and then they took my baby '
But gain her trust and she chats away happily like any other teenager .
In fact , I do n't believe anyone meeting her in a group of young people would even identify learning difficulties .
As for Mark , he has an impressive clutch of GCSEs under his belt , as well as two As in his Highers - the Scottish equivalent of A levels - in art and English .
He is an accomplished artist who makes a reasonable living selling his sketches and charcoal pictures worldwide - he showed me a picture he drew of newborn Ben , and it is a very accurate likeness .
Mark says : ' Neither Kerry nor me have ever had any conviction for cruelty or violence .
I do n't understand why the authorities have treated us like this .'
So what is the truth ?
The Mail , it must be stressed , is not privy to all the information social services hold on this couple .
Kerry admits she is no Einstein , but she seems like any other teenager .
Seeing her with Mark , hand - in - hand on the sofa at their rented house in Ireland , some would say they seem more mature than many young lovers .
Binge - drinking , casual relationships and parties could n't be further from their minds .
Both say they prefer an evening in with friends .
If anything , they could be described as somewhat old - fashioned .
Mark says : ' When we discovered Kerry was pregnant we wanted to get married .
It was important to us that our baby was born to married parents . '
That wedding was set to take place in a church , organised by Mark 's father , who had arranged for the congregation to produce a homemade buffet for their reception .
Although Kerry was brought up in the care of her grandmother , she comes from a close - knit community with a large extended family of aunts and uncles .
Her younger brother , who 's nine , still lives with her grandmother .
The couple met last January through friends .
' I certainly did n't think Kerry had learning difficulties , ' says Mark .
' At first she just seemed quiet , but I soon discovered a quirky sense of humour , and that 's what attracted me to her . '
Family : Ben was born on January 15 weighing 7lb 3oz
By March , they were a couple and the following month Kerry moved into Mark 's one - bedroom flat .
It was shortly after this that Kerry became pregnant .
Kerry says : ' When I told my grandmother I was pregnant , she got a care worker to take me to the GP .
' It was then that the care worker said to me : " You know you wo n't be able to keep this baby do n't you ? " '
Mark adds :
' It was only at this stage I realised how seriously social services viewed Kerry 's so - called condition .
' It was a very upsetting time , as the care worker suggested to Kerry it might be better if she had a termination .
' But neither of us wanted an abortion .
Kerry said she could never do that .'
So the couple pressed on with the pregnancy and , as they heard nothing more from social services , put their worries to the back of their minds .
Mark says : ' When Kerry was three months pregnant , we decided to marry .
' I bought Kerry an engagement ring - a little pink one with a diamond - type stone - and we held a party . '
The pair set the date for the wedding in September .
Mark recalls : ' Kerry had bought her dress , the church was booked , a cake made and the reception organised .
' But two days before , there was a frantic knocking at our front door and we were confronted by two social workers who told us our wedding was illegal .
' Kerry and I were devastated , but we had no option but to cancel our big day . '
It later transpired Fife social services had made the extraordinary step of writing a letter of objection to the registrar , claiming Kerry was too dim to understand her vows .
The couple have since attempted to marry again , but have been told that , as an order is still in place , a wedding is forbidden .
But if that were n't enough , in October , when Kerry was five months pregnant , the couple were called into a meeting with social services and told their baby would be taken into care at birth .
Kerry says : ' I could n't stop crying .
By then , I 'd already found out I was having a little boy and we had decided to name him Ben .
I 'd felt him kick inside me . '
Mark adds : ' There was no mention of trying to help Kerry or give her the chance to be a mum .
' At that time , they said Kerry would be allowed only a few hours with him .
It seemed then he would go to foster parents , and there was the fear he would be adopted and we would lose him for ever .
' T he care worker suggested to Kerry it might be better if she had a termination '
' It did n't seem to matter to social services that we loved one another and wanted to get married . '
The worry was so great that Mark began researching on the internet other cases in which parents had faced losing their babies in this way .
He says : ' I discovered that many couples had been forced to flee the UK and go to other countries where the authorities take a different view and are keen to keep families together .
' It seemed a huge step to take .
Neither Kerry nor myself wanted to leave home , where we had family and support .
But in the end we felt we had no choice . '
The couple decided to go to Ireland , where they believed their case would be looked on more sympathetically .
So in November , having held a tearful farewell gathering - and with just £ 200 in their pockets , a suitcase and a bag of sandwiches made by Kerry - the pair stole out of their house in the dead of night .
The couple made it to Belfast , where they stayed for eight weeks .
' Not having social workers knocking on our doors , wanting meetings all the time , was fantastic , ' says Mark .
' For the first time in Kerry 's pregnancy , we could enjoy it . '
The pair were financed by friends and family - although Mark continued to sell his artwork .
' I missed my grandma , my little brother and my family terribly , ' says Kerry .
' It was hard to be away from them at Christmas .
But I consoled myself that it would be worth it .
I could hold Ben in my arms and not worry he would be taken . '
Kerry and Mark made the final leg of their journey to Waterford in the Republic of Ireland - which is not governed by UK laws - two weeks after Christmas , with the birth of the baby looming .
Accomplished artist : Mark drew a sketch of his son while in hospital
There , with the help of a donation from a secret benefactor , they were able to find a safe house .
Mark recalls : ' We rented a beautiful little house .
Waterford is a seaside resort and we decided to make a new life there . '
On Friday , January 15 at 8.41 pm , their hopes were realised when , after a natural labour , Ben was finally born .
The happy couple took photos of their 7lb 3 oz bundle .
And for three days all appeared to be well .
Mark visited the hospital daily , and close friends who knew where they were sent congratulations cards .
Meanwhile , Kerry took to breastfeeding and caring for Ben without any problems .
Behind the scenes , however , social workers were gearing up to strike .
Through medical records , the Irish authorities had discovered that social workers in Fife had an interest in Kerry .
' It seems they contacted Fife , who told them they feared because of Kerry 's " disability " our baby could suffer physical or emotional neglect , ' explains Mark .
The following Monday , the couple were told a social worker would visit them the next day , and at that point they were not unduly concerned .
' We are honest , so we were happy to co-operate fully , ' says Mark .
' We would have been pleased to be monitored .
' Even putting Kerry into a home for new mums with babies so she could prove she can be a good mother would have been fine .
' We understood that the Irish social workers needed to make their own inquiries , and were perfectly happy to do whatever it took to keep Ben . '
So they were totally unprepared when , at the 9.15 am meeting on the Tuesday , they were forced to hand over their baby .
Since then he has been looked after by foster carers .
They have been allowed two - hourly visits with Ben .
But even now , as they 're about to be reunited with their baby , there is no denying that the episode has been highly distressing .
Kerry says : ' I was so upset when I saw him the first time with the social workers because he had a dummy in his mouth .
' I told them I did n't want him having a dummy .
And he is being bottle fed , but I wanted to breastfeed him .
' I 'm just so happy that I 'll be with my baby .
I do n't know how long I 'll be at the unit .
I 'll miss Mark if he 's not allowed to stay over - but Ben comes first . '
There 's no denying that she and Mark sincerely hope today heralds the start of life as a normal , happy family .
SHANGHAI — A large oil spill in northwest China has heavily polluted a tributary of the Yellow River , and threatens to reach one of the country ’s longest and most important sources of water .
China ’s state - run news media said late Saturday that a “ large amount ” of diesel oil had leaked out of a pipeline last Thursday in Shaanxi Province .
The government has not explained why the report of the spill was not released until late Saturday .
But Xinhua , the official state news agency , said the leak was caused by construction work and that a crew of 700 people was struggling to contain the damage from what Shaanxi officials said was about 150,000 liters , or about 40,000 gallons , of diesel oil .
The damaged pipeline belongs to the China National Petroleum Corporation , one of the country ’s state - owned oil giants and the parent company of PetroChina .
The company did not specify on Saturday exactly how much oil was spilled but said that it had shut down the pipeline .
The company also said that “ much of the leaked oil and polluted silt has already been taken away . ”
But government officials in Shaanxi province said on Saturday that oil has been detected far downstream from the leak and warned local residents not to use water in the region .
There 's a scene in the hit disaster epic 2012 when John Cusack outruns a monstrous dust cloud from a volcanic explosion at Yellowstone National Park , as red - hot lava spews thousands of feet into the air and fireballs annihilate the surrounding landscape .
Cusack outrunning a dust cloud that size is a fantasy .
The Yellowstone super volcano is not .
Much of Yellowstone National Park , which straddles the states of Wyoming , Idaho and Montana , sits on one of the largest volcanoes on the planet , and when ( not if ) it erupts , it 'll be messy .
About 15 kilometres below the park , in a magma chamber 85 kilometres wide , a restless molten blob is bubbling and oozing like neon taffy .
The pressurized heat and gases from this chamber are what cause Old Faithful and its more erratic brethren to spout .
The volcano has erupted three times in the last 2.1 million years , forming the series of calderas ( underground chambers ) illustrated here .
The last eruption , 640,000 years ago , blasted a pillar of ash 100,000 feet in the air , leaving a hole in the ground larger than the Greater Toronto area .
It devastated everything within a 50 - kilometre radius .
The plume spread layers of dust across North America as far as the Gulf of Mexico .
Meanwhile , a haze of sulphur dioxide mixed with water vapours was propelled into the earth 's atmosphere , blotting out the sun .
A period of global cooling cancelled summer – and whatever primitive barbecues may have been planned – for at least a year , maybe more .
The volcano is still very active , rising and falling under pressure at a noticeable rate for the last quarter century .
The Yellowstone plateau has risen seven centimetres a year for the last three years , bulging like the belly of some gassy , lethargic monster .
Scientists agree : this volcano will one day blow its top .
Will yellowstone erupt within our lifetimes ?
Despite current seismic hyperactivity and occasional news reports spelling out a volcano - provoked apocalypse , experts say there 's nothing to worry about .
" We do n't think that anything going on right now indicates an eruption is coming anytime soon , " says Jake Lowenstern , scientist - in - chief at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory , one of five in the U.S. which monitor volcanoes for scientific purposes and public safety .
No one has ever seen an eruption as big as Yellowstone 's could be .
All suppositions are based on blasts a tenth of the size , that history has recorded .
" It 's of dubious information content of what would or would not happen because we do n't ultimately know , " Lowenstern says .
The Yellowstone observatory was founded in 2001 to monitor the volcano 's erratic behaviour with seismographs and other devices plugged deep into the earth , with antennas poking from the surface like metal flowers .
They feed information to researchers across the U.S. via satellite .
While an eruption is unlikely to come soon , earthquakes happen all the time .
In 1959 , a 7.5 magnitude quake adjacent to the park killed 28 people .
Last Christmas , hundreds of small quakes kept geologists on their toes — they were the most energetic earthquake " swarms " to occur in the park in decades .
It 's no 2012 fantasy that the Earth could hiccup and shudder at any moment , and before we know it mountains could be levelled or cities buried in ash .
Scientists say they could predict an eruption by days or even months ; an earthquake by not so much .
" Nobody ever knows with absolute certainty anything in science , " Lowenstern says .
" We are quite good at forecasting eruptions around the world , but it 's a little trickier at a place like Yellowstone because it 's very active . "
Being warned may not matter .

Even a " small " Yellowstone eruption would be well beyond our current acquaintance with what volcanoes are capable of .
The worst might not come first .
Toronto would see a sprinkling of dust and possibly a few weeks of spectacular sunsets .
Then , with the rest of the planet , we 'd feel the climatic effects – forests and wildlife under stress , disruption of agriculture for years .
Summers would be cancelled , barbecues and all .
The Earth wo n't end .
But humanity . . . well , the films can speculate on that .
Hating on Haiti : Is Pat Robertson Gods gift to Journalists ?
Lately I have been running a vague kind of vox pop of my most interesting and informed friends to discover the news sources they favour .
I have been doing this to combat my perpetual suspicion that somewhere there is an ultimate website , newspaper , or magazine that in one fell swoop will imbue me with great understanding and mind bending perspective on all of the most salient happenings around the world .
So far I remain a slave to trawling the usual suspects .
Day to day this is mildly unsatisfying on a fairly general level , however when I am actively looking for real information about a specific event , the paucity of the global media machine becomes violently apparent .
The recent earthquake in Haiti is a case in point .
Highly esteemed publication after highly esteemed publication trotted out identikit stories with the same quotes , the same non factual facts and the same inane technical information of little interest to anyone but the random geologist they managed to dig up for said inane technical fact , in order to disguise the actual fact that essentially no one knew much at all .
But then to rescue of well - meaning journalists pandering to the news hungry masses everywhere came the crazy religious people .
Pat Robertson , an American televangelist , has ramped up reporting on the issue greatly , by suggesting , none too subtly , that the earthquake was punishment from God because of a pact the Haitians made with the Devil in order to get rid of the French .
Oh yes he did .
He describes how “ They were under the heel of the French , you know , Napoleon the third and whatever .
And they got together and swore a pact to the devil .
They said ‘ We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince . ’
True story .
And so the devil said , ‘ Ok it ’s a deal . ’
And they kicked the French out .
The Haitians revolted and got themselves free .
But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another . ”
He goes on to note that the relatively success of the Dominican Republic , which neighbours Haiti , is evidence that there is a biblical curse that has been brought down on Haiti alone .
He then suggests that people ought to donate money to him to help the Haitians .
But of course .
Now Pat Robertson is renowned for tripping the light fantastic a little when it comes to relating his views to minor issues like , say , reality .
My personal favourite is a quote he made way back in 1992 opining that “ The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women .
It is about a socialist , anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands , kill their children , practice witchcraft , destroy capitalism and become lesbians . ”
Why yes Pat , yes it is .
But his growing penchant for preying on global tragedies as fodder for pushing his outlandish views smacks of either mental illness or the most terrible lack of humanity .
Michael Rowe of the Huffington Post reflects that Robertson is “ Writing horror stories in the blood of innocent victims of a monstrous natural occurrence–again .
” Yet Rowe optimistically suggests that the very appallingness of these comments might lead to a reassesment of the role of the religious industry in America .
The sad thing is , even if Pat Robertson takes the entirety of religious crankery down with him in a blaze of bigotry and narrow mindedness , he has already made a mockery of a tragic event , and further victimized people who already have a surfeit of suffering to deal with .

Something went wrong .
Contact us about the problem .
What happened in Baranchinsky , population 11,000 , says much about the consensus Russia reached in 2009 .
Business did not want to spend money ; workers did not want to relocate ; the government did not want the political instability that comes with unemployment and was able to pay huge sums to stave it off .
This consensus has kept much of Russia in a state of suspension , just when the economy would seem to demand change , said Natalya V. Zubarevich , an analyst at the Moscow - based Independent Institute for Social Policy .
“ This is a kind of quarantine , in which people simply wait until the end of the crisis , ” she said .
“ The authorities are doing everything they can to support inefficient employment . ”
As for most people , she added , “ they just want things to be the way they were . ”

The Kremlin has been scrambling to address the future of places like Baranchinsky , where a single factory supplies heat , income and social security .
Credit ... James Hill for The New York Times
A central road runs through Baranchinsky and comes to a stop at the gate of the Electro - mechanical Factory .
At the start of a shift , workers  mostly women  stream in as if inhaled by a giant lung , and nine hours later , they stream out , having changed their work clothes for fur coats and boots with kitten heels .
This rhythm has repeated itself since 1763 , when Catherine the Great commissioned the factory to make artillery shells .
But something changed with the fall of Communism .
Defense orders vanished , and as the plant adjusted to the civilian market for electric motors and generators , there were periods when workers were paid in shoes , or not at all .
Baranchinsky survived the 1990s , but life had become a roller coaster of good years and bad ones .
People in town blame Pavel Fedulov , a local oligarch who bought the factory in 2001 .
Mr. Fedulov snapped up dozens of local enterprises , and critics say he milked the factory of profits and invested nothing in its antiquated infrastructure .
( Some machine tools were brought back from Germany as booty after World War II , workers said . )
The plant was also hampered by age  it still produces its own fittings in an in - house foundry and smithy , a necessity during wartime  and faced rising competition from China and Europe .
Most clients ask the same questions .
For many , the first is “ what will it cost ? ” ( even though you have not discussed their requirements ) .
The next will be “ can you get me to number 1 in Google for < term X > ? ” ( where X is normally a common word such as ‘ shop ’ ) .
Finally , they ’ll ask “ can I add pages and change the content ? ”
This last question is probably the easiest to answer .
There is a bewildering array of Content Management Systems including WordPress , Joomla , MODx , Drupal , TextPattern , and Frog .
A CMS can be useful for any website that exceeds a few pages and you can certainly find appropriate software that matches the client ’s requirements and IT literacy .
I suspect many developers provide a system they know but customize it according to the client ’s wishes .
It ’s the usual story .
You install the CMS , integrate plugins , create a custom theme , and add the client ’s initial content .
You then provide several hours training and give the client useful advice about keywords and the problems they ’ll inevitably encounter when pasting from Microsoft Word .
Following the last payment check , you wish them well on their web journey .
A week later , you notice the client has made one or two changes , but trashed the formatting or removed vital information .
Being conscientious , you contact them , fix the issues , and offer a little free advice .
Then … nothing .
The weeks and months pass by but the site is never updated again .
There are several contributing factors :
Clients are busy running their own business .
If they ’re not actively trading online , they have few compelling reasons to update their site on a regular basis .
The majority of people have modest IT skills .
Unless they use a system regularly , they will forget their training and be wary about breaking something .
Many CMSs have glorious interfaces , but they can be daunting , appear technical , use jargon , and offer too many options .
I ’m sure many people believe they will regularly add content but discover it involves more work than they initially suspected .
But does it matter if your client avoids their CMS ?
Absolutely : you have sold them a system that does not meet their requirements .
Few clients understand their requirements , but a good web development agency will guide them through the options and recommend the most cost - effective solution .
There are web agencies who provide 1,001 features and inevitably make more initial profit .
However , a short - term gain can become a long - term loss if a client does not understand what they are buying .
How can they recommend the agency ’s services ?
The next time you ’re assessing a client ’s requirements , ask them if they ’re genuinely willing to commit several hours every week writing and updating their content .
If they ’re not , perhaps you should sell them content reviews and ongoing maintenance rather than a CMS and associated training .
Do the majority your clients use their CMS or do you do the work for them ?
The royal family says it has a right to privacy in everyday private activities The Queen has issued a strong warning to newspapers not to publish paparazzi pictures of the Royal Family .
Her lawyers have reminded papers of their obligations under the industry 's own code of practice amid concern about invasions of privacy .
Photographers will be monitored on public roads around the Sandringham estate in Norfolk this Christmas .
Prince Charles 's spokesman said the Royal Family had a right to privacy during " everyday private activities " .
The Prince of Wales 's spokesman Paddy Harverson said : " Members of the Royal Family feel they have a right to privacy when they are going about everyday , private activities .
" They recognise there is a public interest in them and what they do , but they do not think this extends to photographing the private activities of them and their friends . "
' Public interest '
In the past freelance photographers have spent many hours touring Sandringham to try and " snatch " pictures of the family on the estate .
Ingrid Seward , editor in chief at Majesty magazine , said it had become " very intense " over the past few years .
This is very much a warning shot across the bows
BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt
Royals ' difficult history with paparazzi " They all want a picture of William and Kate out shooting , and not necessarily for the British papers , but , you know , these pictures make a lot of money abroad . "
Prince William has expressed concern after he and Kate Middleton were " aggressively " pursued by the paparazzi in 2007 .
And some still blame the paparazzi for their role in the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , in a Paris car crash a decade earlier .
BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said legal action , possibly on the grounds of harassment , was a long way off but could be taken if the royal appeals are ignored .
He said : " This is very much a warning shot across the bows .
After years of turning a blind eye , senior royals have decided to take a more robust approach to what they see as unjustified intrusion . "
Graham Smith of the anti-monarchy campaign group , Republic , said the Royal Family must remain open to scrutiny .
" Given the high level of secrecy already surrounding the monarchy the press must be allowed to pursue stories and take photos if there is genuine news value or public interest , " he said .
The Royal Family " routinely use the media " and so they " cannot have it both ways " , he added .

In the Bronx Zoo's Monkey House , squirrel monkeys receive a holiday treat unlike anything they 've seen - or felt - before .
The ability of UK police to use " arbitrary " counter - terror stop and search powers against peace protesters and photographers lay in tatters today after a landmark ruling by the European court of human rights .
The Strasbourg court ruled it was unlawful for police to use the powers , under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , to stop and search people without needing any grounds for suspicion .
The widely - drawn ruling said that not only the use of the counter - terror powers , but also the way they were authorised , were " neither sufficiently circumscribed , nor subject to adequate legal safeguards against abuse " .
The use of these powers has grown fourfold , from 33,177 times in 2004 to more than 117,200 in 2008 .
The Metropolitan police have used them most , but 11 other forces in England and Wales also make routine use of them .
A political furore ensued when it was disclosed that the whole of Greater London had been secretly designated for stop and search without suspicion since 2001 .
The case ruled on today was brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton , who were stopped by police while their way to a demonstration outside the annual arms fair at the Excel centre , in London 's Docklands , in September 2003 .
Quinton , a journalist , was ordered to stop filming the protest despite showing her press card , while Gillan , who was riding his bicycle , was only allowed to go on his way after 20 minutes .
They were awarded € 33,850 ( £ 30,400 ) in costs and expenses .
The European judges said the power to search a person 's clothing and belongings in public included an element of humiliation and embarrassment which was a clear interference with the right to privacy .
But they also criticised the way in which the police use of stop and search powers was authorised .
There is no requirement that the powers be considered " necessary " – only " expedient " .
The use of the powers is subject to confirmation by the home secretary within 48 hours , renewable after 28 days , but the European court said there was no real check on authorisations by parliament or the courts .
This was demonstrated by the continuous renewal , every 28 days , of the use of the powers in London since their first introduction , the judges added .
They said they were further concerned that the decision to stop and search somebody was " based exclusively on the ' hunch ' or ' professional intuition ' of the police officer " .
The sole condition was that the search had to look for articles used in connection with terrorism – but this covered many things commonly carried by people in the street .
Police did not even have to have grounds for suspecting such articles were present .
The judges said that , because of this , there was a " clear risk of arbitrariness in granting such broad discretion " to a police officer .
Their concerns were compounded by the fact that black and Asian people were four times more likely to be stopped under section 44 and there was a risk that the power could be misused against demonstrators .
" The absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised , " the judges said in describing the lack of judicial checks .
As such , section 44 was not in " accordance with the law " and amounted to a violation of article eight – the right to respect for private and family life .
Quinton told the Guardian she was delighted with the judgment , saying : " There has to be a balance between private life and security .
" The court has shown that section 44 is an invasion of people 's right to liberty and privacy .
Hopefully the government will have to put a fairer law in place to protect us . "
Gillan hailed the ruling as " fantastic news after a long struggle " and added : " I look to the government for a strong response . "
Corinna Ferguson , the legal officer for Liberty and acting for the two , said : " Liberty has consistently warned the government about the dangers of stop and search without suspicion and actively campaigned for the tightening up of the infamous section 44 power .
" The public , police and court of human rights all share our concerns for privacy , protest , race equality and community solidarity that come with this sloppy law .
" In the coming weeks parliamentarians must finally sort out this mess . "
The shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , said : " We have long said that anti-terror laws should not be used as a way of conducting normal day - to - day policing .
" The government needs to make sure that the police have the appropriate powers to deal with crime and antisocial behaviour . "

Instead of going to an underwhelming children ’s movie — where you can easily spend $ 70 for two adults , two kids , and some popcorn and drinks — go for a hike instead .
Yes , I know this is easy for Californians to do year - round .
( On Christmas Eve , my family hiked to a cove and looked for shells and sea anemones . )
But if you live in colder climates , bundle up the kiddos , fill a thermos with hot chocolate , and go for a short nature walk .
If it ’s snowing , go sledding or make snow angels or snowmen .
Just get out and breathe some fresh air !
Go to a Museum
Check out your local science or history museum .
My eight - year - old son loved going to the California Science Center ( where admission is free ) , and , surprisingly , he enjoyed playing with his one - year - old brother there the most .
The center has a toddler area where the two kids had a blast together , playing with blocks , climbing on structures , looking at snakes and turtles , and so on .
It was wonderful to see the two of them having fun and playing together in a learning environment .
If you live in a smaller city , do a little research — my sister lives in a very small town in North Carolina , and I was surprised to find an animal safari , train museum , and air and space museum there .
Plan a Game Night
Kids love game night .
It ’s simple and timeless , and just good , clean fun .
My rules , however , are no TVs , laptop computers , BlackBerries , iPhones , or cell phones on .
Pull out the Scrabble or Monopoly board , pop some popcorn , and enjoy !
Host an International Night
Just because you ca n’t afford to jet - set with your family this year does n’t mean you ca n’t experience different cultures .
Once a month , explore another country ’s cuisine and traditions .
For instance , if it ’s French night , plan a typical French dinner and dessert and have the whole family help you cook .
Learn a few French phrases , pull out the map , discuss various traditions , look at old photos if you and your partner have ever been to France , and later watch a French film — one that ’s approved for the kids , of course .
This activity will range in cost , depending on what you decide to cook and how many ingredients you have in your pantry , but rest assured , it will be much cheaper than going to a nice restaurant and the theater , which can easily set you back more $ 150 for a family of four .
Create a Photo Album Together
In this day of online albums , it ’s still nice to create brag books for grandparents or cherished - memory books .
Take out your boxes of printed photos and ask your kids and your partner to help you sort through baby pictures , silly vacation pictures , holiday pictures , and so on .
You ’ll be amazed at how much you find to celebrate .
Little girls especially love scrapbooking , but I find that boys also like to see photos from their childhood and fun times — perhaps inspiring Dad to go on another camping trip .
The cost of this project is typically how much you want to spend on photo albums ( if you do n’t have any lying around the house ) , as well as on printing photos if all of yours are online .
I ’d suggest going to Target or Walmart , where you can find attractive photo albums for less than $ 20 each .
Have a Sunday Picnic
Weather permitting , of course , pack the picnic basket with goodies and bring a Frisbee , football , coloring books , and the newspaper , and just enjoy being together at a local park or other favorite spot .
Take a Group Class / Lesson
Sign the whole family up for a class that involves something new for everyone .
If you ’re a member of the YMCA , for example , you could sign up for an inexpensive family rock - climbing lesson .
Your local library may have free classes and events as well .
For instance , mine hosts free concerts , story times , classic - film clubs , and book clubs .
Organize a Movie Night
Although it may seem simple and not terribly unique , kids love movie night .
Debbie Lieberthal of Thousand Oaks , California , says her two children , ages three and six , adore going to the store and picking out a film and buying candy and desserts .
“ At home we make popcorn , get into our pajamas , light the fireplace , and cuddle under one or two big blankets while watching a movie .
The kids love it , and we really enjoy the cuddle time .
The whole thing costs maybe $ 15 total ; the movie is $ 5 , plus desserts . ”
Volunteer with Your Church or a Local Charity
This is a fun way to connect with your family and help others who may be struggling more than you are .
It ’s also a healthy reminder to your children of what they have to be thankful for .
Go Camping
If you already have a tent and the other required gear , a weekend camping getaway will cost you the price of the campsite , travel , and food .
I reserved a spot at Joshua Tree National Park for a weekend , and the total reservation fee was $ 30 .
We ’ll drive there from Los Angeles , with enough food for two days , and expect to spend $ 150 total .
For a weekend away , that ’s not too shabby .

Renault has appointed Bob Bell as its new stand - in team principal in the wake of the departure of Flavio Briatore for his involvement in the Singapore Grand Prix race - fix controversy .
Bell , who was the team 's technical director , will take charge in the temporary restructure that will remain in place until the end of the season .
He will also be the outfit 's chief technical officer .
As part of the reshuffle forced about by the events of recent weeks , Jean - François Caubet , currently director of marketing and communications , will become the team 's managing director .
A statement issued by Renault said about Bell and Caubet : " They will both report to Bernard Rey , President of the Renault F1 Team .
" Bob Bell will attend all the remaining races of the season and will be the team 's spokesperson on all sporting and technical matters .
" The Renault F1 Team is now ready to concentrate on the future and wishes to stress that no further comments or statements will be issued relating to the events of Singapore 2008 . "
Bell , who started out in the aviation industry before arriving in Formula 1 with McLaren in 1982 , first joined Renault when it was still known as Benetton in 1997 .
Following a brief period with Jordan , he returned to the now Renault factory squad as technical director in 2002 , overseeing the team 's world championship triumphs of 2005 and 2006 , and working under engineering director Pat Symonds , who like Briatore departed last week due to the Singapore scandal .
" My groin is bothering me a bit .
I wo n't be playing tonight .
It 's something that 's been bothering me for three or four days and I 'm going to sit this one out . "
-- Sidney Crosby
Penguins captain Sidney Crosby will not play Saturday night in a showdown with the Chicago Blackhawks due to a groin injury .
" My groin is bothering me a bit , " Crosby said .
" I wo n't be playing tonight .
It 's something that 's been bothering me for three or four days and I 'm going to sit this one out .
" When it 's getting worse each day , it 's not a good sign .
I 've missed periods of time over the last few years with groin ( injuries ) and I kind of know when it 's time to take a step back and make sure that I 'm careful .
I feel like I 'm at that point .

Police yesterday busted two of the hipster Brooklyn cyclists who repainted whole sections of Williamsburg bike lanes the city had just removed at the request of the neighborhood ’s Hasidic community .
Quinn Hechtropf , 26 and Katherine Piccochi , 24 — who surrendered hours after posting a video of the guerilla public - works operation on YouTube — allegedly used paint rollers and stencils to recreate all the markings that had been sandblasted away .
“ We ’re self - hating Jewish hipsters , ” Hechtropf joked last night as the two walked out of the 90th Precinct with desk - appearance tickets .
“ They handcuffed us , ” Piccochi complained .
Both were hit with criminal - mischief charges as well as a violation for defacing the street .
The neighborhood patrol Shomrim grabbed Hechtropf and Piccochi in the incident at 3:30 a.m. Monday .
Cops took their names but at the time did not arrest them .
“ The cops told them they would n’t get arrested , but the police must have come under pressure by the Hasidim , ” said Baruch Herzfeld , the unofficial spokesman for the pro-bike - lane group .
Detectives asked them to come in to the precinct and they did , accompanied by a lawyer .
Cyclists have decried the removal of the bike lanes , but many Hasidic residents had complained that all the bikers whizzing by posed both safety and spiritual risks to the community .
Many of the hipster cyclists wear too little clothing for the Hasids , who are not supposed to stare at members of the opposite sex and wanted the enticement removed .
Herzfeld contends the activists were comprised of both Hasidic and hipster riders unhappy with the removal of the 14 - block bike lane .
On the video , the team is shown repainting the lanes with rollers as a pulsating rhythm plays in the background .
They used a stencil and spray paint to recreate a bicyclist icon on the roadbed at Bedford Avenue and Williamsburg Street .
The group ’s message appears in white text on a black background :
“ We are New York City bicyclists and our message is clear .
Do n’t take away our bike lanes .
We use this stretch of Bedford Avenue because it is a direct route to the Williamsburg Bridge .
“ We will continue to use it whether or not there is a bike lane here , but not having one puts us at greater risk from cars . ”
The statement says the group will restore the lane markings if they ’re removed again .
And the city Transportation Department said it will remove any unauthorized markings .
Hasidic residents complain they are being portrayed as the enemy , when it is the cyclists who are breaking the law .
“ That unauthorized painting on New York City property is unlawful , but that is overlooked because it ’s committed against the terrible Hasidim , ” Moshe Goldberger said .

With loopholes big enough to drive a cement truck through , Obama will propose three - year spending freeze .
Looking to signal at least one step toward reining in huge federal budget deficits , President Barack Obama will propose a three - year freeze in non-security discretionary spending , senior administration officials said Monday .
His budget proposal , to be unveiled in part with Wednesday 's State of the Union speech and in detail next week , will urge Congress to keep overall spending at $ 447 billion a year for agencies other than those charged with national security and mandatory - spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare .
The freeze would take effect with the 2011 fiscal year starting Oct. 1 , and would n't affect the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan already being implemented , the officials said .
It also would n't affect a $ 154 billion jobs plan pending before Congress and backed by Obama , the officials said .
One aide said that plan would be exempt because it would take effect this year , before the freeze .
Administration officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to not upstage the president , said that the three - year freeze would save $ 250 billion over a decade — if it 's approved by an election - year Congress .
After three years , the total spent would be the lowest as a percentage of the total economy in 50 years .
Spending on those agencies has increased by an average of 5 percent a year since 1993 , the officials said .
Still , officials acknowledged that the savings would n't come close to eliminating the deficit and balancing the budget .
" We 're not here to tell you we 've solved the deficit , " one official said .
Exemptions
The $ 154 billion jobs plan pending before Congress

Anjem Choudary is the group 's spokesman in the UK A radical Islamist group that planned a march through Wootton Bassett will be banned under counter - terrorism laws , Home Secretary Alan Johnson has said .
Islam4UK had planned the protest at the Wiltshire town to honour Muslims killed in the Afghanistan conflict .
The government had been considering outlawing the group under its original name , al - Muhajiroun .
A spokesman for Islam4UK told the BBC it was an " ideological and political organisation " , and not a violent one .
Mr Johnson said : " I have today laid an order which will proscribe al - Muhajiroun , Islam4UK , and a number of the other names the organisation goes by .
" It is already proscribed under two other names - al - Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect .
" Proscription is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism and is not a course we take lightly .

More from Today programme Analysis : Banning terror groups
" We are clear that an organisation should not be able to circumvent proscription by simply changing its name . "
Under the Terrorism Act 2000 , a group can be banned if it " commits or participates in acts of terrorism , prepares for , promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism " .
Groups can also be outlawed if they " unlawfully glorify the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism " .
Islam4UK spokesman Anjem Choudary told BBC Radio 4 : " What the people will see is if you do n't agree with the government and you want to expose their foreign policy , then freedom quickly dissipates and turns into dictatorship . "
He denied Islam4UK members were involved in violence : " I challenge anyone to authentically prove that any of our members have been involved in any violent activities or promoting violent activities or asking anyone to carry out any sort of military operations .
" We are always at pains to stress that we are an ideological and political organisation .
' Whatever price necessary ' Please turn on JavaScript .

" We wo n't be using those names and those platforms which have been proscribed , but I can't stop being a Muslim , I can't stop propagating Islam , I can't stop praying , I can't stop calling for the Sharia .
" That 's something I must do , and ultimately I will pay whatever price I need to for my belief . "
Speaking from Lebanon , Omar Bakri Muhammad , founder of al - Muhajiroun , told the BBC the decision to ban the group would " increase the popularity of al - Muhajiroun " and " force them underground " .
On Sunday Islam4UK cancelled the march , saying it had " successfully highlighted the plight of Muslims in Afghanistan " .
The banning order will come into effect on Thursday and make it a criminal offence to be a member , punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
Ordinary Muslim organisations have long regarded al - Muhajiroun as harming community relations - but they were split on whether or not a ban would be beneficial .
Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain , said that he would shed no tears - but he feared a ban would play into al - Muhajiroun 's hands who would present themselves as the victims .
But Muslim campaign group Minhaj - ul - Quran UK said the government had done the right thing .
" We support the ban on the extremist groups but suggest banning extremist individuals too as they will appear again with a different name , " said spokesman Shahid Mursaleen .
" The Government must promote a voice of moderation in order to get rid of the extremist tendencies in our society . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling welcomed the decision to ban Islam4UK , saying Conservatives had been calling for the government to act .
He said : " We cannot permit any group which propagates the views of banned international preachers of hate and organises hate - filled public protests to operate in Britain .
" Now ministers need to look at how they are going to ban other groups in the UK which are part of broader international networks of extremism .

The suicide bomber who killed eight people at a US base in eastern Afghanistan last week was a triple agent brought to the outpost after offering information to catch a leading al - Qaida aide .
The attack at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost province killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer said to have brought the bomber , a Jordanian doctor , to the spy agency outpost .
US news agencies , citing intelligence sources , identified the attacker as Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al - Balawi , a 36 - year - old doctor from the town of Zarqa , Jordan .
Balawi was arrested by Jordanian intelligence more than a year ago on suspicion of extremist sympathies , then apparently agreed to support the US in its fight against al - Qaida .
Jordanian authorities believed Balawi had reformed and handed him over to the CIA so that he could infiltrate al - Qaida in Afghanistan .
He was invited to the remote base on the restive border with Pakistan after offering urgent information to help locate Ayman al - Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden 's deputy , Associated Press reported .
Officials said he was not searched for bombs when he entered the base .
A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment .
The latest account of the attack contradicted a statement by the Taliban soon after the blast , which was said to have occurred as CIA officers began questioning Balawi at the base .
A Taliban spokesman initially said the attacker was a sympathiser in the Afghan national army .
The CIA has vowed to avenge the attack , which killed four CIA officers , including the base 's female chief , and three contract security guards .
Shortly after the attack , Barack Obama sent a letter of condolence to CIA employees , saying the spy agency has been tested " as never before " since the September 11 attacks .
The letter , which was released to the White House press corps , was criticised for its open acknowledgement of the secretive CIA 's role in the Afghanistan war .
The attack was the biggest loss of life for the CIA since the 1983 bombing of the agency 's Beirut station , which killed 17 officers .
Zarqa , a bleak industrial town north - east of the Jordanian capital Amman , has spawned other killers .
In 2006 , a man from the town killed a British tourist and wounded five others when he opened fire on a tour group in Amman .
Zarqa was also the hometown of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the self - styled leader of al - Qaida in Iraq who was killed by a US air strike in 2006 .
The attack has occurred as the US is sending 30,000 more troops to the country , bringing the total number of its forces to about 100,000 .
Last year was the deadliest for US and Nato forces since the Taliban were overthrown by US - backed Afghan forces in late 2001 .
Bin Laden and Zawahiri , also a doctor , are said to have taken refuge in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan after the US invasion .

Apple , Microsoft and Palm
ChangeWave surveyed 4068 consumers in the first weeks of December and found that 21 per cent of people looking to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days want to buy one running on Android .
That ’s up from 6 per cent when ChangeWave asked people in September .
We ca n’t deny that Google is one of the top global brands and knowing how powerful it is on the online world , bringing its online dominance on your hand through its smartphone –is what consumers are really looking and excited for .
Plus , considering Verizon is spending tens of millions marketing the Droid this should n’t come as surprise .
However , Apple ’s iPhone remains unseated getting the 28 percent of smartphone choice , Blackberry although increased at 18 percent comes short at third place and Palm still need to cope up getting at the bottom .
Although we ca n’t speculate right now to what extent Nexus One and Android OS will take on iPhone ’s share , Apple has grown much considering its billion downloads and thousands of iPhone applications which I think Google needs a lot of works to cope up .
Do you prefer Android - based device or you still want an iPhone ?

Rosner liked high school a lot .
After graduating with a ( then ) IQ score of 170 in 1978 , he later successfully fooled school officials by repeating the twelfth grade four times .
From 1979 to 1987 , he returned as a valid senior four times using false IDs , prosthetics and makeup .
On why he did this , he says :
High school 's attractive to me , not necessarily because you have a good time , but because it 's clear why you are miserable .
As opposed to real life - post - high - school life - you can be miserable and not have a clear idea what makes you miserable .
Dissatisfactions are more vague , more amorphous .
( High school 's ) an abridged version of real life , and its abridgment adds clarity , and that clarity is comforting .
It 's also interesting to note that he got away with one of his fake IDs using the alias Gilligan Rich Rosner .
Gilligan
Who Wants To Be A Genius ?
The event that catapulted Rick 's life into the spotlight happened on a show that was simultaneously spotlight
and
knowledge heavy .
This show asked viewers if anyone in the crowd would perchance want to have a lot of money .
After numerous tries to get on the show , Rick was finally in the hot seat .
He was sailing along on the questions and felt really good until a relatively easy - level question messed him up .
He guessed according to his logic , and lost .
He then sued the producers after sending three detailed letters to them explaining his case .
The question was : " What capital city is located at the highest altitude above sea level ? " and the choices were :
A. Mexico City B. Quito
C. Bogotá D. Kathmandu
The reasons Rosner lays out in those letters are spot - on critiques of the semantics of the question and its relative difficulty compared to all other questions asked at that level , but he never got anywhere with his suit .
A sample of his correspondence : " I ’m sorry to keep sending you letters .
I ’m not a grievance - oriented person , but a little research led me to a surprising amount of information indicating that it is an unacceptably - flawed question . "
15 Minutes Late ?
I do think Mr. Rosner has a strong love affair going with the celebrity dance .
Aside from his appearances ( often in the nude ) on cable TV shows like The Man Show , Jimmy Kimmel and Crank Yankers , he 's also appeared on a show called Obsessed , and took jobs guaranteed to draw attention to himself .
Clearly this is someone eager for the 15 minutes of fame he thinks he deserves , but I also see a real human being , one who is acting naturally to the stimuli .
He also got steamed at Domino's when they featured him in this commercial , somehow managing to spell his last name wrong in the graphics ( Rossner ) .
Errol Morris ' First Person
I imagine he is a pretty complicated character who does n't understand himself that well .
He 's in the grip of all this stuff that he cannot control .
Is there such a thing as " too smart " or perhaps too smart for your own good ?
Bruce G. Charlton states a common observation that " high IQ types are lacking in ‘ common sense ’ – and especially when it comes to dealing with other human beings .
" This is a statement that could easily be exemplified by Rick Rosner .
Despite a high IQ and a firm grasp on a litany of subjects , including writing , Rick 's life has had some strange twists and turns that are the combined result of his skewed sensibilities , and his desire to be famous .
Rick 's exploits , and the fact that he got a 44/48 on the Hoeflin Test are legendary .
He 's also been said to have an IQ that rises each time he takes the test .
Here 's his story .
Errol Morris ( The Thin Blue Line , The Fog of War ) created a show where he interviewed subjects through an " interrotron " , a " self - designed camera that allows the interview subject to see " Morris ' face transposed into the cameraface focused on them .
First Person is one of the best interview shows I 've ever seen , as it tends to elicit more truth than can be seen in other shows .
Errol Morris on Rick Rosner : The journey he has taken , along with all the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?

On his official government web page , Ed Jagels boasts that " During Jagels ' tenure as District Attorney , Kern County has had the highest per capita prison commitment rate of any major California County . "
Note that the D.A. makes no claim about the New Jersey - sized county of farms and oil fields being any safer through his efforts .
Instead , he gloats about how many of his constituents he 's put behind bars .
It 's a telling bit of braggadocio .
In October , Jagels told the Bakersfield Californian that after 26 years in office , he wo n't be running for reelection in 2010 .
Good riddance to him .
You'd be hard pressed to find a law enforcement official anywhere in the country who better embodies the worst excesses of America 's sharp turn toward law - and - order crime policy over last 30 years .
From expanding the death penalty to eroding the rights of the accused to jacking up prison populations to formulating crime policy around sports metaphors , Jagels created a high - profile position by backing just about every bad crime policy in a generation .
But if history dispenses justice more honorably than Ed Jagels ever did , the boyish - looking D.A. will be most remembered for his role ruining countless lives in perhaps the most shameful of the Reagan - era " tough on crime " debacles : the coast - to - coast sex abuse panic of the 1980s .
Jagels began his career as an assistant district attorney in Kern County , then took over his boss 's position in 1982 after winning a controversial election against state Superior Court Judge Marvin Ferguson .
The election swung in Jagels ' direction during a debate with Ferguson , when an anti-crime activist revealed the contents of a confidential file in the judge 's ruling on a child custody case which led to the girl being killed by her stepfather .
According to a subsequent grand jury report , the file was illegally lifted from the county courthouse by Colleen Ryan , one of Jagels ' fellow assistant D.A.s.
Jagels had run on a vigorous anti-crime platform , and wasted no time clearing the D.A. 's office 's old guard , re-staffing it with younger prosecutors more in line with his philosophy .
Needless to say , he never investigated Ryan for stealing the court file .
She went on to become a judge .
At about the same time Jagels took office , Bakersfield ( the Kern County seat ) was in the midst of a strange scandal .
Rumors had circulated for years that older , well - connected men among Bakersfield 's political , law enforcement , and business elite were involved in sex rings with underage teen boys .
The " Lords of Bakersfield " rumors gained traction after several young gay men in the community were murdered in the early 1980s , and the accused were given relatively light sentences .
Jagels did make sex crimes a priority during his first years in office , but he had little interest in the Lords of Bakersfield .
Indeed , the notoriously tough on crime prosecutor took a pass , going easy when the alleged boyfriend of one of his assistant D.A.s kept getting arrested on drug charges .
Jagels ' subordinate was later murdered by the young man 's father .
Instead , Jagels set his sights on Kern County 's lower middle class .
Relying on suggestive police and social worker interrogations of children , Jagels ' office put 26 people behind bars on felony child sex abuse charges in the 1980s and '90s .
Of those 26 convictions , 25 have since been overturned .
The details were lurid , and bore striking similarity to the fantastical stories that were springing from similar cases all over the country , from Florida to Massachusetts to Washington State .
Parents were accused of having sex with their own children , of forcing young siblings to have sex with each other , of inviting neighbors over for adult - child orgies .
When the national panic began to include stories of cult activity and Satan worship , Jagels ' and the Kern County Sheriff 's Department managed to locate that sordid activity in Bakersfield , too .
Now children began telling investigators they had been forced to drink blood ; they were hung from ceilings naked and beaten ; infants were sodomized , murdered , and cannibalized .
There was never any physical evidence to back the accusations .
The photos the children alleged the accused to have taken during the acts never surfaced .
The bodies of the murdered babies were never found .
In one case a child alleged to have been murdered was found alive and healthy , living with her parents .
Many of Jagels ' victims are profiled in the moving 2008 documentary Witch Hunt .
They are n't limited to the people he put in prison .
Particularly wrenching are the interviews with children who made the false accusations .
They 're now adults , and have carried unfathomable guilt and remorse .
Some of these children put their parents in prison for a decade or more .
In one scene , a man who falsely accused his neighbor of molesting him as a child breaks down in tears as he explains how due to fear and guilt , he 's never been able to bathe his own son .
But when some of these child accusers came forward as adults to recant their testimony and demand the release of the people they helped wrongly put in prison , Jagels and his deputies called them liars in court .
Witch Hunt includes footage of Jagels stating with is n't - it - obvious mockery that children simply do n't lie about these sorts of things .
Except that they do , especially when they 're led and guilted into lying by adult authority figures .
Jagels ' victim Jeff Modahl was released in 1999 after serving 15 years for molesting his own daughters .
One piece of evidence key to his release was an audio tape that surfaced in the late 1990s of a police interview with one of the girls .
In it , the interviewers clearly lead the girl , drop in suggestions , and repeat questions until they get affirmative answers .
Modahl 's lawyers also found a medical exam performed on Modahl 's daughter showing none of the physical evidence that should have been present if the allegations had been true .
Neither the report nor the tape were turned over to Modahl 's lawyers for his trial .
His daughter has since recanted her testimony and helped win her father 's release .
She says in the movie that she 's battled addiction problems her entire life to bury the guilt she feels for putting him in prison .
In 1986 , a grand jury released a blistering report on the sex abuse prosecutions , accusing Kern County officials of fostering a " presumption of guilt " and bringing charges on little more than hunches .
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp released a report in September of the same year reaching the same conclusions .
But no Kern County official was ever fired or disciplined , and the prosecutions continued .
Jagels continued to get elected .
So far , Kern County has paid out more than $ 9 million in wrongful conviction settlements .
In his 1999 book Mean Justice , Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Edward Humes noted that by Jagels ' second term , the D.A. had tripled the number of prosecutorial misconduct complaints of his predecessor .
He was regularly berated by appellate courts for withholding exculpatory evidence and for his courtroom behavior , admonishments Jagels seemed to relish .
Bakersfield had gone from a blue - collar town of farmers and oil workers to the poster city for the lock 'em up movement .
Residents touted the city 's mock slogan : " Come for vacation , leave on probation . "
Jagels ' influence has leaked across county borders .
Over the course of his career he has been a leading voice in formulating and pushing the policies that have overpopulated California 's prisons .
He boasts that he 's pursued the state 's controversial " three strikes and you 're out " policy more aggressively than any prosecutor in the state , though as one anti-three strikes activist group points out , since the law was implemented Kern County 's crime rate has dropped at a significantly slower rate than jurisdictions such as San Francisco County , where three strikes is n't enforced .
Jagels was also at the fore of 1990's Proposition 115 , which made significant pro-prosecution changes to pre-trial hearings and the discovery process .
More recently , Jagels weighed in on the medical marijuana debate , recommending that all dispensaries in Kern County be prohibited .
He also led the effort to get three anti-death penalty justices removed from the California Supreme Court , an ironic twist , given that Ed Jagels and his 25 false convictions is a walking argument against the death penalty .
Perhaps the most troubling thing about Ed Jagels ' career is that not only have the legal and political systems in California never sanctioned him for his monstrous behavior , he 's been regularly rewarded for it .
He has served as both president and director of the powerful California District Attorneys Association ( CDAA ) , and on a number of blue ribbon panels charged with advising state officials on crime policy .
Upon Jagels ' retirement announcement , Scott Thorpe , the current head of the CDAA , told the Associated Press that Jagels is a " prosecutor 's prosecutor , " a remarkable and revealing statement of that organization 's commitment to justice .
Jagels is also listed as a crime policy advisor to Meg Whitman , a leading candidate for the California GOP 's 2010 gubernatorial nomination .
Given his history , the obituary for Jagels ' career ought to describe a rogue , renegade prosecutor long ago shunted to the fringe by colleagues embarrassed by his continuing reelection .
Instead , as a former subordinate recently told the Bakersfield Californian , " Prosecutors from around the state seek and respect his advice on almost every issue of public safety . "
And that 's the problem .
Bad actors like Jagels are n't shunned .
They 're venerated .
Peers seek their counsel .
And the same justice system so eager to mete out accountability to the accused continues to fail to hold accountable the people we entrust to run it .
Radley Balko is a senior editor at Reason magazine .
My advice in these circumstances , when people have been let down so very badly by the rest of society , is that they should not hurt anybody , and cope as best they can .
The strong temptation is to burgle or rob people – family , friends , neighbours , strangers .
Others are tempted towards prostitution , a nightmare world of degradation and abuse for all concerned .
Others are tempted towards suicide .
Instead , I would rather that they shoplift .
My advice , as a Christian priest , is to shoplift .
I do not offer such advice because I think that stealing is a good thing , or because I think it is harmless , for it is neither .
I would ask that they do not steal from small family businesses , but from large national businesses , knowing that the costs are ultimately passed on to the rest of us in the form of higher prices .
I would ask them not to take any more than they need , for any longer than they need .
The recurrent theme of Mary 's song is the faithful love of God towards his children , no matter how lowly , despised or lacking they may be .
The phrases of her song are drawn almost entirely from the grateful pleading of the forlorn in Old Testament prophetic literature .
It is a song which has done a huge amount to reinforce the Christian commitment to the poor and needy of society in every age .
What advice should one give , for example , to an ex prisoner who was released in mid-November with a release grant of less than £ 50 and a crisis loan , also of less than £ 50 , who applies immediately for benefits but is , with less than a week to go before Christmas , still to receive any financial support ?
One might tell them to see their social worker , but they are on a waiting list for a social worker .
Tell them to see their probation officer , perhaps , but the probation officer can only enquire of the benefits agency , and be told that benefits will eventually be forthcoming .
One might tell them to get a job , but it is at the very best of times extremely difficult for an ex prisoner to find work , and these are not the best of times for anyone trying to find a job .
They could perhaps get cereal and toast every morning from a local charity .
Then could perhaps apply , and see if they are eligible for some limited help from the Salvation Army or other such body .
Let my words not be misrepresented as a simplistic call for people to shoplift .
The observation that shoplifting is the best option that some people are left with is a grim indictment of who we are .
Rather , this is a call for our society no longer to treat its most vulnerable people with indifference and contempt .
Prepare for the coming of Christ , for Christmas is almost upon us .
But do n't let your preparations be limited to tinsel and turkey , crackers , fairy lights and chocolates .
Prepare for Christ by singing his mother 's song , and taking her words to heart .
Do n't just sing about lifting up the lowly : help with the lifting !
Father Tim Jones , parish priest at St Lawrence and St Hilda in York in Britain , has made international headlines by seeming to advocate shoplifting in a recent sermon :
Now why would a Christian priest urge people to shoplift ?
Are there any circumstances that could possibly justify this criminal action ?
Is Father Jones suggesting that stealing is OK ?
Now it 's beginning to sound downright marxist .
Is Father Jones advocating , in a roundabout way , a brand of socialism ?
No , actually , because the sermon is not really about shoplifting .
It is grounded in the Magnificat , the song of Mary in the early part of Luke 's gospel .
But " commitment to the poor and needy of society " has always been easier to talk about than to put into practice .
And that 's what led Father Jones to make such a controversial declaration .
His advice , as we saw above , would be for them to take the things they need .
It 's not good advice , especially to someone with a criminal record .
But what are the alternatives ?
None of these options will provide food , clothing , or shelter .
But a return to jail would , and so shoplifting begins to look more attractive .
There are , of course , ways to get the basic necessities without stealing :
But such charity often has the unintended consequence of creating dependence .
And that cuts to the heart of the gospel message .
Jesus said he came to " bring good news to the poor , " to " proclaim release to the captives , " to " let the oppressed go free . "
But having to go to a shelter for cereal every morning is not freedom , and it is certainly not good news .
If a society cannot offer a better alternative than this to its most vulnerable citizens , it has failed .
And that , ultimately , is Father Jones ' point when he says the best option for the poor is shoplifting : Again , the gospel message confronts us with harsh reality .
Do we believe Christ died for sinners ?
Or are some people beyond his ability to redeem ?
In the sermon , preached the Sunday before Christmas , Father Jones urged his congregation :
It 's a message we all need to take seriously .

The couple 's lighthouse at Cape Wrath is in a remote location A woman who left her remote home in the Scottish Highlands to buy a turkey two days before Christmas has still not made it home .
Heavy snow meant it was not possible for Kay Ure to get back to Cape Wrath after a shopping trip to Inverness .
The 54 - year - old and her husband John live in the Lighthouse Keeper 's cottage at Cape Wrath , on Britain 's north western tip , where they run a cafe .
Her trip involved an 11 - mile car drive , a boat trip and a bus ride .
On her return , the road to the lighthouse was blocked by heavy snow , and Mrs Ure has been stranded 11 miles from home ever since .
She spent Christmas in a friend 's caravan in Durness , while her husband had the company of their six dogs , and two walkers who popped into the cafe .
They have spoken on the phone each night and are hoping to be reunited on Monday if the road to the lighthouse is clear .
We 've got rain coming in today which is breaking up the ice so with a bit of luck tomorrow she might get back
John Ure
Stranded woman 's husband Mrs Ure left for Inverness on an organised shopping excursion on 23 December .
Her husband drove her the 11 miles to a jetty where their boat is moored and from there they crossed the Kyle of Durness where Mrs Ure was picked up by a minibus .
On her return to Durness the heavy snow had blocked the route to the lighthouse and Mr Ure , 57 , was unable to make the drive to pick her up .
The couple moved from Glasgow to Durness several years ago before moving further north to Cape Wrath .
They opened the lighthouse cafe in the summer .
Mr Ure told BBC Scotland : " We 've got rain coming in today which is breaking up the ice so with a bit of luck tomorrow she might get back , fingers crossed .
" It 's the first time we 've been separated .
We 've been snowed in here for three weeks before , so we are well used to it and it 's quite nice to get a bit of peace and quiet . "

For the past several weeks , scientists , politicians , and Sarah Palin have been discussing a series of e-mails from leading climate researchers at Britain 's University of East Anglia .
Fox News and Republicans have been using the contra temps to question efforts to remedy .
The e-mails show that leading academics and climate scientists shaded data to make their points , contemplated withholding data , and attacked editors of journals who allowed anti-warming critics to publish their views .
According to Marc Ambinder at The Atlantic , " that is not how normal science works . "
Yes it is .
Scientists , human beings , shade reality to support their collective point of view all the time .
Group psychology in search of unanimity drives most human thought .
That 's why liberals tune in MSNBC , where they see the mirror image of events as portrayed for conservative viewers on Fox News .
I played basketball regularly at the gym at the University of Pennsylvania , where I attended college .
One day , several varsity players were shooting in the gym and challenged a group of us to a game .
I asked if it would n't make for a better contest if we split the varsity players up .
Their ( who was 6 ' 11 " ) earnestly argued , " We 're only subs - we 're no better than you . "
I laughed - the experience made clear to me what I already suspected .
Athletes and others do n't want to be challenged - they prefer one - sided conquests .
People will use any possible means to make sure their team wins , including convincing themselves they are playing on equal terms even when the deck is stacked completely in their favor .
I once attended a public health conference where a libertarian spoke out against government regulations curtailing individual health behavior choices , even if these were unhealthy .
The two public health specialists on his panel immediately attacked his point of view .
Afterwards , when I asked another public health advocate what he thought of the panel , he was irate that the lone libertarian was allowed to speak !
In fact , unanimity and elimination of dissent is the goal of normal scientific activity and discourse .
The of intellectual differences is too much for scientists to bear .
Minority , iconoclastic opinions might be right ?
Their own thinking and life work might be wrong ?
Never !
The facts never line up in a row for any position .
So all wide - ranging points of view can be challenged .
Meanwhile , wrong - headed views are broadly held by great majorities of people , even well - educated specialists , on a wide variety of subjects .
We have in place - in medicine , science , and society - any number of platforms and policies that have demonstrably failed to produce positive results .
Yet the approaches are maintained ad infinitum .
People do n't strive to understand the world as it is .
They strive to maintain their own mind sets .
As John Tierney , science columnist from the Times , describes his ethos : 1 . Just because an idea appeals to a lot of people does n't mean it 's wrong .
2 . But that 's a good working theory .

EXCLUSIVE : Convicted CIA Spy Says " We Broke the Law " Sabrina deSousa says U.S. " Betrayed " her and others found guilty in kidnapping .
Nov. 4 , 2009  --
One of the 23 Americans convicted today by an Italian court says the United States " broke the law " in the CIA kidnapping of a Muslim cleric Abu Omar in Milan in 2003 .
" And we are paying for the mistakes right now , whoever authorized and approved this , " said former CIA officer Sabrina deSousa in an interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC's World News with Charles Gibson .
DeSousa says the U.S. " abandoned and betrayed " her and the others who were put on trial for the kidnapping .
She was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison .
Representative Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , a member of the House Intelligence Committee told ABC News that the trial was a disaster for CIA officers like DeSousa on the frontline .
" I think these people have been put out there .
They 've been hung out to dry .
They 're taking the fall potentially for a decision that was made by their superiors in our agencies .
It 's the wrong place to go . "
Italian prosecutors said deSousa was a CIA officer who helped organized the kidnapping using her diplomat cover at the U.S. Consulate in Milan .
Several former U.S. intelligence officials confirm to ABC News deSousa 's role in the operation .
Without confirming her CIA role , deSousa said her status as a State Department diplomat should have protected her , but that the U.S. refused to invoke diplomatic immunity .
" Everything I did was approved back in Washington , " she said .
deSousa says she was on a ski trip on the actual day of the kidnapping .
The ruling by the Italian court was seen as landmark repudiation of the U.S. policy of rendition , involving the capture of suspected terrorists taken to secret locations for interrogation .
" It 's clear that the kidnapping of Abu Omar was a great mistake , " said Italian prosecutor Armando Spataro , who led the five - year long investigation .
" It did serious damage in fighting terrorists because we do n't need torture , we do n't need renditions , we do n't need secret prisons . "
The former CIA station chief in Milan , Robert Seldon Lady , was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison .
deSousa and twenty - two others received five - year sentences .
Jeffrey Castelli , the CIA station chief in Rome , who several former CIA officers describe as the alleged architect of the kidnapping , was acquitted by the Italian court .
The court ruled that he and two others had diplomatic immunity because they worked out of the U.S. Embassy in Rome .
The CIA declined to comment , as it has since the case first became public .
A State Department spokesman said the Obama administration was " disappointed " by the verdict .
Also convicted was Air Force Colonel Joseph Romano , who allegedly helped facilitate the CIA kidnapping team 's flight to Egypt from a U.S. air base in Italy .
The Department of Defense had unsuccessfully claimed the court had no jurisdiction over Romano under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement .
" We are clearly disappointed with the ruling and the lack of respect for the fact that we have asserted jurisdiction in this case , " said Pentagon spokesperson Geoff Morrell .
" The verdict today came as a complete surprise since Italy lacks jurisdiction over Col Romano , " said Romano through an attorney upon his conviction and five year sentence in Italy today .
" We believe the judge clearly misapplied the law by failing to recognize his nation 's obligations under the NATO Treaty .
The trial judge 's irresponsible actions should be an embarrassment to Italy and we find the verdict illegitimate . "
The kidnapping was discovered and linked to the CIA by Italian authorities due to " sloppy " tradecraft , according to U.S. officials .
Much of the evidence used in the trial involved cellphone records of the CIA team assembled to take Abu Omar .
" They were using e-mail , they were calling home , the Italians were able to connect their credit cards with true names and true addresses , " said former CIA officer Bob Baer .
" I did these same things under the Reagan administration , " Baer told ABCNews.com
" When we did a rendition , we did it in international waters .
The Bush administration threw all caution to the wind . "
The operation to capture Abu Omar was part of the CIA 's extraordinary rendition program , according to U.S. intelligence officials involved in his transfer .
The kidnapped cleric was held in Egypt for four years and says he was repeatedly tortured there by Egyptian interrogators .
He was never charged with a crime and ultimately set free .
He remains in Alexandria , Egypt .
" He was the wrong guy , " said Baer .
" It was not worth putting the reputation of the United Sates on the line going after somebody like this . "
According to both U.S. and Italian intelligence officials , the trial ruined the relationship between the two countries ' intelligence services , and has hurt continued counterterrorism efforts .
DeSousa who resigned from and brought a lawsuit against the U.S. government fears the damage to U.S. - Italian relations from the verdict will continue .
" It 's getting more embarrassing every day , " deSousa said .

Early dinosaurs were n't just covered in feathers .
They were also poisonous .
Analysis of skulls belonging to different species of Sinornithosaurus , a group of feathered predatory theropods that lived 125 million years ago in what is now northeast China , shows skeletal features reminiscent of modern rear - fanged snakes and lizards .
Sinornithosaurus ' rear teeth were long , with grooves connected to ducts running under their fangs to a pocket that could have housed a venom gland .
" These features are all analogous to the venomous morphology of lizards , " wrote paleontologists in a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers speculate that Sinornithosaurus ' long teeth could have penetrated the feathers of its avian prey , penetrating just far enough to release their poison .
Like most modern rear - fanged reptiles , the venom probably was n't lethal , but instead shocked prey into immobility .
Short front teeth were probably used " to pluck the feathers off their victims , " wrote the researchers , who suggest that other members of Sinornithosaurus ' family , including the velociraptors of Jurassic Park fame , had the same venomous capabilities .

OTTAWA – Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government appears unwilling to hand over documents as ordered in a vote last night in the Commons , setting the stage for a showdown with Parliament and a possible rendezvous with the courts .
Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said that the government would release only " legally available " documents on whether Afghan prisoners detained by Canadian forces were subject to torture when handed over to local authorities , and what the government knew about the issue .
The definition of that is apparently going to be established in days and perhaps weeks to come by officials .
" These are done by experts , non-partisan individuals , who have a look at these things , who have no other interests but the best interests and security of Canadians , particularly those Canadians in uniform , " Nicholson said .
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said that 's not good enough , and the government is standing in the way of democratic rights .
" This is about democracy .
Last night , the House of Commons said ' We need the documents .
We need all the documents .
We need to end the censure .
We need to end all this wiping - out of documents . '
" We need the truth .
This is about the honour of Canada .
This about torture .
This is about our human - rights reputation , " Ignatieff told reporters in Montreal .
" This is an issue about fundamental democracy in Canada and we see absolutely no reason why the government just can't do what Parliament says . "
International Trade Minister Stockwell
Day indicated this morning that the opposition parties would have to go to the courts to get all the information they 're seeking .
A PMO spokesperson later confirmed that the Conservative government does not intend to turn over the documents as ordered by Parliament .
The government will respect laws intended to protect national security and the operational security of the Afghan mission , the spokesperson said .
" When people ask for all the information , when they ask for every little bit of information ... it would be naive to the extreme to think that that information can be given out .
I do n't think Canadians would like the fact that our troops would be unnecessarily exposed , " Day told reporters during the release of a quarterly progress report on Canadian involvement in Afghanistan .
" But if there 's a piece of information that somebody does n't have , there is a process , " Day said .
The Liberals narrowly pushed through a motion in the Commons on Thursday that forces the Harper government to release waves of unedited documents on Afghan detainee treatment .
The motion passed with a vote of 145 - 143 , and has legal force – Parliament , according to the Commons law clerk , represents the ultimate court in the land .
But the government and the department of justice are arguing that other laws – those protecting national security , for instance – take priority , and Day made clear today that the Conservative government intends to use that interpretation to block the documents ' release .
" We are not going to make information available just readily , about friend and foe alike , about specific items , about a security operation that could imperil our own troops and could imperil the citizens , " Day said .
The government fought hard Thursday against the release of information , arguing that the Taliban would profit from the data , while soldiers and Canada 's partners abroad could be compromised .
Information about when and how Canadian officials visit particular prisons , for instance , " would be of great value to the insurgents , and to the terrorists , " said Justice Minister Rob Nicholson .
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said such arguments were " ridiculous . "
" The risk of putting anybody in operational danger is about zero , but even if there was a case of operational risk , a parliamentary committee could find a way to get the documents , " Ignatieff said .
He said the Liberals were forced to take this measure because of the way the Conservatives have been releasing documents surrounding the detainee - transfer issue for the past few years – either with significant portions blacked out , or indiscriminately sharing more documents with friendly sources outside Parliament than with MPs .
The issue has become more contentious in the wake of recent testimony to a committee of MPs by senior Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin that he had warned of potential detainee torture while he served in Afghanistan , but that his warnings were ignored .
Then on Wednesday , chief of defence staff Gen .
Walter Natynczyk produced evidence that a prisoner detained by Canadians and transferred to Afghan police in June 2006 was abused – only a day after he had given contrary testimony to a Commons committee .

Natynczyk also cited a report that said soldiers photographed the detainee before the transfer to ensure that if Afghan police abused him " as had happened in the past , " they would have a record of his condition .
Intelligence specialist Wesley Wark said the heavy censorship of the documents supplied to the parliamentary committee probing the handling of prisoners has turned the hearings into a " farce . "

MIAHUATLÁN , Mexico 
During the best of the times , Miguel Salcedo ’s son , an illegal immigrant in San Diego , would be sending home hundreds of dollars a month to support his struggling family in Mexico .
But at times like these , with the American economy out of whack and his son out of work , Mr. Salcedo finds himself doing what he never imagined he would have to do : wiring pesos north .
Unemployment has hit migrant communities in the United States so hard that a startling new phenomenon has been detected : instead of receiving remittances from relatives in the richest country on earth , some down - and - out Mexican families are scraping together what they can to support their unemployed loved ones in the United States .
“ We send something whenever we have a little extra , at least enough so he can eat , ” said Mr. Salcedo , who is from a small village here in the rural state of Oaxaca and works odd jobs to support his wife , his two younger sons and , now , his jobless eldest boy in California .
He is not alone .
Leonardo Herrera , a rancher from outside Tuxtla Gutiérrez in the southern state of Chiapas , said he recently sold a cow to help raise $ 1,000 to send to his struggling nephew in northern California .
THE Bangalow - based Australian Vaccination Network ( AVN ) and its founder , Meryl Dorey , are the subjects of an investigation by the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission .
The AVN is accused of ‘ engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct with the intent of persuading parents not to vaccinate their children , ’ by Ken McLeod , a member of a group known as Stop the AVN .
When Mr McLeod first filed his 20 - page complaint in July it was unclear whether the AVN or Mrs Dorey would fall under the commission ’s jurisdiction and complaints process , as neither were registered health - care providers .
However , the complaint was referred to the Health Commissioner , who decided an investigation should proceed .
Mr McLeod ’s complaint lists instances in which he claims the AVN has provided false and misleading information about whooping cough , bacterial meningitis , the Gardasil vaccine and the safety of the measles , mumps andrubella vaccine , MMR .
And while the commission may take several more months to complete itsinvestigation , the ABC last month released a statement to say that information supplied by Mrs Dorey which was broadcast on ABC Mid-North Coast local radio in September was found to be misleading .
The presenter of the morning program , on which Mrs Dorey and Lismore obstetrician Dr Chris Ingall were guests , referred to statistics supplied by Mrs Dorey .
The investigation found the use of these statistics , about whooping cough , was misleading as they were ‘ drawn from different data sets and related to different groups of children ’ .
The statistics were also presented as vaccination rates for 1991 , when they were , in fact , for 2001 , the ABC said .
The broadcaster received two complaints about the statistics used during the segment .
The use of the data was found to be in breach of the ABC ’s editorial requirements for accuracy and context in factual content .
Professor Peter McIntyre , from the National Centre for Immunisation and Surveillance , said better reporting and diagnosis of whooping cough had lead to an increase in the number of cases reported each year .
Prof McIntyre said it was wrong to suggest the prevalence of whooping cough had increased and that vaccination did not work .
He said the five per cent of children who were not vaccinated accounted for 30 per cent of all reported cases of whooping cough .
“ They have around seven to eight times the chance of contracting whooping cough than vaccinated children , ” Prof McIntyre said .
Mrs Dorey said the network sourced its information directly from the Australian Government and peer reviewed medical journals , and that it was the ABC which got it wrong .
“ I believe they have misunderstood what was on the graphs , ” she said .
Mrs Dorey is currently having her information verified by the editor of a peer - reviewed medical journal in the United States and would be filing her own complaint with the ABC should her interpretation of the data be verified .
KANDAHAR AIRFIELD , Afghanistan – With a dry wind blowing across the dusty terrain , Gen. Stanley McChrystal arrived to this crucial proving ground for the pending surge of 30,000 troops .
McChrystal , the commanding general in Afghanistan and the architect of the troop increase that President Barack Obama announced Tuesday night , gathered in a cavernous tent with a group of U.S. and NATO field commanders and civilian staff from the State Department .
They sat in rows of metal folding chairs in what looked like a makeshift classroom .
The State Department staff took notes .
The military field commanders and officers just listened .
McChrystal marked on a white board the message he wanted to deliver to the troops in Kandahar , which will become perhaps the most crucial theater of battle for Obama ’s new strategy to deploy a quick surge of troops intended to hasten the attack on the Taliban and break the momentum they have created so that U.S. troops can begin a drawdown by July 2011 .
McChrystal scribbled on the four “ buzzwords ” for the war ’s new strategy : credibility , clarity , confidence , capability .
He scribbled words that described the “ diversity ” of the insurgency and the key parts of carrying out a sophisticated new campaign .
He explained to the brass and staff gathered there that the key to counterinsurgency was not keeping track of how many insurgents are killed , but more importantly keeping tabs on how the insurgents had been sidelined , and made irrelevant to the lives of Afghans .
Afterward , McChrystal described how attacks since 2007 had gone up 300 percent : he said that with Obama ’s decision to add more troops , “ everything changes right now . ”
“ Even though it ’s eight years , this is not the end , this is not even the beginning of the end , I think it ’s the end of the beginning , ” he said .
Increased troop deployments , which could start within weeks , are expected to arrive first right here , in the violent southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand .
More U.S. troops have been killed in the south than anywhere else since the war began
in 2001 .
Some of those fighting the war here have doubts about whether new troops will make a difference in what has become a dangerous and unpopular campaign .
Others believe the supporting troops can not arrive soon enough if McChrystal is to succeed in his strategy to change the tide of the war .
But Kandahar City , Afghanistan ’s second largest and the one of the birthplaces of the Taliban , appears to be the place where this strategy will be tested .
Kandahar stands at the forefront of the battle for southern Afghanistan , called Regional Command South , according to the Canadian commander of Task Force Kandahar , Brig .
Gen. Daniel Menard .
“ Kandahar city , being the center mass of the population is by far my priority number one , but also a very important centerpiece right now of Gen.
McCrystal ’s plan here in [ Regional Command ]
South , ” he said .
“ So we are in the middle of all this , at the forefront of all
these activities . ”
Under Obama ’s Afghanistan plan , at least one battalion of U.S. troops will join the 1,500 already under Menard ’s command .
There are 2,800 Canadian troops in that country 's Afghanistan mission .
Canada has lost 133 troops , most of them in the last three years since taking responsibility for Kandahar Province .
“ Every day we have troops in contact .
Every day we have indirect fire on our troops .
And every day I would say we deal with a kind of IED threat , ” Menard said .
Under McChrystal ’s new strategy , Task Force Kandahar will begin to implement a plan to establish a ring of US and Canadian troops around Kandahar city .
The purpose of the ring will be to “ hold and build ; ” which means keeping the Taliban out , providing security to the city ’s residents and building up Afghan security forces .
85 percent of the province ’s population lives in Task Force Kandahar ’s area of operations .
“ The Intent is to insure that around the city … we create a ring of stability , so that we have a true buffer zone of people that believe in something else than the insurgency , ” Menard said .
“ The importance of stabilizing the area is key , because if we do this we will then turn the population into a population that will support us and therefore marginalize the insurgency .
And that is what we are after . ”
Some of the troops who are responsible for turning the plan for Kandahar into reality had to wake up early this morning to watch Obama ’s speech , which aired here at Task Force Kandahar 's base , the sprawling Kandahar Airfield in Southern Afghanistan , before the sun came up .
Around 50 U.S. troops , some dressed in work - out gear for their morning jog , watched the speech on two TV screens in the base ’s American recreation room .
Obama ’s speech was largely aimed at waning public support for the war .
A CBS poll this week showed that 69 percent of Americans say the war in Afghanistan is going badly .
In interviews with more than a dozen junior American military officers and enlisted men and women on the sprawling Kandahar Airbase earlier this week , opinions largely reflected those of the wider America public .
A surprising number expressed doubts that a troop surge would work .
Others said their mission in Afghanistan in is not clear .
Others said they believe the war In Afghanistan is not worth any more American blood or treasure .
“ We need to turn efforts toward our own country , ” said a captain with the 4th Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division , who asked not be named .
“ This is an Afghan problem .
We ’re not going be able to solve an Afghan problem .
We should turn inwards ; the United States has its own
problem .
I do n’t think there ’s any need to shed more American blood for this country . ”
Amidst an eight - year war and a financial crisis at home , many troops say that trying to stabilize one of the poorest and most corrupt counties in the world is beyond the capabilities or will of the United States .
A sergeant working on supply convoys to forward operating bases off Kandahar Airfield said the troop surge was two - fold .
“ It ’s good and it ’s bad , ” he said .
“ It ’s good to have more people , more help .
But it ’s a chance for more soldiers to die . ”
The soldier , on his fourth deployment after three tours in Iraq , said his 100 - person unit recently lost a soldier to an IED .
He believed Afghanistan was a “ lost cause . ”
“ I think no matter what we do it ’s not going to change much .
You ca n’t help anybody who do n’t want to be helped , ” he said .
First Lt. Glenn Nieradka , 37 , could n’t disagree more .
He ’s with the 5th Stryker Brigade of the Army ’s 2nd Infantry Division , and leads a platoon of scouts from a base located in the dangerous countryside outside Kandahar .
He said the “ surge ” would help his mission to fight the Taliban and to implement the counterinsurgency doctrine of protecting the Afghan population .
He voiced the frustration shared by many troops that there were n’t enough U.S. and NATO boots on the ground to deny safe havens to Taliban and other insurgents .
“ Where we ’re at , we could use more troops , and I think a surge in Afghanistan would step on the necks of the Taliban , ” Nieradka said .
“ We ’re doing the best we can , but we ca n’t be everywhere at once . ”
Another soldier , Spc. Kyle Mitchell , 27 , patrols roads to find and defuse roadside bombs with an Explosives Ordinance Detonation team .
“ It ’s way , way , way undermanned here , ” the combat engineer said .
“ I tell my family all the time there are n’t close to enough troops here .
To be on the roads here and what they ’re doing with IED ’s and whatnot .
More is better . ”
Although counterinsurgency doctrine says far more troops are needed than 30,000 , most here say no matter their personal feelings , the troop escalation can only help improve security and hold more ground .
Obama ’s address did lay out danger that withdrawing from Afghanistan could pose , saying his three - month review of the war showed him that the war is in “ our vital national interest . ”
In making that statement , he seemed determined to address those skeptics across the spectrum of American , and military opinion , and seemed to read the minds of what some troops here needed to hear .
GERMAN HEAVY TRANSPORT TRAILER
The following information concerning the German heavy transport trailer was obtained in a recent examination of one of the vehicles by our own Ordnance officers .
The trailer has an overall length of 38 feet 10 1 / 2 inches , wheelbase from front bogie to rear bogie of 28 feet 8 inches ; its total weight unloaded is 31,810 pounds and its load - carrying capacity is approximately 35 tons .
The trailer consists of front and rear bogies with a load platform suspended between them .
This platform is constructed of two main I beams and two secondary I beams parallel to each other .
The primary I beams extend past the platform in front and rear and constitute the only means of attaching the platform to the bogies .
This is done by the use of four heavy fingers , two per bogie , that fit in rectangular slots in each of the primary I beams .
This assembly is secured by large pins inserted through the slots and fingers .
The front bogie attachment to the load platform is semi-permanent while the rear bogie attachment is removable .
a. Specifications
Front bogie section weight 9,560 lbs Platform 10,850 lbs Rear bogie section weight 11,400 lbs Ground clearance 1 ft 10 in Ground to platform top 2 ft 3 in Width from center of tires 8 ft 3 1/2 in Platform size 19 ft 1 in x 9 ft 10 1/2 in Rear bogie section length 9 ft 7 in Front bogie section length 9 ft 9 in Drawbar length 5 ft 4 in Turning radius ( using rear steering in addition to drawbar ) 58 ft
There are eight wheels ( singles ) with size 13.50 x 20 tires .
In addition to these wheels for the running gear there are two spares ( same size ) .
All tires are 16 - ply and hold 114 lbs per square inch of air .
b. Suspension
(1) Leaf - type springs , one for each wheel , eight in all , having 11 leaves each spring .
(2) Thickness of spring leaves , 3/8 - inch .
(3) Length of spring overall , 4 feet .
GERMAN HEAVY TRANSPORT TRAILER
c. Maker and Markings
In the trailer which was examined there was a part of an instruction manual , the text of which indicated that the vehicle was probably built by the Waggon Maschinen Fabrik at Bautzen , Germany .
The figure of a tiger , stenciled on the trailer , may signify that it was attached to a unit serving the German heavy tank Pz Kw 6 , called the " Tiger " .
(1) Markings on the rear of the trailer were :
Vorsicht beim Überholen ( Be careful when passing )
Anhängerbreite 3 Meter ( Width 3 meters )
Heben ( Lifting ) Senken ( Lowering )
Schnellgang ( Fast gear ) Normalgang ( Normal gear )
Markings on the rear of the fenders were :
Beim Senken Kupplungskopf , 2 Kabelstecker & 2
Stossdämpfergestängebolzen Lösen ( Disconnect coupling
head , 2 cable connections , & 2 shock absorber bolts when
lowering ) .
(2) Markings on the rear of left cab were :
Vor jedem Senken oder Heben der Ladebrücke ist die Öl pumpe
zu Betätigen & die Zahnflanken des Getriebes im Windenkasten
Einzufetten ( Each time before lowering or raising load platform ,
lubricate with oil pump and grease gears in winch box . )
(3) Below the above instruction plate were these markings :
Druckschmierung ( Pressure lubrication )
(4) Markings on the rear of the front truck were :
Stossdämpfergestängebolzen im Gelände lösen ( Disconnect
shock absorber bolts in rough terrain . )
d. Loading
Trailer must first be positioned so that if the vehicle to be loaded is dead , the winch cable can be used to tow the vehicle on the trailer platform .
Large pins securing the two fingers of the rear bogie section in the rectangular slots of the primary I beam must be turned past their catches and removed .
Lower the rear of the trailer platform by means of the two hand - driven winches which are located one on each side of the rear bogie section .
These winches must be turned in the direction marked Senken .
When the rear end of the platform is resting on the ground , pressure is taken off the tongs holding the platform and they can be released .
When the rear bogie section is free of the trailer the section must be pushed out of the path of the vehicle to be loaded .
After the vehicle to be loaded is pulled on the platform by means of the winch of the prime mover , the rear bogie section is repositioned over the rear of the trailer platform , the lifting tongs are engaged and the two hand winches are turned in the direction marked Heben .
( Note : Although the operation appears to be quite simple , the actual work involved to prepare the trailer , load the vehicle and reconnect the platform is a task that took a crew of five experienced men at least 90 minutes to accomplish . )
e. Steering
(1) Steering is accomplished by means of a drawbar attached to the prime mover .
When aided by rear steering , the turning radius is approximately 50 feet .
All four wheels of the front bogie assembly steer by means of the draw bar .
The linkage is such that the wheels are always tangent to an imaginary circle .
(2) Rear bogie assembly wheels are steered by the trailer driver who operates a steering wheel .
To aid the trailer driver in steering when under full load , a double - acting air piston is connected with the linkage so that power is exerted whenever the wheel is turned .
All four wheels of the rear bogie steer differentially so that they are all tangent to the same imaginary circle that the front bogie wheels are .
(3) The air for steering and for the air brakes is supplied by the towing vehicle .
Provision is made for four air reservoir tanks , one of which is on the front bogie and is used for the front air brakes .
The other three tanks are positioned on the rear bogie .
One of these is used for the rear air brakes ; the other two are used for steering purposes .
(4) The driver on the rear bogie is provided with a steering indicator dial on the steering wheel column .
A small indicator lamp is placed on each side of the dial .
It is considered that these lamps are provided so that the driver of the prime mover may signal steering instructions to the trailer driver .
To the left of the trailer driver 's compartment is a hand wheel that applies the brakes on the wheels of the rear bogie by means of a worm and gear linkage .
This is probably used only for parking .
f. Conclusions
(1) This transport trailer can be used to provide a loading ramp for railroad cars .
(2) Its gradual angle of load when the platform is lowered aids in loading .
(3) The rear steering , air boosted , makes this trailer very maneuverable so that it can negotiate sharp corners on relatively narrow streets .
This feature also makes it very easy to back the trailer .
👋 Hey there !
We want to give you a heads up that the source code that accompanies this series is no longer available to download .
We still think there are valuable bits of information to get from the series , but given that we ’re 10 + years down the road , we also think it ’s worth considering a modern PHP framework ( like Laravel ) or even a JavaScript framework ( like React or Vue ) to create a progressive web app .
Today we begin Part 1 of an 8 - Part series on building a web application from absolute scratch to a complete product .
I am going to kick things off by introducing the idea , and then I will be handling the design , UI , and general front - end stuff .
We are going to be going back and forth from here over to my friend Jason Lengstorf ’s site Copter Labs .
Jason will be handling the back - end stuff like application planning and database stuff .
At the end of the week , we ’ll unleash the actual working application for you .
Here is the plan :
What we ’re going to create is a “ list app ” .
The idea being focused on simplicity and usefulness .
Sign up for an account , and get started making a list in just a few seconds .
Sounds easy right ?
Even the PHP dabblers out there probably could throw something like this together fairly quickly , right ?
Well the fact is , no , it ’s not that easy .
First of all , it needs to work and it needs to work well .
That means good back end code that does what it ’s supposed to do and well .
That means a good UI that is intuitive , helpful , and pleasurable to use .
It means keeping the app secure and users data private .
None of these things is trivial .
Through this whole 8 - part series , we are going to create an app that hopefully does all these things pretty well .
We are n’t out to tell you this is the greatest app ever made , but rather , we are going to use this app as a walk - through journey of the app creating process and hopefully do as many smart things as we can along the way .
The Big Idea
This “ list app ” is going to be called Colored Lists .
Lists ( in real life ) , can be for anything : a to - do list , a grocery list , things to bring camping list …
As you finish things , you cross them off .
Things on a list may be of different relative importance as well .
This makes paper lists potentially messy and inefficient .
With a list on a computer , we can make crossing off items just a click and we can make rearranging them a matter of drag and drop .
For dealing with relative importance , we can use colorization , which could also be used for things like grouping .
Computers and the web are a perfect place for lists .
Sketch It Out
No need to get fancy right away .
Here is a very rudimentary sketch of what the app might look like :
Looks like a list to me .
Each list item is a long rectangle because the big idea here is to colorize each list item , so putting them inside a colored box makes sense .
There are some interactive elements to the left and right of each list item .
Those are going to be for accomplishing the basic things we intend people to be able to do with their colored list .
Let ’s take a closer look .
Early UI Planning
We do n’t necessarily want to be talking about specific technologies at this point , but we should be thinking about how the UI will operate , so we can make choices about technology that can accommodate our UI desires .
Click - to- edit
Drag and drop
Two - click delete
Automatic saving ( after any action )
All this stuff basically adds up to a whole bunch of AJAX .
We do n’t want to load special screens to do relatively trivial tasks like deleting a list item .
That stuff should happen seamlessly , smoothly and with proper feedback in response to mouse clicks without page refreshes .
In a sense , we are creating a one - page app , where the majority of interaction with this app happens on a single page .
This is certainly by design , and not trying to adhere to any particular fad .
Lists are easy and quick , that ’s why they are useful .
If this app is complicated , it ’s usefulness is diminished and nobody will use it .
The Screens
Just doing some quick brainstorming of the idea so far , we can come up with quite a number of “ screens ” , or states the application can be in .
Homepage Logged out = Intro / Sales Page Logged in =
Your list
Log in page
Settings page
Lost password page
Account activation page
Emails
Yep , even emails should be considered a part of the “ screens ” , as they are a vital part of the process and interaction with an app .
People love “ features ” .
Things that your app has that other apps do n’t have , or that yours does better .
This is just as much for marketing as it is for your actual product .
All the fancy AJAX this app will have is certainly a feature , but that stuff these days is getting more and more expected rather than a feature .
The one feature that we will focus on with this app is “ public sharing ” .
Each list will have a unique URL that can be publicly shared .
A visitor visiting this URL can see the list in its exact current state , but not interact with it as far as editing / adding / deleting .
Moving On
Now that we have the idea in place of what we want to build , in the next part we ’ll dive into looking at what this is going to take in terms of server - side technology .
Voluntaryism -- the only legitimate moral philosophy Share This :
Why Voluntaryism Is the Best and Only Legitimate Moral Philosophy
By Ross Kenyon
I explicitly refer to myself as a voluntaryist because I believe voluntaryism to be the only moral position worth assuming .
It is my opinion that the only reason libertarianism is worth a damn is because it is a philosophy of non-aggression which acknowledges the incalculable value of individual sovereignty .
Non-coercion is infinitely preferable to coercion .
Even statists will agree with this abstract statement , albeit befuddledly .
Libertarianism and conservatism as a whole still endorse the concept of forcing others into systems based upon their respective ideologies .
Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy because it leaves room for Marxists , monarchists , theocrats , and everyone else to exercise their negative rights of self - ownership and self - determination .
I completely respect the initiative of individuals who wish to form a socialist commune where the negative rights of the participants are neglected in favor of a collectivist ethic .
This can be completely consistent with voluntaryism so long as everyone participating is doing so voluntarily and they are not violating the person or justly acquired property of those who remain outside of their preferred system .
In other words , it is not consistent with voluntaryist values to coerce others into any form of libertarianism .
Voluntaryists respect the fact that others might not wish to live as they live .
" Anything that is peaceful " is a core value of voluntaryism .
This is one of the first ways I broach this subject with statists and minarchists alike .
I declare that the individual has a legitimate right to govern him or her self and to voluntarily associate with any other individual so long as it is consensual and non-aggressive to those outside of the agreement .
With self - admitted state socialists this is one of the first things I will proffer .
In my experience , convincing someone who instinctively distrusts the free market and loves the state that the inverse is consequentially better is an arduous and frustrating process .
Rather than trying to convince involuntaryists that my ideal system has better results than theirs , I will submit that there is room for both of our philosophies on this planet .
The Earth is large , and all I request is that the negative rights and justly acquired property of individuals who prefer other systems be left unmolested and in full retention of their sovereignty .
This is a very reasonable assertion and does not confront any competing philosophy on any grounds except for the element which is based upon coercion in the place of voluntary association .
If they believe it is moral to force others into their system I would challenge them to explain on what grounds they have inherited the authority to rule others .
I condemn this idea of authority as immoral and coercive .
In addition to the sovereignty argument , I will approach our close ideological allies of the minarchist movement with the point that they have made their peace with participating in systemic coercion so long as they can use the guns of the state to create their version of a just society .
Pragmatically , many libertarians believe that statism isã€ €so thoroughly entrenched that it is better to try to work from within , solemnly protecting the few crumbs of freedom that remain .
They simply underestimate the moderating and corrupting force state power has upon those who wield it .
There is no middle ground between coercion and non-aggression .
Trying to dismantle systems of coercion by gaining the ability to use coercion is not only inconsistent with the ends of voluntaryism and a free society but our participation in electoral democracy signals our consent to be governed by democracy .
I am a voluntaryist because I respect the wishes of individuals to live their lives as they see fit so long as they are non-aggressive , and I hope that the same courtesy will eventually be shown to me .
I oppose coercion no matter what costume or badge is worn and I do not acknowledge the validity of involuntary relationships .
Without voluntaryism , individuals will continue to try to solve the complex ethical problems facing us by resorting to coercion through the state .
They will be forever incapable of creating a just society because they start with the premise that aggression is an acceptable tool to address social problems .
It is time for us to respect the self - determination of all people .
Voluntaryism is not only the moral way ; it is the only way to peace and justice .

How long can survivors last under rubble ?
Rescuers say determination is key to survival when trapped
Rescue efforts have been declared officially over in Haiti , 11 days after the earthquake .
The BBC's Anna Jones examines how people survive in the rubble - and what dictates the duration of search operations .
The UN usually decides to call off search and rescue attempts between five and seven days after a disaster , once no - one has been saved for a day or two - but people have been known to survive for much longer .
In 1995 , Park Seung Hyun was pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed supermarket in Seoul , South Korea , 16 days after it collapsed and in January 2004 , Shahr - Banu Mazandarani , an Iranian woman in her 90s was rescued after nine days buried in the rubble of her home after the Bam earthquake .
In one extraordinary case in December 2005 , a 40 - year - old woman was found buried in what had been her kitchen in Pakistan - administered Kashmir , more than two months after an earthquake hit the region .
Doctors said it was a miracle that Naqsha Bibi had survived so long in a space so small she could not move .
Julie Ryan , a co-ordinator with UK - based group International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) , says that survival largely depends on what happens the moment the quake first hits .
" The ideal situation is you have become trapped and entombed but have some sort of oxygen supply from the outside world , are not injured and also have some sort of access to water , " she told the BBC .
" You have usually managed to get yourselves into some sort of void where you are enclosed by the building but it does n't injure you . "
She said an IRC team rescued three boys who had been buried in the ruins of their school for five days after the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 .
' Crush syndrome '
" They were laid flat on backs next to each other , with the ceiling touching their noses but totally unhurt , " she said .
Another boy alongside them had died .
After so long in the dark , rescue teams had to cover the boys ' eyes as they pulled them out , to protect them from the strong sunlight .
Dr Tejsrhi Shah of Medecins Sans Frontieres says many of those injured in earthquakes are so badly hurt they would not reach medical care .
But she says that if people are trapped , " just the immobility will reduce your chance of survival " .
Being unable to move or having injuries to limbs can lead to crush syndrome , she says , where blood flow to the limbs is disrupted .
When the crush is removed , a build - up of toxins floods the body and it is unable to cope .
Mazandarani spent nine days in the rubble of her home " It causes renal damage and shock , people are in agony with the pain and have a high risk of developing renal failure if do n't get urgent medical care , " she said .
Dr Shah says there are reports of people surviving in rubble even longer than two weeks , but such cases are " incredibly rare " .
" The chances of getting someone out alive decreases with each day , " she says .
Being trapped in a confined space also means a rising temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide , which , if it reaches too high a level , leads to suffocation .
Search teams monitor for rising levels of CO2 in a building - a rise means someone is trapped inside and breathing .
When CO2 levels stop rising , the search is no longer needed .
Graham Payne , chairman and founder of rescue charity Rapid , told the BBC trapped people could go quiet for hours at a time if they passed out or fell asleep but teams never gave up on them .
" You think you 've lost them but you carry on .
It might be another eight hours , then they start making noise again .
" But if they 're trapped and we can hear , then we get them out , we do n't give up . "
Determination
If you are uninjured , have an air supply and are in an adequate space - however small - the next priority is water .
Dr Shah says estimating how long people can survive without water is the " million dollar question " , but that the average is between three and seven days .
" It depends on the ambient temperature , how much fluid you 're losing through sweat , if you have diarrhoea , how healthy you are , how old you are , " she says .
A few fortunate people may find themselves trapped with a clean supply but others will find a trickle of rainwater , condensation or even use water from inside radiators .
Haiti survivors
How survivors are found Following the South Korean supermarket collapse , IRC rescued a man who had been trapped for 13 days - he had been drinking drops of rainwater and eating cardboard lying around him to stave off hunger .
Some of those rescued in Haiti have spoken of being encouraged by hearing voices around them .
But Ms Ryan says that as time goes on , knowing other people are trapped can be more upsetting than comforting .
" The man trapped in Korea was initially lying with quite a few people but one by one they all stopped talking .
So psychologically , it does n't do any good . "
She says the best thing buried survivors can do is stay calm and listen , however hard that may be .
" We use sound location equipment to look for survivors , which picks up tapping .
If you hear tapping , tap back , or shout , " she says .
But despite the best preparation and advice , rescuers say survival often comes down to " sheer determination " .
" It 's the will , " says Mr Payne .
" Some people just accept they are trapped and it 's fate .
Others just keep going . "

The Gemini North observatory in Hawaii fires a laser into the sky as part of its adaptive optics system ( Image : Gemini Observatory )
Could astronomers accidentally blind Earth - observing satellites ?
That seems to be the worry of the US air force , which restricts the use of lasers pointed at the sky to help focus telescopes .
But some astronomers warn they will miss key observations under the rules , which have tightened in recent years .
Many of the world ’s largest observatories , including Lick , Gemini North , Palomar and Keck in the US , shine lasers into the sky to measure atmospheric turbulence , which distorts images .
The laser causes a layer of sodium atoms at an altitude of about 90 kilometres to glow , producing an artificial star whose twinkles reveal the turbulence .
Shape - shifting mirrors on the telescopes , called adaptive optics , then correct for the blurring by adjusting their shape many times per second .
Advertisement
If such a laser were to hit the optics of an Earth - observing satellite , it could cause damage .
So the air force ’s Space Command has for years restricted when and where US observatories can fire them , and the observatories have voluntarily complied , with little impact on astronomy .
Then about two years ago , just as kinks in the laser technology were being ironed out and interest in the lasers was growing , the rules were tightened .
Now astronomers say the restrictions are beginning to chafe , according to a story first reported by the American Physical Society .
“ Significant negative impacts of these new restrictions on scientific productivity are being felt , ” says a 2008 report ( pdf ) by the US Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy , which is based in Washington , DC .
Off limits
The restricted zones are now so large that they can rule out observations even when a satellite is below the horizon , the report says .
About half to two - thirds of the objects astronomers seek to observe have off - limits periods , or closures , in a given night , the report adds .
These periods last a few seconds to a few minutes each .
“ Typically we ’d get a couple closures a night [ before the changes ] , and now we get hundreds – sort of a dozen per target we submit , ” says Antonin Bouchez , who manages the laser adaptive optics system at the Palomar Observatory in California .
This means astronomers sometimes have to interrupt long exposures of faint objects .
It is possible to work around this by combining several shorter exposures , but this adds noise to the image , degrading its quality , Bouchez says .
Long lead time
But the biggest impact of the restrictions is that they prevent laser - adaptive - optics observations of one - off events like supernovae , which appear and fade away in a matter of days , and gamma-ray bursts , which have afterglows in visible and infrared light that often fade away in a matter of hours .
It is impossible to use the lasers for these sudden , brief events because under current rules , US observatories have to submit their proposed targets to the air force three days in advance .
Bouchez says he is not arguing to completely eliminate the restrictions .
Satellites with optics pointed at the ground could in principle be damaged by laser beams pointing upwards , he says .
Unknown risks
But it is not clear how sensitive the satellites ’ optics are , or how likely a given laser is to directly hit a satellite ’s optics , since details on some US Department of Defense satellites are not publicly released .
The air force simply takes astronomers ’ proposed laser - assisted observations and tells them when to turn the lasers off after crunching its own data on satellite orbits .
“ None of us [ astronomers ] really knows what the risk is , ” he says .
“ The air force people are presumably the only ones who do , because we do n’t know what ’s up there . ”
Even if some restrictions are necessary , faster responses from the air force would make them less burdensome , he says .
“ If you could get an answer within minutes or seconds , then you could observe time - variable things like gamma- ray bursts ” with laser - assisted adaptive optics , he says .
The air force did not immediately respond to New Scientist inquiries about the restrictions .
[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : safer - file - handles - 0.1
Hello , I 'm happy to announce another member in the ' monadic regions ' family : safer - file - handles : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/safer-file-handles-0.1
The package uses my ' regions ' and ' explicit - iomodes ' packages to add two safety features on top of the regular System .
IO file handles and operations : * Regional file handles .
Files must be opened in a region .
When the region terminates all opened files are automatically closed .
The main advantage of regions is that the handles to the opened files can not be returned from the region which ensures no I/O with closed files is possible .
* Explicit IOModes .
The regional file handles are parameterized by the IOMode in which they were opened .
All operations on handles explicitly specify the needed IOMode .
This way it is impossible to read from a write - only handle or write to a read - only handle for example .
The primary technique used in this package is called " Lightweight monadic regions " which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung - chieh Shan .
See : http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight
This technique is implemented in the ' regions ' package which is re-exported from ' safer - file - handles ' .
See the ' safer - file - handles - examples ' package for examples how to use this package : darcs get http://code.haskell.org/~basvandijk/code/safer-file-handles-examples regards , Bas P.S.
While I wrote this message I realized a serious lack of expressive power of my regions package .
Namely that I can't write a program that opens two different types of resources in the _same_ region .
If for example I want to combine my usb - safe package and this package the following wo n't type-check : openBoth ∷ Device → FilePath → IO ( ) openBoth usbDevice filePath = runTopRegion $ do h1 ← open usbDevice ∷ RegionT Device s IO ( RegionalHandle Device ( RegionT Device s IO ) ) h2 ← openFile filePath ReadMode ∷ RegionT File s IO ( RegionalHandle File ( RegionT File s IO ) ) return ()
The reason , as can be seen from the types of the monadic actions , is that the monad types differ between the two actions and bind ((>>= ) :: Monad m => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b ) obviously requires them to be the same .
The main problem thus , is that I parameterized the region with the type of resources .
Note that I 'm working on a solution where I remove the resource type from RegionT .
So instead of : newtype RegionT resource s ( pr ∷ * → *) α = RegionT { unRegionT ∷ ReaderT ( IORef [ Opened resource ] ) pr α } I will have : newtype RegionT s ( pr ∷ * → *) α = RegionT { unRegionT ∷ ReaderT ( IORef [ SomeOpenedResource ] ) pr α } data SomeOpenedResource = ∀ resource .
Resource resource ⇒
Some ( Opened resource ) Hopefully I will be able to release this fix before FP - NL tomorrow .
There are sixteen distinct personality types in the currently most widely - accepted Personality Type model .
Each type has its own characteristics which can be identified in individual personalities .

What will the United States be like in 20 years when today ’s toddlers are in college or trying to land that first job or maybe thinking about starting a family ?
The answer will depend to a great extent on decisions we make now about the American infrastructure .
This came to mind as I was reading about yet another closure of the problem - plagued San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge , which is more than 70 years old .
In 20 years , will today ’s toddlers be traveling on bridges and roads that are in even worse shape than today’s ?
Will they endure mammoth traffic jams that start earlier and end later ?
Will their water supplies be clean and safe ?
Will the promise of clean energy visionaries be realized , or will we still be fouling the environment with carbon filth to the benefit of traditional energy conglomerates and foreign regimes that in many cases wish us anything but good ?
The answers to these and many other related questions will depend to a great extent on decisions we make now ( even in the midst of very tough economic times ) about the American infrastructure .
We ’re trundling along in the infrastructure equivalent of a jalopy , with bridges rotting and falling down , while other nations , our competitors in the global economy , are building efficient , high - speed , high - performance infrastructure platforms to power their 21st - century economies .

According to the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab , last month had the second greatest December Northern Hemisphere snow cover since records were started in 1966 .
Snow extent was measured at 45.86 million sq. km , topped only by 1985 at 45.99 million sq. km .
North America set a record December extent at 15.98 million sq. km , and the US also set a December record at 4.16 million sq. km .

This is not an isolated event for 2009 , as can be seen in the graph below .
Seventeen of the last twenty - one Decembers have had above normal snow cover .

Nor is it an isolated trend for the month of December .
January , 2008 was the second snowiest January on record , and six out of the last eight Januaries have had above normal snow .

October , 2009 was the snowiest October on record in the US , and sixth snowiest in the Northern Hemisphere .
Twelve of the last fifteen Octobers have had above normal snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere , similar to the pattern of the 1970s .

A favorite mantra of the global warming community is that reduced snow cover will reduce the albedo of the earth and provide positive feedback to global warming – causing additional warming .
Clearly that is not happening , at least not during the October through January time period .
2010 is also getting off to a fast start .
Most of Europe and North America is covered with snow , as is much of Asia .

The occupied government of Afghanistan and the United Nations have both concluded that U.S. - led troops recently dragged eight sleeping children out of their beds , handcuffed some of them , and shot them all dead .
While this apparently constitutes an everyday act of kindness , far less intriguing than the vicious singeing of his pubic hairs by Captain Underpants , it is at least a variation on the ordinary American technique of murdering men , women , and children by the dozens with unmanned drones .
Also this week in Afghanistan , eight CIA assassins ( see if you can find a more appropriate name for them ) were murdered by a suicide bombing that one of them apparently executed against the other seven .
The Taliban in Pakistan claims credit and describes the mass - murder as revenge for the CIA 's drone killings .
And we thought unmanned drones were War Perfected because none of the right people would have to risk their lives .
Oops .
Perhaps Detroit - bound passengers risked theirs unwittingly .
The CIA has declared its intention to seek revenge for the suicide strike .
Who knows what the assassination of sleeping students was revenge for .
Perhaps the next lunatic to try blowing up something in the United States will be seeking revenge for whatever Obama does to avenge the victims ( television viewers ? ) of the Crotch Crusader .
Certainly there will be numerous more acts of violence driven by longings for revenge against the drone pilots and the shooters of students .
In a civilized world , the alternative to vengeance is justice .
Often we can even set aside feelings of revenge as long as we are able to act so as to deter more crime .
But at the same time that the puppet president of Afghanistan is demanding the arrest of the troops who shot the handcuffed children , the puppet government of Iraq is facing up to the refusal of the United States to seriously prosecute the Blackwater assassins of innocent Iraqis .
Justice will not be permitted as an alternative to vengeance -- the mere idea is anti-American .
No one so much as blinks at the CIA 's avowal of vengeance for the recent suicide attack , never mind the illegality , because the entire illegal war on Afghanistan / Pakistan was launched and is still maintained as a pretended act of revenge for the crimes of 9 - 11 .
Of course , we 're not bombing the flight schools or the German and Spanish hotels .
Of course , we admit that there are fewer than 100 members of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
Of course we openly seek massive permanent bases and an oil pipeline .
Of course , Obama 's decisions are all electoral calculations computed by the calculus of cowardice .
Of course , we 're prosecuting the Butt Bomber as a criminal , just as we always used to prosecute criminals as criminals .
Of course , revenge would not be a legal justification for war even if we could persuade ourselves it was a sane one .
But the war is publicly understood as revenge , the resistance by its victims is understood as revenge , the escalation is understood as revenge for the resistance , and an eye for an eye slowly makes the whole world blind .
But here 's what we 've forgotten : nothing is ever remotely as horrible as war .
So , nothing can ever constitute a justification for launching or escalating or continuing a war .
Dragging children out of bed and killing them is not a freak blip in the course of a war .
It is war reduced to a comprehensible scale .
It 's less war , not worse war .
Everything we are spending our grandchildren 's unearned pay on , borrowed from China at great expense , all of it is for the murdering of human beings .
And it will remain so for eternity , no matter how many times you chant " Support Duh Troops . "
I know many soldiers and mercenaries had few other options , given our failure to invest in any other industries .
I know they 've been lied to .
I know they 're scared and tired .
But they would n't be there if we brought them home .
And I support a full investment in their physical and mental and economic recovery .
What I do n't support is anyone participating in these wars , and that includes every single American who is not putting every spare moment into demanding that Congress stop forking over the money .
It 's blood money .
It 's payment for murder .
It can not be defended .
It can not be permitted .
We must stop it now .
We must shut down the place it comes from .
Not another dime .
Not another dollar .
Not another death .
Not another thought of revenge .

Maybe this will help : UN says Afghans slain in troop raid were students
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC , Associated Press Writer , Thu Dec 31 , 1:26 pm ET

KABUL �
The United Nations said Thursday that a weekend raid by foreign troops in a tense eastern Afghan province killed eight local students and warned against nighttime actions by coalition forces because they often cause civilian deaths .
The Afghan government said its investigation has established that all 10 people killed Sunday in a remote village in Kunar province were civilians .
Its officials said that eight of those killed were schoolchildren aged 12 - 14 .
. . .
UN special representative in Afghanistan Kai Eide said in a statement that the preliminary UN investigation showed " strong indication " that there were insurgents in the area at the time of the attack .
But , he added , " based on our initial investigation , eight of those killed were students enrolled in local schools . " . . .
Eide said the UN remained concerned about nighttime raids by coalition troops " given that they often result in lethal outcomes for civilians , the dangerous confusion that frequently arises when a family compound is invaded . " . . .
A statement issued Thursday by the Afghan National Security Directorate said the government investigation showed no Afghan forces were involved and " international forces from an unknown address came to the area and without facing any armed resistance , put 10 youth in two rooms and killed them .
" They conducted this operation on their own without informing any security or local authorities of Afghanistan , " the statement said .
___ Associated Press writer Rahim Faiez in Kabul contributed to this report .
I 've excerpted much of the above article , but not the military denials .
Go read them at the link above .
Here 's the Los Angeles Times : Western troops killed civilians , Afghan investigators say
The government investigators say eight of those killed over the weekend in a remote eastern province were boys under 18 .
Western military officials say there is no evidence to back the claim .
By Laura King , Los Angeles Times , December 31 , 2009 Reporting from Kabul , Afghanistan - Afghan government investigators asserted Wednesday that foreign troops had killed 10 civilians in a raid this week , including eight students younger than 18 .
Western military officials called the charge unsubstantiated and urged a joint investigation .
. . .
A statement from the presidential palace said Karzai had offered condolences to the families of the dead , and endorsed the initial findings of an investigative panel that had traveled to Kunar at his behest .
The head of the Afghan delegation , Asadullah Wafa , said 10 males , all civilians , were taken from their homes in Ghazikhan village , in the Narang district , and then shot dead by foreign troops .
The report cited the village schoolmaster as identifying eight of them as pupils between the ages of 12 and 17 .
. . .
Wafa , a close aide to Karzai , suggested that an informant had provided misleading information to Western forces , triggering the strike .
Afghan villagers have sometimes tried to settle scores with rival clans or tribes by falsely reporting insurgent activity to the authorities .

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6971638.ece
President Karzai sent a team of investigators to Narang district , in eastern Kunar province , after reports of a massacre first surfaced on Monday .
" The delegation concluded that a unit of international forces descended from a plane Sunday night into Ghazi Khan village in Narang district of the eastern province of Kunar and took ten people from three homes , eight of them school students in grades six , nine and ten , one of them a guest , the rest from the same family , and shot them dead , " a statement on President Karzai 's website said .
Assadullah Wafa , who led the investigation , said that US soldiers flew to Kunar from Kabul , suggesting that they were part of a special forces unit .
Mr Wafa , a former governor of Helmand province , met President Karzai to discuss his findings yesterday .
" I spoke to the local headmaster , " he said .
" It 's impossible they were al - Qaeda .
They were children , they were civilians , they were innocent .
I condemn this attack . "
In a telephone interview last night , the headmaster said that the victims were asleep in three rooms when the troops arrived .
" Seven students were in one room , " said Rahman Jan Ehsas .
" A student and one guest were in another room , a guest room , and a farmer was asleep with his wife in a third building .
" First the foreign troops entered the guest room and shot two of them .
Then they entered another room and handcuffed the seven students .
Then they killed them . "
Directly from Karzai's website ...

President Karzai in a telephone contact expressed condolences and shared grief with the families of the victims of the recent attack in Kunar province .
Following the attack , President Karzai tasked a delegation on Monday led by the Chief of Complaints Commission and composed of representatives from the ministries of Defense , Interior , National Directorate of Security and the Office of Administrative Affairs for an immediate investigation of the incident .
The findings by the delegation concluded that a unit of international forces descended from a plane Sunday night into Ghazi Khan Village in Narang district of the eastern province of Kunar and took 10 people from three homes , eight of them school students in grades six , nine and 10 , one of them a guest , the rest from the same family , and shot them dead .
Eight of those shot dead were confirmed as school students by the village school principle .

The governor of Kunar , Fazullah Wahidi , said that " the coalition claimed they were enemy fighters , " but that elders in the district and a delegation sent to the remote area had found that " 10 people were killed and all of them were civilians . "

The market price of trills would fluctuate , reflecting the changing prospects for future G.D.P. growth , just as the market price of stocks reflects the changing prospects for future earnings growth .
There is no complexity here .
It is all plain - vanilla financing , though unconventional by today ’s standards .
There are indications that officials in China are starting to worry about threats to their huge investment in United States debt from a possible outbreak of high inflation .
The trills , tied to nominal G.D.P. , would protect them .
Right now TIPS , or Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities , are offering disappointingly low yields , which may have to be raised to attract more investment .
Trills , even at an ultralow dividend yield , would seem more exciting as an inflation - protected prospect , because they represent a share in future economic growth .
The United States government is highly unlikely to default on its debt , but even this remote possibility would be virtually eliminated by trills , because the government ’s dividend burden would automatically decline in tough times , when G.D.P. declined .
The final statement of the Group of 20 economic meeting in Pittsburgh in September pledged to “ establish a pattern of growth across countries that is more sustainable and balanced , and reduce development imbalances . ”
These imbalances  exemplified by the massive Chinese holdings of United States government debt  might not be so worrisome if the investments were financed better .
In fact , issuing shares in G.D.P. might even be viewed as a policy that systematically rectifies a wide array of imbalances in capital flows .
People who expect strong economic growth in a country would bid up the price of a claim on its G.D.P. , creating a cheap source of funding for the issuing government .
So a country with good investment prospects gets the resources at a low current cost .
There would be no need for central bank machinations to try to correct global imbalances .
We already have international equity markets that allow international investments in private firms within countries .
But these do not represent the entire economy .
Corporate stocks represent implicit claims on after - tax corporate profits , which typically amount to no more than 10 percent of G.D.P.
Moreover , after - tax corporate profits are a much more slippery concept than G.D.P. , affected as they are by many domestic policies , including taxes , government involvement in labor disputes and even government bailouts  as we now know very well .

During the holiday season , we often start thinking about what we can do to help others .
The “ spirit of the season ” often prompts us to want to do more for others .
But it can be difficult to know where to go in order to get the best bang for your donation buck — or even to figure out where to go if you want to help in general .
You can go to Charity Navigator to see rankings of how effective your cash donation will be when made to different organizations , but you can also visit one of these four web sites to do a little more for others :
Volunteer Match :
This is a pretty cool web site that allows you to find local places to volunteer by typing in your ZIP code .
You can also search by keyword , according to what interests you .
I found that Meals on Wheels is an option , as well as helping at the local chapter of the American Red Cross .
My local food pantry is n’t on the list , but I know where to go for that .
The Holiday Project :
If you are interested in brightening the holidays for those in nursing homes , you can check into The Holiday Project .
According to the project ’s web site , 60 % of the three million people confined to institutions do not receive visitors .
The Holiday Project helps those in hospitals and nursing homes receive a little holiday cheer .
There are a number of options for helping out , and you can also donate cash .
Welcome Back Veterans :
This is a rather interesting charity devoted to helping veterans .
You can do something as simple as write a thank you note , or you can volunteer to help provide rides for those who need a lift to the nearest VA hospital .
There is also good information about PTSD and what you can do to help veterans suffering from the disorder .
Cards that Give :
You can support the charity of your choice by providing an easy place to shop for greeting cards designed by non-profits as fundraisers .
It ’s a creative and fun way to support a good cause .
Plus , you can raise awareness when you send the greeting cards out to friends and family .
You do n’t have to go online to find ways to give back during the holidays , of course .
There are a number of places in your own community that you can probably donate to — whether you donate your time , talents or cash ( which is also a good tax strategy ) .
Check with local children ’s shelters , homeless shelters , food banks , soup kitchens , thrift shops and your faith congregation .
Keep an eye out for Sub for Santa , Toys for Tots and Angel Tree programs .
You can also check with community organizations , such as the YMCA , Kiwanis or even the Chamber of Commerce to see what sorts of programs are going on in your community .
This is the perfect time of year to remember others and give of yourself .
Besides , if you make it a holiday tradition , it provides the perfect opportunity to teach your children about being charitable as they grow older .
Look for chances to serve as a family when possible .
You might enjoy it so much that it becomes a regular habit throughout the year , and not just something you do during the holidays .

Despite his enthusiasm , Mr. Gundlach , like Mr. Joseph , told of wondering if Google would even allow such potentially self - harming extensions .
Image Michael Gundlach , an independent programmer , created an extension for Google 's browser that hit No. 8 in popularity .
Credit ... Wingate Downs for The New York Times
Each read the rules , and when convinced that an ad - blocking extension would n’t be kicked off , began programming in earnest .
Mr. Joseph said he was “ honestly a little surprised that they kept true to their word and allowed ad - blockers , ” but then explained that in many ways , Google ’s hands were tied .
Programmers who make iPhone applications , whose work exists at the sufferance of Apple , he said , at least share in the profit .
Google needs to give great latitude to programmers as a way of “ keeping credibility with the people who make extensions . ”
Both programmers said their tasks were much easier because they had borrowed from the Firefox add - on  whether its code or its carefully compiled affiliated list of Internet addresses where ads come from .
The Chrome extensions work differently , though : ad blockers on Chrome cannot prevent the ads from arriving on a Web page , as is done on Firefox ; instead they mask the ads after they arrive .
For now , Google is playing only on the fringes by tolerating ad - blocking programs on Chrome , despite the implied threat to its livelihood .
Chrome is still a fringe browser  in the vastness of the Internet , 40 million users is still fringe  and ad - blocking browser additions are still a relatively fringe experience .
“ Ad blockers are still used by a tiny proportion of the Internet population , and these are n’t the kind of people susceptible to ads anyway , ” Wladimir Palant , who runs Adblock Plus on Firefox , wrote in an e-mail message .
Adblock is the most downloaded add - on for Firefox and has more than seven million users .
Still , Google seems confident that Internet users will be able to distinguish between their ads and more aggressive display advertising .
A grave expression of anti-Semitism was discovered in Strasbourg , France , Wednesday : Knesset Members Shlomo Molla ( Kadima ) and Amnon Cohen ( Shas ) , who attended a city ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day , found that the local Jewish cemetery was desecrated by neo -Nazis , and closed by police .
Upon trying to visit the graveyard , which was founded in 1810 , the two found 31 of desecrated headstones : " It was a horrible sight , which probably stemmed from the rising anti-Semitism is Europe , " Molla told Ynet .
Remember Netanyahu : New evil threatening us Anat Shalev Prime minister speaks at Holocaust remembrance ceremony held at Auschwitz , says Jews ' will always remember what Nazi Amalek did to us and prepare for new Amalek making appearance on stage of history '
Netanyahu : New evil threatening us
" There were dozens of shattered tombstones , swastikas sprayed everywhere – complete destruction .
This is a heinous crime , " he added .
" And today of all days , when dozens of European dignitaries attending the ceremony … this is a reminder that anti-Semitism is alive .
World nations must pass laws against such anti-Semitic expressions . "
Israeli consul to Marseille Simona Frankel , who arrived at the cemetery said the perpetrators " must have has extraordinary ill will , considering the temperatures in Strasbourg dropped below - 10 last night .
" The timing , obviously is n’t coincidental , either .
There 's some anti-Semitism in France , but this is the first time I 've come across it personally .
I can't even describe the shock . "
The cemetery ( Photo courtesy of MK Shlomo Molla )
Gilbert Roos , Israel 's honorary consul to Strasbourg , said the city is home to 17,000 Jews : " Unfortunately , we see such incidents here from time to time .
Every once in a while the incidental idiot , some neo - Nazi or a member of a far - right group will carry out this kind of anti-Semitic act .
" We 're not afraid , but this kind of thing seems to be happing more often .
Mostly , we 're just appalled that 65 yeas after the war this kind of thing still exists . "
The report about the Strasbourg cemetery desecration came at the same time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was addressing the crowd at an International Holocaust Remembrance Day memorial in Auschwitz .
" We will always remember what the Nazi Amalek did to us , and we wo n't forget to be prepared for the new Amalek , who is making an appearance on the stage of history and once again threatening to destroy the Jews , " Netanyahu said at the ceremony .
The light was captured on camera by a local man , Jan Petter Jorgensen , while he was on his way to work at a salmon factory .
" The light appeared for two to three minutes .
I could not believe my eyes , and got the shivers and was quite shaken by it , " he said .
Well bless my soul and whiskers .
This is the first time I ’ve joined the congregation at the Church of Apple for a new product launch .
I ’ve watched all the past ones , downloaded the Quicktime movies and marvelled as Apple ’s leader has stood before an ovating faithful and announced the switch to Intel , the birth of iPod , the miniMac , the iTunes Store , OS X , iPhoto , the swan ’s neck iMac , the Shuffle , Apple retail stores , the iPhone , the titanium powerbook , Garageband , the App Store and so much more .
But today I finally made it .
I came to San Francisco for the launch of the iPad .
Oh , happy man .
Today had special resonance .
In front of his family , friends and close colleagues stood the man who founded Apple , was fired from Apple and came back to lead Apple to a greatness , reach and influence that no one on earth imagined .
But a year ago , it is now clear , there was a very strong possibility that Steve Jobs would not live to see 2010 and the birth of his newest baby .
With revenues of 15.6 billion Apple is now the largest mobile device company in the world , Jobs told the subdued but excited six hundred packed into the Yerba Buena Cultural Center for the Arts Theatre this morning .
A few more triumphant housekeeping notes followed and then we were into the meat of it .
Well , the whole event is available to be watched online , you do n’t need me to describe it .
He picked up an iPad and walked us through .
Afterwards I was allowed to play with one myself .
I know there will be many who have already taken one look and pronounced it to be nothing but a large iPhone and something of a disappointment .
I have heard these voices before .
In June 2007 when the iPhone was launched I collected a long list of “ not impressed ” , “ meh ” , “ big deal ” , “ style over substance ” , “ it ’s all hype ” , “ my HTC TyTN can do more ” , “ what a disappointment ” , “ majorly underwhelmed ” and similar reactions .
They can hug to themselves the excuse that the first release of iPhone was 2G , closed to developers and without GPS , cut and paste and many other features that have since been incorporated .
Neither they , nor I , nor anyone , predicted the “ game - changing ” effect the phone would so rapidly have as it evolved into a 3G , third - party app rich , compass and GPS enabled market leader .
Even if it had proved a commercial and business disaster instead of an astounding success , iPhone would remain the most significant release of its generation because of its effect on the smartphone habitat .
Does anybody seriously believe that Android , Nokia , Samsung , Palm , BlackBerry and a dozen others would since have produced the product line they have without the 100,000 volt taser shot up the jacksie that the iPhone delivered to the entire market ?
Nonetheless , even if they could n’t see that THREE BILLION apps would be downloaded in 2 years ( that ’s half a million app downloads a day , give or take ) could they not see that this device was gorgeous , beautifully made , very powerful and capable of development into something extraordinary ?
I see those qualities in the iPad .
Like the first iPhone , iPad 1.0 is a John the Baptist preparing the way of what is to come , but also like iPhone 1.0 ( and Jokanaan himself too come to that )
iPad 1.0 is still fantastic enough in its own right to be classed as a stunningly exciting object , one that you will want NOW and one that will not be matched this year by any company .
In the future , when it has two cameras for fully featured video conferencing , GPS and who knows what else built in ( 1080 HD TV reception and recording and nano projection , for example ) and when the iBook store has recorded its 100 millionth download and the thousands of accessories and peripherals that have invented uses for iPad that we simply can’t now imagine – when that has happened it will all have seemed so natural and inevitable that today ’s nay - sayers and sceptics will have forgotten that they ever doubted its potential .
“ What can I do with it that I ca n’t do with a laptop or an iPhone ? ” they might now be objecting .
“ Too big for my pocket , not big enough for serious use .
Do n’t see the need .
It ’s a solution looking for a problem . ”
There are many issues you could have with the iPad .
No multitasking , still no Flash .
No camera , no GPS .
They all fall away the minute you use it .
I cannot emphasise enough this point : “ Hold your judgment until you ’ve spent five minutes with it ” .
No YouTube film , no promotional video , no keynote address , no list of features can even hint at the extraordinary feeling you get from actually using and interacting with one of these magical objects .
You know how everyone who has ever done Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ?
always says , “ It ’s not the same when you ’re actually here .
So different from when you ’re sitting at home watching . ” ?
You know how often you ’ve heard that ?
Well , you ’ll hear the same from anyone who ’s handled an iPad .
The moment you experience it in your hands you know this is class .
This is a different order of experience .
The speed , the responsiveness , the smooth glide of it , the richness and detail of the display , the heft in your hand , the rightness of the actions and gestures that you employ , untutored and instinctively , it ’s not just a scaled up iPhone or a scaled - down multitouch enhanced laptop – it is a whole new kind of device .
And it will change so much .
Newspapers , magazines , literature , academic text books , brochures , fliers and pamphlets are going to be transformed ( poor Kindle ) .
Specific dedicated apps and enhancements will amaze us .
You will see characters in movies use the iPad.
Jack Bauer will want to return for another season of 24 just so he can download schematics and track vehicles on it .
Bond will have one .
Jason Bourne will have one .
Some character , in a Tron like way , might even be trapped in one .
There ’s much to like of course .
The physical beauty and classy build quality , as in anything designed by Jonathan Ive .
The shockingly low price — $ 499 for the basic model .
The contract - free , unlocked nature of the 3G version .
But there are two chief reasons for its guaranteed success .
1 . It is SO SIMPLE .
It is basically a highly responsive capacitative piece of glass with solid state memory and an IPS display .
Just as a book is basically paper bound together in a portable form factor .
The simplicity is what allows everyone , us , software developers , content providers and accessory manufacturers to pour themselves into it , to remake it according to the limits of their imagination .
I ’ll stop before I get too Disney .
2 . It is made by Apple .
I ’m not being cute here .
If it was made by Hewlett Packard , they would n’t have global control over the OS or the online retail outlets .
If it was made by Google , they would have tendered out the hardware manufacture to HTC .
Apple — and it is one of the reasons some people distrust or dislike them — control it all .
They ’ve designed the silicon , the A4 chip that runs it all , they ’ve designed the batteries , they ’ve overseen every detail of the commercial , technological , design and software elements .
No other company on earth does that .
And being Apple it has n’t been released without ( you can be sure ) Steve Jobs being wholly convinced that it was ready .
“ Not good enough , start again .
Not good enough .
Not good enough .
Not good enough . ”
How many other CEOs say until their employees want to murder them ?
That ’s the difference .
Slightly annoying that the iPhone autocorrects iPad into upas – which is a kind of poison mulberry I believe … you can bet that omission in the iPhone ’s glossary will change with the upcoming release of iPhone OS 4.0 .

I have always thought Hans Christian Andersen should have written a companion piece to the Emperor ’s New Clothes , in which everyone points at the Emperor shouting , in a Nelson from the Simpson ’s voice , “ Ha ha !
He ’s naked . ”
And then a lone child pipes up , ‘ No .
He ’s actually wearing a really fine suit of clothes . ”
And they all clap hands to their foreheads as they realise they have been duped into something worse than the confidence trick , they have fallen for what E. M. Forster called the lack of confidence trick .
How much easier it is to distrust , to doubt , to fold the arms and say “ Not impressed ” .
I ’m not advocating dumb gullibility , but it is has always amused me that those who instinctively dislike Apple for being apparently cool , trendy , design fixated and so on are the ones who are actually so damned cool and so damned sensitive to stylistic nuance that they can’t bear to celebrate or recognise obvious class , beauty and desire .
The fact is that Apple users like me are the uncoolest people on earth : we salivate , dribble , coo , sigh , grin and bubble with delight .
No , I do n’t have shares in Apple .
I came so close to buying some as an act of defensive defiance in the early 90s when every industry insider and expert in the field agreed that Apple had six months to go before going bust .
But I did n’t .
If I had done I could now afford to buy you all an iPad .
Yes , I do like and have tried to champion OpenSource software .
How can I square that with my love of Apple ?
I ’m complicated .
I ’m a human being .
I also believe in a mixed economy and mixed nuts .
I love our National Health Service and the National Theatre , but I also love Fortnum and Mason ’s and Hollywood movies .
“ Apple , ” Steve Jobs said , “ stands at the intersection of Technology and the Liberal Arts . ”
This statement confused non-Americans who are not familiar with the phrase Liberal Arts ( you can look it up here ) but I think shows the fundamental cultural seriousness of Jobs and Apple which in turn explains their huge success and impact .
He might perhaps more accurately have said that Apple stands at the intersection of Technology , the Liberal Arts and Commerce . ”
You may or may not be in the queue for an iPad in March , April , May or June .
Or you may decide to stay your hand for version 2.0 or 3.0 .
But believe me the iPad is here to stay and nothing will be quite the same again .
You should know , however that plenty of industry commentators disagree with me .
They have pronounced themselves less enthralled .
It is perfectly possible I will be proved wrong about its enduring , game - changing place in the landscape and that people will gleefully rub my nose in this blog in two year ’s time .
I ’m certainly not wrong about how soul - scorchingly beautiful it is to use though .
And that , for me , is enough .

Dear old Google .
Sounds silly to feel sorry for them .
But their text transcription service has a long way to go .
I was asked to do a Skype interview for the BBC ’s Newsnight programme today and I gave the producers my Google Voice number .
This Google service is n’t available outside the US , but is basically a phone number that you can use as one number that directs itself to all your phones .
It will call your handsets , whether landline or cell , send SMS texts and voicemail to accounts and so on .
Anyway , one of the Newsnight people left this message on my phone :
Hi , Stephen , it ’s Natasha from BBC Newsnight in London .
Just to say I ’ve sent you two texts .
One is to say that we could do it at eleven am your time after the launch , or any time sooner after the launch , or we could do it at midday as we suggested earlier .
I , er , if you could text me back about that , and I ’ve sent you the details of Skype that you need to do too .
If you could give me a call back .
Enjoy the launch and I ’ll speak to you after that .
Thank you Bye .
I ’ve transcribed it from the voicemail sound file that resides online on my inbox on the Google Voice site .
All fine .
I have also ticked the option for Google Voice to send me a text transcript of any voicemail .
Below is their interpretation of Natasha ’s message … it ’s rather endearing how hopelessly wrong the largest company on earth gets it .
Hi Stephen .
It ’s Jeff from BBC needs in nuns .
And just to say I sent 80 tax , one , if to say we could do it .
I left in i a m your time off to go into any time soon , or the court and full we could grab me today as we suggested at .
A. F. I . If you could text me back byebye .
I ’ve sent you the details of skylights that you need to 3 T if you could give me a call .
Bye .
Enjoy the loans .
I ’ll speak to you after that .
Thank you .
Bye .
Bless

Dog owner banned from keeping animals after pet Dalmatian balloons to 11 stone on crisps and chocolate
At the rate he was eating , he was on the way to being the size of a hundred and one Dalmatians .
On a diet of chocolate and crisps , Barney 's distinctive spots had swollen into great blotches , and he was carrying so much flab he could barely move .
When RSPCA inspectors raided owner John Green 's home , the overfed dog tipped the scales at a mammoth 11st , double what he should have weighed .
So fat he could hardly move :
This was Barney at 11 stone in June .
RSPCA inspectors removed him from owner John Green
Spot the difference : Barney has slimmed down to just 4 stone , but is in need of a new home
Moving about left him out of breath almost immediately , and jumping in the air was an impossibility .
Yesterday , after 50 - year - old Green was banned from keeping dogs for ten years , Barney displayed his new slimline figure , thanks to a healthy new diet and regular exercise .
Since he was taken into care in June , he has slimmed down to just over 6st , and he is now ready to go to a new home .
Inspectors seized eight - year - old Barney after Green , of Macclesfield , Cheshire , ignored warnings to stop overfeeding him .
Crash diet : Barney was so overweight he was unable to lift his paws after being fed on bags of crisps and bars of chocolate
Magistrates in the town heard that Green treated Barney more like a friend than a pet , regularly sharing fatty treats with him .
' When he had a packet of crisps , Barney had a packet of crisps , ' said Andrew Meachin , prosecuting .
Along with regular bars of chocolate , Barney 's food intake left him ' morbidly obese ' , and the dog was immediately seized by the RSPCA .
John Green , 50 , was banned from keeping dogs for ten years
The court was told that unemployed Green ' thought the dog was a little overweight but did not know what weight he should be ' .
His solicitor John Temperley said : ' The phrase " killing with kindness " comes to mind .
He just overfed and overindulged his dog . '
Green admitted cruelty and was also ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work .
Afterwards , RSPCA inspector Rachel Andrews said : ' Hopefully this case will show pet owners just how vital it is to provide their animals with a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise .
' With Christmas just round the corner it might be tempting to overfeed them , but it 's important to remember that those extra pounds can have a huge impact on their comfort , health and well - being . '
Earlier this year animal charity PDSA claimed 35 per cent of Britain 's dogs were overweight , increasing the risk of arthritis , diabetes and an early death .
Pet owners now have a legal duty to provide proper care under the Animal Welfare Act .
Breaches including feeding a cat or dog too much carry the threat of a fine of up to £ 20,000 or even 12 months ' jail .
Anyone who wants to offer Barney a home should call the RSPCA 's Warrington centre on 01925 632 944 .
Many women in Africa are vulnerable to HIV A major trial of a vaginal microbicide has produced no evidence that its use reduces the risk of HIV infection in women .
The gel , PRO 2000 , is intended for use before sexual intercourse to help reduce HIV infection .
It was tested in a trial involving 9,385 women in four African countries .
The risk of HIV infection was not significantly different among women supplied with the gel than in women given a placebo gel .
This result is disheartening
Dr Sheena McCormack
Medical Research Council
It was hoped microbicide gels would prove to be an effective way to limit the spread of HIV , as experts admit that condom promotion alone has not controlled the epidemic .
New ways of curbing the spread of HIV are badly needed , particularly in sub-Saharan Africa , where nearly 60 % of those infected with the virus are women .
Women are often forced to take part in unsafe sex , and are biologically more vulnerable to HIV infection than men - so in theory a gel they could apply themselves could be effective .
A previous , smaller trial suggested PRO 2000 could reduce the risk of HIV infection by 30 % .
But the latest study , carried out by the Microbicides Development Programme , a not - for - profit partnership of 16 African and European research institutions , failed to find any positive effect .
And the researchers say the trial was large enough to provide conclusive results .
The women who took part were given the gel together with free condoms and access to counselling about safe sex .
Important result Lead researcher Dr Sheena McCormack , of the Medical Research Council , which part - funded the study , said : " This result is disheartening .
" Nevertheless , we know this is an important result and it shows clearly the need to undertake trials which are large enough to provide definitive evidence for whether or not a product works . "
Professor Jonathan Weber , from Imperial College London , who also took part in the study , said : " It is unfortunate that this microbicide is ineffective at preventing HIV infection , but it 's still vital for us as scientists to continue to look for new ways of preventing HIV .
" Now that we know this microbicide is not the answer , we can concentrate on other treatments that might be . "

The World Health Organisation and the pharmaceutical industry have been criticised for their handling of last year 's swine flu pandemic .
At a hearing of the Council of Europe - the European Union 's human rights body - the WHO faced accusations that it exaggerated the danger of the virus under pressure from drug companies .
When a pandemic was declared last June , most European countries changed their health priorities to accommodate thousands of expected patients .
A number of European governments had signed contracts with the drug companies to buy back vaccines , believing a flu pandemic long predicted by health experts would be a virus - like bird flu with a very high death rate .
But swine flu , it is now clear , is a mild flu with a lower mortality than seasonal influenza .
The organisation denies any conflict of interest .

Saying you 're a deficit hawk is like saying you 're a patriot .
Everybody claims to be one , but the definitions vary so wildly as to make the term utterly worthless .
Catherine Rampell breaks down the internecine war among self - proclaimed hawks at the New York Times ' Economix blog .
It 's a good piece , but I disagree ever - so - slightly with her take on why we can't get a good conversation going about fixing structural problems with our debt .
She writes :
The biggest criticism I have right now of Washington 's handling of fiscal policy :
Yes , government officials can do things that foster economic recovery this year .
And they can do things that will save the economy from a debt crisis 10 years from now .
But the options on the table for fixing the economy today are relatively concrete ( if sometimes controversial ) , whereas those for reducing the budget tomorrow are notoriously vague ...
I think that 's true , but it 's not surprising .
Obviously a bill that makes its way to the president 's desk is more specific than an idea for a bill that has n't been written .
Moreover , there 's no political gain in writing up a concrete , rational plan for budget reduction .
Fighting the deficit will require a painful combination of tax increases and budget cuts .
It will be a bitter pill .
If you think spending an extra $ 787 billion to fight a recession did n't go over well , try presenting a bill that raises taxes and reduces services in the name of " shoring up our long - term finances . "
This reluctance to commit to , or even discuss , a game plan , I think , is what makes lots of people nervous about encouraging their elected officials to spend more money now , even if such spending might help put more of the jobless back to work .
They just do n't trust legislators to exercise self - discipline , even when boom times return .
Rampell is absolutely right that a lot of Americans , especially right of center , are concerned about the Ricardian impact of overspending today , because they 're afraid that the other shoe will drop in the form of taxes or reduced spending in the future .
Even though I support deficit spending , I 'll acknowledge that this is a legitimate concern .
But the " reluctance to commit to , or even discuss , a game plan " goes back to politics .
The " game plan " is going to be ugly .
For example , the bulk of our long - term debt crisis lives in entitlement spending -- Medicare and Social Security .
Reforming entitlements by means - testing both benefits , raising the SS age , or tightening Medicare outlays requires removing benefits from retirees and soon - to - be retirees , who represent both the richest segments of the population and the most likely to vote .
Maybe being the first politician to propose these kind of changes will earn major brownie points from reasonable voters .
More likely , it will involve a great weeping and gnashing of dentures , and electoral calamity .
Finally ...
Maybe the Conrad - Gregg proposal for a " fiscal task force " will help ; the verdict is still out .
The Conrad - Gregg proposal shows exactly how serious our elected fiscal hawks are .
That is , not at all .
The duo's debt - fighting bill would require a super - majority to pass both the House and Senate .
It 's designed to be impossible to pass .
Our electeds are n't afraid of discussing ideas to reduce the deficit .
They 're afraid of what happens if we hear them .
In an extended propagandistic interview in Time magazine , Ben Bernanke is finally asked the crucial question :
Q : So , I ’m a fringe economics type , I ’m not personally , but I ’m saying a reader picks up TIME Magazine , and they see this and they go , oh , my God , Ben Bernanke , low interest rates caused this whole thing .
He ’s just an extension of that devil man , Alan Greenspan .
Low interest rates , this is the whole cause .
What ’s your bullet answer to that ?
A : It ’s hard to give a bullet answer .
Q : Myth - busters answer .
A : Monetary policy in the early part of this decade was accommodated for good reasons .
There was a recession in 2001 , there was the jobless recovery , inflation was very low .
Keeping interest rates low to get the economy back on track was a reasonable thing to do .
I think there are a lot of forces that led to the crisis , a whole range of things were relevant there .
I do n’t think that monetary policy was a particularly important source of the crisis .
By way of review , the Fed has only one distinct power : the capacity to create money out of thin air .
In the end , and despite all its other powers , this is the one that matters .
So if you are interviewing the Fed governor , one would think that this would be the central question : what did you do with the money - creating power to bring about this situation ?
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
This is not a “ fringe concern . ”
This was a central issue in all 19th century debates on money .
It was the primary concern before Keynes within the economic profession .
The belief that money manipulations spawns booms and busts was the conventional wisdom even into the 1940s .
As late as 1973 , F.A. Hayek won the Nobel Prize for his work demonstrating the point .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
To be sure , what matters is not whether this is a fringe issue but whether it is true .
In fact , the point is so true that it is apparently the great taboo issue about which one is never supposed to ask the head of the Fed .
We are n’t supposed to ask the wizard about any possible downside to his powers .
What ’s even more interesting is that Bernanke does n’t quite say that monetary policy did n’t cause the boom - bust .
What he says is that there were “ good reasons ” for injecting hallucinogenic drugs into the economic bloodstream .
Then he goes on to say that the results were not “ particularly important . ”
We are supposed to trust his answer .
At least he does admit that the Fed was “ accommodative ” — in the same way that the drug dealer accommodates a daily habit .
The economy was running on debt , but desperately wanting to cleanse itself of its problem .
The Fed intervened to prevent the inevitable .
And so the inevitable got worse and came anyway .
That ’s the short history .
And from this we can know the future : the next time will be even worse .
This is the nature of the state and its affiliated institutions : to learn nothing from mistakes and to screw things up even more the next time .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
What about Bernanke ’s history of the early 2000s ?
He mentions the recession of 2001 and the “ jobless recovery ” ( what about today ’s jobless green shoots ? ) .
What he does n’t mention , and what very few people have pointed out , is the impact of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
After the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were hit , the mood in Washington was total shock and horror .
Bush claimed at the time that he was determined to do whatever it took to show those terrorists that they could n’t hurt our economy .
We will be strong in the face of these attacks !
Here is what Bush said immediately after 9/11 :
I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy .
Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity .
They did not touch its source .
America is successful because of the hard work , and creativity , and enterprise of our people .
These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th , and they are our strengths today .
Of course , Washington does n’t have any magical ability to make the economy strong , to cause prosperity to appear as a way of showing terrorists what ’s what .
The Fed is the only weapon in town for these purposes .
And so the Fed went to work for the central state , as it always does .
You can see the evidence here .
Now , this action , like everything else the state does , caused unforeseen results .
They thought they would create a boom but now we are all paying the price .
Osama bin Laden must be laughing .
If Washington had done nothing at all after 9/11/01 , either in domestic or foreign policy , the world would be much more peaceful and prosperous today .

Trial of C.B. Reynolds for Blasphemy
Trial of C.B. Reynolds for Blasphemy
Introduction
by Madalyn O'Hair
Return to Top
Charles B. Reynolds was born in New York City on August 5 , 1832 , of parents who had just arrived from Somershire , England .
His mother died at his birth .
His father died before the boy was five .
Since there were no relatives , nothing is known of the orphan 's childhood .
The first record given of him in his biographical materials is that at age 36 in 1868 , he began to preach for the First Day Adventists , and the following year , in 1869 , he joined the Seventh Day Adventists .
The next date is September 1883 , when he made his first appearance at the New York Freethinkers ' Convention held at Corinthian Academy of Music , in Rochester .
His conversion had come , it is held , from reading the Boston Investigator and the New York Truth Seeker .
His speech was an eloquent eulogy on D.M. Bennett , the founder of the Truth Seeker magazine .
The next year he was elected chairman of the executive committee of the American Secular Union at the annual convention held at Cassadaga , New York , in 1884 .
During 1886 , Reynolds began to give speeches , with a stereopticon exhibition , and was assisted therein by his son Clinton , age 17 .
The exhibition consisted of paintings of exotic places , illuminated with gas light , and accompanied by an educational lecture .
One of his most acclaimed lectures proved to be " Why I Left The Pulpit . "
Other lectures focused on the need for " secularism . "
At the same time his wife was also lecturing .
In 1885 he ( or someone ) had proposed that -- since halls were not obtainable for meetings of persons such as the freethinkers of the nation -- a tent should be purchased as a substitute meeting place for a traveling lecturer .
Through the Truth Seeker , the necessary funds were raised , three hundred dollars of which came from William Smith of Geneva , New York .
After some successful work in the West , Reynolds pitched the tent at Boonton , New Jersey , on July 26 , 1886 .
There , after two or three nights of disturbances , including the cutting of his tent , he was arrested for blasphemy after a howling mob attacked him and his friends during the delivery of the lecture .
His tent was substantially destroyed by the mob action .
At this time Reynolds was placed under a three hundred dollar bond , which was given by James Maxfield .
In the interest of peace , Reynolds dismissed the audience in attendance , but this availed him naught .
He was finally forced to make his escape and leave the tent in the possession of the mob .
On October 13 , Reynolds appeared in Morristown .
He was arrested there and held under a bond of four hundred dollars to await the action of the Morris County Grand Jury .
Edwin Warman was the one to offer the bail .
An indictment was had on October 19 , 1886 , with Reynolds charged with one blasphemy at Boonton and a second at Morristown .
On October 20 , Reynolds , in reading the newspaper , found that the blasphemy was not for his words at either the Boonton or the Morristown tent lectures , but rested on a document he has passed out after the incidents .
He had , in fact , distributed two .
The first was an analysis of the blasphemy laws .
The second was titled " Blasphemy and The Bible . "
The latter showed that Christians and their Bible were the real blasphemers inasmuch as they ascribed to god sentiments , passions , and attributes which degraded him to an inhumane , bloodthirsty monster .
This inflamed the Grand Jury more than did the speeches given .
The original bond was then renewed again , and a trial came off May 19 and 20 , 1887 .
The editor of the Truth Seeker , then E.M. Macdonald , wrote to Robert Ingersoll asking if he would take the defense of Reynolds .
Ingersoll replied on August 13 , agreeing to do so -- the only time on record that he came to the aid of a freethinker .
This was one case that Ingersoll lost .
The jury returned a verdict of " guilty . "
The judge gave a judgement of twenty - five dollars and costs , amounting to a total of seventy - five dollars , which were paid by Robert Ingersoll .
The speech to the jury was considered to be so sublime by those who attended that it was published by C.P. Farrell .
A copy of the speech follows this introduction .
In June of the same year an attempt was made through the Truth Seeker to pay Ingersoll for his services .
When informed of this , Ingersoll wrote a letter dated June 2 , 1887 , in which such payment was declined .
Following the trial , Reynolds continued his proselytizing , making further appearances in New Jersey , Michigan , Canada , New York , Connecticut , Ohio , Indiana , Iowa , and Pennsylvania .
Later , on May 1 , 1889 , Mr. Reynolds accepted an engagement to lecture Small 's Opera House to members of the Liberal Club of Walla Walla , Washington , each Sunday evening for six months .
In May 1892 , he accepted an engagement as lecturer for the Tacoma Secular Union , lecturing weekly .
He soon became president of the club , and in December 1889 , he began to organize a first state convention which came to fruition in Seattle in 1890 .
A state Union was formed and was successful in abolishing paid chaplains in the Senate and House in Olympia .
It also worked against reading of the Bible and religious services in public schools .
It also proposed that Sunday closing laws be abolished .
On August 6 , 1893 , Reynolds wrote inaugurated the Tacoma Secular Sunday School
For the next three years he was the regular speaker for the Secular Church of Portland , Oregon .
During all of this activity , Reynolds wrote regularly for the Boston Investigator , the New York Truth Seeker , and the Indiana Ironclad Age .
He died , at age 64 , of concussion of the brain sustained when he fell from a swing in which he was sitting .
The death occurred at his home in Seattle , Washington , on July 3 , 1896 .
Reproduced here are ( 1 ) the New York Times May 20 , 1887 news account of Reynolds ' blasphemy trial and ( 2 ) Robert Ingersoll 's address to the jury .
Trial of C.B. Reynolds for Blasphemy
Blasphemy in New Jersey
The New York Times , May 20 , 1887
Return to Top
Within thirty miles of New York , in the city of Morristown , New Jersey , a man was put on trial yesterday for distributing a pamphlet argument against the infallibility of the Bible .
The crime which the indictment alleges is blasphemy , for which the statutes of New Jersey provide a penalty of two hundred dollars fine , or twelve months imprisonment , or both .
It is the first case of the kind ever tried in New Jersey , although the law dates back to colonial days .
Charles B. Reynolds is the man on trial , and the State of New Jersey , through the Prosecuting Attorney of Morris County , is the prosecutor .
The Circuit Court , Judge Francis Child , assisted by County Judges Munson and Quimby , sit upon the case .
Prosecutor Wilder W. Cutler represents the State , and Robert G. Ingersoll appears for the defendant .
Mr. Reynolds went to Boonton last summer to hold " free - thought " meetings .
Announcing his purpose without any flourish , he secured a piece of ground , pitched a tent upon it , and invited the towns - people to come and hear him .
It was understood that he had been a Methodist minister ; that , finding it impossible to reconcile his mind to some of the historical parts of the Bible , and unable to accept it in his entirety as a moral guide , he left the church and set out to proclaim his conclusions .
The churches in Boonton arrayed themselves against him .
The Catholics and Methodists were especially active .
Taking this opposition as an excuse , one element of the town invaded his tent .
They pelted Reynolds with ancient eggs and vegetables .
they chopped away the guy ropes of the tent and slashed the canvas with their knives .
When the tent collapsed , the crowd rushed for the speaker to inflict further punishment by plunging him in the duck pond .
They rummaged the wrecked tent , but in vain .
He had made his way out in the confusion and was no more seen in Boonton .
But what he had said did not leave Boonton with him , and the pamphlets he had distributed were read by many who probably would not have looked between their covers had his visit been attended by no unusual circumstances .
Boonton was still agitated upon the subject when Mr. Reynolds appeared in Morristown .
This time he did not try to hold meetings , but had his pamphlets with him .
Mr. Reynolds appeared in Morristown with the pamphlets on October thirteenth .
A Boonton delegation was there , clamoring for his indictment for blasphemy .
The Grand Jury heard of his visit and found two indictments against him : one for blasphemy at Boonton and the second for blasphemy at Morristown .
He furnished a five hundred dollar bond to appear for trial .
On account of Colonel Ingersoll 's throat troubles the case was adjourned several times through the winter and until Monday last , when it was set peremptorily for trial yesterday .
The public feeling excited at Boonton was overshadowed by that of Morristown and the neighboring region .
For six months no topic was so interesting to the public as this .
It monopolized attention at the stores , and became a fruitful subject of gossip in social and church circles .
Under such circumstances it was to be expected that everybody who could spare time would go to court yesterday .
Lines of people began to climb the court house hill early in the morning .
At the hour of opening court the room set apart for the trial was packed , and distaffs had to be stationed at the foot of the stairs to keep back those who were not early enough .
From nine thirty to eleven o'clock the crowd inside talked of blasphemy in all the phases suggested by this case , and the outsiders waited patiently on the lawn and steps and along the dusty approaches to the gray building .
Eleven O'clock brought the train from New York and on it Colonel Ingersoll .
His arrival at the court house with his clerk opened a new chapter in the day 's gossip .
The event was so absorbing indeed , that the crowd failed entirely to notice an elderly man wearing a black frock suit , a silk hat , with an army badge pinned to his coat , and looking like a merchant of means , who entered the court house a few minutes behind the famous lawyer .
That last comer was the defendant .
All was ready for the case .
Within five minutes five jurors were in the box .
Then Colonel Ingersoll asked what were his rights about challenges .
He was informed that he might make six peremptory challenges and must challenge before the jurors took their seats .
The only disqualification the Court would recognize would be the inability of a juror to change his opinion in spite of evidence .
Colonel Ingersoll induced the Court to let him examine the five in the box and promptly ejected two Presbyterians .
Thereafter Colonel Ingersoll examined every juror as soon as presented .
He asked particularly about the nature of each man 's prejudice , if he had one .
To a juror who did not know that he understood the word , the Colonel replied : " I may not define the word legally , but my own idea is that a man is prejudiced when he has made up his mind on a case without knowing anything about it "
This juror thought he came under that category .
Presbyterians had a rather hard time with the examiner .
After twenty men had been examined and the defense had exercised five of its peremptory challenges , the following were sworn as jurymen ....
The jury having been sworn , Prosecutor Cutler announced that he would try only the indictment for the offense in Morristown .
He said that Reynolds was charged with distributing pamphlets containing matter claimed to be blasphemous under the law .
If the charge could be proved he asked a verdict of guilty .
Then he called sixteen towns - people , to most of whom Reynolds had given a pamphlet .
Colonel Ingersoll tried to get the Presbyterian witnesses to say that they had read the pamphlet .
None of them admitted it .
Further than this he attempted no cross-examination .
" I do not know that I shall have any witnesses one way or the other , " Colonel Ingersoll said , rising to suggest a recess .
" Perhaps after dinner I may feel like making a few remarks . "
" There will be great disappointment if you do not " Judge Child responded , in a tone that meant a word for himself as well as the other listeners .
The spectators nodded approval to this sentiment .
At 4:20 o'clock Colonel Ingersoll having spoken since 2 o'clock , Judge Child adjourned until this morning .
As Colonel Ingersoll left the room a throng pressed after him to offer congratulations .
One old man said : " Colonel Ingersoll I am a presbyterian pastor , but I must say that was the noblest speech in defense of liberty I ever heard !
Your hand , sir ; your hand . "

Trial of C.B. Reynolds for Blasphemy
Closing Argument by Robert G. Ingersoll
From The Works of Robert G. Ingersoll

Return to Top
Address to the Jury .
Gentlemen of the Jury : I regard this as one of the most important cases that can be submitted to a jury .
It is not a case that involves a little property , neither is it one that involves simply the liberty of one man .
It involves the freedom of speech , the intellectual liberty of every citizen of New Jersey .
The question to be tried by you is whether a man has the right to express his honest thought ; and for that reason there can be no case of greater importance submitted to a jury .
And it may be well enough for me , at the outset , to admit that there could be no case in which I could take a greater -- a deeper interest .
For my part , I would not wish to live in a world where I could not express my honest opinions .
Men who deny to others the right of speech are not fit to live with honest men .
I deny the right of any man , of any number of men , of any church , of any State , to put a padlock on the lips -- to make the tongue a convict .
I passionately deny the right of the Herod of authority to kill the children of the brain .
A man has a right to work with his hands , to plow the earth , to sow the seed , and that man has a right to reap the harvest .
If we have not that right , then all are slaves except those who take these rights from their fellow - men .
If you have the right to work with your hands and to gather the harvest for yourself and your children , have you not a right to cultivate your brain ?
Have you not the right to read , to observe , to investigate -- and when you have so read and so investigated , have you not the right to reap that field ?
And what is it to reap that field ?
It is simply to express what you have ascertained -- simply to give your thoughts to your fellow - men .
If there is one subject in this world worthy of being discussed , worthy of being understood , it is the question of intellectual liberty .
Without that , we are simply painted clay ; without that , we are poor , miserable serfs and slaves .
If you have not the right to express your opinions , if the defendant has not this right , then no man ever walked beneath the blue of heaven that had the right to express his thought .
If others claim the right , where did they get it ?
How did they happen to have it , and how did you happen to be deprived of it ?
Where did a church or a nation get that right ?
Are we not all children of the same Mother ?
Are we not all compelled to think , whether we wish to or not ?
Can you help thinking as you do ?
When you look out upon the woods , the fields -- when you look at the solemn splendors of the night -- these things produce certain thoughts in your mind , and they produce them necessarily .
No man can think as he desires .
No man controls the action of his brain , any more than he controls the action of his heart .
The blood pursues its old accustomed ways in spite of you .
The eyes see , if you open them , in spite of you .
The ears hear , if they are unstopped , without asking your permission .
And the brain thinks in spite of you .
Should you express that thought ?
Certainly you should , if others express theirs .
You have exactly the same right .
He who takes it from you is a robber .
For thousands of years people have been trying to force other people to think their way .
Did they succeed ?
No .
Will they succeed ?
No .
Why ?
Because brute force is not an argument .
You can stand with the lash over a man , or you can stand by the prison door , or beneath the gallows , or by the stake , and say to this man : " Recant , or the lash descends , the prison door is locked upon you , the rope is put about your neck , or the torch is given to the fagot . "
And so the man recants .
Is he convinced ?
Not at all .
Have you produced a new argument ?
Not the slightest .
And yet the ignorant bigots of this world have been trying for thousands of years to rule the minds of men by brute force .
They have endeavored to improve the mind by torturing the flesh -- to spread religion with the sword and torch .
They have tried to convince their brothers by putting their feet in iron boots , by putting fathers , mothers , patriots , philosophers and philanthropists in dungeons .
And what has been the result ?
Are we any nearer thinking alike today than we were then ?
No orthodox church ever had power that it did not endeavor to make people think its way by force and flame .
And yet every church that ever was established commenced in the minority , and while it was in the minority advocated free speech -- every one .
John Calvin , the founder of the Presbyterian Church , while he lived in France , wrote a book on religious toleration in order to show that all men had an equal right to think ; and yet that man afterward , clothed in a little authority , forgot all his sentiments about religious liberty , and had poor Serviettes burned at the stake , for differing with him on a question that neither of them knew anything about .
In the minority , Calvin advocated toleration -- in the majority , he practiced murder .
I want you to understand what has been done in the world to force men to think alike .
It seems to me that if there is some infinite being who wants us to think alike he would have made us alike .
Why did he not do so ?
Why did he make your brain so that you could not by any possibility be a Methodist ?
Why did he make yours so that you could not be a Catholic ?
And why did he make the brain of another so that he is an unbeliever -- why the brain of another so that he became a Mohammedan -- if he wanted us all to believe alike ?
After all , maybe Nature is good enough and grand enough and broad enough to give us the diversity born of liberty .
Maybe , after all , it would not be best for us all to be just the same .
What a stupid world , if everybody said yes to everything that everybody else might say .
The most important thing in this world is liberty .
More important than food or clothes -- more important than gold or houses or lands -- more important than art or science -- more important than all religions , is the liberty of man .
If civilization tends to do away with liberty , then I agree with Mr. Buckle that civilization is a curse .
Gladly would I give up the splendors of the nineteenth century -- gladly would I forget every invention that has leaped from the brain of man -- gladly would I see all books ashes , all works of art destroyed , all statues broken , and all the triumphs of the world lost -- gladly , joyously would I go back to the abodes and dens of savagery , if that were necessary to preserve the inestimable gem of human liberty .
So would every man who has a heart and brain .
How has the church in every age , when in authority , defended itself ?
Always by a statute against blasphemy , against argument , against free speech .
And there never was such a statute that did not stain the book that it was in and that did not certify to the savagery of the men who passed it .
Never .
By making a statute and by defining blasphemy , the church sought to prevent discussion -- sought to prevent argument -- sought to prevent a man giving his honest opinion .
Certainly a tenet , a dogma , a doctrine , is safe when hedged about by a statute that prevents your speaking against it .
In the silence of slavery it exists .
It lives because lips are locked .
It lives because men are slaves .
If I understand myself , I advocate only the doctrines that in my judgment will make this world happier and better .
If I know myself , I advocate only those things that will make a man a better citizen , a better father , a kinder husband -- that will make a woman a better wife , a better mother -- doctrines that will fill every home with sunshine and with joy .
And if I believed that anything I should say today would have any other possible tendency , I would stop .
I am a believer in liberty .
That is my religion -- to give to every other human being every right that I claim for myself , and I grant to every other human being , not the right -- because it is his right -- but instead of granting I declare that it is his right , to attack every doctrine that I maintain , to answer every argument that I may urge -- in other words , he must have absolute freedom of speech .
I am a believer in what I call " intellectual hospitality . "
A man comes to your door .
If you are a gentleman and he appears to be a good man , you receive him with a smile .
You ask after his health .
You say : " Take a chair ; are you thirsty , are you hungry , will you not break bread with me ? "
That is what a hospitable , good man does -- he does not set the dog on him .
Now , how should we treat a new thought ?
I say that the brain should be hospitable and say to the new thought : " Come in ; sit down ; I want to cross - examine you ; I want to find whether you are good or bad ; if good , stay ; if bad , I do n't want to hurt you -- probably you think you are all right -- but your room is better than your company , and I will take another idea in your place . "
Why not ?
Can any man have the egotism to say that he has found it all out ?
No .
Every man who has thought , knows not only how little he knows , but how little every other human being knows , and how ignorant , after all , the world must be .
There was a time in Europe when the Catholic Church had power .
And I want it distinctly understood with this jury , that while I am opposed to Catholicism I am not opposed to Catholics -- while I am opposed to Presbyterianism I am not opposed to Presbyterians .
I do not fight people -- I fight ideas , I fight principles , and I never go into personalities .
As I said , I do not hate Presbyterians , but Presbyterianism -- that is , I am opposed to their doctrine .
I do not hate a man that has the rheumatism -- I hate the rheumatism when it has a man .
So I attack certain principles because I think they are wrong , but I always want it understood that I have nothing against persons -- nothing against victims .
There was a time when the Catholic Church was in power in the Old World .
All at once there arose a man called Martin Luther , and what did the dear old Catholics think ?
" Oh , " they said , " that man and his followers are going to hell . "
But they did not go .
They were very good people .
They may have been mistaken -- I do not know .
I think they were right in their opposition to Catholicism -- but I have just as much objection to the religion they founded as I have to the church they left .
But they thought they were right , and they made very good citizens , and it turned out that their differing from the Mother Church did not hurt them , And then after a while they began to divide , and there arose Baptists ; and the other gentlemen , who believed in this law that is now in New Jersey , began cutting off their ears so that they could hear better ; they began putting them in prison so that they would have a chance to think .
But the Baptists turned out to be good folks -- first rate -- good husbands , good fathers , good citizens .
And in a little while , in England , the people turned to be Episcopalians , on account of a little war that Henry VIII . , had with the Pope -- and I always sided with the Pope in that war -- but it made no difference ; and in a little while the Episcopalians turned out to be just about like other folks -- no worse -- and , as I know of , no better .
After awhile arose the Puritan , and the Episcopalian said , " We do n't want anything of him -- he is a bad man " ; and they finally drove some of them away and they settled in New England , and there were among them Quakers , than whom there never were better people on the earth -- industrious , frugal , gentle , kind and loving -- and yet these Puritans began hanging them .
They said : " They are corrupting our children ; if this thing goes on , everybody will believe in being kind and gentle and good , and what will become of us ? "
They were honest about it .
So they went to cutting off ears .
But the Quakers were good people and none of the prophecies were fulfilled .
In a little while there came some Unitarians and they said , " The world is going to ruin , sure " ; -- but the world went on as usual , and the Unitarians produced men like Channing -- one of the tenderest spirits that ever lived -- they produced men like Theodore Parker -- one of the greatest brained and greatest hearted men produced upon this continent -- a good man -- and yet they thought he was a blasphemer -- they even prayed for his death -- on their bended knees they asked their God to take time to kill him .
Well , they were mistaken .
Honest , probably .
After awhile came the Universalists , who said : " God is good .
He will not damn anybody always , just for a little mistake he made here .
This is a very short life ; the path we travel is very dim , and a great many shadows fall in the way , and if a man happens to stub his toe , God will not burn him forever . "
And then all the rest of the sects cried out , " Why , if you do away with hell , everybody will murder just for pastime -- everybody will go to stealing just to enjoy themselves . "
But they did not .
The Universalists were good people -- just as good as any others .
Most of them much better .
None of the prophecies were fulfilled , and yet the differences existed .
And so we go on until we find people who do not believe the Bible at all , and when they say they do not , they come within this statute .
Now , gentlemen , I am going to try to show you , first , that this statute under which Mr. Reynolds is being tried is unconstitutional -- that it is not in harmony with the constitution of New Jersey ; and I am going to try to show you in addition to that , that it was passed hundreds of years ago , by men who believed it was right to burn heretics and tie Quakers to the end of a cart ; men and even modest women -- stripped naked -- and lash them from town to town .
They were the men who originally passed that statute , and I want to show you that it has slept all this time , and I am informed -- I do not know how it is -- that there never has been a prosecution in this State for blasphemy .
Now , gentlemen , what is blasphemy ?
Of course nobody knows what it is , unless he takes into consideration where he is .
What is blasphemy in one country would be a religious exhortation in another .
It is owing to where you are and who is in authority .
And let me call your attention to the impudence and bigotry of the American Christians , We send missionaries to other countries .
What for ?
To tell them that their religion is false , that their gods are myths and monsters , that their saviors and apostles were impostors , and that our religion is true .
You send a man from Morristown -- a Presbyterian , over to Turkey .
He goes there , and he tells the Mohammedans -- and he has it in a pamphlet and he distributes it -- that the Koran is a lie , that Mohammed was not a prophet of God , that the angel Gabriel is not so large that it is four hundred leagues between his eyes -- that it is all a mistake -- there never was an angel so large as that .
Then what would the Turks do ?
Suppose the Turks had a law like this statute in New Jersey .
They would put the Morristown missionary in jail , and he would send home word , and then what would the people of Morristown say ?
Honestly -- what do you think they would say ?
They would say , " Why , look at those poor , heathen wretches .
We sent a man over there armed with the truth , and yet they were so blinded by their idolatrous religion , so steeped in superstition , that they actually put that man in prison . "
Gentlemen , does not that show the need of more missionaries ?
I would say , yes .
Now , let us turn the tables .
A gentleman comes from Turkey to Morristown .
He has got a pamphlet .
He says , " The Koran is the inspired book , Mohammed is the real prophet , your Bible is false and your Savior simply a myth . "
Thereupon the Morristown people put him in jail .
Then what would the Turks say ?
They would say , " Morristown needs more missionaries , " and I would agree with them .
In other words , what we want is intellectual hospitality .
Let the world talk .
And see how foolish this trial is .
I have no doubt that the prosecuting attorney agrees with me today , that whether this law is good or bad , this trial should not have taken place .
And let me tell you why .
Here comes a man into your town and circulates a pamphlet .
Now , if they had just kept still , very few would ever have heard of it .
That would have been the end .
The diameter of the echo would have been a few thousand feet .
But in order to stop the discussion of that question , they indicted this man , and that question has been more discussed in this country since this indictment than all the discussions put together since New Jersey was first granted to Charles II 's dearest brother James , the Duke of York .
And what else ?
A trial here that is to be reported and published all over the United States , a trial that will give Mr. Reynolds a congregation of fifty millions of people .
And yet this was done for the purpose of stopping a discussion of this subject .
I want to show you that the thing is in itself almost idiotic -- that it defeats itself , and that you cannot crush out these things by force .
Not only so , but Mr. Reynolds has the right to be defended , and his counsel has the right to give his opinions on this subject .
Suppose that we put Mr. Reynolds in jail .
The argument has not been sent to jail .
That is still going the rounds , free as the winds .
Suppose you keep him at hard labor a year -- all the time he is there , hundreds and thousands of people will be reading some account , or some fragment , of this trial .
There is the trouble .
If you could only imprison a thought , then intellectual tyranny might succeed .
If you could only take an argument and put a striped suit of clothes on it -- if you could only take a good , splendid shining fact and lock it up in some dungeon of ignorance , so that its light would never again enter the mind of man , then you might succeed in stopping human progress .
Otherwise , no .
Let us see about this particular statute .
In the first place , the State has a constitution .
That constitution is a rule , a limitation to the power of the Legislature , and a certain breastwork for the protection of private rights , and the constitution says to this sea of passions and prejudices : " Thus far and no farther . "
The constitution says to each individual : " This shall panoply you ; this is your complete coat of mail ; this shall defend your rights . "
And it is usual in this country to make as a part of each constitution several general declarations -- called the Bill of Rights .
So I find that in the old constitution of New Jersey , which was adopted in the year of grace 1776 , although the people at that time were not educated as they are now -- the spirit of the Revolution at that time not having permeated all classes of society -- a declaration in favor of religious freedom .
The people were on the eve of a revolution .
This constitution was adopted on the third day of July , 1776 , one day before the immortal Declaration of Independence .
Now , what do we find in this -- and we have got to go by this light , by this torch , when we examine the statute .
I find in that constitution , in its Eighteenth Section , this : " No person shall ever in this State be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshiping God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ; nor under any pretense whatever be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rates for the purpose of building or repairing any church or churches , contrary to what he believes to be true . "
That was a very great and splendid step .
It was the divorce of church and state .
It no longer allowed the State to levy taxes for the support of a particular religion , and it said to every citizen of New Jersey :
All that you give for that purpose must be voluntarily given , and the State will not compel you to pay for the maintenance of a church in which you do not believe .
So far so good .
The next paragraph was not so good .
" There shall be no establishment of any one religious sect in this State in preference to another , and no Protestant inhabitants of this State shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles ; but all persons professing a belief in the faith of any Protestant sect , who shall demean themselves peaceably , shall be capable of being elected to any office of profit or trust , and shall fully and freely enjoy every privilege and immunity enjoyed by other citizens . "
What became of the Catholics under that clause , I do not know -- whether they had any right to be elected to office or not under this Act .
But in 1844 , the State having grown civilized in the meantime , another constitution was adopted .
The word Protestant was then left out .
There was to be no establishment of one religion over another .
But Protestantism did not render a man capable of being elected to office any more than Catholicism , and nothing is said about any religious belief whatever .
So far , so good .
" No religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office of public trust .
No person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil right on account of his religious principles . "
That is a very broad and splendid provision , " No person shall be denied any civil right on account of his religious principles . "
That was copied from the Virginia constitution , and that clause in the Virginia constitution was written by Thomas Jefferson , and under that clause men were entitled to give their testimony in the courts of Virginia whether they believed in any religion or not , in any bible or not , or in any god or not .
That same clause was afterward adopted by the State of Illinois , also by many other States , and wherever that clause is , no citizen can be denied any civil right on account of his religions principles .
It is a broad and generous clause .
This statute , under which this indictment is drawn , is not in accordance with the spirit of that splendid sentiment .
Under that clause , no man can be deprived of any civil right on account of his religions principles , or on account of his belief .
And yet , on account of this miserable , this antiquated , this barbarous and savage statute , the same man who cannot be denied any political or civil right , can be sent to the penitentiary as a common felon for simply expressing his honest thought .
And before I get through I hope to convince you that this statute is unconstitutional .
But we will go another step : " Every person may freely speak , write , or publish his sentiments on all subjects , being responsible for the abuse of that right "
That is in the constitution of nearly every State in the Union , and the intention of that is to cover slanderous words -- to cover a case where a man under pretense of enjoying the freedom of speech falsely assails or accuses his neighbor .
Of course he should be held responsible for that abuse .
Then follows the great clause in the constitution of 1844 -- more important than any other clause in that instrument -- a clause that shines in that constitution like a star at night :
" No law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press . "
Can anything be plainer -- anything be more forcibly stated ?
" No law shall be passed to abridge the liberty of speech . "
Now , while you are considering this statute , I want you to keep in mind this other statement :
" No law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press . "
And right here there is another thing I want to call your attention to .
There is a constitution higher than any statute .
There is a law higher than any constitution .
It is the law of the human conscience , and no man who is a man will defile and pollute his conscience at the bidding of any legislature .
Above all things , one should maintain his self - respect , and there is but one way to do that , and that is to live in accordance with your highest ideal .
There is a law higher than men can make .
The facts as they exist in this poor world -- the absolute consequences of certain acts -- they are above all .
And this higher law is the breath of progress , the very outstretched wings of civilization , under which we enjoy the freedom we have .
Keep that in your minds .
There never was a legislature great enough -- there never was a constitution sacred enough , to compel a civilized man to stand between a black man and his liberty .
There never was a constitution great enough to make me stand between any human being and his right to express his honest thoughts .
Such a constitution is an insult to the human soul , and I would care no more for it than I would for the growl of a wild beast .
But we are not driven to that necessity here .
This constitution is in accord with the highest and noblest aspirations of the heart --
" No law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech . "
Now let us come to this old law -- this law that was asleep for a hundred years before this constitution was adopted -- this law coiled like a snake beneath the foundations of the Government -- this law , cowardly , dastardly -- this law passed by wretches who were afraid to discuss -- this law passed by men who could not , and who knew they could not , defend their creed -- and so they said : " Give us the sword of the State and we will cleave the heretic down . "
And this law was made to control the minority .
When the Catholics were in power they visited that law upon their opponents .
When the Episcopalians were in power , they tortured and burned the poor Catholic who had scoffed and who had denied the truth of their religion .
Whoever was in power used that , and whoever was out of power cursed that -- and yet , the moment he got in power he used it .
The people became civilized -- but that law was on the statute book .
It simply remained .
There it was , sound asleep -- its lips drawn over its long and cruel teeth .
Nobody savage enough to waken it .
And it slept on , and New Jersey has flourished .
Men have done well .
You have had average health in this country .
Nobody roused the statute until the defendant in this case went to Boonton , and there made a speech in which he gave his honest thought , and the people not having an argument handy threw stones .
Thereupon Mr. Reynolds , the defendant .
published a pamphlet on blasphemy and in it gave a photograph of the Boonton Christians .
That is his offence .
Now let us read this infamous statute :
" If any person shall willfully blaspheme the holy name of God by denying , cursing , or contemptuously reproaching his being ... "
I want to say right here -- many a man has cursed the God of another man .
The Catholics have cursed the God of the Protestant .
The Presbyterians have cursed the God of the Catholics -- charged them with idolatry -- cursed their images , laughed at their ceremonies .
And these compliments have been interchanged between all the religions of the world .
But I say here today that no man , unless a raving maniac , ever cursed the God in whom he believed .
No man , no human being , has ever lived who cursed his own idea of God .
He always curses the idea that somebody else entertains .
No human being ever yet cursed what he believed to be infinite wisdom and infinite goodness -- and you know it .
Every man on this jury knows that .
He feels that that must be an absolute certainty .
Then what have they cursed ?
Some
God they did not believe in -- that is all .
And has a man that right ?
I say , yes .
He has a right to give his opinion of Jupiter , and there is nobody in Morristown who will deny him that right .
But several thousand years ago it would have been very dangerous for him to have cursed Jupiter , and yet Jupiter is just as powerful now as be was then , but the Roman people are not powerful , and that is all there was to Jupiter -- the Roman people .
So there was a time when you could have cursed Zeus , the god of the Greeks , and like Socrates , they would have compelled you to drink hemlock .
Yet now everybody can curse this god .
Why ?
Is the god dead ?
No .
He is just as alive as he ever was .
Then what has happened ?
The Greeks have passed away .
That is all .
So in all of our churches here .
Whenever a church is in the minority it clamors for free speech .
When it gets in the majority , no .
I do not believe the history of the world will show that any orthodox church when in the majority ever had the courage to face the free lips of the world .
It sends for a constable .
And is it not wonderful that they should do this when they preach the gospel of universal forgiveness -- when they say , " If a man strike you on one cheek turn to him the other also -- but if he laughs at your religion , put him in the penitentiary " ?
Is that the doctrine ?
Is that the law ?
Now , read this law .
Do you know as I read it I can almost hear John Calvin laugh in his grave .
That would have been a delight to him .
It is written exactly as he would have written it .
There never was an inquisitor who would not have read that law with a malicious smile .
The Christians who brought the fagots and ran with all their might to be at the burning , would have enjoyed that law .
You know that when they used to burn people for having said something against religion , they used to cut their tongues out before they burned them .
Why ?
For fear that if they did not .
the poor , burning victims might say something that would scandalize the Christian gentlemen who were building the fire .
All these persons would have been delighted with this law .
Let us read a little further :
" Or by cursing or contemptuously reproaching Jesus Christ . "
Why , whoever did , since the poor man , or the poor God , was crucified ?
How did they come to crucify him ?
Because they did not believe in free speech in Jerusalem .
How else ?
Because there was a law against blasphemy in Jerusalem -- a law exactly like this .
Just think of it .
Oh , I tell you we have passed too many milestones on the shining road of human progress to turn back and wallow in that blood , in that mire .
No : Some men have said that he was simply a man .
Some believed that he was actually a God .
Others believed that he was not only a man , but that he stood as the representative of infinite love and wisdom .
No man ever said one word against that Being for saying , " Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you . "
No man ever raised his voice against him because he said , " Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy . "
And are they the " merciful " who , when some man endeavors to answer their argument , put him in the penitentiary ?
No .
The trouble is , the priests -- the trouble is , the ministers -- the trouble is , the people whose business it was to tell the meaning of these things , quarreled with each other , and they put meanings upon human expressions by malice , meanings that the words will not bear .
And let me be just to them .
I believe that nearly all that has been done in this world has been honestly done .
I believe that the poor savage who kneels down and prays to a stuffed snake -- prays that his little children may recover from the fever -- is honest , and it seems to me that a good God would answer his prayer if he could , if it was in accordance with wisdom , because the poor savage was doing the best he could , and no one can do any better than that .
So I believe that the Presbyterians who used to think that nearly everybody was going to hell , said exactly what they believed .
The were honest about it , and I would not send one of them to jail -- would never think of such a thing -- even if he called the unbelievers of the world " wretches , " " dogs , " and " devils . "
What would I do ?
I would simply answer him -- that is all ; answer him kindly .
I might laugh at him a little , but I would answer him in kindness .
So these divisions of the human mind are natural .
They are a necessity .
Do you know that all the mechanics that ever lived -- take the best ones -- cannot make two clocks that will run exactly alike one hour , one minute ?
They cannot make two pendulums that will beat in exactly the same time , one beat .
If you cannot do that , how are you going to make hundreds , thousands , billions of people , each with a different quality and quantity of brain , each clad in a robe of living , quivering flesh , and each driven by passion 's storm over the wild sea of life -- how are you going to make them all think alike ?
This is the impossible thing that Christian ignorance and bigotry and malice have been trying to do .
This was the object of the Inquisition and of the foolish Legislature that passed this statute .
Let me read you another line from this ignorant statute :
" Or the Christian religion . "
Well , what is the Christian religion ?
" If you scoff at the Christian religion -- if you curse the Christian religion . "
Well what is it ?
Gentlemen , you hear Presbyterians every day attack the Catholic Church .
Is that the Christian religion ?
The Catholic believes it is the Christian religion , and you have to admit that it is the oldest one , and then the Catholics turn round and scoff at the Protestants .
Is that the Christian religion ?
If so , every Christian religion has been cursed by every other Christian religion .
Is not that an absurd and foolish statute ?
I say that the Catholic has the right to attack the Presbyterian and tell him , " Your doctrine is all wrong . "
I think he has the right to say to him , " You are leading thousands to hell , " If he believes it , he not only has the right to say it , but it is his duty to say it ; and if the Presbyterian really believes the Catholics are all going to the devil , it is his duty to say so .
Why not ?
I will never have any religion that I cannot defend -- that is , that I do not believe I can defend .
I may be mistaken , because no man is absolutely certain that he knows .
We all understand that .
Every one is liable to be mistaken .
The horizon of each individual is very narrow , and in his poor sky the stars are few and very small .
" Or the Word of God ... "
What is that ?
" The canonical Scriptures contained in the books of the Old and New Testaments . "
Now , what has a man the right to say about that ?
Has he the right to show that the book of Revelation got into the canon by one vote , and one only ?
Has he the right to show that they passed in convention upon what books they would put in and what they would not ?
Has he the right to show that there were twenty - eight books called " The Books of the Hebrews " ?
Has he the right to show that ?
Has he the right to show that Martin Luther said he did not believe there was one solitary word of gospel in the Epistle to the Romans ?
Has he the right to show that some of these books were not written till nearly two hundred years afterward ?
Has he the right to say it , if he believes it ?
I do not say whether this is true or not , but has a man the right to say it if he believes it ?
Suppose I should read the Bible all through right here in Morristown , and after I got through I should make up my mind that it is not a true book -- what ought I to say ?
Ought I to clap my hand over my mouth and start for another State , and the minute I got over the line say , " It is not true , It is not true " ?
Or , ought I to have the right and privilege of saying right here in New Jersey , " My fellow citizens , I have read the book -- I do not believe that it is the word of God " ?
Suppose I read it and think it is true , then I am bound to say so .
If I should go to Turkey and read the Koran and make up my mind that it is fake , you would all say that I was a miserable poltroon if I did not say so .
By force you can make hypocrites -- men who will agree with you from the teeth out , and in their hearts hate you .
We want no more hypocrites .
We have enough in every community .
And how are you going to keep from having more ?
By having the air free , -- by wiping from your statute books such miserable and infamous laws as this .
" ... The Holy Scriptures . "
Are they Holy ?
Must a man be honest ?
Has he the right to be sincere ?
There are thousands of things in the Scriptures that everybody believes .
Everybody believes the Scriptures are right when they say , " Thou shalt not steal " -- everybody .
And when they say " Give good measure , heaped up and running over , " everybody says , " Good ! "
So when they say " Love your neighbor , " everybody applauds that .
Suppose a man believes that , and practices it , does it make any difference whether he believes in the flood or not ?
Is that of any importance ?
Weather a man built an ark or not -- does that make the slightest difference ?
A man might deny it and yet be a very good man .
Another might believe it and be a very mean man .
Could it now , by any possibility , make a man a good father , a good husband , a good citizen ?
Does it make any difference whether you believe it or not ?
Does it make any difference whether or not you believe that a man was going through town , and his hair was a little short , like mine , and some little children laughed at him , and thereupon two bears from the woods came down and tore to pieces about forty little children ?
Is it necessary to believe that ?
Suppose a man should say , " I guess that is a mistake ; they did not copy that right ; I guess the man that reported that was a little dull of hearing and did not get the story exactly right . "
Any harm in saying that ?
Is a man to be sent to the penitentiary for that ?
Can you imagine an infinitely good God sending a man to hell because he did not believe the bear story ?
So I say if you believe the Bible , say so ; if you do not believe it , say so .
And here is the vital mistake , I might almost say , in Protestantism itself .
The Protestants when they fought the Catholics said : " Read the Bible for yourselves -- stop taking it from your priests -- read the sacred volume with your own eyes ; it is a revelation from God to his children , and you are the children . "
And then they said : " If after you read it you do not believe it , and you say anything against it , we will put you in jail , and God will put you in hell . "
That is a fine position to get a man in .
It is like a man who invited his neighbor to come and look at his pictures , saying : " They are the finest in the place , and I want your candid opinion .
A man who looked at them the other day said they were daubs , and I kicked him down stairs -- now I want your candid judgment . "
So the Protestant Church says to a man , " This Bible is a message from your Father , -- your Father in heaven .
Read it .
Judge for yourself .
But if after you have read it you say it is not true , I will put you in the penitentiary for one year . "
The Catholic Church has a little more sense about that -- at least more logic .
It says : " This Bible is not given to everybody .
It is given to the world , to be sure , but it must be interpreted by the church .
God would not give a Bible to the world unless he also appointed some one , some organization , to tell the world what it means . "
They said : " We do not want the world filled with interpretations , and all the interpreters fighting each other . "
And the Protestant has gone to the infinite absurdity of saying : " Judge for yourself , but if you judge wrong you will go to the penitentiary here and to hell hereafter . "
Now , let us see further :
" Or by profane scoffing expose them to ridicule . "
Think of such a law as that , passed under a constitution that says , " No law shall abridge the liberty of speech . "
But you must not ridicule the Scriptures .
Did anybody , ever dream of passing a law to protect Shakespeare from being laughed at ?
Did anybody ever think of such a thing ?
Did anybody ever want any legislative enactment to keep people from holding Robert Burns in contempt ?
The songs of Burns will be sung as long as there is love in the human heart .
Do we need to protect him from ridicule by a statute ?
Does he need assistance from New Jersey ?
Is any statute needed to keep Euclid from being laughed at in this neighborhood ?
And is it possible that a work written by an infinite Being has to be protected by a legislature ?
Is it possible that a book cannot be written by a God so that it will not excite the laughter of the human race ?
Why , gentlemen , humor is one of the most valuable things in the human brain .
It is the torch of the mind -- it sheds light .
Humor is the readiest test of truth -- of the natural , of the sensible -- and when you take from a man all sense of humor , there will only be enough left to make a bigot .
Teach this man who has no humor -- no sense of the absurd -- the Presbyterian creed , fill his darkened brain with superstition and his heart with hatred -- then frighten him with the threat of hell , and he will be ready to vote for that statute .
Such men made that law .
Let us read another clause :
" And every person so offending shall , on conviction , be fined not exceeding two hundred dollars , or imprisoned at hard labor not exceeding twelve months , or both . "
I want you to remember that this statute was passed in England hundreds of years ago -- just in that language .
The punishment , however , has been somewhat changed .
In the good old days when the king sat on the throne -- in the good old days when the altar was the right - bower of the throne -- then , instead of saying : " Fined two hundred dollars and imprisoned one year , " it was : " All his goods shall be confiscated ; his tongue shall be bored with a hot iron , and upon his forehead he shall be branded with the letter B ; and for the second offence he shall suffer death by burning . "
Those were the good old days when people maintained the orthodox religion in all its purity and in all its ferocity .
The first question for you , gentlemen , to decide in this case is :
Is this statute constitutional ?
Is this statute in harmony with the part of the constitution of 1844 which says : " The liberty of speech shall not be abridged " ?
That is for you to say .
Is this law constitutional , or is it simply an old statute that fell asleep , that was forgotten , that people simply failed to repeal ?
I believe I can convince you , if you will think a moment , that our fathers never intended to establish a government like that .
When they fought for what they believed to be religious liberty -- when they fought for what they believed to be liberty of speech , they believed that all such statutes would be wiped from the statute books of all the States .
Let me tell you another reason why I believe this .
We have in this country naturalization laws .
People may come here irrespective of their religion .
They must simply swear allegiance to this country -- they must forswear allegiance to every other potentate , prince and power -- but they do not have to change their religion .
A Hindoo may become a citizen of the United States , and the Constitution of the United States , like the constitution of New Jersey , guarantees religious liberty .
That Hindoo believes in a God -- in a God that no Christian believes in .
He believes in a sacred book that every Christian looks upon as a collection of falsehoods .
He believes , too , in a Savior -- in Buddha .
Now , I ask you , -- when that man comes here and becomes a citizen -- when the Constitution is about him , above him -- has he the right to give his ideas about his religion ?
Has he the right to say in New Jersey : " There is no God except the Supreme Brahm -- there is no Savior except Buddha , the Illuminated , Buddha the Blest " ?
I say that he has that right -- and you have no right , because in addition to that he says , " You are mistaken ; your God is not God ; your Bible is not true , and your religion is a mistake , " to abridge his liberty of speech .
He has the right to say it , and if he has the right to say it , I insist before this Court and before this jury , that he has the right to give his reasons for saying it ; and in giving the reasons , in maintaining his side , he has the right , not simply to appeal to history , not simply to the masonry of logic , but he has the right to shoot the arrows of wit , and to use the smile of ridicule .
Anything that can be laughed out of this world ought not to stay in it .
So the Persian -- the believer in Zoroaster , in the spirits of Good and Evil , and that the spirit of Evil will finally triumph forever -- if that is his religion -- he has the right to state it , and the right to give his reasons for his belief .
How infinitely preposterous for you , one of the States of this Union , to invite a Persian or a Hindoo to come to your shores .
You do not ask him to renounce his God .
You ask him to renounce the Shah .
Then when he becomes a citizen , having the rights of every other citizen , he has the right to defend his religion and to denounce yours .
There is another thing .
What was the spirit of our Government at that time ?
You must look at the leading men .
Who were they ?
What were their opinions ?
Were most of them as guilty of blasphemy as is the defendant in this case ?
Thomas Jefferson -- and there is , in my judgment , only one name on the page of American history greater than his -- only one name for which I have a greater and tenderer reverence -- and that is Abraham Lincoln , because of all men who ever lived and had power , he was the most merciful .
And that is the way to test a man .
How does he use power ?
Does he want to crush his fellow citizens ?
Does he like to lock somebody up in the penitentiary because he has the power of the moment ?
Does he wish to use it as a despot , or as a philanthropist -- like a devil , or like a man ?
Thomas Jefferson entertained about the same views entertained by the defendant in this case , and he was made President of the United States .
He was the author of the Declaration of Independence , founder of the University of Virginia , writer of that clause in the constitution of that State , that made all the citizens equal before the law .
And when I come to the very sentences here charged as blasphemy , I will show you that these were the common sentiments of thousands of very great , of very intellectual and admirable men .
I have no time , and it may be this is not the place and the occasion , to call your attention to the infinite harm that has been done in almost every religious nation by statutes such as this .
Where that statute is , liberty can not be ; and if this statute is enforced by this jury and by this Court , and if it is afterwards carried out , and if it could be carried out in the States of this Union , there would be an end of all intellectual progress .
We would go back to the Dark Ages .
Every man 's mind , upon these subjects at least , would become a stagnant pool , covered with the scum of prejudice and meanness .
And wherever such laws have been enforced , have the people been friends ?
Here we are today in this blessed air -- here amid these happy fields .
Can we imagine , with these surroundings , that a man for having been found with a crucifix in his poor little home , had been taken from his wife and children and burned -- burned by Protestants ?
You can not conceive of such a thing now .
Neither can you conceive that there was a time when Catholics found some poor Protestant contradicting one of the dogmas of the church , and took that poor honest wretch -- while his wife wept ; while his children clung to his hands -- to the public square , drove a stake in the ground , put a chain or two about him , lighted the fagots , and let the wife whom he loved and his little children see the flames climb around his limbs -- you cannot imagine that any such infamy was ever practiced .
And yet I tell you that the same spirit made this detestable , infamous , devilish statute .
You can hardly imagine that there was a time when the same kind of men that made this law said to another man :
You say this world is round ?
" Yes , sir ; I think it is , because I have seen its shadow on the moon . "
" You have ? " --
Now , can you imagine a society , outside of hyenas and boa constrictors , that would take that man , put him in the penitentiary , in a dungeon , turn the key upon him , and let his name be blotted from the book of human life ?
Years afterward some explorer amid ruins finds a few bones .
The same spirit that did that , made this statute -- the same spirit that did that , went before the grand jury in this case -- exactly .
Give the men that had this man indicted the power , and I would not want to live in that particular part of the country .
I would not willingly live with such men .
I would go somewhere else , where the air is free , where I could speak my sentiments to my wife , to my children , and to my neighbors .
Now , this persecution differs only in degree from the infamies of the olden times .
What does it mean ?
It means that the State of New Jersey has all the light it wants .
And what does that mean ?
It means that the State of New Jersey is absolutely infallible -- that it has got its growth and does not propose to grow any more .
New Jersey knows enough , and it will send teachers to the penitentiary .
It is hardly possible that this State has accomplished all that it is ever going to accomplish .
Religions are for a day .
They are the clouds .
Humanity is the eternal blue .
Religions are the waves of the sea .
These waves depend upon the force and direction of the wind -- that is to say , of passion ; but Humanity is the great sea .
And so our religions change from day to day , and it is a blessed thing that they do .
Why ?
Because we grow , and we are getting a little more civilized every day -- and any man that is not willing to let another man express his opinion is not a civilized man , and you know it .
Any man that does not give to everybody else the rights he claims for himself , is not an honest man .
Here is a man who says , " I am going to join the Methodist Church . "
What right has he ?
Just the same right to join it that I have not to join it -- no more , no less .
But if you are a Methodist and I am not , it simply proves that you do not agree with me , and that I do not agree with you -- that is all .
Another man is a Catholic .
He was born a Catholic , or is convinced that Catholicism is right .
That is his business , and any man that would persecute him on that account , is a poor barbarian -- a savage ; any man that would abuse him on that account , is a barbarian -- a savage .
Then I take the next step .
A man does not wish to belong to any church .
How are you going to judge him ?
Judge him by the way he treats his wife , his children , his neighbors .
Does he pay his debts ?
Does he tell the truth ?
Does he help the poor ?
Has he got a heart that melts when he hears grief 's story ?
That is the way to judge him .
I do not care what he thinks about the bears , or the flood , about bibles or gods .
When some poor mother is found wandering in the street with a babe at her breast , does he quote Scripture or hunt for his pocket - book ?
That is the way to judge .
And suppose he does not believe in any bible whatever ?
If Christianity is true , that is his misfortune , and everybody should pity the poor wretch that is going down the hill .
Why kick him ?
You will get your revenge on him through all eternity -- is not that enough ?
So I say , let us judge each other by our actions , not by theories , not by what we happen to believe -- because that depends very much on where we were born .
If you had been born in Turkey , you probably would have been a Mohammedan .
If I had been born among the Hindoos , I might have been a Buddhist -- I can't tell .
If I had been raised in Scotland , on oatmeal , I might have been a Covenantor -- nobody knows .
If I had lived in Ireland , and seen my poor wife and children driven into the street , I think I might have been a Home - ruler -- no doubt of it .
You see it depends on where you were born -- much depends on our surroundings .
Of course , there are men born in Turkey who are not Mohammedans , and there are men born in this country who are not Christians -- Methodists , Unitarians , or Catholics , plenty of them , who are unbelievers -- plenty of them who deny the truth of the Scriptures -- plenty of them who say -- " I know not whether there be a God or not . "
Well , it is a thousand times better to say that honestly than to say dishonestly that you believe in God .
If you want to know the opinion of your neighbor , you want his honest opinion .
You do not want to be deceived .
You do not want to talk with a hypocrite .
You want to get straight at his honest mind -- and then you are going to judge him , not by what he says but by what he does .
It is very easy to sail along with the majority -- easy to sail the way the boats are going -- easy to float with the stream ; but when you come to swim against the tide , with the men on the shore throwing rocks at you , you will get a good deal of exercise in this world .
And do you know that we ought to feel under the greatest obligation to men who have fought the prevailing notions of their day ?
There is not a Presbyterian in Morristown that does not hold up for admiration the man that carried the flag of the Presbyterians when they were in the minority -- not one .
There is not a Methodist in this State who does not admire John and Charles Wesley and Whitefield , who carried the banner of that new and despised sect when it was in the minority .
They glory in them because they braved public opinion , because they dared to oppose idiotic , barbarous and savage statutes like this .
And there is not a Universalist that does not worship dear old Hosea Ballou -- I love him myself -- because he said to the Presbyterian minister : " You are going around trying to keep people out of hell , and I am going around trying to keep hell out of the people . "
Every Universalist admires him and loves him because when despised and railed at and spit upon , he stood firm , a patient witness for the eternal mercy of God .
And there is not a solitary Protestant who does not honor Martin Luther -- who does not honor the Covenantors in poor Scotland , and that poor girl who was tied out on the sand of the sea by Episcopalians , and kept there till the rising tide drowned her , and all she had to do to save her life was to say , " God save the king " ; but she would not say it without the addition of the words , " If it be God 's will . "
No one , who is not a miserable , contemptible wretch , can fail to stand in admiration before such courage , such self - denial -- such heroism .
No matter what the attitude of your body may be , your soul falls on its knees before such men and such women .
Let us take another step ,
Where would we have been if authority had always triumphed ?
Where would we have been if such statutes had always been carried out ?
We have now a science called astronomy .
That science has done more to enlarge the horizon of human thought than all things else .
We now live in an infinite universe .
We know that the sun is a million times larger than our earth , and we know that there are other great luminaries millions of times larger than our sun .
We know that there are planets so far away that light , traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty - five thousand miles a second , requires fifteen thousand years to reach this grain of sand , this tear , we call the earth -- and we now know that all the fields of space are sown thick with constellations .
If that statute had been enforced , that science would not now be the property of the human mind .
That science is contrary to the Bible , and for asserting the truth you become a criminal .
For what sum of money , for what amount of wealth , would the world have the science of astronomy expunged from the brain of man ?
We learned the story of the stars in spite of that statute .
The first men who said the world was round were scourged for scoffing at the Scriptures .
And even Martin Luther , speaking of one of the greatest men that ever lived , said : " Does he think with his little lever to overturn the Universe of God ? "
Martin Luther insisted that such men ought to be trampled under foot .
If that statute had been carried into effect , Galileo would have been impossible .
Kepler , the discoverer of the three laws , would have died with the great secret locked in his brain , and mankind would have been left ignorant , superstitious , and besotted .
And what else ?
If that statute had been carried out , the world would have been deprived of the philosophy of Spinoza ; of the philosophy , of the literature , of the wit and wisdom , the justice and mercy of Voltaire , the greatest Frenchman that ever drew the breath of life -- the man who by his mighty pen abolished torture in a nation , and helped to civilize a world .
If that statute had been enforced , nearly all the books that enrich the libraries of the world could not have been written .
If that statute had been enforced , Humboldt could not have delivered the lectures now known as " The Cosmos . "
If that statute had been enforced , Charles Darwin would not have been allowed to give to the world his discoveries that have been of more benefit to mankind than all the sermons ever uttered .
In England they have placed his sacred dust in the great Abbey .
If he had lived in New Jersey , and this statute could have been enforced , he would have lived one year at least in your penitentiary .
Why ?
That man went so far as not simply to deny the truth of your Bible , but absolutely to deny the existence of your God .
Was he a good man ?
Yes , one of the noblest and greatest of men .
Humboldt , the greatest German who ever lived , was of the same opinion .
When someone retires from a legendary television franchise , passes the torch to a worthy successor .
Then he gets bored and starts a new show which sucks and then asks for their old job back by firing the successor .
While adults have been collecting gachapon for some time now , the contents of these brightly colored plastic capsules have remained the preserve of the kidult : figures molded into the likeness of characters from anime , or novelty toys like the hugely popular curly piles of plastic poop .
But some stores are now taking gachapon machines and customizing them to contain tiny objects that would appeal to a rather more mature audience .
Just such a machine , located outside a store deep in the heart of Tokyo ’s book - selling area of Jinbocho , is selling miniature books of poetry , photography or illustrations printed on traditional Japanese paper .
The books sold at the store have proved so popular that people are now queuing up to buy them .
Of course , as with all gachapon machines , whether they get the tiny tome they were after is down to luck ; those disappointed are n’t allowed another go but have to ask around if anyone else is willing to swap .
It ’s not just literature that ’s proving popular , the gachapon machine pictured at the right was spotted in Koenji and contains knitted broaches that might appeal to the arty student population of the area .
Takara
Tomy , a leading producer of gachapon , is keen to show that gachapon is a form of art , albeit of the pop variety .
Their Time Capsule range is dubbed “ art capsule toy product ” and designed by a subsidiary of creative boffins at Yujin Co .
They were the brains behind the smiley plastic poop that has become ubiquitous in many a gachapon collection , as well as the YMCK key chains that depict the 8 - bit pop band in pixelated plastic form .
Cashing in on the vinyl toy boom they have collaborated with vinyl toy - maker Devilrobots to produce a collectable evirob range and with TOUMA to make the Knuckle Bear range .
Most recently in December they teamed up with apparel maker Edition to produce two specially designed “ Korejiya - nai ! ” ( It ’s Not This ! ) robots .
Taking advantage of the collectible nature of these miniature toys , the future for Tomy ’s Time Capsule toys looks to be in lucrative collaborations with trendy labels .
But I ’m hoping to see more boutique stores appropriate gachapon for themselves .
Have you seen any unique gachapon machines ?
Let us know .

ETF2L Turns
Two
The European Team Fortress 2 League turned two recently .
In their own words :
" Whether it 's a public server , a group of friends forming a clan , or a team of volunteers trying to build a place for people to play , online gaming and e-sports enterprises are notoriously fragile and short - lived .
So , it 's with a great degree of humility that ... we say we 're very proud to see our organisation progress from strength to strength to become the biggest TF2 league in the world . "
Congratulations on the anniversary , guys !
This Mailbox Just Got Dominated by Saxton Hale
Those of you who sent in money along with a coupon cut from Gentleman Scoundrel Magazine from our Sniper vs .
Spy update recently received a handsome collection of postcards from Valve 's other resident Australian strongman , Saxton Hale .
The money you sent has been donated to gamer charity Child 's Play .
Our legal department wants us to remind you that , in the future , please do not send us money ( no matter what it says in the fake fictional advertisement ) .
A friendly letter is enough to get potential free stuff sent your way .
The ABC 's recently announced 24/7 news channel is bad news for SKY , but good news for Australia : we can only rely on non-commercial media to provide genuinely independent news coverage .
It did n’t take long for Sky News ’s Angelos Frangopoulos to lash out at the ABC ’s announcement of its new 24 - hour news channel .
A media release emerged shortly after Mark Scott ’s statement , raising the spectre of core ABC services being starved of funding and “ needless duplication of services already available to Australians . ”
One CEO ’s “ needless duplication ” is of course another ’s discipline of the market place .
The ABC announcement has fed into what has become perceived to be a News Ltd v public broadcasting debate .
But Sky News is n’t actually controlled by News Ltd .
It ’s a one - third - each venture of PBL , Seven and BSkyB , which is itself less than half - owned by News Corporation , although noted BBC fan James Murdoch is BSky B ’s chairman .
Even so , News Ltd takes a proprietorial interest in the local Sky .
Former company lobbyist Malcolm Colless fills in his time waiting to replace Piers Akerman as the company ’s Conspirasist - in - Chief by writing richly amusing political “ commentary ” and regularly putting the case for Sky to replace the ABC as operator of the Government ’s international broadcasting contract .
Colless never reveals that in 2005 he tried to convince the Howard Government to do just that but was unable to , despite the Coalition then being at its most Ultimo - phobic .
Nevertheless , it ’s possible to have some sympathy for Frangopoulos , given Sky has , on oily - rag level resources , built up a fair dinkum 24 hour news service over the years , only to see the publicly - funded entity barge into its carefully - nurtured space , leveraging off its vast newscaff output and reputation , offering for nix what is currently a subscription business model .
Charging people for news content just got that little bit harder , at a time when media companies desperately need to find a way to do just that .
That the ABC stuck its hand out for an extra $ 35 m a year for a similar proposal in 2003 , but now appears to be able to do something even more resource intensive without any extra call on the taxpayer , also raises questions about how seriously the ABC ’s funding bids should be treated .

But sympathy for Sky was possible only up to the second paragraph of Frangopoulos ’s press release , where he said the new ABC service “ goes against the ABC charter to provide services that commercial broadcasters are unable or unwilling to provide Australians . ”
I ’ve seen some funny interpretations of the ABC Charter in my time , but that one pretty much takes the cake .
For a moment I thought Stephen Conroy had somehow snuck through a new ABC Charter that required the ABC to do only the crap that no one else wanted to do .
But no .
As always , the ABC “ shall take account ” of services provided by the commercial and community broadcasting sectors , and its
Act specifically enjoins it to “ have regard to ” SBS .
But its charter obligation is to “ to provide within Australia innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services of a high standard as part of the Australian broadcasting system consisting of national , commercial and community sectors . ”
Moreover , news programming is the only genre singled out in the ABC Act as a requirement – the effective provision of news by the ABC imposes specific duties on the Managing Director .
We ’re talking here about legislated requirements .
This is n’t ABC Shops , a decidedly non-core activity that , leveraging off taxpayer - funded content , directly competes with the private sector in a manner that for mine barely avoids breaching the notion of competitive neutrality .
Private sector concerns about the ABC competing with them should not always be dismissed out of hand .
It may be no consolation to Frangolopoulos and the hard - working and talented people at Sky News whose futures are directly affected by the new ABC service , but , funny thing is , the new service is exactly in accordance with Frangopoulos ’s peculiar interpretation of the Charter .
It will provide a service commercial broadcasters are unable to provide , by definition – an independent news service .
That ’s the phrase in the Act , by the way – “ independent service for the broadcasting of news and information ” .
That can only be provided by a non-commercial broadcaster , because however rigorous , however watertight the editorial independence of a commercial media outlet , there must always be , by definition , the possibility of a link between revenue and editorial judgement .
No commercial media outlet ( not even Crikey ) can escape that reality .
The ABC is thus the only media outlet capable of providing a fully independent news service , and that ’s a far more important role than local drama or encouraging the arts or any of the many middle - class welfare roles that luvvies and ABC purists insist should be publicly - funded .
The ABC has n’t always fulfilled the requirements of its Act .
For years it was a laggard in business reporting .
Maybe the fair trade soyaccino types at the ABC preferred not to sully themselves by taking capitalism seriously .
But as the only possible source of independent business coverage – as the only media outlet not itself a business story – it has a particular responsibility to comprehensively cover business and finance .
It only really started doing so properly in the mid-1990s , and with more success when the much - maligned Jonathan Shier got funding from the Howard Government to improve the ABC ’s business coverage .
And if you want a demonstration of why media companies can’t always be relied to provide genuinely independent news coverage , here ’s a small example .
Last weekend , after many months of maneuvering , the UK media regulator OfCom ruled that BSkyB would have to sell access to sporting content and movies to other subscription television providers for dramatically lower prices .
This will enable competitors like BT and Virgin to undercut BSkyB ’s dominant market position in premium content , which has been a key driver of BSkyB ’s success in the UK market .
The Telegraph broke the story , and the Guardian followed up shortly afterward .
The decision has major repercussions for BSkyB , which is under regulatory threat on a couple of fronts in the UK ( yesterday it lost its battle to avoid selling much of its stake in ITV ) .
How did the News Corporation press cover it ?
Well , they did n’t .
Not a mention in the Times , the British journal of record , or in the News tabloids .
That proud tribune of the British people , The Sun , could easily have attacked OfCom as threatening the future of British sports , since lower prices for BskyB may eventually mean lower returns for sports rights holders .
But nary a word from the News Ltd stable about how sports fans might be able to get cheaper access to their favourite sports from other providers than BSkyB , even though OfCom ’s decision was reported as far afield as Bloomberg and Hollywood Reporter in the US .
It ’s a minor demonstration of a very important point : independent news can only really be provided by non-commercial media , which is why the ABC announcement is good news .

The government wants to encourage inter caste marriages
Many Indian states already pay money to those who marry Hindus from the lowest castes who are also called dalits .
But the amount differs from state to state - in Gujarat a couple gets the full $ 1,100 ( 50,000 rupees ) - whereas in West Bengal state the amount is $ 45 .
The government says it now wants the sum to be the same throughout India .
Break barriers
The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment , which bears half the cost of the payment , has written to all the states asking them to standardise the minimum amount to $ 1,100 .
" I am very keen on this and I have asked all the state governments to back to me , " Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Meira Kumar told the BBC .
This is not the only way to end the caste discrimination , but one has to start somewhere
Social Justice Minister Meira Kumar
Ministry officials say encouraging such marriages will ultimately break down caste barriers .
They have organised a two - day conference of the state social welfare secretaries in Delhi to discuss the issue .
" In our caste - ridden society if someone breaks out of the mould and marries outside of the caste , we want to give them this money as a token of our appreciation .
We want to make an example of them so that others will follow them , " Ms Kumar said .
She said that inter -caste marriages do happen around the country , but " we want it to grow so much that one day no can say what caste they belong to " .
' Material incentives '
Many say such a proposal is easy to suggest but hard to implement .
Caste is deeply rooted in Indian society and those marrying outside their caste are often ostracised by their family and the wider community .
Low caste Hindus complain of frequent discrimination
Delhi - based sociologist Radhika Chopra said that while $ 1,100 is not a huge amount , it may help a couple to set up a house .
She said that the government has always intervened to determine the shape and structure of the family .
" They have a rather simplistic view that material incentives always work and there is evidence that monetary incentives have worked in the past in reducing female foeticide or persuading people to adopt family planning measures , " Ms Chopra said .
Ministry officials hope the same incentives will work in reducing caste barriers too .
" We do n't know how many people marry across caste .
Only a fraction of all marriages are registered and this exercise will give us an opportunity to document the number of inter - caste marriages taking place in the country , " a senior official said .
