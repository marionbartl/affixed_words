SEOUL — South Korea 's government is wiping out rules for Web browsing that trapped the country 's Internet users with 1990s - era security technology and created a de facto monopoly for Microsoft Corp . 's Internet Explorer here .
The South Korean rules had long stood in contrast to efforts by other governments around the world that have tried to break Microsoft 's grip on the Internet browser market .
For South Koreans , they made Internet transactions a nuisance by requiring that users download plug - in programs , ...

How much is a life worth ?
Marijuana is easily available for $ 20 ; three lines of cocaine run $ 10 .
LSD can be had for $ 5 or $ 10 .
Ecstasy pills are worth $ 5 to $ 15 each .
Tickets to the May 29 Pop 2010 rave at the Cow Palace were approximately $ 85 apiece at the door .
Parking was $ 20 .
Bottled water was $ 3 .
The event drew approximately 16,500 attendees , and the promoter reportedly paid $ 75,000 in rent to the Cow Palace , which is owned and operated by the California Department of Agriculture .
Pop 2010 resulted in two drug - related deaths , plus another half - dozen hospitalized for a variety of drug - related symptoms , some life - threatening .
As of June 14 , several remain in Bay Area hospitals .
At the event , more than 100 law enforcement officers from 25 local , state and federal agencies arrested 73 - including five minors - on various drug charges and seized some 800 tablets of ecstasy , plus varying amounts of LSD , cocaine , methamphetamine and marijuana , and thousands in cash .
It was not the first time .
Drug -related arrests at multiple Cow Palace raves from 2003 through 2009 total more than 255 , and a 2002 New Year 's Eve rave at the Cow Palace resulted in two fatal overdoses .
The pattern here is obvious and cannot continue .
Add up all the associated police , emergency medical and hospital expenses , and the costs are staggering .
However the real costs are borne by the people of the surrounding residential neighborhood .
They must deal with the aftermath of events that attract countless drug dealers from as far away as Los Angeles and Seattle .
If the Cow Palace , as a public facility , were under the jurisdiction of San Mateo County , a rave - type event would most likely be prohibited as being an incompatible use .
In all fairness , the majority of the Pop 2010 attendees had nothing to do with illegal drug use or distribution .
They were there for the music and the social aspects of a large , all - night , electronic dance party .
The promoter cooperated with law enforcement and all attendees were informed about undercover officers being in the crowd .
Those involved with illegal substances generally do so regardless of time and location and regardless of whether or not the Cow Palace can or cannot host raves .
However , that is not the point .
By itself , an electronic music festival is simply a highly profitable , commercial event catering to those who enjoy listening and dancing to that genre of music .
No problem .
However , in reality , such events also attract drug dealers from hundreds of miles away , while draining law enforcement and public health resources .
In reality , a rave at the Cow Palace killed two - again .
Giant dance parties with thousands of attendees , dozens of drug - related arrests , running until 2 a.m. are absolutely incompatible with a residential neighborhood .
Are raves appropriate for the Cow Palace ?
Are two lives worth $ 75,000 ?
No .
Wallowing in the sting of romantic rejection ?
Is that tragic " hit and quit " experience keeping you up at night ?
It 's not your fault .
Neuroscientists say your brain is hardwired to crave the rollercoaster of romantic fulfillment - and rejection .
Advertisement
A group of researchers recently discovered that people suffering romantic rejection were displaying neurological patterns normally associated with the brain 's reward and addiction centers .
Their research , which appears this month in Journal of Neurophysiology , suggests that recovery from a breakup may be akin to recovering from drug addiction :
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , researchers recorded the brain activity of 15 college - age adults who had recently been rejected by their partners but reported that they were still intensely " in love . "
Upon viewing photographs of their former partners , several key areas of participants ' brains were activated , including the ventral tegmental area , which controls motivation and reward and is known to be involved in feelings of romantic love ; the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal / prefrontal cortex , which are associated with craving and addiction , specifically the dopaminergic reward system evident in cocaine addiction ; and the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate , which are associated with physical pain and distress .
By tying these specific areas of the brain to romantic rejection , the research provides insight into the anguished feelings that can accompany a break - up , as well as the extreme behaviors that can occur as a result , such as stalking , homicide and suicide .
" Romantic love , under both happy and unhappy circumstances , may be a ‘ natural ' addiction , " said [ neuroscientist Lucy ] Brown .
" Our findings suggest that the pain of romantic rejection may be a necessary part of life that nature built into our anatomy and physiology .
A natural recovery , to pair up with someone else , is in our physiology , too . "

In some ways , this study reminds me of what neuroscientists have discovered about gambling addiction , where losing can give you as much of a dopamine squirt as winning does .
It may not feel great , but you could be getting high on getting dumped .

The success of BP 's latest attempt to completely cap its leaking oil well is n't just important to the ecosystem and residents of the Gulf of Mexico who have suffered 82 days of devastating pollution .
There are two very good reasons why BP needs this to work .
Firstly , crunch time is approaching for BP 's only remaining option for permanently capping the leak -- the relief wells .
The drilling of a relief well , which intersects the original well bore deep beneath the ground and pumps it full of heavy mud and cement to kill the leak , is a tried and tested oil industry technique .
It 's also very challenging .
BP 's drilling engineers must intersect perfectly with a well bore around seven inches in diameter some 18,000 feet below them .
Imagine trying to pick up a pea in the end of a mile long drinking straw and you 've got some idea of the level of the challenge .
The last time a relief well was drilled to cap an oil leak -- the Montara rig blowout off the northwest coast of Australia late in 2009 -- it took five attemps over the course of a month to hit the well bore .
Given the level of public outrage in the U.S. , it 's hard to imagine people sitting patiently if BP faces a similar timetable in its efforts to kill the leak .
However , if the company can demonstrate that the cap is preventing all of the oil leaking into the Gulf , it will have far more breathing space to get the job done .
Secondly , if BP is able to capture 100 % of the oil leaking from the Macondo well , for the first time it will be able to accurately answer the controversial question -- just how big is the leak .
This may seem academic to the people who can see with their own eyes oil that has washed onto their beaches , but it is crucial in determining how many billions of dollars BP will pay in fines .
Blockbuster king James Cameron 's offer to help BP stem the flow of oil from a leaking Gulf of Mexico well was spurned by the oil giant , even though the director says he knows his way around the ocean 's depths .
" Over the last few weeks I 've watched , as we all have , with growing horror and heartache , watching what 's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons do n't know what they 're doing , " Cameron said at the All Things Digital technology conference .
Cameron , the director of " The Abyss , " " Titanic " and " Avatar , " has worked extensively with robot submarines and is considered an expert in undersea filming .
His comments came a day after he participated in a meeting at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency headquarters in Washington to " brainstorm " solutions to the oil spill .
Cameron said his offer to help was " graciously " turned away by the British energy company but said he has not spoken to the White House about his offer .
So far , methods with names like " top hat , " " top kill " and " junk shot " have failed .
The first was a 100 - ton containment box that was lowered onto the broken pipe but was unexpectedly rendered buoyant by gases rising from 13,000 feet beneath the seabed .
The other methods basically involved clogging the pipe with debris including golf balls and old tires .
All have flopped .
BP is currently trying to slice the bent pipe and install a sealed dome on it once there is a straight section to cap .
But experts believe the bend in the pipe is actually slowing the flow and that the new approach , even if successful , will at least temporarily increase the flow by as much as 20 percent .
If it works , the dome will allow BP to siphon the oil upward to a waiting ship .
The gambit hit a snag Wednesday , when the diamond - tipped saw got stuck .
But officials hoped to get it working again quickly .
Meanwhile , BP is trying a longer - term approach , drilling diagonally through bedrock toward the pipeline , a method that could intercept the erupting oil but is more than a month away from fruition .
The growing oil slick has reached the shores of Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi and is just nine miles from the coast of Florida , according to officials .
Cameron believes he could be of service , especially in directing robots at the mile - deep leak site .
The company has tried several gambits to stanch the leak , which began on April 20 , when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in a fireball .
" I know really , really , really smart people that work typically at depths much greater than what that well is at , " Cameron said .
While acknowledging that his contacts in the deep - sea industry do not drill for oil , Cameron said that they are accustomed to operating various underwater vehicles and electronic optical fiber systems .
" Most importantly , " he added , " they know the engineering that it requires to get something done at that depth . "

A player whose prior year salary was equal or less than $ 660,000 must receive a qualifying offer of 110 % of their prior year ’s salary .
A player whose prior year salary was more than $ 660,000 and up to $ 1 million must receive a qualifying offer of 105 % of their prior year ’s salary ( but in no event shall such qualifying offer exceed $ 1 million ) .
A player whose prior year salary was more than $ 1 million must receive a qualifying offer at 100 % of their prior year ’s salary .
– The Dallas Stars announced today that the club has extended qualifying offers to the following nine players : left wing , defenseman , center , defenseman , center , defenseman , left wing , defensemanand right wingRight wing Tyler Shelast did not receive a qualifying offer .
Teams are required to extend a one - year “ qualifying offer ” to any current restricted free agent by June 28 in order to receive the right of the first refusal or draft choice compensation should that respective player sign an offer sheet with another NHL club .
The qualifying offers will expire at 4 p.m. ( Central Time ) on Thursday , July 15 .
Qualifying offers fall into three categories :
If a team does not give a qualifying offer to a restricted free agent , he is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 , and can sign with any team with no compensation required to the player ’s former club .
In a column just posted to our op - ed page , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , is announcing he 'll vote against Elena Kagan 's nomination to the Supreme Court .
McCain 's reason :
The restrictions Kagan put on military recruiters when she was dean at Harvard Law School .
" She unmistakably discouraged Harvard students from considering a career in the military , " writes the senator , a decorated Navy veteran who spent more than five years in a Vietnamese prison camp .
During her confirmation hearing , Kagan said she did so because she felt the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , which allows gays to serve only if they keep their sexual preferences secret , violated Harvard 's anti-discrimination code .
McCain is n't buying her argument , for reasons you can read in his column .
By our count ( and we consulted with GOP Senate leadership offices ) , this makes McCain the seventh Republican to announce plans to vote against President Obama 's second Supreme Court nominee .
The others are : Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , and Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , Orrin Hatch of Utah , Bob Bennett of Utah , James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina .
No real surprises there :
All of them , including McCain , voted against Obama 's first nominee to the high court , Justice Sonia Sotomayor .
Given the Democrats ' 58 - 41 edge in the Senate and the Republicans ' lack of appetite for a filibuster , Kagan seems assured of confirmation .
The only suspense : How many of the Republicans who voted for Sotomayor will stick with Kagan .
Sotomayor got the votes of nine Republicans , one of whom , Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida , has since retired .
We 're checking to see if any of the others are willing to make an announcement .
They are : Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , Kit Bond of Missouri , Susan Collins of Maine , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , Richard Lugar of Indiana , Olympia Snowe of Maine and George Voinovich of Ohio .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has set a business meeting for Tuesday , meaning the vote on Kagan 's nomination could come as early as then , but Republicans could request a one week delay .

Radio host Alex Jones , who believes that 9/11 was a U.S. government plot and “ inside job ” conspiracy , is featured in Chris Matthews ’
Wednesday documentary on MSNBC as a leader of the “ New Right ” and the Tea Party movement .
But Jones has absolutely nothing to do with the conservative or Tea Party movements .
In the advance promotional advertisements for the program , Jones is shown saying that the U.S. has entered the phase of “ deep tyranny . ”
The promos make Jones appear to be the undisputed leader of the “ New Right ” and the Tea Party movement .
But in fact , a video shows Jones disrupting a Tea Party rally in Texas by shouting at organizers and speakers with a bullhorn .
This performance woke up many Tea Party members to the real Jones agenda and he has been anathema to them ever since .
“ HARDBALL Looks at Conservative Movement , ” the MSNBC website says , referring to the Chris Matthews program which airs at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday .
But Jones is not and never has been a conservative .
Jones has much more in common with the left than the right .
He is , for example , a member of the 9/11 Truth Movement , as was Van Jones , the Obama official fired after evidence of his communist background began to surface .
The 9/11 Truth Movement was originally designed to undercut evidence that Muslims were behind the attacks that killed almost 3,000 Americans .
Leftists joined the movement and used it to undermine the Bush Administration drive for a military response to Islamic terrorism and its base of operations in the Middle East .
On MSNBC , it seems clear that the “ Rise of the New Right ” program planned for June 16 is an outgrowth of fear that the Tea Party movement could threaten liberal control of Washington , D.C .
The key to the MSNBC assault is the use of Jones .
As Accuracy in Media has documented , Jones postures as a “ patriot ” with inside information about various plots but appears regularly on the Russia Today television propaganda channel , where he has defended Russian foreign policy .
One of his themes is that the U.S. is the greatest instigator of terrorism in the world today .
He also promotes legalization of marijuana as a solution to our economic woes .
These are hardly “ conservative ” or Tea Party positions .
Judging by the transcript , reportedly leaked by an MSNBC “ insider ” to Jones , the radio host says in the program , apparently with a straight face , that a “ global guild of psychopaths ” is “ setting up a planetary police state ” to destroy up to 99 percent of the world ’s population .
Adopting its own conspiracy theory , MSNBC throws out the names of Sarah Palin , Scott Brown , Dick Armey , Rand Paul , Joe McCarthy , Glenn Beck , Father Coughlin , Pat Buchanan , and the John Birch Society , as if they are all somehow linked or share something in common .
It is classic guilt by association , with no evidence of association being presented .
But for Alex Jones , the attention serves his purposes .
Having cooperated with Matthews , a former Democratic Party operative , and his producers , Jones ’ associates are now claiming that the script is biased to make the Tea Party movement look bad .
This was the obvious intention all along , of course , and Alex Jones played his part .
Matthews and his “ sources ” in the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Media Matters group should understand that , rather than being any kind of right - wing political figure , Jones works openly and closely with such “ progressive ” figures as Webster Tarpley , a former high - level associate of political opportunist and extremist Lyndon LaRouche , one of the first fringe political figures to question whether Muslims were behind the 9/11 attacks .
Tarpley wrote 9/11 Synthetic Terror : Made in the USA , blaming the U.S. for the attacks .
LaRouche , who has been on the fringes of the political scene for decades , began his career as a Marxist and his National Caucus of Labor Committees was a faction of the left - wing Students for a Democratic Society at Columbia University .
During the late 1970s and 1980s , LaRouche and his operatives suddenly adopted a “ conservative ” posture .
After that , however , LaRouche ran for president as a Franklin Roosevelt Democrat .
He served prison time on financial fraud charges before re-emerging and running a movement that today is attempting to co-opt the Tea Party message .
Tarpley , who , like Jones , is a prominent figure in the so - called 9/11 Truth Movement , is a regular guest on the Jones radio show and appears in Jones documentaries that purport to expose the Obama Administration and the forces behind it .
One of Tarpley ’s books on Obama , published by Progressive Press , whitewashes Obama ’s Marxist connections .
He advertises himself as “ one of the most incisive critics of Anglo - American hegemony , ” demonstrating how he views the world .
One of the common themes of both Jones and Tarpley is that Muslims are being unfairly blamed for terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and that the U.S. and / or Israel are really behind them .
The problem of LaRouche operatives in the Tea Party movement is a real one and has been recognized as such .
Members of the LaRouche movement have been waving the signs that are sometimes seen at Tea Party gatherings that depict President Obama as Hitler .
The words “ LaRouche PAC , ” referring to the cult leader ’s political action committee , are actually visible on some of the signs and banners .
The Matthews documentary mentions the Nazi charge against Obama , in order to discredit the Tea Party movement , without noting its LaRouche origins .
It is another example of the program ’s basic dishonest approach .
Conservative activist Tom DeWeese of the American Policy Center , who began his conservative career in Young Americans for Freedom decades ago , has written that , “ Forces led by Lyndon LaRouche and , in my opinion , Alex Jones , are working deep inside our movement to see it implode into fights , caused by distrust and hatred .
I believe they are manipulating the media to show the freedom movement as simply a band of nuts not to be taken seriously . ”
It ’s hard to tell who is manipulating whom .
In any case , the Matthews agenda is clear : to use Jones in an unfair effort to smear the ordinary Americans and conservatives associated with the Tea Party movement as kooks following dangerous and unstable personalities .
By extension , this reasoning goes , any candidate receiving their support is questionable .
All of this is supposed to benefit Democrats such as Harry Reid running against Tea Party - backed candidates like Sharron Angle in Nevada .
Another theme of the Matthews program , which we have seen before , is that the Tea Party movement includes racists .
Matthews is a member of an all - white line - up of hosted shows on MSNBC - TV that has been determined to ignore black speakers and black leaders of the Tea Party movement .
If Matthews had wanted to present the facts , rather than his own conspiracy theories , he could have mentioned that Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul , a leader of the Tea Party movement , has appeared several times on the Alex Jones radio show and that Jones has even raised money for him .
These are facts that any objective journalist on the right or left would agree that Paul has to account for .
In addition , Fox News host Andrew Napolitano , who now has his own television show on the Fox Business Network ( FBN ) , appears regularly on the Jones radio program and has referred to the radio personality as a “ great ” figure with amazing insights into current events .
Incredibly , Rand Paul recently bypassed NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” in order to avoid being questioned about his libertarian views , and instead went on the Russia Today propaganda channel , where he talked about immigration and other matters .
For someone who wants to be elected to a national office with influence over national security affairs , it is shocking that Paul would go on a channel financed by the Kremlin that not only promotes Russian foreign policy but also the 9/11 “ inside job ” conspiracy theory .
In one segment that seems largely untainted by the political motives or conspiracies advanced by Matthews and his producers , the MSNBC program features a legitimate Tea Party member by the name of Ana Puig , a stay - at - home mother of four who got involved in the “ Kitchen table patriots ” because of the Marxist threat she saw developing from the Obama Administration .
“ I like to call it 21st Century Marxism , a camouflage statement for Communism since we are not fighting a bloody battle , ” she has written .
“ Instead , we are fighting an ideological one . ”
This is the real voice of the Tea Party movement .
And this is why liberals like Matthews are so scared of it .
The Tea Party movement has emerged because of recognition of what Obama and his backers truly represent .
One motive for the weak and slanted Matthews documentary is clearly disgust over the fact that Fox News , which is killing MSNBC in the ratings , has been a platform for Ana Puig and others like her .
The role of Fox News in promoting the movement is mentioned several times .
By attacking the Tea Party movement , Matthews is really attacking his nemesis Fox News .
But if the transcript that is being made available by Jones is the final one , Matthews will have demonstrated that , in addition to being a hatchet man for the Democratic Party , he is also a bad journalist .
He could have mentioned a real issue — how Andrew Napolitano of FBN has praised Alex Jones and has appeared repeatedly on his radio show .
The “ Rise of the New Right ” will be quickly forgotten because of its serious inattention to the facts .
But you can bet that Jones will use it to make himself into a media martyr .

ATHENS  Greece took a big step toward overhauling its debt - plagued economy on Thursday by forcing through a pension bill that would sharply pare down the country ’s welfare state by increasing the retirement age and reducing benefits .
For Prime Minister George Papandreou , who commands a seven - member majority in Parliament , the bill represents the beginning of the end of the cradle - to - grave state compact that his father put in place as prime minister in the early 1980s .
The plan was approved in principle late Wednesday .
Individual provisions were approved on Thursday as workers protested outside the Parliament building , and the whole package passed Thursday night by a vote of 157-134 .
Three months after Europe provided Greece with a financial rescue program worth 110 billion euros  about $ 140 billion , and half of Greece ’s gross domestic product  the government has exceeded the deficit - cutting benchmarks set by the International Monetary Fund .
Officials see the bill ’s passage as further evidence for skeptical investors that Greece is committed to pushing through painful overhaul measures that will restore fiscal stability .

Russian resupply ship returns and docks to space station
BY JUSTIN RAY
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : July 4 , 2010
The Russian - American crew living aboard the International Space Station welcomed the safe arrival of a cargo - delivery tug Sunday , two days after the freighter aborted its initial rendezvous and sailed by the orbiting complex .
Credit : NASA TV
Flying smoothly on autopilot 220 miles above Earth , the Progress M -06 M spacecraft linked up to the aft docking port of the station 's Zvezda service module at 12:17 p.m. EDT .
" Docking confirmed ... at the four - corner border of Russia , Kazakhstan , China and Mongolia , " NASA commentator Rob Navias announced from Houston 's Mission Control Center .
" The belated arrival of the Progress 38 cargo ship executed perfectly , flawlessly by the KURS automated rendezvous system . "
Hooks and latches were engaged a few minutes later to firmly secure the 24 - foot - long craft to the station , finally bringing two - and - a - half tons of supplies and equipment to the outpost .
The Expedition 24 crew of commander Alexander Skvortsov , Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Fyodor Yurchikhin , and NASA astronauts Tracy Caldwell Dyson , Doug Wheelock and Shannon Walker plan to open hatches and enter the Progress around 3:30 p.m. EDT .
The cargo includes 2,667 pounds of equipment , food , fresh clothing , life support system gear , 1,918 pounds of propellant to replenish reservoirs that feed the Russian maneuvering thrusters , 220 pounds of water and some 110 pounds of oxygen and air for the station 's atmosphere .
The Progress was launched Wednesday atop a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome , reaching a preliminary orbit of 150 by 120 miles .
A series of precise engine firings over two days guided the craft toward its planned Friday rendezvous .
But an apparent interference problem about 25 minutes before docking halted the scheduled intercept and caused the freighter to move past the space station in harmless fashion .
The Progress went into the standby condition when the communications link between the ship and station was interrupted .
Engineers later traced the interference to a television transmitter used in the backup docking equipment that is available for the cosmonauts to manually fly the freighter via remote control .
The autonomous safety procedures aboard the supply ship worked as designed to abort the rendezvous since conditions exceeded pre-programmed commands .
Subsequent testing of the KURS autopilot showed that system to be functioning properly , so Russian specialists uplinked plans for the vessel to perform maneuvers Friday night and Saturday to target a Sunday docking attempt .
" Everything is going extremely well .
The KURS automated rendezvous system reported by the Visiting Vehicle Officer to be rock solid and locked on , " Navias said Sunday as the craft closed within two miles of the space station .
After arriving in close range of the space station , Progress began a flyaround maneuver at 11:49 a.m. to get lined up with the docking port and then executed a roll maneuver to properly orient its forward docking probe with Zvezda .
The station crew did n't activate the television transmitter this time and the interference problem was n't repeated .
A brief stationkeeping hold with about 600 feet between the freighter and station allowed Russian flight controllers to assess systems before giving approval at 12:06 p.m. to commence the 11 - minute final approach .
The ship 's autopilot did its job and drove the craft down the corridor for a successful docking while traveling over Russian ground tracking stations .
" No doubt a sigh of relief on the part of the Russian flight control team after Friday 's events .
Today went by the book , a smooth and uneventful approach and docking automatically , " Navias said .
It is the 38th Progress to dock with the station over its decade - long life and the third of six scheduled this year .
The craft joins the previous resupply ship that arrived on May 1 and remains affixed to the outpost 's Pirs port , plus two Soyuz crew transport capsules currently residing at the space station 's Poisk and Rassvet modules .

Muslim civil rights group calls on officials , interfaith leaders to support targeted mosque
WASHINGTON , July 27 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / --
The Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR - LA ) today denounced a planned anti-mosque protest by California Tea Party supporters who are being told to bring dogs to harass Muslim worshippers during a Friday congregational prayer , or " Jummah . "
CAIR -LA called on local officials and interfaith leaders to show support for the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley , the target of the July 30 protest by the Southwest Riverside County ( SWRC ) Tea Party group .
The protest is in opposition to a proposal for a new mosque in the area .

http://tinyurl.com/2e5x6g7
An e-mail alert announcing the anti-mosque protest sent to area newspapers by " a leader of a conservative coalition that has been active with Republican and Tea Party functions " stated : " An Islamic Mosque is planned to be built in Temecula .
Islam is not a religion .
It is a worldwide political movement meant [ sic ] on domination of the world .
And it is meant to subjugate all people under Islamic law . . . Islam permits lying !. . . The Islam 's [ sic ] treat women as second class people and they also hate dogs .
Women are forbidden to sing and dogs are killed .
We will not be submissive to Sharia Law .
Tennessee was able to stop the Mosque so bring your Bibles , flags , signs , dogs and singing voice on Friday . "

http://www.myvalleynews.com/story/49601/
" Californians of all faiths should repudiate those who would target a house of worship using tactics specifically designed to cause offense , " said CAIR - LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush .
" National and state Tea Party leaders should explain why their movement has apparently deviated from its agenda on fiscal responsibility and limited government to the promotion of Islamophobia . "
Ayloush noted that many Muslims believe the saliva of dogs invalidates the ritual ablution ( wudu ) performed before prayer .
For this reason , it has become a cultural norm for individuals not to have dogs in their houses -- not because the dog is " hated . "
Islam 's Prophet Muhammad allowed the use of dogs for protection and for hunting , and he related several traditions ( hadith ) in which individuals were rewarded by God for protecting animals , including dogs , and punished for mistreating them .
In response to the planned protest , the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley released a statement that read in part : " It has come to our attention that a group of people seek to disrupt our prayer session on Friday , July 30th .
We are disheartened and saddened that a group of our neighbors seeks to disrespect and make our community feel unwelcome . "

Unreadable – until now ( Image : Peter and Nejma Beard / Eurekavision ) ( Image : Peter and Nejma Beard / Eurekavision )
Secrets of David Livingstone ‘s experiences and thoughts from Africa are about to be revealed for the first time , thanks to multispectral imaging enhancement .
Advertisement
To date , historians have had to rely on a heavily edited version of the diaries called The Last Journals of David Livingstone , compiled and published a year after Livingstone ’s death in 1873 by his friend , Horace Waller , to whom all the letters were addressed .
Now , historians will be able to see what Livingstone really said , experienced and thought in his final and doomed quest to find the source of the Nile .
Most of the letters are virtually unreadable since Livingstone had run out of writing paper and reverted to newspaper and pages ripped out from journals and books , which meant scrawling in the margins and all over the existing newsprint or text .
In the 140 years since the letters were written , Livingstone ’s ink made from local berries has faded or soaked through the paper , obliterating his words .
Now , a project is under way to rescue his words from the mush of paper and print .
The imaging technique accentuates the visibility of Livingstone ’s ink while simultaneously suppressing the visibility of the underlying print ( see picture ) .
It does this by taking 12 separate images of each document , exposing it in turn to 12 different wavelengths of light , from blue ultraviolet , through the visible spectrum to infrared .
Eureka moment
By feeding the stack of 12 superimposed images through image analysis software , algorithms pick out and best highlight the Livingstone text .
“ We get the 12 images that stack up in an image cube , and you can process this digitally , ” says Michael Toth , the programme manager , who has used the same technique to enhance other valuable ancient documents including the Palimpsest revealing Archimedes ’s famous “ Eureka ” theory , parts of the US Declaration of Independence and Abraham Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address condemning slavery .
Different light wavelengths bring out different parts of the text , Toth explains .
So Livingstone ’s ink disappears under infrared and becomes most distinct under blue .
The group ’s first fully deciphered letter , written in 1871 from a remote village in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo , has been made public today in the first stage of the project .
The aim is to decipher all the letters written between 1870 and early 1871 , just months before Livingstone ’s famous meeting with New York Herald reporter Henry Morton Stanley .
The letters amount to around 140 sides altogether , and the four sides comprising Livingstone ’s Letter from Bambarre , dated 5 February 1871 , showcase the potential of the technology .
The letter reveals Livingstone ’s despair over his failing health , feeling ravaged by heat and tropical diseases , his intense rivalry towards other African explorers , and his well - documented abhorrence of the slave trade .
“ The letter is really just a test run for the much larger diary project , ” says Adrian Wisnicki of Birkbeck , University of London , the project director guiding the programme in collaboration with the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh and the David Livingstone Centre in Balantyre .
“ This takes us back to the original text and Livingstone ’s experiences as he went through this key period towards the end of his life . ”
Deciphered diary
Toth says that the next stage of the project is already under way , with all 140 diary pages already scanned and ready for deciphering .
He expects the complete versions to be available within 18 months or so .
Like the Letter from Bambarre , they will all eventually be made publically available at Livingstone Online , the leading British - based internet resource for Livingstone ’s writings .
The project promises to reveal much about Livingstone that Waller ’s editing concealed .
He presented the explorer as a swashbuckling hero , an anti-slavery campaigner and martyr .
The deciphered letter portrays a man in terrible health , wracked by fevers , weak from bleeding haemorrhoids , and virtually stranded at Bambarre by bone - deep wounds in his feet until his “ rescue ” by Stanley .
All of which Livingstone told Waller to conceal from the public with the words “ for your eyes only ” .
More true to form , he rails in the letter against the trafficking of slaves saying : “ It is awful traffic and can be congenial only to the Devil and his angels . ”

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday criticized US President Barack Obama for failing to provide him with clear answers to a number of questions regarding the future of peace talks with Israel .
Abbas also confirmed that Obama has been exerting pressure on him to enter direct negotiations with Israel .
Abbas was speaking during a closed meeting of members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council in Ramallah .
Abbas was quoted by some Fatah operatives as saying that Egypt and Jordan supported the PA ’s refusal to move to direct talks unless progress is first achieved on the issues of security and the future borders of a Palestinian state .
“ We ca n’t go to direct negotiations like blind people , ” Abbas was quoted as saying .
“ We ca n’t enter direct negotiations without clarity .
” Abbas complained that Obama recently sent him an oral message urging him to launch direct negotiations with Israel unconditionally .
According to the PA president , Obama ’s message was “ unclear and ambiguous .
” Abbas was quoted as saying : “ With all due respect to the American president , his message was not clear .
We want to clear answers to questions we presented to the Americans , especially regarding security , borders and the status of Jerusalem .
We continue to insist that any negotiations with Israel be based on recognition of 1967 as the future borders of the Palestinian state .
” Abbas said that the US administration has also failed to give the Palestinians a clear answer with regard to Israel ’s policy of settlement construction .
“ Before we go to the negotiations , we want clear answers on the borders and settlements , ” Abbas stressed .
He is also under pressure from Fatah to reshuffle the cabinet of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad so that it would include more ministers from Fatah .
Some of the Fatah operatives at the meeting attacked Fayyad and accused him of “ marginalizing ” their faction and denying their supporters key jobs .
Muhammad Taha , a member of the Revolutionary Council , said he expected a cabinet reshuffle within two weeks .
He said that the discussions also focused on the severe financial crisis in Fatah .
Another council member , Sabri Saidam , said Abbas asked the Fatah council to present him with a name of candidates for ministerial posts in a new cabinet .
After months of rumors , announcements and cancellations , a new Blu-ray edition of Ridley Scott 's Gladiator has at last been actually released in the Netherlands .
Eager enthusiasts have compared the picture quality of this new release with that released last year and confirmed that the image is now noticeably superior .
The Digital Bits has received confirmation that this remastered disc will also be available in the US , and that Paramount Home Entertainment will implement a " limited exchange program . "
The studio admits that the first edition had edge enhancement and digital video noise reduction , but it does not acknowledge that the product was defective .
Rather , it posits that some consumers " may have preferential issues with some of the technical DVNR ( digital video noise reduction ) and EE ( edge enhancement ) choices made in the original source transfer , and so would prefer to exchange it for one that addresses those preferences in a different manner .
While the version that we originally distributed was of the highest quality , some enthusiasts may prefer to view it without the Edge Enhancement and DVNR implemented as standard process in bringing the film to hi-def .
This new master resolves those issues . "
Those interested in receiving a replacement disc should contact Paramount Home Entertainment 's service hotline number 323-956-3010 for instructions .
For those in North America who do n't yet own the disc , a running production change has been initiated , so future copies shipped to retailers will include the new transfer .
In other countries around the world , the new disc is being gradually rolled out in each region by Universal : contact your local distributor for details .
Update
Universal ( which holds the UK rights to the movie ) is also setting up an exchange program , and is sending the following instructions : " If you wish to exchange your original DVNR ( digital video noise reduction ) feature disc we ask that you send us just your disc 1 in an envelope with your name and address enclosed .

Andrew Breitbart was on Michael Savage ’s show today , where he claimed that his own edited video of Shirley Sherrod is really a campaign by Barack Obama to destroy him .
Breitbart said , “ I believe that he is orchestrating the campaign to destroy me and my reputation . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

In response to a caller who asked if Obama ’s appearance on The View this week is payback for his possibly asking program last week to put on Shirley Sherrod , Breitbart said , “ I do n’t know , but I think , I ’m not going to say I feel bad for President Obama because I believe that he is orchestrating the campaign to destroy me and my reputation . ”
Okay , so according to Breitbart , Obama was behind his editing of a 25 year old video of Shirley Sherrod , to give the false impression that she was racist .
Obama also told Breitbart to post the video to his own website for the sole purpose of using the doctored video as grounds for firing Ms. Sherrod so that the truth could soon emerge , which would destroy Breitbart ’s reputation as a , “ credible journalist . ”
The problem is that even before this Breitbart had no credibility after the ACORN video was exposed as a doctored fraud .
It is revealing that Breitbart did not get to go on Fox News , Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh ’s radio shows in order to make his case , but that he has been reduced to going on Michael Savage ’s show , which is most decidedly part of the B team in the right wing media .
It would appear that all of the A list big audience programs are distancing themselves from him .
Despite what he thinks of himself , Andrew Breitbart is not important enough for the President of the United States to waste one second thinking about him , much less hatch a plot to destroy him .
Breitbart is trying to appeal to the natural paranoia of the conservative mindset in order to save his own hide .
If we suspend all logic and reality for a second , and believe Breitbart ’s story , then he is the biggest idiot on the face of the earth .
His defense is that he is a victim of an Obama plot , which means that he played a role in setting himself up , because he edited the video and ran it on his site .
Even the most die hard Obama hating conspiracy theorists have to shake their heads at that one .
Breitbart should have been finished after his ACORN video was debunked , but now he and his race baiting really are done .
Let ’s hope Shirley Sherrod sues him for every dime he ’s got , and maybe she can take over his website and use it to combat racism .
That would be some true poetic justice .
A British - made solar powered aircraft has been airborne above a US military test range in Arizona for more than seven days continuously , it has been announced .
Make the most of it lads , your sons will be doing the next servicing .
The " Zephyr " , made by controversial MoD boffinry selloff bonanza firm Qinetiq , is still in flight above the US Army Yuma Proving Ground as of publication , having taken off last Friday .
At 168 hours as of just before 3 pm UK time , this far outstrips the official world record for longest duration unmanned flight ( 30 hours 24 minutes , set by the RQ - 4A Global Hawk in 2001 ) .
In order to make the Zephyr 's new record official , a representative of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale ( FAI ) is present at Yuma .
The books will be amended once the aircraft is safely down : however Qinetiq intends to keep it airborne for another week if possible before that .
The Zephyr uses electricity from its solar cells to recharge its batteries during the daytime and runs off the stored power at night .
It is intended to carry out surveillance and communications - relay tasks above the battlefield , where it would offer a long - endurance alternative to normal aircraft or satellites .
According to Qinetiq , the goal of the current flight is to show that Zephyr is the world 's first " truly eternal plane " , capable of staying up for months .
“ The team has worked tirelessly over the past few years , making truly significant leaps forward in overall design and construction - and to see it successfully soar into the sky was fantastic , ” gushes Jon Saltmarsh , Zephyr chief at Qinetiq .
“ By being able to remain over a location for weeks or months at a time , it can usefully deliver a host of practical and more affordable solutions to both civil and military customers . ”
The new and upgraded Zephyr has been enlarged from previous versions and features a new power - management system and T - tail for reduced drag .
There 's no doubt that the current flight is a significant achievement for Qinetiq .
However , as with Zephyr 's previous unofficially record - breaking flight one can't help noticing that the firm has chosen to make the attempt in uniquely favourable circumstances .
Yuma Proving Ground lies in the Sonoran Desert just 32 degrees north of the Equator , and the northern - hemisphere summer solstice is only just past .
The sun is tracking as nearly dead overhead as it ever does over US territory just now , meaning that the Zephyr is getting far more energy from its cells than it would farther north or at other times of year .
One should note that in operational use the Zephyr will have to power a payload as well as itself - and for much of the year in many locations it will have to do this with less output from its cells than it is getting now .
If the sun-plane is generating a large surplus above what it needs to stay airborne , well and good : Qinetiq are offering no details at this point .
If it is n't , though , its claim to be the first useful " eternal plane " will look rather unfounded . ®
Fortescue Metals CEO
Andrew Forrest says he is relieved that the resources super profits tax is now dead , but says the redesigned tax unfairly penalises junior and smaller Australian miners .
The Government has backed down on several key areas in a bid to end the damaging stoush with the resources sector , dumping its resource super profits tax for the Minerals Resource Rent Tax ( MRRT ) .
Tax renamed the minerals resources rent tax

Tax will kick in at the government bond rate plus 7 per cent , which would be around 12 per cent Changes mean the Government loses $ 1.5 billion of expected revenue
Mr Forrest says the original tax proposal would also have been axed by former prime minister Kevin Rudd .
" The changes broadly encompassed to the RSPT picked up from where the previous prime minister and I left off , " he said
" Remember that the previous prime minister and I were to bring forward a discussion paper to formally bury what I always thought was the stillborn RSPT ; a very , very dangerous tax . "
He says the new agreement generally reflects the key elements of the discussion paper Fortescue was expecting Mr Rudd to release last week .
" However , it is very disappointing that right at the time that junior and smaller Australian iron ore and coal miners have managed to develop a foothold into the industry , they are immediately slugged with this proposed new and additional tax , " he said .
" [ In ] the developing sector if we 're going to be fair dinkum about fairness , we should have a floating rate above a company 's true cost of borrowings .
Then of course you have a fair playing field .
" At this stage the playing field is skewed towards those companies with lower cost of borrowings and therefore skewed towards multinationals and not Australians . "
Mr Forrest also says the narrow and complex nature of the new tax will be a disincentive for other mining project developers who are keen to enter the industry .
Fortescue is seeking clarification on transitional arrangements , the treatment of infrastructure costs and the uplift over the bond rate .
Mr Forrest says he was aware the Government was holding talks with other miners , but did not ask Prime Minister Julia Gillard if he could join in .
" She would well have known that I would insist on a discussion paper , not a cut and dry deal , " he said .
" She perhaps chose people who were in more of a hurry and less willing to consult than I was . "
' Strange scenario '
West Australian Premier Colin Barnett has criticised the discussion process leading up to the new tax , saying the Commonwealth failed to consult his government .
He has also echoed the negative sentiments of some mid-tier and junior miners .
" It is a strange scenario when a national government will sit down with probably the world 's three largest mining companies to negotiate an arrangement and the Australian - owned companies are basically left out in the cold , " he said .
Mr Barnett says the new tax deal shows considerable improvement but is still flawed and should be scrapped .
" This proposal is a better one than the previous one but it is still a new mining tax , " he said .
" Increasing the threshold level is a good move - reducing the rate of taxation also good .
" It 's a bit strange to me that it 's now just going to apply to iron ore , coal and the oil and gas industry .
That is a discriminatory taxation regime . "
Mr Barnett says he is unsure what future role his state will have regarding royalties .
" We are not going to give up any sovereignty over our natural resource - to do so would be to abandon the future of Western Australia , " he said .
" I do n't know what the Commonwealth proposes but there have been some strange comments made with respect to royalties - some very obscure comments . "
Meanwhile , Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is refusing to back the deal made between the Federal Government and the resources sector over its redesigned resources tax .
Mr Abbott is not rescinding his calls for a new tax on the mining industry to be dumped and says that the next election will be a referendum on the proposal .
Telstra has been ordered to pay more than $ 18.5 million in fines for locking broadband competitors out of its telephone exchanges .
In the Federal Court in Melbourne Justice John Middleton found Telstra breached the Trade Practices Act and its licence 27 times between 2006 and 2008 .
The ACCC had wanted Telstra to be fined about $ 40 million , but Justice Middleton said the ACCC had not proved that other companies had suffered any actual losses .
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission started the case against Telstra after reports the company had told its competitors there was not any room at the exchanges for them to install their equipment .
In fact there was enough space , and Telstra admitted to most of the ACCC 's allegations .
The Competitive Carrier Coalition is made up of most of Telstra 's main competitors except Optus , and its chairman Matt Healy welcomed today 's judgement and fine .
" Unfortunately it merely reinforces that which we know already which is that Telstra really is n't set up to adequately serve its competitors , " he said .
" We really need Telstra 's cooperation when we try and put our equipment into Telstra 's exchanges and other facilities .
However , Telstra being our main competitor obviously does n't have the underlying incentive to give us decent quality of service and really that is what the judgement reflects today . "
Justice John Middleton accepted that the requests Telstra rejected in 2006 and 2007 made up only 0.5 per cent of the total number of requests for space that the company received in that time and concerned only seven out of the 526 relevant exchanges .
But Matt Healy says the fact that the case dealt with such a small number of requests does not lessen its significance .
" There are problems obviously in prosecuting some of these cases and bringing all the evidence to court .
This has taken more than four years you must remember and , during that time , we see that the conduct is ongoing , " he added .
" It really has been a disincentive for investment during that period so , just because on one reading it might not look like many services , the effect of not servicing those people and those customers has undermined competition in quite a significant way . "
Associate Professor Caron Beaton - Wells specialises in competition law at the University of Melbourne 's Law School and agrees this is a significant case in terms of the extent of Telstra 's breaches and the nature of the penalty imposed .
" Telstra admitted the conduct , so it was not a question of whether or not Telstra was liable .
The only contest here was between Telstra and the ACCC over the appropriate scale of the penalty .
The ACCC did seek a high penalty in the order of $ 34 million , " she said .
" Telstra contended that in fact an appropriate penalty was in the order of $ 3 million to $ 5 million so there was a very large gap between the parties on the appropriate penalty .
" Justice Middleton came down somewhere in the middle but closer to what Telstra had submitted was appropriate , in that Justice Middleton ordered a penalty of $ 18.5 million .
He had discounted the penalty that he thought appropriate of $ 26 million by 30 per cent to reflect Telstra 's cooperation essentially in the proceedings . "
Professor Beaton - Wells says the case is a significant precedent .
" The primary consideration by the judge in this proceeding was to impose a penalty that would deter Telstra specifically , but other actors in the telecommunications market in the future , from similar conduct and , yes , I do think it is a substantial penalty from that perspective , " she said .
" The penalty also reflects the size and the influence of Telstra in the market and the fact that it has significant advantages over its competitors in terms of information and bargaining strength .
" I might say it is also significant that the judge made the finding that Telstra staff really did not have the training or the understanding in their exchange access obligations that they should have had given that Telstra , as I said , has been subject to these obligations for some time , and he found that there was no culture of compliance in the organisation with respect to these obligations . "
The costs in the case are still to be finalised .

The article is based on reports by sociologist Anna Kontula , who lived with Polish workers at the site for one month .
" Only a small number of employees work according to Finnish labour contract rules .
It 's hard to separate legal labour from grey - market labour , because taxes are n't paid for all the workers , " says Kontula .
She told the magazine that the foreign workers themselves can't make complaints , because they will be sent back home .
Neither do they have the opportunity to find another job in the area .
In addition , says Kontula , any complaints that are made lead nowhere because labour inspectors usually do n't have time to look into the matter until the employee in question has already finished his job and returned home .
‘ NHS does n't care about cost of medicine ’ : Drugs firms accused of profiteering by raising prices by ONE THOUSAND per cent
Millionaire who raised the price of widely - used drugs by 1,000 % over two years says : ‘ I do n’t have to justify my profits to anyone ’
Drugs companies making everyday medicines for the NHS are facing claims of profiteering after imposing huge price rises for commonly prescribed drugs .
The increases – some as high as 1,000 per cent in just two years – coincided with some of the firms involved earning massive profits .
One company boss said the NHS ‘ does n’t care what it costs ’ .
Drugs made by Teva , one of the world 's largest pharmaceutical firms .
It is the main producer of Qvar asthma inhalers , which have gone from costing a couple of pounds to £ 16
The medicines are not new innovative products developed by pharmaceutical companies after enormous investment in research and development .
Instead , they are unbranded so - called ‘ generic ’ drugs which have been available for many years and include commonly used antibiotics prescribed to millions of patients .
Last night ,
The Mail on Sunday investigation prompted the Department of Health to reveal it had launched a review of the price increases and to say that it was examining what action could be taken against manufacturers deemed to be making excess profits .
The revelations will be particularly upsetting for cancer patients and others trying to get access to expensive life - prolonging drugs which have been blocked on the grounds of cost .
Last month , in the latest controversial decision of its kind , the UK ’s medicines advisory body , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , recommended against the NHS paying for a new breast cancer drug .
One of the medicines under the spotlight after a huge unexplained price increase is hydrocortisone tablets – a daily lifesaver for thousands of kidney patients .
In June 2008 , the cost to the NHS of a packet of 10 mg pills was £ 5 .
Today , the NHS is paying £ 44.40 for the same course .
The main supplier of the drug is a small pharmaceutical firm called Auden McKenzie , based in Ruislip , North - West London , which sells 60,000 packets a month to the NHS .
Earlier this year , the price peaked at £ 48 a packet which – allowing for the High Street chemists ’ profit – meant the firm was earning an estimated £ 2,400,000 a month from the drug , or up to £ 28 million a year .
In June 2008 , the cost to the NHS of a packet of 10 mg hydrocortisone pills was £ 5 .
Today , the NHS is paying £ 44.40 for the same course
It also produces a 20 mg dose pack , for which the NHS pays £ 46.62 and dispenses around 2,000 packets a month .
The prescription - only medicines are taken when a patient ’s body is not making enough hydrocortisone , either because part of the adrenal gland is not working or because of surgery or other injuries .
It is used in the treatment of Addison ’s disease .
The firm ’s current accounts are overdue , according to Companies House , and its current turnover and profits are not available .
However , its most recent accounts for 2008 – signed off by its board last year – showed a massive increase in profits .
In 2007 , its turnover was £ 5.3 million and it was making profits of £ 2.3 million .
In 2008 , turnover was up to £ 10.6 million and profits had trebled to £ 6.2 million .
Auden McKenzie is owned by Amit Patel , an accountant , who founded the firm in 2001 , starting out making only one drug .
Today , Auden Mckenzie sells more than 30 licensed products in the UK and six in continental Europe .
Some of the drugs it sells have been bought from giants such as GlaxoSmithKline , but the company has research - and - development facilities for modifying and improving its products .
Last year , for the first time , 35 - year - old Mr Patel appeared on the Eastern Eye magazine Asian Rich List , with a reputed worth of £ 40 million .
He lives in a large double - fronted house in Northwood , North - West London , which cost him £ 775,000 seven years ago , and where yesterday a three - year - old Aston Martin , worth at least £ 100,000 , and a £ 70,000 Mercedes ML were parked on the drive .
Last night , Mr Patel appeared reluctant to discuss why he is charging so much more for hydrocortisone .
He claimed that the price increase was a result of his firm ’s large outlay on a new production line to make the drug .
Imposing : The London home of Amit Patel , owner of the Auden Mckenzie company , which produces the exorbitantly priced hydrocortisone tablets
But he refused to say where the expensive new plant was or give more details about the spending .
He said : ‘ This is all commercially confidential . ’
He added : ‘ For hydrocortisone , there is a very specific raw material required .
Basically , the plant that made that was no longer prepared to do that .
There had to be a multi-million - pound investment put in to ensure that [ production ] continued .
‘ This sort of product can not be made in a general facility .
There are dangers of cross contamination .
A new manufacturing plant had to be put up .
‘ Either we just let this product go , just let it die .
But it is crucial to certain patients , so we ca n’t do that .
Now the majority of the investment which has been made has been recouped .
‘ So now you will steadily see [ the price ] coming back down .
It will creep back down because the company has recouped what it needed to .
It was not simple and it was a very expensive process . ’
He added : ‘ Joe Public would not know what it takes sometimes to revive these old drugs .
Quite rightly , the Government views medicine as public safety .
They do n’t care what it costs .
They will not put people ’s lives at risk by allowing us to market substandard drugs .
‘ This a classic example of the malaise in the NHS where more and more money is being pumped in without any regard for whether we are getting value for money ’
- Peter Bone MP
' To be honest , they do n’t care what it costs .
You either meet their criteria or you do n’t market the product .
This being a critical product , you ca n’t not market it . ’
Asked about his company profits , he added : ‘ That is nothing to do with this product .
' That is to do with our European sales of completely different sorts of drugs . ’
He refused to give further details of his company ’s spending that he said had led to the price increase .
‘ This is commercially confidential , ’ he said .
‘ The Government has those details .
I do n’t need to justify my profits to anybody .
There are companies that make bigger profits than I do . ’
Another of the drugs under the spotlight is Flucloxacillin syrup , one of the most common antibiotics prescribed to children .
It is used to treat a variety of skin conditions and throat infections .
According to the NHS drugs price list , in October last year a 125 ml course cost the NHS around £ 4 a bottle .
Now , the NHS price – which includes the wholesale cost set by the drugs company and a built - in profit for High Street chemist shops – has risen to £ 21.87 , a more than five - fold increase .
The NHS price of the 250 ml course , also branded as Floxapen Syrup , has risen from £ 8.02 last year to £ 26.87 .
Until last year , the medicine , which is prescribed to more than two million patients annually , was made by two of the world ’s biggest drug companies , Teva and Actavis .
But the price increases coincided with a decision last year by Teva to stop making the drug – claiming it was too expensive and unprofitable – handing its rivals a virtual monopoly .
The subsequent price increase could cost the NHS and the taxpayer an estimated £ 44 million in extra prescription costs for this drug alone .
Actavis is an international generic pharmaceutical company based in Iceland .
Listed on the Icelandic Stock Exchange until 2007 , it was taken private by Novator Partners , an investment vehicle of the chairman Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson , once his country ’s first billionaire .
The entrepreneur was hit by the recent banking crisis and saw his net worth decline from £ 2.3 billion to £ 600 million .
Last night , Actavis , which makes around £ 1.3 billion a year worldwide , ignored requests to explain its price rises .
Instead , it issued a statement saying it is ‘ very proud of the low - cost , high - quality generics they manufacture which enable the NHS to afford prescription medicines and to fund the vital research into new medicines ’ .
Analysis of NHS drug prices shows a number of other large price increases involving other generic manufacturers .
‘ The question for the NHS is who agreed to these enormous price increases and why ? ’
- Former Tory Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell
The biggest supplier of Flutamide , which is used to treat advanced prostate cancer , is again Actavis .
And again the price of the drug has risen dramatically in the past 12 months , going from around £ 7 for a 250 mg pack to £ 20.02 for a course in May ’s NHS price list .
Qvar inhalers , used to prevent asthma attacks , have gone from costing a couple of pounds to £ 16 .
The inhalers , once made by three manufacturers , are now mainly produced by Teva , which says the price increases are the result of a change in the inhalers ’ delivery mechanism .
The device , which pumps the anti-asthma drugs into the airway , previously used harmful CFC gases as a propellant .
But the gases were outlawed by the Government , adding extra production costs for the firm .
Other drugs , such as Gabapentin , which prevents epileptic fits , have been hit by shortages of active ingredients which explain , according to the manufacturers , why the price of a 600 mg pack has risen from £ 5.52 to a cost to the NHS of £ 41.06 .
Other increases , one of the big drug companies claims , are caused by a low demand for a drug or less competition as some companies decide it is not economic for them to continue production .
This , it is claimed , is behind the 400 per cent increase in the price of acne infection antibiotic Minocycline , with the price of a 100 mg dose rising from 26 p to £ 1.20 .
The same cause is blamed for the price hike of Erythromycin .
A 250 mg pack of the antibiotic cost £ 6.64 in August 2008 .
The July 2010 NHS price list now shows they cost £ 13.50 a pack .
And an 800 mg pack of stomach ulcer treatment Cimetidine now costs £ 22.09 , up from £ 16.01 .
Tory MP Peter Bone , a former member of the Commons Health Committee , described the findings as ‘ staggering ’ .
He said : ‘ This a classic example of the malaise in the NHS where more and more money is being pumped in without any regard for whether we are getting value for money . ’
He added : ‘ What is amazing is that this seems to have happened under the noses of hundreds of highly paid bureaucrats whose job should be to keep an eye on this sort of thing and stamp it out .
‘ If you were running a business and one of your suppliers said they were putting their prices up by 1,000 per cent , you would want to know why – but when this happens in our Health Service it appears nobody blinks .
‘ I shall be raising this issue in Parliament .
It needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency . ’
Former Tory Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell , now chairman of the Commons Health Committee , said : ‘ On the face of it , this seems to be profiteering by the drugs companies and they must answer for that .
‘ The question for the NHS is who agreed to these enormous price increases and why ?’
He added : ‘ It will not be for the Commons Health Committee to negotiate drugs prices with the pharmaceutical companies but we will be announcing a series of investigations which will look at how to tackle the inefficiencies in the way the Health Service is run . ’
Last night , the Generic Medicines Association , which represents a large number of the drugs firms supplying the NHS , said competition in the industry kept drug prices down and meant that the Health Service paid less for its drugs than anywhere else in Europe .
It said that the Department of Health also had powers to sanction firms profiteering on drug sales but was unaware of any recent cases of the Government intervening in this way .
The spokesman said : ‘ Each quarter , manufacturers report their sales and net revenues for each medicine to the Department of Health which in turn sets pharmacists ’ reimbursement prices for the following quarter at a level that gives community pharmacies a margin of £ 500 million in total .
‘ This provides the incentive for the competitive buying behaviour of pharmacists and wholesalers to drive down prices of generic medicines . ’
But last night the Department of Health said it had launched a review to examine why the cost of some generic drugs had risen dramatically .
A spokesman said : ‘ We are aware that the prices of a small number of medicines have risen in recent times and we are reviewing what action may be taken . ’
He added : ‘ The average price of a generic medicine has actually gone down .
There are approximately 3,700 generic medicines prescribed on the NHS .
Between 2004 - 2009 the average price of a generic medicine fell from £ 5.24 to £ 3.96 . ’

There are many ways in which friends can boost health and wellbeing
Having a good network of friends and neighbours boosts survival chances by 50 % , US researchers believe .
The Brigham Young University team came to this figure by number - crunching data from nearly 150 studies looking at survival odds and social networks .
And they calculate that having few friends is as damaging to survival as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being alcoholic , PLoS Medicine reports .
They believe caring about others makes us take better care of ourselves .
But they warn that in today 's modern world social networks are deteriorating as we struggle to juggle careers and families and find a happy work - life balance .
Relationships sustain us and help our mental health and wellbeing Christine Northam , Relate counsellor
Losing this social support , they say , cuts survival odds far more than being obese or not exercising .
Lead researcher Julianne Holt - Lundstad says there are many ways in which friends , colleagues and family can boost health and wellbeing .
" When someone is connected to a group and feels responsibility for other people , that sense of purpose and meaning translates to taking better care of themselves and taking fewer risks . "
In their study , which looked at over 300,000 people from four continents over a period of seven years , those with the strongest social networks fared best in terms of health outcomes and lifespan .
They were nearly twice ( 1.5 times ) as likely to be alive at any given age than those who were lonely .
The study included people of all ages and backgrounds , yet the findings remained the same and regardless of initial health status .
Co-researcher Timothy Smith said : " The effect is not isolated to older adults .
Relationships provide a level of protection across all ages . "
But he warned that modern conveniences and technology can lead some people to think that face - to - face social networks are not necessary .
Social networking
" We take relationships for granted as humans - we 're like fish that do n't notice the water .
That constant interaction is not only beneficial psychologically but directly to our physical health . "
Christine Northam , a counsellor for Relate , said friendship was essential to human survival .
" We are designed to live and work in groups .
It starts in childhood with our family , then school widens our social network .
" Relationships sustain us and help our mental health and wellbeing .
Isolation , on the other hand , is linked with mental illness , anxiety and ill health . "
Michelle Mitchell of Age UK said illness could be a barrier to maintaining social networks .
" It 's well known that social relationships are extremely important to older people 's wellbeing , yet sadly one - in - 10 over - 65s say they always or often feel lonely .
" Many people in later life struggle to maintain social networks due to mobility difficulties , access to transport or following the death of a spouse .
The isolation and loneliness many face can also lead to symptoms of depression , affecting one - in - four older people .
She said Age Concerns across the country offer older people a place to socialise and meet new people .
" We run a range of activities such as lunch clubs , computer courses and exercise classes , as well as one - to - one befriending schemes for people who need extra support . "
Professor Sally Macintyre , director of the Medical Research Council 's Social and Public Health Sciences Unit , said : " Policymakers and health care staff should note this important finding , and we need to build on it to find out how we can use social relationships to reduce the risk of death .

Now it ’s time to add the pièce de résistance : a high - speed solid - state drive ( SSD ) , so you can say goodbye to slow Windows boot - ups , lengthy application load times , and the retro feel of a motor - driven platter drive in a 21st - century computer .
But SSDs are n’t like old - fashioned spinning hard drives , where a quick look at rotational speed , interface type , and cache memory can give you a pretty good idea of performance .
The SSD market is relatively new , and even experienced PC builders and upgraders might be taken aback by the choices and feature sets available .
Unless you ’ve been running an investment banking scheme , you ’re probably not going to be able to afford to replace that 1TB boot drive with an equivalently sized SSD or even four 256GB SSDs .
So how big a drive do you need ?
Does your hard drive controller , which sat back and relaxed as data flowed in at well under 100,000 Kbps with your old spinning drive , have what it takes to keep up with an SSD that can spit out data almost five times faster ?
Does RAID Level 0 still offer a speed boost with these things ?
And since that roomy conventional spinning drive is going to have to stick around to hold your extensive collection of Nickelback concert videos , how big an SSD do you even need , anyway ?
The good news which you probably already know is that adding just about any SSD to a typical system will give you a noticeable speed - up over a conventional hard disk .
A small boot drive that ’s only large enough to hold your operating system and key applications wo n’t cost much , and will definitely make a difference .
But what if you want the fastest possible performance ?
It ’s worth investing in a new motherboard supporting 6 - Gbps SATA , and even buying a second drive for a RAID array .
Let ’s take a look at what kind of speed - up you can expect from various SSD hardware setups , and the best way to set up your software to get the most from an SSD installation .

GCRT J1745−3009 is a transient , bursting low - frequency radio source which lies in the direction of the galactic center . [ 1 ]
Discovery [ edit ]
A radio image of the central region of the Milky Way galaxy .
The arrow indicates the supernova remnant .
A group of astronomers from Sweet Briar College and the Naval Research Laboratory detected transient emission from two sources in 1998 while studying the Galactic Center .
They then began monitoring the region specifically looking for transient sources and detected five bursts of radio waves about 1 meter in wavelength ( frequency 330 MHz ) during a seven - hour period from September 30 to October 1 , 2002 .
The five bursts were of equal brightness , with each lasting about 10 minutes , and occurring every 77 minutes .
[ 2 ]
Like an earlier low - frequency transient discovered by the same group , [ 3 ] it was given the designation GCRT , an abbreviation for Galactic Center Radio Transient .
The source was also nicknamed a burper . [ 4 ]
The group found no X - ray or γ-ray counterpart to the object . [ 2 ]
Another burst from the source was later found in data recorded September 28 , 2003 , [ 5 ] and a weaker burst was found in data recorded March 20 , 2004 .
[1 ]
As of January 2007 , no other bursts have been found .
Structure [ edit ]
The discoverers argue that if the source is further than 70 parsecs away , its high brightness temperature would require it to be powered by a coherent emission process .
( If within 70 parsecs , the source could be either coherent or incoherent . )
They also claim that most known coherent emission processes are unlikely explanations for the source .

Models proposed by others include a nulling pulsar , [ 4 ] a pair of orbiting neutron stars , [ 6 ] a radio - emitting white dwarf , [ 7 ] and a pulsar precessing with a period of 77 minutes . [ 8 ]
The government calls it “ sealed management . ”
China ’s capital has started gating and locking some of its lower - income neighborhoods overnight , with police or security checking identification papers around the clock , in a throwback to an older style of control .
It ’s Beijing ’s latest effort to reduce rising crime often blamed on the millions of rural Chinese migrating to cities for work .
The capital ’s Communist Party secretary wants the approach promoted citywide .
But some state media and experts say the move not only looks bad but imposes another layer of control on the already stigmatized , vulnerable migrants .

So far , gates have sealed off 16 villages in the sprawling southern suburbs , where migrants are attracted to cheaper rents and in some villages outnumber permanent residents 10 to one .
“ In some ways , this is like the conflict between Americans and illegal immigrants in the States .
The local residents feel threatened by the influx of migrants , ” Huang Youqin , an associate professor of geography at the University at Albany in New York who has studied gating and political control in China , said in an e-mail .
“ The risk is that the government can control people ’s private life if it wants to . ”

The Queen has been forced to sell one of her country estates , raising almost £ 1 m in cash and heightening concerns over the scale of the financial crisis sweeping her investments and crumbling palaces .
Hadley Hall , a 16th - century listed farmhouse set in 50 acres of Cheshire countryside , was last night auctioned off by the Duchy of Lancaster ; the Queen 's national property portfolio which provides the monarch with a private income .
The royal sale comes on the eve of the publication of the Duchy 's accounts which next week will reveal the extent of the damage done to her private wealth by combined effects of the recession and the credit crunch .
Separate accounts published by the Palace this month showed how the Queen 's reserve of public cash , saved to pay her rising staff bills and fund her role as head of state , had fallen from £ 35 m to £ 1 m in the past 10 years , forcing her to go cap in hand to the Treasury for an increase to the Civil List .
Money raised by the Duchy of Lancaster is mostly used to finance her private affairs and businesses .
The Civil List and parliamentary grants pay for her role as head of state .
But critics say it is time the Queen used her vast private wealth to pay off her public debts , including a £ 40 m bill for the maintenance of Buckingham Palace and her other occupied palaces .
Last year the value of the Duchy of Lancaster , comprising 46,000 acres across England and Wales , fell by a fifth , or £ 75 m , to £ 322 m .
Lord Shuttleworth , the chairman of the Duchy 's council , said in the Duchy report that the Queen 's private estates had " suffered a substantial fall in the capital value " and he warned that the Queen 's income would not be immune from the recession .
" In the year ahead , it will be hard to maintain , let alone grow , the income with slow take - up for empty commercial space and a heightened risk of tenant business failure . "
The Duchy invests its funds in agricultural , residential , commercial and financial portfolios .
Last year almost £ 15 m was taken out of the financial portfolio in a defensive move and to pay for property refurbishments and new buildings .
The four - bedroom Hadley Hall near the Shropshire border with Cheshire needs renovating but retains period features such as a sweeping oak staircase , inglenook fireplace and oak - panelled wall on the first floor .
There are also two outbuildings next to the main house with scope for conversion .
These include a Dutch barn and traditional brick building that could be turned into a detached house or used for office space , stables or storage .
In addition , the Duchy is selling two lots of agricultural land covering a further 16 and 33 acres , with guide prices of £ 90,000 and £ 150,000 respectively , which would be suitable for farming or horses .
Ahead of the auction last night , Ben Legget , of auctioneers Denton Clark , said there had been huge interest in the sale of the " very unusual property " which had been previously let to one of the Queen 's tenant farmers .
" It needs a great deal of modernisation and possible alteration , " he said .
" It needs new wiring , central heating , plumbing and a new bathroom .
It will probably have to be a cash buyer who has somewhere else to live while the work is being carried out . "
A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said the Duchy had a policy of consolidating its estates and disposing of peripheral assets .
" Hadley Hall is located on a peripheral estate and is therefore designated for future sale , " said the spokeswoman .
" The sale will provide further capital for re-investment into the Duchy portfolio .
The Queen does not have any right to either the capital or the capital gains deriving from The Duchy of Lancaster , which is in effect a private portfolio of land and property assets held in trust and providing a private income for the reigning Sovereign . "
Her Majesty 's finances :
The mystery of the sovereign 's wealth funds
A recent analysis of the Queen 's wealth showed that she holds assets worth £ 17bn in trust for the nation .
But access to these treasures is restricted by hundreds of years of obfuscation over what the Queen owns as sovereign and what she , as Elizabeth Windsor , owns personally .
While her private income is derived from a mixture of a portfolio of stocks and shares invested by the Bank of England Nominees and the drawings from the ancient estate of the Duchy of Lancaster , her public income is provided by the Government under the terms of the Civil List and parliamentary grants for travel , communications and the upkeep of the royal palaces .
The main areas of confusion focus on her " grey wealth " : ambiguities surrounding the ownership of large parts of her estates which she holds in name alone , such as the Duchy of Lancaster and the Crown Estates .
Constitutional experts argue that hundreds of years of history have helped to muddle the issue of royal title .
But ultimately , such questions may have to be settled in the courts .
Only by dividing the Queen 's property and income into properly defined categories – private wealth , sovereign wealth and grey wealth – would it be possible to finally work out what she is actually worth and what parts of her property the nation can claim as its own .
This would give Parliament a firm basis from which to debate the issue of the funding of the Royal Family and the many treasures it owns on the people 's behalf .
This would appear particularly relevant today as the Queen 's annual earnings , public subsidies and the cashflow of the Royal Family business have come under increasing strain over the past decade .
So what else could she sell ?
The Royal Train
It costs the public on average £ 52,000 every time the train leaves the sidings .
Could fetch a few million if a railway buff or museum took an interest .
Collections
The Queen has in her personal possession a wine portfolio worth £ 2 m , 800 medals ( including the first Victoria Cross , which was never issued ) worth £ 2 m , cars ( including a 1900 Daimler Mail Phaeton ) worth £ 7 m and an inherited stamp collection believed to be worth up to £ 100 m and including a £ 2 m Mauritian twopenny .
( Values from 2002 ) .
Private homes
When Edward VIII abdicated , George VI had to buy both Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham House in Norfolk , so that they would remain retreats for the Royal Family .
These are the Queen 's private homes and unlike Buckingham Palace , which is held in trust for the nation , could be put up for public sale .
In 2002 they were estimated to have a combined value of £ 60 m .

Has the leader of Italy ’s government revealed how the global community plans to handle Iran ?
That ’s entirely possible , according to a report from Israel which cites Silvio Berlusconi as telling reporters at the G8 summit in Toronto , “ Iran is not guaranteeing a peaceful production of nuclear power , [ so ] the members of the G8 are worried and believe absolutely that Israel will probably react preemptively . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He added that the G8 nations “ absolutely believe ” Israel will attack Iran , according to Haaretz .
The claim comes on the same day that the top spy in the United States accused Iran of having nuclear material for two bombs , provided the uranium is further enriched to weapons grade .
The process , the CIA said , would likely take at least a couple years .
Even Russia , which has traditionally been an ally of Iran ’s civilian nuclear power program , joined the U.S. in condemning the alleged nuclear weapons ambitions .
It is exceptionally rare that the Kremlin publicly comments on a CIA statement .
“ This information has to be checked but such information is always worrying and all the more so because the international community does not recognize the Iranian nuclear program as transparent , ” Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said .
“ We are profoundly concerned by Iran ’s continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , ” a G8 joint statement read .

Earlier this month the United Nations passed stronger economic sanctions against Iran at the United States ’ behest .
Russia supported the measures , drawing a rebuke from Tehran .
Iran continues to insist its nuclear enrichment efforts are purely for electricity generation .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan has been summoned to Washington to explain derogatory comments about President Obama and his colleagues , administration officials said Tuesday .
Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who publicly apologized Tuesday for using “ poor judgment ” in an interview in Rolling Stone magazine , has been ordered to attend the monthly White House meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan in person Wednesday rather than over a secure video teleconference , according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .
He ’ll be expected to explain his comments to Obama and top Pentagon officials , these officials said .
Mr. Obama has the authority to fire Gen. McChrystal .
His predecessor , Gen. David McKiernan , was sacked on grounds that the military needed “ new thinking and new approaches ” in Afghanistan .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Gen. McChrystal made “ a significant mistake ” and used poor judgment in remarks to a magazine reporter .
Mr. Gates said the general has apologized to him .
According to a Pentagon statement Mr. Gates also has recalled Gen. McChrystal to Washington to discuss the matter in person .
That ’s on top of the White House summons that Gen. McChrystal appear there Wednesday .
The Pentagon said McChrystal will hold a separate meeting with Mr. Gates .
Mr. Gates ’ statement said nothing about whether Gen. McChrystal should keep his job .
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen has told Gen. McChrystal of his “ deep disappointment ” over the article , a spokesman said .
The article in this week ’s Rolling Stone depicts Gen.
McChrystal as a lone wolf on the outs with many important figures in the Obama administration and unable to persuade even some of his own soldiers that his strategy can win the war .
The interview describes Gen. McChrystal , 55 , as “ disappointed ” in his first Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama .
The article says that although Gen. McChrystal voted for Mr. Obama , the two failed to connect from the start .
Mr. Obama appointed Gen. McChrystal to lead the Afghan effort in May 2009 .
Last fall , though , Mr. Obama called Gen. McChrystal on the carpet for speaking too bluntly about his desire for more troops .
“ I found that time painful , ” Gen. McChrystal said in the article , on newsstands Friday .
“ I was selling an unsellable position . ”
Mr. Obama agreed to dispatch an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan only after months of study that many in the military found frustrating .
And the White House ’s troop commitment was coupled with a pledge to begin bringing them home in July 2011 , in what counterinsurgency strategists advising Gen. McChrystal regarded as an arbitrary deadline .
In Kabul on Tuesday , Gen. McChrystal issued a statement saying : “ I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his national security team , and for the civilian leaders and troops fighting this war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome . ”
“ I extend my sincerest apology for this profile , ” the statement said .
“ It was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and should never have happened . ”
Adm. Mullen talked with Gen. McChrystal about the article Monday night , Capt . John Kirby , Adm . Mullen ’s spokesman said .
In a 10 - minute conversation , the chairman “ expressed his deep disappointment in the piece and the comments ” in it , Kirby said .
The Rolling Stone profile , titled “ The Runaway General , ” emerged from several weeks of interviews and travel with Gen. McChrystal ’s tight circle of aides this spring .
In the interview , Gen. McChrystal he said he felt betrayed by the man the White House chose to be his diplomatic partner , Ambassador Karl Eikenberry .
If Mr. Eikenberry had the same doubts , Gen. McChrystal said he never expressed them until a leaked internal document threw a wild card into the debate over whether to add more troops last November .
In the document , Mr. Eikenberry said Afghan President Hamid Karzai was not a reliable partner for the counterinsurgency strategy McChrystal was hired to execute .
Gen. McChrystal accused the ambassador of giving himself cover .
“ Here ’s one that covers his flank for the history books , ” Gen. McChrystal told the magazine .
“ Now , if we fail , they can say ‘ I told you so . ’ ”
Caitlin Hayden , spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Kabul , said Mr. Eikenberry and Gen. McChrystal “ are fully committed to the president ’s strategy and to working together as one civilian - military team . ”
Gen . McChrystal has a history of drawing criticism , despite his military achievements .
In June 2006 President George W. Bush congratulated Gen. McChrystal for his role in the operation that killed Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq .
As head of the special operations command , Gen. McChrystal ’s forces included the Army ’s clandestine counterterrorism unit , Delta Force .
He drew criticism for his role in the military ’s handling of the friendly fire shooting of Army Ranger Pat Tillman — a former NFL star — in Afghanistan .
An investigation at the time found that Gen. McChrystal was “ accountable for the inaccurate and misleading assertions ” contained in papers recommending that Tillman get a Silver Star award .
Gen .
McChrystal acknowledged he had suspected several days before approving the Silver Star citation that Tillman might have died by fratricide , rather than enemy fire .
He sent a memo to military leaders warning them of that , even as they were approving Tillman ’s Silver Star .
Still , he told investigators he believed Tillman deserved the award .
This week ’s development comes as criminal investigators are said to be examining allegations that Afghan security firms have been extorting as much as $ 4 million a week from contractors paid with U.S. tax dollars and then funneling the spoils to warlords and the Taliban , according to a U.S. military document .
The payments are intended to ensure safe passage through dangerous areas they control .
The payments reportedly end up in insurgent hands through a $ 2.1 billion Pentagon contract to transport food , water , fuel and ammunition to American troops stationed at bases across Afghanistan .

The transatlantic smackdown is getting vicious , as Angela Merkel makes a point to demonstrate her refusal to follow Obama 's policies before a business audience in Berlin .
As Bloomberg reports , " Chancellor Angela Merkel championed German export strength as “ the right thing ” for her country , spurning President Barack Obama ’s call to boost private spending as both leaders prepare for Group of 20 talks .
Merkel , addressing a business audience in Berlin today , said she told Obama in a phone call that cutting government debt is “ absolutely important for us , ” exposing a second point of contention ahead of the June 26 - 27 G - 20 summit in Canada . "
It appears Germany 's chancellor is actually prudently thinking ahead after realizing that the recent bailout of Europe has massively angered potential voters , cost her parliamentary majority , and absent damage control , her career would come to a premature end .
If that means openly mocking the pinnacle of Keynesian insanity these days , Washington D.C. , so be it .
It is strange that our own president has yet not realized his own political career will be very short unless he follows in Merkel 's footsteps .
Instead , he and the Fed will melt the market up to unprecedented highs in the months leading to the mid-term elections in hopes that this will presumably indicte just how strong the US economy is , even as fresh new millions in the GoM find themselves unemployed courtesy of some salt water content in the oily gulf .
Perhaps Orszag is much smarter than people give him credit for : surely his pitchfork avoidance skills will come in very handy when the tide finally turns .
More from Bloomberg :
Reducing the budget deficit by 10 billion euros ( $ 12 billion ) per year “ wo n’t put a brake on the world ’s economic growth , ” Merkel said , relating what she told Obama yesterday .
Germans are more likely to spend money if they feel the government “ is taking precautions ” to ensure solid finances , she said .
Four days before world leaders meet in Toronto , Germany is heading for conflict with the rest of the G - 20 over tighter financial regulation , a banking levy and U.S. calls to boost growth rather than cut debt .
The G - 20 must “ safeguard and strengthen ” the economic recovery and promote “ global demand growth that avoids the imbalances of the past , ” Obama said in a June 16 letter to fellow G - 20 leaders .
He expressed concern about “ heavy reliance on exports by some countries , ” which he did n’t name .
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner called on June 5 for “ stronger domestic demand growth ” in European countries like Germany that have trade surpluses .
The upcoming G - 20 meeting will likely be very contentious :
Merkel said on June 11 that she expects to have a “ hard time ” from fellow leaders at the G - 20 meeting , where Germany and France are leading Europe ’s push for a global commitment to impose bank levies and a tax on financial transactions .
The G - 20 faces a test of unity on the banking levy , a German government official said earlier today , warning that leaders can either pull together or split into two camps over the tax .
The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity .
And the punchline :
Obama ’s appeal “ is n’t anything that goes against what we are doing , ” Merkel told reporters yesterday .
“ If we do n’t get onto a path of sustainable economic growth but have rather a growth bubble , then if the next crisis comes we wo n’t be able to pay for it . ”
How long before our own " elected " leaders realize they should follow the will of the people , not the recommendations of economic advisers who have a 2 year shelf life ?

Stop Canned Hunting
From native deer and bears to African Lions and rhinos , animals are slaughtered , usually at point blank range in a cage , to become a trophy head on a mantle with no chance to defend themselves .
The animals are locked in cages with no room to run , to await their deaths by unsportman like people who feel powerful for killing a defenseless animal .
An example of a brochure from a canned hunting ranch in Michigan : Charges $ 350 and up for a Corsican ram , $ 450 for a Russian boar , $ 750 and up for a blackbuck antelope , $ 3,000 for a buffalo , and $ 5,500 for a trophy elk .
The brochure also says any exotic animals not listed are available upon request .
Please , help stop this disgusting act of animal slaughter .

Cage once took hallucinogenic magic mushrooms with his cat after the feline mistakenly ate a handful .
The Oscar - winner had stashed a bag of the psychedelic fungi in his fridge and was shocked when his pet Lewis pulled the door open and munched on the mushrooms .
So Cage decided to join in - and he and Lewis then spent hours staring at each other in his bedroom .
He tells U.S. host David Letterman , " I had a bag of mushrooms in my refrigerator .
My cat used to sneak into the refrigerator and eat them .
The cat ate them voraciously , so I thought what the heck , I better do it with him .
" I remember lying on my bed for hours and Lewis was on the desk across my bed and we just stared at each other for hours - not moving , just staring at each other , and I had no doubt that he was my brother .
" But having said that I do n't do that anymore .
And you know what , later in life when I was completely not doing any of that , I know he said ' Hi ' to me . "

Sadly , Sci ’s home laptop died another little death last night .
While Le Petit Mort might indeed feel great to my laptop , the sudden loss of function was pretty rough on Sci .
While Mr. S attempts to work his super magic on the issue , Sci ’s post for today comes to you via Ruby , Sci ’s intrepid little netbook .
Everyone wave hello to Ruby , and hope she can keep herself together long enough to get this thing written .
What this also means is that Sci will be unable to provide any interesting pictures until she is capable of getting to her other computer in the AM .
She will do her best to paint a picture of this for you in your mind .
First …allow Sci into your mind .
MY GOD YOU HAVE A DIRTY MIND !!!!
* takes shower *
Ok , let ’s just try and paint a picture instead .
Banasr and Duman .
“ Glial loss in the prefrontal cortex is sufficient to induce depressive - like behaviors ” Biological Psychiatry , 2008 .
Now picture a rat .
One very sad , depressed little rat .
Now look at it ’s brain .
What do you think you see ?
Do you see glial loss ?
Well yes , perhaps … you do .
EDIT : Now with PICTURES !!!
So you can forget all that stuff up there .
Also it ’s free on Pubmed so you can find the pics anyway .
For some time now , scientists who study depression have noticed that there is cell loss in the brains of depressed patients .
Of course , what scientists see in humans is a reduction in brain volume in patients with depression , but does that mean that neurons are being lost ?
Neuronal connections ?
And what about those little cells on the side ?
What about the GLIA ?!
Glia have been something of a black box to scientists until recently .
At first , we thought they were just support cells , helping with reuptake and metabolism , forming myelin sheaths to allow for quick transmission of information , and giving neurons the supportive environment that they needed to thrive .
But is that really ALL they do ?
After all , glia outnumber neurons 3 to 2 !
( Oh hey , look I rhymed ! )
And it turns out that glia may have important roles in helping to control neurotransmission , though as of right now , scientists are n’t at all sure how they do it .
Now , scientists DO know that both glia and neuronal density is lower in patients with depression .
The question is , are the decreases in glia themselves important ?
Or are they only important in the context of the neurons they support ?
So in an effort to get at this question ( Sci will go on to whether they really GOT at this question in the end ) , the scientists took a bunch of rats .
They then did three different things to them :
1 ) They had the rats undergo a chronic , unpredictable stress .
These are 10 different mild stressors that are given several times a day for a while .
You ’d be surprised what stresses out a rat , it includes things like tipping the cage one way or the other , raising or lowering the temperature , turning the lights on and off , strobe lights , taking the food away for a few hours , stuff like that .
2 ) They used the toxin L - Alpha - Aminoadipic Acid ( L - AAA ) to selectively get rid of astrocytes , a specific kind of glial cell , in the prefrontal cortex .
This would selectively block the function of astrocytes for a few days .
3 ) They used another toxin , Ibotenic acid , which hits only NEURONS , as opposed to one that hits glia .
This would divide out the effects of the neurons in depression vs the ones in the glia .
And here ’s what they came up with :
1 ) They found that the chronically stressed rats had LESS GLIA than unstressed rats .
This meant that the stress itself reduced the glia .
These rats also displayed behaviors that scientists look at to characterize depression .
They drank less sucrose and took longer to approach a tasty bit of food .
They even did n’t swim as much in the forced swim test .
The depressive like behaviors correlated with a decrease in glia .
Here , you can see the decrease in glia cells following the stress .
And here you can see a decrease in sucrose drinking , and increases in the latency to feed on something tasty in a new environment , increases in helpless float during the forced swim test , and increases in active avoidance of other rats .
2 ) They found that getting rid of astrocytes using L - AAA gave the same behavioral effects as the chronic stress procedure .
The rats drank less sucrose and swam less , showing depressive like behaviors .
These rats were n’t stressed , they were just missing glia .
Here you can see the changes in the depressive like behaviors when the glia are deleted .
3 ) This was a test where they infused a neurotoxin to just delete neurons rather than glia .
This time , they DIDN ’T get any depressive behaviors , which suggests that the depressive behaviors seen above were entirely the result of the deletion of the astrocytes , NOT a deletion of the neurons !
And HERE you can see the ibotenate ( which makes Sci think of IOCAINE ) , had no effect on depressive behaviors , indicating that neuron loss was n’t to blame .
Also , IOCAINE !
So what does this all mean ?
Well , it could mean that the important loss in depression is loss of the glia , not loss of the neurons .
The neurons ARE lost , but that could be because of loss of the glia , which means loss of a neuronal support network .
Sci thinks this paper is a nifty little bit of research .
It ’d be interesting to see if all models of depression cause a loss of glia , and it ’d ALSO be interesting to see if antidepressants INCREASE levels of glia .
We know that antidepressants increase levels of neurons , but do they also increase levels of glia ?
Would increasing glia be more effective than neurons ?
I think more work is needed .
Sigh…every time you think you ’re getting a handle on the brain , it just gets more complicated .
First neurons , then neurotransmission , now GLIA ?!

Much organically bound carbon is deposited on inland lake bottoms .
A portion remains in the sediment , sometimes for thousands of years , while the rest is largely broken down to carbon dioxide and methane , which are released into the atmosphere .
Swedish researchers have shown that carbon retention by sediment is highly temperature - sensitive and that a warmer climate would result in increased carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere .
The study is published in the current issue of the journal Nature .
Particles of different kinds -- including microscopic algae , other plankton and humus from surrounding land areas -- are continuously deposited on lake bottoms .
The breakdown of a portion of this matter by bacteria in the sediment contributes significantly to atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Lake sediment nevertheless constitutes an important " carbon sink , " serving to store -- sometimes for a very long time -- a significant portion of the carbon - containing material that does not decompose .
To date , it has been unclear to what extent organic , carbon - containing material remains on lake bottoms , as opposed to being broken down .
A group of researchers under the leadership of Professor Lars Tranvik at the Department of Limnology at Uppsala University has found a strong connection between the carbon dioxide production of lake sediment and bottom - water temperature .
" What we have discovered is that a very similar temperature - dependence relationship holds for a wide range of lake - sediment types , " says doctoral student Cristian Gudasz , who was responsible for data collection and evaluation .
" Temperature affects carbon - dioxide production in much the same way regardless of a lake 's nutrient content and geographic location and the chemical composition of the sediment . "
The discovery of a broadly robust temperature - dependence relationship set the stage for an investigation of the effect of temperature on lake sediment in the boreal forest zone that runs through Eurasia and North America and contains millions of lakes .
The annual rate at which bound carbon is deposited as sediment in the lakes of the boreal zone will fall by 4 - 27 per cent , depending on which climate forecasts are borne out , over the next hundred years .
The production of carbon dioxide by lake sediment will increase correspondingly , resulting in higher levels of emissions to the atmosphere .
It is becoming increasingly clear that inland water systems play an important role in the global carbon cycle , in spite of the fact that they only cover 3 percent of the land area of the Earth .
The study under consideration demonstrates how the role of inland water systems can be expected to change in response to climate change .
The project was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Linköping University within the scope of a major research undertaking focusing on the effects of environmental change on lake ecosystems and financed by Formas and the Swedish Research Council .

If you 've been reading Mother Jones lately , you 've heard about BP 's stranglehold on media access in the Gulf , which has included preventing reporters from visiting oil - soaked public beaches and barring its spill cleanup workers from talking to the press .
Now , one of BP 's ex-media enforcers is speaking out .
Former BP contractor Adam Dillon went public last Friday , telling a local news station in New Orleans that he was fed up with BP 's handling of the spill response , not least of all its information clampdown .
In an interview with Mother Jones this week , Dillon , who claims he was fired for raising concerns about the cleanup with his bosses , elaborated on his experiences in the Gulf and vented his frustrations with BP .
A retired Army special operations soldier who lives in Wilmington , N.C. ( and is running for sheriff in his home county ) , Dillon first worked management for BP on the beaches of Louisiana .
In June , a camera crew caught him chasing reporters off a Grand Isle beach .
Dillon was hired by O'Brian 's Response Management Group , which was in turn contracted by BP to hire an army of subcontractors to aid in various aspects of the the spill response , from cleanup workers to security guards to communications specialists .
Based on his behind - the - scenes view of the spill response , he describes a cleanup effort in disarray , marred by unclear lines of authority and shoddy communications among the numerous players involved - from BP and its litany of contractors and subcontractors to the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies .
" There 's just so many moving parts and moving pieces , " he says .
" The right hand is just not talking to the left . "
In BP 's attempts to control the flow of information , Dillon says , it has largely compounded these problems . "
The Climate DeskBut while Dillon says the company is bungling many aspects of the spill response , he notes that it has done a reasonably good job in one area : blocking the media from seeing the worst of the disaster in Grand Isle , a beach on a barrier island off Louisiana 's coast .
" There was all kinds of stuff they did n't want the media to see , " he says , describing areas thick with oil that were off - limits to journalists .
" They kept it very strict what they wanted the media not to see , and what they wanted them to see .
Where the media was actually given access to really was kind of mundane . "
While BP has insisted publicly that it has not prevented spill workers from talking to the press , Dillon says company officials made it perfectly clear to contractors that they would lose their jobs if they spoke to reporters .
" There are people down on that beach that are begging to talk to reporters , because they 're having pay issues , having problems , " says Dillon of the workers in Grand Isle .
" Any of those laborers that are down there are being told behind closed doors that if they talk to the media , they 'll be fired . "
To enforce its media blockade , Dillon says , the company turned to its security force , largely made up of guys like him , ex-military and law enforcement personnel .
" They were given orders to herd the media away , " he says , and they followed those instructions just like he did .
" They did n't know the reason behind it -- they were just told keep the media away from [ the cleanup workers ] . "
He adds , " That 's a First Amendment violation ...
You can't keep the media away .
It 's a public beach .
We were n't under Martial Law . "
After working on Grand Isle , Dillon was transferred to the Unified Command Center in Houma , La. , the hub of BP and federal response activities , to work on cleanup logistics .
He claims he was fired last week " because he was seen as a threat to superiors . "
( Stephanie Hebert , a spokeswoman at the Unified Command Center , confirms he was a contractor there but declined to comment on his dismissal . )
Specifically , he says BP axed him after taking photos of what he described as " equations on dispersants " and calling these pictures to the attention of his bosses .
He says he was " confined and interrogated for almost an hour " about what he saw , and within 12 hours was dismissed from the command center .
Dillon declined to elaborate on the dispersant issue when we spoke , but pledged to avenge his termination by calling attention to BP 's mishandling of the response .
" They screwed up royally when they let me go , " he says .
" I was down there to do the right thing , to clean up .
They just do n't know who they 're messing with . "

Almost immediately after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , BP management realised that it would be vulnerable to questions about whether cost - cutting contributed to safety failures .
The company went on the offensive , with Hayward asserting straight away that it was not responsible for the lapses of its contractors – despite the fact that the oil giant had designed the blown - out well , approved the rig and had supervisors on board with the ultimate say on how it was drilled .
" This was not our accident .
It was not our people , our systems or our processes , " Hayward insisted .

In the year 4000 , in the William Hartnell ( First Doctor ) episode " The Daleks Master Plan , " the Daleks conspire to conquer Earth 's densely - populated solar system .
Their scheme involves treachery at the highest levels , and a weapon capable of destroying the very fabric of time .
The story of the Steampunk Daleks starts where one Dalek scout ship headed for Earth suffers a engine core breach ( possibly due to simple malfunction or to sabotauge ) and disrupts the space - time continuum around it .
Falling through time , it is propelled backward 2000 years , where it crashes on the Earth 's surface in 1880 .
With practically all of their advanced technology destroyed or damaged beyond repair , the Daleks must rebuild their forces using the technology available to them added to their knowledge of future tech .
Once there , they will conquer Earth while it is still in its Victorian age , making the goals of their future kin all the more easier .
All goes well until a wheezing sound is heard , and a box materializes out of nowhere ...... and no , the Doctor who stops them is NOT Nine or Ten .
While doing this steampunk piece , I kept in mind this little exchange between the Cybermen and the Daleks in " Doomsday : " Cybermen : " Our species are similar , though your design is in - elegant .
" Dalek : " Daleks have no concept of elegance !!" Cybermen : " This is obvious .
" Not only did I think that was kind of funny , but it gave an interesting insight into each race : the Cybermen are obviously very proud of their design , and elegance and style is an important factor in how they look .
Daleks , on the other hand , have themselves claimed to have " no concept of elegance , " so they apparently do n't care what they look like , as long as it works .
I kept this in mind during these drawings ; whereas the Steampunk Cyberman is very artistically crafted with fine decorative details ( for example , the fancy smokestack tops ) , the Steampunk Dalek looks like a high school science fair reject ( its smokestack just has a simple , functional tip ) , with all sorts of stuff just crammed onto it .
Anyway ... enjoy !!

The Whale Beach luxury residence where a rendezvous took place .
Jessica * was the 18 - year - old daughter of a friend , who never knew her father and dreamed of working with animals .
Their friendship blossomed as they spent mornings training his prize German shepherds .
He gave her a $ 20,000 dog .
For three months , they had sex repeatedly en route to dog shows and at a Whale Beach mansion where Elle Macpherson has stayed .
In August last year she accused him of rape .
It was - and remains - a case of his word against hers .
Robert lost a job with the Catholic Church , from which he had earned more than $ 100,000 over the past three years , and was told he could no longer worship there .
i Phone
The investigating officer , Detective Senior Constable Karen Hennessy , seized the $ 20,000 dog , saying it was relevant to the investigation .
The only thing standing between Robert and five sentences of up to 14 years were the messages from her on his iPhone , which he had deleted to conceal the relationship .
Robert 's lawyer , John Gooley from Collins & Thompson solicitors , commissioned Gary Coulthart , a former covert operations policeman and ICAC surveillance expert , to plumb the depths of Robert 's iPhone .
Mr Coulthart retrieved more than 300 deleted texts and phone calls from the alleged victim , some of which appeared to undermine the allegations .
Prosecutors later withdrew the charges and have been ordered to pay $ 30,056 of Robert 's legal costs .
'' Without the ability of Coulthart to drag the content out , a man 's life may have been ruined , '' Mr Gooley said . '' [ iPhone evidence is ] a bit like DNA .
It can work both ways . ''
From a cohort of about 20 people in Australia with the equipment and know - how to do this sort of forensic work , Mr Coulthart said it was the first case he had seen in which an iPhone investigation commissioned by a defence lawyer has led to charges being dropped .
'' Usually [ when ] you get engaged by the defence and they say , ' This person says they did n't do it ' , you find evidence that they have done it , '' he said .
Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones since 2007 but few users know how much information they collect .
The keyboard logging cache means an expert can retrieve anything typed on it for up to 12 months .
Its internal mapping and ' ' geotags ' ' attached to photos indicate where a user has been .
An iPhone has up to 32 gigabytes of data that can be ' ' imaged ' ' or decoded with the right equipment , Mr Coulthart said , even if it has been deleted .
Robert wants police to investigate Jessica for causing a false investigation and is considering civil action against the police and the church .
'' It 's put huge pressure on my home life and on my business , '' he said .
'' I had to go through the denigration of being charged and I 've never been in trouble in my life . ''
Jessica did not want to comment .
Loading
A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said it withdrew the charges because the victim did not want to proceed and that '' the brief of evidence had not been given to the ODPP at the time this matter was withdrawn ' ' .
A police spokeswoman said that , for operational reasons , it was inappropriate to comment except to say that the alleged victim had told police she did not wish to pursue the matter .
* Not their real names
Omar Khadr , shown in this courtroom artist 's sketch , attends a hearing at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in January 2009 .
The federal government will appeal the court ruling that ordered it to remedy the breach of Canadian Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr 's constitutional rights .
In a statement Monday , Justice Minister Rob Nicholson announced the government would take a decision by Federal Court Justice Russel Zinn last week to the Federal Court of Appeal .
The statement said the case " raises important issues concerning the Crown prerogative over foreign affairs . "
In a separate letter to Zinn on Monday , government lawyers also said they were seeking a suspension of all deadlines to allow the Appeal Court to determine the government 's motion .
In his ruling , Zinn said Ottawa had not met the standard set by the Supreme Court of Canada earlier in 2010 when it declared Khadr 's rights had been violated at a U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The Toronto - born Khadr , now 23 , has been held at the prison since he was captured in 2002 , at the age of 15 , during a firefight in Afghanistan with U.S. soldiers .
He faces five charges in connection with the incident , the most serious being murder of an American special forces soldier .
Khadr faces a maximum life sentence if convicted .
The top court noted that CSIS officials obtained evidence from Khadr under " oppressive circumstances " during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay in 2003 , and then shared that evidence with U.S. officials .
But in his statement , Nicholson noted the Supreme Court also ruled it would not be appropriate for justices " to give direction as to the diplomatic steps necessary " to address the breaches .
Khadr 's legal team in Canada has tried — through the courts — to force the Conservative government to demand Khadr be repatriated .
He is the lone Western citizen remaining in detention at Guantanamo Bay .
The government has so far refused to make any such request to U.S. officials , insisting it must respect the legal process in place .
Nicholson 's statement reiterated the government 's position that Khadr " faces very serious charges " and continues to receive consular support .
One of Khadr 's Canadian lawyers said his legal team was not surprised by the government 's decision to appeal but said he doubted the Appeal Court could reach a decision before Khadr 's military trial begins on Aug. 10 .
" The problem is we 're extremely short on time , " Nathan Whitling told CBC News in an interview from Edmonton .
In the meantime , he said Khadr 's team is prepared to file a motion calling for the government to be found in contempt of Zinn 's order .
" That 's what we can do , and that 's what we will do , " he said .
Khadr to boycott trial
The decision comes on the same day as Khadr told a U.S. military judge in Guantanamo Bay that he intends to boycott his trial in August , saying there was no chance he would receive a fair trial .
" I 'm going to get 30 years no matter what , " said Khadr .
Khadr fired his U.S. civilian lawyers this week and sought to represent himself at the trial .
He also tried to fire his court - appointed military lawyer but the presiding judge denied that request .
Far too often our government agencies , elected officials , and our legal system favor the powerful and the wealthy , protecting private profit while ignoring the public good .
We can and must challenge this bias and force these systems to work instead to protect our environment and defend the less powerful ; to help achieve a fair and sustainable society that is essential to our future survival .

No waiter has ever looked so happy .
None who 's ever waited on me , at least .
In fact , a moment ago , this same guy did wait on me .
But he was n't this waiter then .
Now , after noticing Mexican actress
Ana de la Reguera sitting across from me , he looks like he just strapped the sun to his face .
Alex Freund
She notices his smile ( it 'd be hard not to ) and the one she gives back to him is neither proud nor perfunctory .
She 's genuinely pleased to be appreciated .
For what , it 's hard to say .
He could be familiar with her work — the countless Mexican movies and telenovelas ; the HBO Latino series Capadocia , which was nominated for three International Emmys ; 2006 's Nacho Libre , in which she plays a meek nun with a knack for subtle glances and a face that manages to draw attention away from Jack Black 's absurd showboating .
He could be one of the four people who saw her in the Bruce Willis / Tracy Morgan flop , Cop Out .
Or he could just be struck by what he sees .
Alex Freund
De la Reguera is the opposite of Cinco de Mayo : huge in Mexico , and recognized by only a few people here .
When the thirty - three - year - old did Nacho Libre , her first American movie , Jack Black could n't have been bigger — a few years after School of Rock , on the heels of King Kong .
But when the two went out in Oaxaca , near where they were filming , she was swarmed while he was ignored .
Here , in the bar at the London hotel in New York City , a few blocks from the huge , touristy crowds of Times Square , she 's just another patron .
No one , with the exception of a Mexican actor who greeted her on the way in , seems to recognize her at all .
Alex Freund
That will likely change this fall , when she stars with Danny McBride in the second season of HBO 's foul and funny Eastbound & Down .
After leaving North Carolina at the end of season one , Kenny Powers ( McBride ) — a racist , homophobic former pro baseball player — moves to Mexico to start over .
" [ Mexico ] is kind of like a Third World country [ to him ] , " de la Reguera says .
" And if he feels like he 's king in America , imagine how he feels there . "
He soon falls for de la Reguera 's character , a lounge singer who covers pop songs translated into Spanish and who has , as de la Reguera says , " a big asset . "
She explains : " He called himself a boob man in the first season , but now ... "
She trails off as if she wo n't qualify , as if it were obvious what he'd like about her .
It is .
De la Reguera grew up in Veracruz , a beach town where her mom still lives and she keeps an apartment .
She landed her first telenovela role at nineteen and found immediate success , doing fifteen more TV shows and movies over the span of ten years .
But the Mexican film industry is tiny — only thirty to forty movies are made each year — so four years ago she moved to Los Angeles .
" There was a period of adapting to the country , to the auditions , " she says .
" People really did n't get to know me , because they still thought maybe I do n't speak English or that I live in Mexico .
[ Plus ] , there 's much more competition . "
It was n't until last year that she started getting the roles she wants .
She got new representation , and she learned to avoid most dramas : " I 'm going to look terrible when I say this , " she says , " but they always write the Latina parts the same .
There 's a lot of roles for doctors , lawyers , or cops , and all of them ... are smart , clever , strong , but at the same time , they 're superfast talking and super ... sharp .
I 'm not interested in spending six years doing that every day of my life .
So I told my agent , just send me to comedies . "
De la Reguera is small — around five feet tall .
She 's stunning , even without makeup , in a plain black shirt , cream blazer , and jeans .
Although she apologizes for not looking prettier , there 's really no need .
While we talk , she grabs a few strands of thick brown hair that have fallen over her shoulders and fiddles with them mindlessly .
It 's a combination of innocence and sex that reminds you of Penélope Cruz or Emmanuelle Chriqui .
And while she 's not exactly funny , she is fun .
When she brings up her newest project — director Jon Favreau 's upcoming sci- fi western Cowboys & Aliens , starring Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig —
I ask her if she 's seen Iron Man 2 , also directed by Favreau and recently out in theaters .
She shakes her head , then gestures toward the recorder , smiles , and exclaims , " Yes !
Of course ! "
The most telling moment of the afternoon is the last one .
As we say goodbye , right as de la Reguera turns and starts to walk away , I notice a girl standing a few feet from her , talking with some friends .
She 's about fifteen , a tourist .
When she sees de la Reguera , her face changes .
She turns her head fully toward her for a second look .
It 's not recognition ; it 's a look of appreciation .
Like the waiter 's but less lusty .

Abortion as " Black Genocide "
An Old Scare Tactic Re-Emerges
The Public Eye | April 29 , 2010 | Printer Friendly This February , a highly provocative series of 65 billboards went up around Atlanta , which featured an African American infant and the proclamation , “ Black Children Are an Endangered Species . ”
The signs directed viewers to a website , TooManyAborted.com , created by the Radiance Foundation — a vaguely defined antiabortion and “ personal transformation ” nonprofit founded by biracial advertising executive Ryan Bomberger — with funding from Georgia Right to Life .
[ 1 ]
At the unveiling of the billboards , Georgia Right to Life Minority Outreach Director Catherine Davis explained their justification : “ Planned Parenthood ’s Negro Project , ” she said , “ is succeeding . ” [ 2 ]
She was referring to a 1939 project begun by Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger that has inspired decades of claims that family planning is a racist plan to wipe out populations of color .
It ’s an old argument , with roots in the Black Power and Black Nationalist movements .
But in recent years it has become the province of anti-abortion groups who are selectively co-opting civil rights rhetoric to present abortion and even contraception as eugenicist plots disguised as voluntary reproductive choices , which are leading to a slow “ Black genocide . ”
Margaret Sanger and Eugenics “ The argument has always been there , ” says Alex Sanger , [ 1 ] Margaret Sanger ’s grandson and the chair of the International Planned Parenthood Council — echoing other leaders who ca n’t remember a time when accusations of racism were n’t made against reproductive - rights activists .
Over the years , the name of the early twentieth - century birth - control advocate Margaret Sanger has become toxic .
Recently , when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received the Margaret Sanger Award , anti-abortion stalwart Senator Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) raised such a stir that Clinton asked Ellen Chesler , the historian and author of Woman of Valor : Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America ( 1992 ) , to submit testimony regarding Sanger ’s history to the Congressional Record .
[ 2 ]
Likewise , Gloria Feldt , the author of The War on Choice ( 2004 ) and a former president of Planned Parenthood , recalls that when Sanger was nominated for the Arizona Women ’s Hall of Fame , the debate was so heated that the Arizona legislature de-funded the entire Hall of Fame . [ 3 ]
Much of the ire comes from epic misrepresentation of Sanger ’s work , especially her ideas about eugenics , or human “ selective breeding , ” explains Alex Sanger .
“ Her discussions of eugenics are very complex and nuanced .
She said a lot of stuff that nobody at Planned Parenthood agrees with today , but she ’s also quoted as saying things she never said . ” [ 4 ]
Among the quotations frequently and incorrectly credited to Sanger is , “ More children from the fit , less from the unfit — that is the chief issue of birth control . ”
It is so widely misattributed to her that it appeared on the wall of an International Center for Photography exhibit on eugenics .
Another common offender showed up in a recent fundraising letter from Priests for Life : “ Colored people are like human weeds and have to be exterminated . ”
The historian Esther Katz , director of the Margaret Sanger Papers Project at New York University , explains that Sanger never said anything of the sort .
[ 5 ]
According to the “ Black genocide ” movement , Sanger worked in cahoots with the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis to advance a theory of White supremacy and forced sterilization .
The truth is more complicated than this caricature .
Sanger did embrace ideas about eugenics that were popular in the 1920s ; the eugenics movement offered her legitimacy , says Chesler , adding that Margaret Sanger had no choice but to engage eugenics .
It was a mainstream movement , like public health or the environment today .
It was to sanitize birth control and remove it from the taint of immorality and the taint of feminism , which was seen as an individualistic and antisocial group that addressed the needs of women only , and immoral women at that .
[ 6 ]
This was an era when President Teddy Roosevelt condemned birth control as immoral , fearful that it would lead to the “ race suicide ” of white Protestants . [ 7 ]
Like the president , most eugenicists did n’t believe in birth control and were hostile to the idea of women ’s bodily autonomy .
Sanger , conversely , derided what she called “ cradle competition ” [ 8 ] by leaders angling for higher birthrates among the White upper class and said women ’s first procreative duty was not to the state , nor their race , but to themselves .
She believed women ’s reproductive choices should be voluntary and individualistic .
Eugenics is unquestionably at odds with today ’s reproductive - rights principles , says Chesler , but Sanger was ahead of her time in an era when the majority of people believed in forced eugenic sterilization .
[ 9 ]
One of eleven children , Sanger was motivated by her experience of growing up in crowded tenements with high rates of infant and maternal mortality .
“ She believed women were natural eugenicists , ” explains Alex Sanger , “ and that birth control , which could limit the number of children and improve their quality of life , was the panacea to accomplish this . ” [ 10 ]
When Sanger began her work , Black communities were ignored by the medical establishment .
So , from early on , Sanger ’s clinics in Harlem were welcomed by esteemed black leaders of the day including W.E.B. Du Bois and Mary McLeod Bethune , the founder of the National Council of Negro Women .
In 1939 Sanger founded the Negro Project , a birth control campaign for southern Blacks .
As soon as it secured funding , the project was wrested from her control by the White men running the Birth Control Federation of America — a merger between Sanger ’s Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau and the American Birth Control League — and by Robert Seibels , the chairman of the Committee on Maternal Welfare of the South Carolina Medical Association . [ 11 ]
The new leadership dismissed Sanger ’s plan to introduce the project with a widespread educational campaign that would be run by black experts and leaders .
It was in this context that Sanger had written , “ We do n’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population , and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members . ”
Sanger meant that she did n’t want rumors to spread of nefarious intentions behind family planning [ 12 ] ( a key reason , Alex Sanger adds , why she never allowed herself to profit from her birth control innovations ) .
However , generations of activists have presented Sanger ’s remark that she did n’t want word to “ go out ” as proof that she secretly intended genocide .
Sanger had nothing to do with the project ’s implementation , and indeed , as the Margaret Sanger Papers Project holds , it was a failure , enacted without regard for Black needs and in terms that today sound blatantly racist .
Nevertheless , her early involvement is still cited by the Black genocide movement as evidence that she supported coercive programs .
In years past , says Esther Katz , these arguments spread slowly , as only zealots sought out materials like the lurid 1979 pamphlet , Margaret Sanger : Father of Modern Society , which paints Sanger as a promiscuous Nazi sympathizer . [ 13 ]
But starting in the mid-1990s , the internet enabled accusations fly farther and faster , and unsourced , unchecked material built a mountain of false allegations and attributions , with Wikipedia a key battleground .
“ It fits in with the tendency to use the Big Lie as a tool .
You can take the smallest phrase and make a whole industry out of it .
It ’s a deliberate refusal to address the complexity of our past and its figures , ” says Katz . [ 14 ]
In fact , Katz says , Sanger was among the few family planning activists who sought to partner with those Black leaders who believed uncontrolled reproduction was harming their communities .
Not all of them did .
Du Bois envisioned a “ talented tenth ” — a
Black elite made possible by family planning in poor Black communities , but Black separatist figures such as Marcus Garvey opposed birth control .
Sanger was also opposed by many mainstream churches , both Black and White .
The Catholic Church called Sanger an antisemite when she opened a clinic in a Jewish neighborhood , despite her marriage to a Jew , and alleged she was trying to eliminate the poor during the Depression , despite her own roots in urban poverty .
Of course , serious abuses sprang from the eugenics movement with which Sanger was allied , including forced or coerced sterilizations of tens of thousands of women , mostly Black or Latina .
Although Sanger opposed racially based eugenics and generally believed that sterilization should be voluntary , she made an exception in the cases of people she thought were unable to parent their children , such as the mentally ill — a position upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1927 , eight - to - one Buck v. Bell decision concerning an allegedly “ feebleminded ”
White woman .
But while this is downplayed in biographies of the judges involved , Sanger ’s association with eugenics has been so overemphasized it often eclipses her role in promoting birth control .
Reproductive rights advocates have successfully refocused population - control programs from abusive tactics such as sterilization to women ’s choices .
Yet we ’re too close historically to the abuses of eugenics to ignore them — especially since the abuses are n’t all in the past .
Most recently , in 2008 , John LaBruzzo , a Republican member of the Louisiana House , proposed paying poor women $ 1,000 to sterilize themselves .
Alex Sanger concludes that his grandmother ’s attempt “ to co-opt eugenics in a bid for respectability ” was a resounding failure , with dangerous fallout that continues to this day . [ 15 ]

Sanger and the Negro Project , " Margaret Sanger Papers Project " The Demonization of Margaret Sanger , " Margaret Sanger Papers Project Interview with author , January 14 , 2010 " Eugenics , Race , and Margaret Sanger Revisited : Reproductive Freedom for All ? , " Hypatia ( PDF ) Recent studies by the Guttmacher Institute found that abortion rates are indeed higher among women of color [ 3 ] .
African Americans , in particular , are thirteen percent of the population but account for 37 percent of all abortions .
However , Guttmacher determined , this is due to their greater incidence of unwanted pregnancies , resulting from economic inequality and poor access to contraception and education .
Nonetheless , the anti-abortion movement holds that Black and brown populations are being targeted – rather than served – by abortion providers who deliberately place clinics in inner-city , low - income neighborhoods .
For the past several years Black History Month has brought an onslaught of antiabortion activities related to this “ Black genocide ” strategy .
This year was no exception .
At the same time that the Georgia billboards appeared , White Republicans Representative Barry Loudermilk and Senator Chip Pearson introduced the so - called Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act ( SB 529 and HB1155 ) into the state ’s legislature .
The bill , which the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reports [ 4 ] was crafted to pose an immediate challenge to Roe v.
Wade before President Obama nominates a replacement for retiring Justice John Paul Stevens would criminalize race - and sex- selective abortions and has been fast - tracked through Georgia ’s legislature .
The Senate passed it on March 26 , and although the original House bill floundered in that chamber ’s special judiciary committee , SB529 quickly replaced it .
The bill , which rests on the assertion that many women are coerced into abortions as a result of race or gender bias , goes on to establish “ the offense of criminal solicitation of abortion ” and requires doctors to prove patients have not been pressured into abortion .
On April 15 , Georgia Right to Life launched a series of robo-calls that featured 2008 presidential candidate and Fox talk show host Mike Huckabee , stumping for the bill on the grounds of its “ powerful implications for the sanctity of human life nationwide . ” [ 5 ]
The Network of Politically Active Christians made a similar pitch and the bill drew national support from groups like Focus on the Family .
As the state ’s legislative session wound down in the last week of April , Republican House Speaker David Ralston planned a last - minute substitution of the bill that addressed some constitutional issues with the original , but maintained its ban on abortions performed because of the race or gender of the fetus .
[ 6 ]
Reproductive - rights advocates of color have been appalled by these campaigns , with their implicit accusation that women of color are either dupes or agents of genocide against their own people .
( Not to mention that the language of the billboards implies a tone - deaf comparison between Black children and animals . )
“ We ’re calling the bill the OB / GYN criminalization and racial discrimination act , ” says the director of the women - of - color organization SPARK Reproductive Justice NOW , Paris Hatcher . [ 7 ]
She notes that the burden of proof the bill puts on doctors would greatly impede health care delivery .
In an email campaign that has generated hundreds of complaints about the “ endangered species ” billboards to the owner of the signs , CBS Outdoors , SPARK tweaked a common refrain in the prochoice community — “ trust women ” — calling on people to “ trust Black women ” over those demonizing their decisions .
“ I think what you have here is tokenized leaders within a White movement floating an agenda , ” says Hatcher .
“ You see White organizations capitalizing off of Black bodies and the shaming and blaming of Black women . ” [ 8 ]
Civil Rights Rhetoric and " Black Genocide "
The token leaders to whom Hatcher is referring are a small but busy cadre of Black activists working in White - run anti-abortion organizations .
For example , in late 2008 , Pro-Life Unity hired a Black vice president , Samuel Mosteller , [ 9 ] and in January 2009 , after years of failed attempts to reach out to African Americans , Georgia Right to Life hired Davis to spread the word that reproductive health care providers such as Planned Parenthood have a “ mission to eliminate blacks from America . ” [ 10 ]
Most visible of these leaders is Alveda King , the niece of Martin Luther King Jr. , whose full - time position with Priests for Life was the first funded role for a “ Black genocide ” activist .
Her main strategy — and critics say her sole qualification — has been capitalizing on her uncle ’s legacy , often asking , “ How can the dream survive if we murder the children ? ” [ 11 ]
She takes frequent aim at a speech delivered on behalf of Martin Luther King Jr. by his wife , Coretta Scott King , in acceptance of the 1966 Margaret Sanger Award .
The speech includes a lament about the number of unwanted children among poor Blacks .
Alveda King suggests that Martin Luther King did n’t write the speech — to her ears , it sounds like it was written by a woman — and that his wife ’s delivery of it was due to a marital disagreement .
On Alveda King ’s website , [ 12 ] she annotates the speech with quotations from the Rev. King that she believes refute his apparent support for the birth - control movement .
Alveda King and other “ Black genocide ” spokespeople make ample use of imagery that aligns the anti-abortion cause with the Civil Rights Movement .
There is no shortage of emotionally charged analogies .
The Rev. Johnny Hunter , the president of the Life Education and Resource Network ( LEARN ) , speaks of “ womb lynchings . ” [ 13 ]
The president of LEARN ’s Northeast chapter , the Rev. Clenard Childress , who founded the website BlackGenocide.org , frequently partners with the California - based group Genocide Awareness Project , which hosts “ photo - mural ” demonstrations on university campuses , comparing abortion to the Rwandan genocide [ 14 ] .
In 2007 , 10,000 pamphlets published by the Waco , Texas - based anti-abortion group Life Dynamics Incorporated were mailed to inner-city neighborhoods to publicize an appearance by the Black right - wing radio personality , the Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson .
The pamphlets denounced “ Klan Parenthood ” and juxtaposed images of lynchings with those of aborted fetuses , under the slogan “ lynching is for amateurs . ”
Anti-abortion activists have long compared Roe v. Wade to the 1857 Dred Scott decision , which opened the territories to slavery .
They have also pointed to the Constitutional mandate to count Blacks as 3/5 of a person to show that the U.S. law has always devalued Black people — and that Roe is no different .
Their strategy now includes merging this rhetoric with fetal “ personhood ” amendment campaigns underway in eight states — and building in dozens more .
In January , the American Life League and Father Frank Pavone , the national director of Priests for Life , hosted a meeting about overturning Roe v. Wade , which focused both on recruiting supporters in Black communities and passing fetal personhood bills .
“ There ’s a lot of personhood legislation nationally , ” agrees Childress , “ and that ’s going to remind most African Americans that there was a question about our personhood with Dred Scott . ” [ 15 ]
In an email interview , Pavone said [ 16 ] that the language of the Civil Rights Movement lends itself seamlessly to the anti-abortion cause .
After visits to Martin Luther King ’s Ebenezer Baptist Church with the King family , Pavone said , “ I have thought to myself , the message is exactly right .
Nothing has to change except to include one more group of people — the unborn . ”
Pavone and Alveda King both sample civil rights language in their outreach to Black pastors , explaining that the “ beloved community ” must include the unborn , and “ that nonviolence includes nonviolence to children in the womb ” [ 17 ] — messages they ’ll further this summer through a series of “ freedom ride ” bus tours kicking off in Birmingham on April 27 , led by Alveda King and other “ Black genocide ” leaders .
The apparent success of such rhetoric has encouraged mainstream anti-abortion groups to ask their donors to support outreach to African Americans , arguing that these converts to the anti-abortion cause have the potential to revive the movement .
Last December , Pavone told his donors , “ With your help today we will help African Americans take their rightful place in the pro-life movement … men and women who know what it means to be persecuted and treated as ‘ non- persons ’ … men and women who will re-energize the movement . ” [ 18 ]
Promoting Conspiracism
In 1999 , Childress helped lead 1,500 people , mostly Black activists , on the “ Say - So ” anti-abortion march from Newark , New Jersey , to Washington , D.C. , where they laid 1,452 roses — the number of abortions black women were then having daily — on the steps of the Supreme Court .
Childress , a 2007 candidate for the New Jersey state assembly who often says that “ the most dangerous place for an African American to be is in the womb of their African American mother , ” was recruited to the anti-abortion movement by a White Catholic activist who convinced him to attend a 1994 conference featuring the Rev. Johnny Hunter . [ 19 ]
While other organizations contribute money or materials , Childress supplies bodies for protests from his 200 - member , Montclair , New Jersey , congregation , New Calvary Baptist Church .
His young “ zealots ” frequently volunteer for high - commitment activism , such as a bus trip to Birmingham in 2003 , where they crashed a mainstream Civil Rights Movement celebration , and recent trips to NAACP conventions to protest the exclusion of “ Black genocide ” concerns .
Childress is featured in Maafa 21 : Black Genocide in 21st Century America , a 2009 film produced by Mark Crutcher , a White Texan who runs Life Dynamics Incorporated — the producer of the “ Klan Parenthood ” brochures .
Maafa is a Swahili word that refers to the African holocaust of abduction and slavery .
The film argues that the maafa did n’t end with slavery but rather continues in a plot to exterminate the black population through ongoing eugenics programs created by “ wealthy white elitists . ”
Its chief villain is Planned Parenthood founder , Margaret Sanger .
“ In the African American community , if you shout conspiracy , they ’ll listen , because of the history they ’ve had in this country , ” Childress told me [ 20 ] .
“ I come from the conspiracy tone whenever I ’m speaking , especially to African Americans , so they understand you ’ll have to do some digging , you ’ll have to go beneath the veneer . ”
( Apparently using the same tactic , Alveda King dismisses the studies citing higher rates of unwanted pregnancy among Black women as the cause for high abortion rates by suggesting that Planned Parenthood intentionally distributes faulty contraception to minority teens so they ’ll need abortions .
[ 21 ] ) Childress ’s loose attitude toward historical accuracy seems representative of the broader “ Black genocide ” movement .
Thus , Maafa 21 sidesteps historical hurdles to suggest that Sanger ’s support for sterilization on mental illness grounds ( see sidebar ) was a coded effort to target Blacks ; that a eugenics movement mobilized to legalize abortion to market it to Black women ; and that the government “ hired Planned Parenthood ” to continue eugenics programs .
The film , which received financial support from Priests for Life , premiered at the United States Capitol Visitor Center last year on Juneteenth , an African American holiday marking the day the emancipation proclamation was finally enforced in Texas .
The host was the White Congressman Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) — a steadfast ally of the “ Black genocide ” cause .
Later , Alveda King and others held a screening of the film for congressional aides .
In early March , Maafa 21 was the feature presentation at the Jubilee Film Festival at the 45th anniversary of the “ Bloody Sunday ” attacks outside of Selma . [ 22 ]
The film has been shown at numerous Black churches and colleges .
In April , Childress , hosted by the Christian student group Every Nation Campus Ministries , discussed the film at Florida A&M , the largest historically Black college in the country — an event he predicts will exponentially spread his message into the Black community . [ 23 ]
In a March fundraising appeal seeking support to fill requests for the film , Crutcher claimed that 13,000 copies had already been distributed .
He triumphantly announced , “ Life Dynamics has hit pay dirt ” with Maafa 21 , as the film rages “ like a wildfire ” through the Black community .
The film , he said , is “ the stone our pro-life movement would use to bring the abortion Goliath to his knees . ”
" Black Genocide " and Health Care Reform
For close to fifteen years , the “ Black genocide ” movement has drummed up publicity by capitalizing on discussions of race or Black history in the media and promoted the posturing of White antiabortion activists laying claim to Rosa Parks ’s legacy .
But from these awkward origins , the movement has grown enormously in size and sophistication over the past year .
In January , Lou Engle , the White founder of the anti-abortion group Bound4 Life as well as of a group that campaigned to pass California ’s Proposition 8 forbidding same - sex marriage , convened a Martin Luther King Day march on a large Planned Parenthood clinic under construction in Houston , calling it an “ abortion supercenter that targets the minority community . ” [ 24 ]
The march drew prominent
White anti-abortion leaders , including the Family Research Council ’s Tony Perkins and the president of the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , Richard Land .
The stage had been set earlier in the year , as the abortion debate overwhelmed health care reform .
In mid-July , White congressional Representative Todd Tiahrt ( R- KS ) argued against President Obama ’s health care bill on “ Black genocide ” grounds , suggesting that Obama ’s mother might have aborted him if she ’d had the option of “ taxpayer - funded abortions . ” [ 25 ]
Tiahrt was backed up by a series of five op - ed essays in the conservative Washington Times , written by prominent Black leaders of the “ abortion as genocide ” cause , which urged Republicans to adopt the issue in their fight against health care reform .
At press conferences throughout the summer , Alveda King and her colleagues kept the rhetoric heated , telling the media that “ genocide is not health care . ”
In an open letter to President Obama in August , a writer for the creationist Discovery Institute implied that John Holdren , Obama ’s pick to head the Office of Science and Technology Policy , was a eugenicist targeting people of color in developing nations . [ 26 ]
Sex - and Race - Selective Abortion
At the end of February , Representative Franks upped the ante in the “ Black genocide ” debate , telling a blogger that with “ half of all black children ” being aborted , “ Far more of the African American community is being devastated by the politics of today than were devastated by the policies of slavery . ” [ 27 ]
After his statement , a lineup of leaders from the “ Black genocide ” movement came to his defense .
Alveda King declared that any critics of Franks shared “ the slave owner ’s mindset . ” [ 28 ]
Day Garder of the National Black Pro-Life Union said Franks “ should be revered as a great modern day abolitionist . ” [ 29 ]
In 2008 , Franks said , a “ Black genocide ” protest in Washington , D.C. , inspired him to sponsor a bipartisan House bill that would prohibit “ discrimination against the unborn on the basis of sex or race , and for other purposes . ” [ 30 ]
The bill , which benefited from the collaboration of “ Black genocide ” leaders like King and Childress , was reintroduced by Franks last spring as the Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2009 .
It has 42 sponsors .
Intellectuals in the anti-abortion movement have long counseled linking abortion with female infanticide and sex- selective abortion , as a method of converting moderates who would recoil at the thought of reproductive choice being used as a weapon of gender inequality .
This argument is making the rounds in states as well .
Oklahoma passed a law banning sex- selective abortion in 2009 ( it was struck down this February on technical grounds ) .
Expanding the strategy to race may be even more potent .
In addition to Georgia , with its Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act , Arizona , Mississippi , and New Jersey have proposed bans on race - and sex-selective abortions .
When Franks first introduced his bill in 2008 , the Catholic anti-abortion and anti-contraception group , Population Research Institute , mused that the bill ’s premise — that there is discrimination through abortion — could be as powerful as the campaign against so - called partial - birth abortion .
“ Even those who believe in the absolute right to destroy a child under any and all circumstances , it is safe to predict , will be uncomfortable defending such an extreme position , ” PRI President Steve Mosher suggested . [ 31 ]
There ’s a clear sense among abortion - rights activists in Georgia that the campaigns there are deliberate efforts to splinter alliances between reproductive - rights and racial - justice organizations and individual supporters , as well as to lay the groundwork for a national push .
During a March press call [ 32 ] organized by the blog Reproductive Health Reality Check , Loretta Ross , the national coordinator of Sister Song : Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective , explains that because Georgia has the highest number of Black elected officials in the country , the anti-abortion movement is using the state as test case for enshrining the “ Black genocide ” argument into law .
The issue has been deployed , she says , in classic wedge - politics fashion , to draw Blacks and South Asians — who are allegedly the targets of providers promoting sex- selective abortions — into the conservative base .
“ I actually see this as an opening salvo , ” says Ross , “ because if the Right can deliver this bill in the state of Georgia as a successful trial balloon , I think it will embolden them to believe that around the country they can drive a wedge into the African American community and into other communities of color . ”
In fact , Sister Song has heard reports that a Republican legislator in Arizona may soon introduce a bill on race - and sex- selective abortion aimed at finding support among the Latino community .
SPARK ’s Paris Hatcher agrees :
We know Georgia is a testing ground for harmful legislation .
It started with the “ personhood ” amendment in 2008 .
We know that if it happens here in Georgia , it will happen in other places , and if there is a victory here in Georgia , it will increase the momentum in other states where bills are located .
[ 33 ]
Anti-Abortion Movement Cynicism
On the basis of their past votes on issues of concern to Black voters , says Ross , the Georgia bill ’s sponsors are not convincing advocates for civil rights .
She notes that It ’s really hard to persuade African American women in the city of Atlanta [ that this bill ] , headlined by rural White Republicans , is truly about saving Black or South Asian children .
These are the same legislators who , when we look at their voting records , when it comes to improving schools or getting guns off the streets , are not people whose votes indicate that they care about children of color once they ’re here . [ 34 ]
Indeed , during the three hours of debate preceding the passage of SB 529 in Georgia ’s Senate , Black Democratic Senator Vincent Fort indicated his skepticism [ 35 ] by introducing an amendment to it addressing racial profiling — an issue tackled in an earlier Senate bill that never made it out of committee .
His amendment was ruled unconstitutional .
While in recent years conservative Christian groups have made efforts , both calculated and sincere , to address racism , the Religious Right has an undeniable history of antipathy to civil rights concerns .
The pseudoprogressive nature of the “ Black genocide ” frame becomes more evident when politicians such as Representative Joe Wilson ( R - SC ) , a Confederate flag defender , signs on to Franks ’s bill ; when Tony Perkins , who managed the Louisiana Senate campaign that famously bought
White supremacist David Duke ’s mailing list , [ 36 ] protests Houston ’s Planned Parenthood on antiracist grounds ; or when Pro-Life Radio ’s Stephen Peroutka calls for “ the defunding of the racist agenda of Planned Parenthood , ” [ 37 ] while he and his brother and law partner Michael are the principal sponsors of the Institute on the Constitution [ 38 ] : a think - tank closely tied to the far - right Constitution Party , which calls for repealing the Voting Rights Act.
Alfred Ross , the founder and president of the Institute for Democracy Studies , which researches antidemocratic movements in the U.S. , studied right - wing organizations in the early 1990s for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
He tracked ties between the anti-abortion movement and fringe groups such as the Taxpayer Party ( now the Constitution Party ) that , he says , represented “ the first underground movement that justified the creation of a militia . ”
These groups promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories that condemned legal abortion as a Jewish plot .
More recently , attacks on Planned Parenthood have found ammunition in the work of the anti-abortion ingénue Lila Rose , a White University of California Los Angeles student who gained fame for a “ sting operation ” that caught several Planned Parenthood clinics accepting donations targeted to fund abortions for Black women .
( Rose was inspired , boasts Childress , by reading his BlackGenocide.org website . )
Rose ’s collaborator in the scheme was James O’Keefe , the right - wing activist behind a similar 2009 sting against the community organizing group ACORN , in which O’Keefe posed as a pimp .
In phone calls to Planned Parenthood , O’Keefe claimed he was donating out of concern that affirmative action would harm the prospects of his ( fictitious ) child .
However , complicating the “ gotcha ” appeal of his script are revelations that O’Keefe ’s racist playacting is n’t far removed from his college history of holding an “ affirmative action bake sale ” or his later involvement in a 2006 Race and Conservatism conference , sponsored by the Robert A. Taft Club , a paleoconservative organization affiliated with a network of racist groups , which drew an audience of noted antisemites and White supremacists .
O’Keefe was arrested this winter for breaking into the office of Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) .
Alfred Ross warns , though , that overstressing the relationship between the anti-abortion movement and racism may be missing the mark .
“ Some people who make that argument are n’t from the racist right , they ’re just using an opportunistic moment to recruit supporters , ” he says .
From the late 1980s on , right - wing groups such as Ralph Reed ’s Christian Coalition attempted to recruit Black churches using social issues such as LBGT rights , on which these churches took conservative positions .
“ In spite of the barbarism of their agenda , ” says Ross , “ they ’re marginally creative enough to make up reasons why people who are n’t allies should become allies .
They ’re bottom feeding : whatever bait they can throw up , no matter how rancid , they use . ” [ 39 ]
Kevin Alexander Gray , an African American civil rights leader and the author of Waiting for Lightning to Strike : The Fundamentals of Black Politics ( 2008 ) , sees White conservative Evangelical outreach to the Black church as destructive .
It has shifted the Black church away from liberation theology , he says , and toward conservative social action , particularly through the prosperity gospel movement , which has flourished in Black churches by promising financial rewards to the faithful .
Likewise , the organizations screening Maafa 21 for black audiences , such as the Frederick Douglass Foundation , Global Outreach Campus Ministries , and the Network of Politically Active Christians ( NPAC ) , which is now lobbying for Georgia ’s “ Black genocide ” bill , “ have close ties with religious right powerhouses Focus on the Family and Family Research Council , ” says Sarah Posner , the author of God ’s Profits : Faith , Fraud , and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters ( 2008 ) .
Some groups , like the NPAC , which shares offices with the Family Research Council , were created specifically “ to bolster Religious Right and Republican outreach to Blacks , ” Posner says . [ 40 ]
The Power of Rumor Maafa 21 , says Posner , argues “ that Blacks have been ‘ hoodwinked ’ by diabolical , eugenics - promoting family planning advocates . ”
The film , she says , “ is intended to tap into anger about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and involuntary sterilizations of the early - to mid-twentieth century . ” [ 41 ]
Timothy Johnson , chairman of the right - wing Frederick Douglass Foundation told Posner that Maafa 21 screenings have been successful because they reinforce Black people ’s historically justified sense that they ’ve been lied to .
But the comparison between the Tuskegee experiment and abortion is a false one , says Faith Pennick , the director and producer of Silent Choices , a 2007 documentary about Black women and abortion .
The Tuskegee victims had no opportunity to give informed consent — unlike women seeking abortions .
Nonetheless , says Pennick , who is African American , the genocide argument “ hits a nerve with Black people , particularly those who are uncomfortable with abortion , because they say , here ’s another example of us being messed with . ” [ 42 ]
The sad reality is that rumors about eugenics experiments keep many young women of color from accessing what ’s often the only affordable medical care in their communities .
Pamela Merritt , an African American blogger and the statewide e-organizer for Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri , witnessed this firsthand in 2003 , when she volunteered in a transitional home for teen mothers in St. Louis .
In a discussion about where the women could obtain affordable HIV / AIDS tests , their first reaction was , “ Not the Planned Parenthood ! ”
When Merritt asked them why , they told her that at Planned Parenthood , women are given shots that will keep them from ever having babies .
“ It was n’t the same thing as the prolife rhetoric that you should n’t even walk through the door , ” says Merritt .
“ It ’s the sense that , if I walk through that door , they ’re going to do something to make me not have this baby . ” [ 43 ]
The big issue , for Merritt , is sex education .
She has met a stream of young women in her community who have been taught so little about reproduction that a number were n’t really sure where children come from , and there is a vicious cycle of STD re-infection among the St. Louis population .
Into this knowledge vacuum come out - of - state groups such as Lou Engle ’s Bound4 Life , which tour local churches to promote the idea of Planned Parenthood ’s “ Black genocide ” agenda .
“ Call me militant , ” Merritt says , “ but from my perspective , not allowing more women of color , without fear or dogma or this crazy conspiracy theory , to have access to medically accurate information and health care , is itself part of a mass plot to hold back communities of color . ” [ 44 ] " Dupes " and " Sell - Outs "
In the 1990s , when Alex Sanger , Margaret Sanger ’s grandson and the chair of the International Planned Parenthood Council , ran Planned Parenthood New York City , he observed that the Black escorts working at the city ’s clinics were particular targets of protesters , who would single them out and accuse them of committing genocide against their own people .
Sanger sees the problem as originating in older splits in the various Black rights movements , which , he says , were often along gender lines , as Black women leaders demanded the ability to control their fertility while male leaders were more concerned about “ the genocide issue . ” [ 45 ]
Reopening this old rift , anti-abortion groups claim that Blacks who support choice are either genocidal elitists or dupes .
Alveda King suggests that a White - led birth control movement “ cultivate [d ]
Black leaders ” to coerce them into targeting other people of color . [ 46 ]
Day Gardner likewise refers to the Black politicians , ministers , and community organizers who worked with Margaret Sanger in Harlem as Judases , “ who sold their souls for ‘ 30 pieces of silver ’ ” when they were hired to enact “ ethnic cleansing . ” [ 47 ]
Childress and Maafa 21 focus on mainstream Black organizations , such as the NAACP , and leaders such as Jesse Jackson , who at one time opposed abortion rights , depicting them as formerly principled advocates who bought into Planned Parenthood lies in exchange for campaign support .
In Maafa 21 , the Dallas , Texas , pastor Stephen Broden , a leader in the “ Black genocide ” movement who has addressed Tea Party conventions , remarks of Jackson , “ There ’s never been a shortage of Black leaders willing to sell us down the river . ”
( Gray , who was Jackson ’s South Carolina presidential campaign manager in 1988 , instead suggests that Jackson ’s understanding of the issue evolved . ) [ 48 ]
The argument leaves Black women facing the accusation that they are either fools or murderers — and either way complicit in what Mark Crutcher says is Planned Parenthood ’s sinister plan for “ convincing the target group to commit mass suicide . ” [ 49 ]
The accusation cuts to the heart of an intersection of sexism and racism for Black women , who have historically been pressed to choose allegiance between two aspects of their beings : their gender and their race .
It continues today .
Maame Mensima - Horn , an African American activist based in Miami who consulted for Sister Song , says that the “ Black genocide ” argument has remained a male - driven conversation that shuts out women of color and ignores the role they have played in the reproductive justice movement .
Mensima - Horn sees a new generation of male activists relegating women to “ breeder ” status and blaming them for a deficit in the Black population . [ 50 ]
It seems a neat return to the 1920s debate in the Black community about how to best uplift the race .
W.E.B. DuBois argued for “ quality versus quantity , ” saying that Black interests were best met by family planning that allowed parents to invest more in fewer children , not by simply birthing greater numbers .
In 2010 , Catherine Davis of Georgia Right to Life seems to take the latter position , saying that if Black women had n’t had abortions , “ we would be 59 million strong . ” [ 51 ]
The emphasis underscores a history of sexism in the Civil Rights Movement and its institutions , says Gray , in which Black women ’s intellectual and physical labor was the backbone of the movement yet was rarely acknowledged .
Today , “ Black genocide ” movement leaders , such as Childress and King , emphasize male leadership in both the movement and church — not surprising in conservative circles , but the destructive effect on women of color continues .
For Gray , this kind of sexism is a result of White fundamentalist outreach as well as a symptom of a larger problem : the breakdown of political education in Black politics .
He says ,
The result of it is that we have people claiming that the maafa is the abortion of black kids , instead of what it really is : the great catastrophe related to the slave trade .
It means a bunch of frauds can rewrite your history and make it everything that it ’s not .
The freedom movement , which is what civil rights is about , is about the freedom of citizens to determine their lives for themselves and make their own opportunities .
And not , Grays says , to become a mother simply “ because these people think you ought to be a mother . ” [ 52 ]
Women of Color at the Intersection
The question of how to counter the “ Black genocide ” argument is almost as complicated as its history .
Ellen Chesler , historian and author of Woman of Valor : Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America ( 1992 ) says that , after one hundred years of variations on the argument , she ’s not sure what the response could be . [ 53 ]
Alex Sanger says it ’s the same dilemma that faces the larger prochoice movement , of boiling down a complex argument to a catchphrase , to counter anti-abortion slogans that claim abortion is murder , or now , genocide . [ 54 ]
Gloria Feldt , author of The War on Choice ( 2004 ) and a former president of Planned Parenthood , says that many reproductive - rights activists who came out of the Civil Rights Movement are so horrified by accusations of racism that they have n’t been able to effectively contextualize this history .
We ’re not pure in this country , but Margaret Sanger was probably on the leading edge of those looking for a different way .
It does take a certain amount of energy and research to put the truth out there , but the truth is that for any woman of any race , ethnicity , or economic level , the first and most important thing she must have is the right to make her own reproductive decisions .
“ To own and control her own body , ” as Sanger herself says . [ 55 ]
Part of the answer could be more discussion of the issue led by women of color .
Sanger notes the need for more diversity in the reproductive - rights movement , and more women of color in visible leadership roles .
Faith Pennick agrees that inadequate outreach by prochoice groups to women of color , and insufficiently direct attempts to address the complicated history of Sanger and eugenics , has “ left a door open for prolife organizations to come in and say , ‘ they do n’t care about you , but we do . ’” [ 56 ]
“ That ’s my motivation for addressing it , because this is what makes someone feel not comfortable in joining a movement we need more women of color joining , ” says Pamela Merritt . [ 57 ]
Another part of the solution , many activists agree , must be more discussion of sexuality and reproductive issues in communities of color .
Gray says that ’s a problematic absence in the Black community , which avoids discussions of abortion just as it has shunned talk of AIDS and gay issues .
When you do n’t talk about it , it gives all these other folks who have their own political agenda room to step in and shape the argument as they have with the black church , as it relates to gay rights and women ’s rights .
Nothing is being said , so they 're filling up the space . [ 58 ]
“ There is a need to have more conversations , ” agrees Paris Hatcher .
She points out that the Georgia billboards and legislative campaign have had the unintended , positive effect of drawing hundreds of people into the debate — to rallies , email campaigns and public comment on media stories about the issue .
The conversation itself affirms a long unacknowledged truth : that abortion is not a White issue .
“ There is ample silence in our communities , and it ’s important that we are vocal about what ’s going on and talking about what ’s going on with our bodies , ” says Hatcher .
“ If we ’re not talking about them , they ’re being divvied up by other people ” [ 59 ]
The U.S. District Court in Columbus , Ohio ( Kirk Herbstreit's hometown ) denied a couple 's charitable contribution deduction for the house they donated to a suburban fire department that was demolished and the land returned to the couple ( who built a larger home on the land ) because they did not submit with their return a qualified appraisal or a contemporaneous acknowledgment of the donation from the city .
Hendrix v. United States ; No. 2:09 - cv-00132 ( S.D. OH July 21 , 2010 ) :
Plaintiffs had retained the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche regarding a possible donation of the house to the city that would result in the city demolishing the structure and then returning the real estate back to Plaintiffs .
In a March 2004 report , a Deloitte & Touche advisor analyzed the possible transaction and concluded , among other things , that “ [ d] onation of property to a fire department is aggressive and not explicitly sanctioned by the Internal Revenue Code . ” ...
The city used the house from June 29 , 2004 , until October 29 , 2004 , at which time the house was demolished .
Plaintiffs then proceeded to construct a new , larger house on their lot .
Plaintiffs also reported a charitable contribution on their 2004 income tax return , claiming a deduction for the house in the amount of $ 287,400 .
The IRS disallowed the deduction and proceeded to assess a tax deficiency of $ 100,590 .
...
The parties ’ dispute presents four core issues , each of which is arguably potentially dispositive of this litigation .
The first issue is whether Plaintiffs have met the requirement of submitting a sufficient qualified appraisal .
The second issue is whether Plaintiffs filed a sufficient contemporaneous acknowledgment of the purported donation .
The third issue is whether the Internal Revenue Code precludes a deduction for the conduct involved here .
The fourth issue is whether Plaintiffs have otherwise established that they are entitled to a deduction .
Because the first two of these issues prove dispositive , this Court need not and does not reach the remaining issues .
...
Ciardelli ’s appraisal ... fails to constitute a “ qualified appraisal . ” ...
The end result is that Plaintiffs are not entitled to the claimed deduction .
Plaintiffs contest this result , although they concede that their appraisal lacks several areas of content .
They argue that they substantially complied with the regulations and statutory scheme , however , and point to components of the appraisal that did include required information .
Defendant counters that it does not appear that the Sixth Circuit has recognized the substantial compliance doctrine in regard to taxpayer deductions and that , even if this Court were to assume that the doctrine could apply here , Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate substantial compliance .
This Court agrees that the substantial compliance doctrine cannot salvage Plaintiffs ’ case .
Contemplated application of the doctrine in this Circuit to Internal Revenue Code provisions has previously arisen in the context of statutory language that specifically provides for substantial compliance .
...
Assuming arguendo that the doctrine indeed could apply in such taxpayer actions , the Court finds that the appraisal at issue wholly lacks even a modicum of content in critical areas to say that it substantially complies with numerous statutory and regulation mandates .
The substantial compliance doctrine is not a substitute for missing entire categories of content ; rather , it is at most a means of accepting a nearly complete effort that has simply fallen short in regard to minor procedural errors or relatively unimportant clerical oversights .
The required content Plaintiffs neglected does not constitute such instances of technicalities .
...
Plaintiffs ’ appraisal is insufficient and precludes their claimed deduction .
Additionally , even if this first ground did not resolve the litigation , the Court concludes that Defendant is still entitled to summary judgment under its second rationale : that Plaintiffs failed to file a contemporaneous acknowledgment as required by § 170 .
... [ B ] ecause none of the documents produced in this case , including the June 29 , 2004 contract between Plaintiffs and the city , satisfies § 170 ( f ) ( 8 ) ( B ) , Plaintiffs in turn have failed to avoid the § 170 ( f ) ( 8 ) ( A ) bar on their claimed deduction .
Either of the foregoing grounds ends this litigation .
Thus , as noted , the Court declines to reach the remaining moot issues involved in the parties ’ dispute .
The consequent result of the foregoing analysis is that , regardless of whether taxpayers may be able to claim a deduction for the type of donation involved in this case–a question this Court need not ultimately answer today –the deficient manner in which Plaintiffs pursued such a donation here proves dispositive .
Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment , while Plaintiffs are not .
His comments are unlikely to be taken seriously in Washington , which has long suspected Gen Gul of being a dangerous influence in Pakistan politics , but there is concern in Islamabad that the early withdrawal of American and British troops starting next summer might destabilise the region 's politics .
' I do n't see why I should give my music to iTunes or anyone else , ' singer says of digital sales .
Do n't expect [ artist id = " 14481 " ]
Prince [ / artist ] to join the army of celebs oversharing on Twitter or ranting on Facebook .
The legendary performer has proclaimed the Internet a thing of the past , calling the World Wide Web " outdated . "
" The Internet 's completely over , " Prince told the U.K.'s Daily Mirror .
It appears that he wants fans to head to an old - fashioned record store to pick up his upcoming album 20 Ten , as he is not OK with selling his latest music through an e-retailer .
" I do n't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else .
They wo n't pay me an advance for it and then they get angry when they can't get it . "
The Purple One did n't stop his critique at e-commerce and chalked up his lack of interest in the Internet as a whole to the medium 's lack of coolness .
" The Internet 's like MTV , " said Prince .
" At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated . "
It 's probably safe to assume that Prince is neither a Mac nor a PC — the " Purple Rain " singer also lambasted the proliferation of technical devices and said , " All these computers and digital gadgets are no good . "
The music luminary , who is releasing 20 Ten for free in the U.K. with copies of the Mirror on Saturday , insisted that users would be better off without their digital devices .
" They just fill your head with numbers and that can't be good for you . "
In addition to slamming all things digital , Prince also directed some criticism inward .
The influential singer and instrumentalist revealed that since he feels he 's been advancing his craft over the years , he 's embarrassed by his earlier recordings .
" Someone told me they saw me at my peak , but how do they know when my peak is ?
I think I 'm improving all the time , " he said .
" When I listen to my old records I 'm ashamed of how I played then . "
The singer also insisted that a lifetime of rocking out has preserved his youthful appearance .
" Playing electric guitar your whole life does something to you .
I 'm convinced all that electricity racing through my body made me keep my hair , " he offered .
While the pop icon may be over his earlier music , he is still regarded by many as a living legend .
Prince was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 BET Awards , as stars like Patti LaBelle and Alicia Keys took to the stage to celebrate the artist 's massively successful and hugely influential career .
REDWOOD CITY , California —
“ I ’ve kind of made a habit of taking children ’s fairy tales and turning them into dark , twisted content , ” says game designer American McGee .
He might be understating the case a bit .
As creator of American McGee ’s Alice and American McGee ’s Grimm , he ’s best known ( and pointedly parodied ) for dirtying up a story from our innocent childhoods , then slapping his name into the videogame ’s title .
With Alice : Madness Returns , McGee ’s moniker is off the box , but the creative vision is unmistakable :
It ’s a creepy trip into a perverted Wonderland , where Alice is beset not by humorous anthropomorphs but nightmare visions .
Electronic Arts will publish the game in 2011 for PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and PC .
At a press event last week hosted by publisher Electronic Arts , McGee and story collaborator R.J. Berg discussed what gamers should expect from this long - awaited Alice sequel .
Wired.com : I have n’t played the previous Alice .
Are there any plans to bring it back as a downloadable game before the sequel comes out ?
American McGee :
It ’s certainly endured with the fans .
I think that there ’s an audience for it , but at this moment we ’re just focused on Alice : Madness Returns .
Any bringing it back would be up to EA and EA Partners .
R.J. and I were here as employees when we created the first Alice .
Wired.com :
Since this will probably be many people ’s first experience , I ’m guessing you ’re crafting the game in such a way that you do n’t need to have played the original to enjoy it .
McGee : Yeah , but there ’s a definite need for us to honor and answer to the existing audience , people who ’ve been loyal fans to the property over the years .
We ’ve done our best to blend together into the story elements from the first game .
This is a natural sequel , a narrative sequel to the first game .
So we get back in there and people who know the first game are going to have a lot of reward in terms of seeing locations that they may have seen before , characters that they knew from the first game .
But it ’s certainly not a requirement , bringing this game to console for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 players , for them to have played the PC one .
Wired.com : Describe some of the gameplay mechanics .
McGee :
For the first game , the idea was to make a solid platformer .
The other tenets were the art , which at the time was really out there in terms of its ability to present art as a core of the experience .
R.J. wrote the first game ’s story , and he ’s writing the story for Madness Returns .
I think if you ask anybody about the way that story is presented in the title , you ’ll find that that was one of the things that was really unique about it .
At the time with PC gaming , the Half - Lifes and things like that had n’t hit just yet .
And so we felt , I think our audience felt , that we really nailed it in terms of how we delivered story and got the player immersed in the game .
Coming back now to the story in Madness Returns , we ’re once again focused on these things : really good story , solid third - person platforming gameplay , adventure , action , exploration and puzzle solving .
Wired.com :
You bring up an interesting point , because after Alice came out there was a revolution in game storytelling .
What do you do differently now that you have to clear a higher bar for people who ’ve played BioShock , who ’ve played Half - Life ?
R.J. Berg : I do n’t think that we ’ve looked upon them as necessarily raising the bar so much as expanding people ’s acceptance of what they could do on a console .
We are extremely impressed with BioShock , for instance .
Still , we thought that by basing our game on such a strong intellectual property , and Alice being such a deep and rich font of intellectual property , that we were already stretching out the sense of action - adventure , and maybe one that was not particularly well - suited 10 years ago .
Whereas now , with something like BioShock , Half - Life , games that have really improved our notion of what you can do , what kind of deep story you can tell on that platform , we ’re pretty confident that our audience will come right along with us .
We ’re pretty happy about this direction .
Wired.com : I just finished reading the book Extra Lives , and now my head is filled with big words :
It reminded me of Clint Hocking ’s blog post about ludonarrative dissonance in BioShock , how the gameplay and the narrative can go out of whack with each other .
Is that something you ’re concerned about ?
McGee :
Well , I think his idea of dissonance is that it made the entertainment experience so jolting , so shocking .
In the first Alice , we were playing with narrative shocks and twists , and they obviously hit home with people who played the game .
In Madness Returns , it ’s much more of the same and then some .
I think that storytelling , which is R.J. ’s forte , does n’t necessarily need to catch up to anything , it ’s that the technology has to be applied in a way that honors the story you want to tell and does n’t cause a disconnect from the audience .
You want to find a balance between this thing that is game and this thing that is story .
That ’s the truth of it — you ’re not letting these pieces get in the way of each other unless , in the instance of BioShock , you ’re turning something on its head for the key purpose of , “ Oh my God , I ca n’t believe this whole time I ’ve been in this thing and this thing has been talking to me . ”
Wired.com : A lot of people have nightmares about their teeth falling out , as we saw in that teaser trailer .
Are you trying to play on our common fears ?
McGee :
Well , the title is M-rated .
The first Alice was actually EA ’s first M- rated game .
We are trying to seek common horror — not that it ’s simple or expected , but instead of being that in - your - face cliché horror , we ’re trying to go for a much more psychological , deep , disturbing horror .
The kind that would juxtapose something like the blood and the teeth and this beautiful girl to try to create — that is a dissonance that you ’re trying to pull up .
And the game is filled with that , actually .
As you move through the environments , you ’re going to find elements of the art that are one moment comforting , because these are things that have all been born out of Alice ’s experiences in her life , and at the same time disturbing because they ’re set against this thing that ’s coming into this environment that would normally be her sanctuary , her psychological sanctuary , and screwing everything up .
At its core is the idea of going mad .
That ’s really at the center of this , probably the most frightening thing .
Wired.com :
Have you gone up against things that you could n’t put in the game because you ’d get an Adults Only rating ?
Berg :
No , we knew we were making an M - rated game .
That just gave us a play area to work with .
There was never any temptation to go over the top to get that kind of rating .
The thing that was most important to American and me was that we always be true to our idea of her — what she experienced , what she imagined , what she dreamed about — was it credible ?
We ’re looking for people to appreciate this vibrant , courageous , troubled young woman hero character .
But we really almost insist that you come along with all of your notions , all of your imagination , everything that you ’ve ever thought about how Alice would live her life .
It was just important that we not try to , for the sake of shock or otherwise , do something that violated our sense of who she grew up to be .
McGee : I think if we had , in the first game , violated that sense of who that character was , pushed it too far , pushed it in any direction for the wrong reasons , we would not have seen that kind of response that we did .
So many people , people we respected , our audience who we obviously respect , came back and told us that they thought this was the truest adaptation of the story that they ’d ever seen .
I think that really says a lot about the sensitivity with which we approached it .
Wired.com : Alan Moore , in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , touched on the idea of what happens when you come back from Wonderland .
How it changes you .
Berg :
You ’re into something critical and something that I ’m afraid we can’t really talk about right now .
Wired.com :
Are there puzzles ?
McGee : Absolutely .
We thought that was an important element of the first game , and in Madness Returns it ’s there , and it ’s there in some ways that are new .
New and old .
We ’re seeing this revival — we saw it today in Dead Space : Ignition , the side - scrolling 2 - D presentation of arcade gameplay on the console .
We ’re finding ways to pull ideas like that into the game as puzzles , and also ideas that come more naturally out of the fiction like chess and cards .
It certainly was a big piece of what made the first game fun and we ’ve brought it back with some new thinking and some new ideas .
Wired.com :
Is there pressure to make it more marketable — add an online multiplayer death - match mode ?
McGee :
Well , we did n’t do that .
This is very much focused on the strongest and best single - player narrative game that we can make .
You know , I think we ’ve all seen examples of projects where that should have been the case , and it was n’t , and you can see where the quality kind of falls off .
We ’ve been really fortunate in having EA Partners as a creative partner , understanding that this is a title that needs room and space and time as a single - player narrative presentation to be just that .
Wired.com :
Is Wonderland supposed to be a happy place for Alice that ’s gotten perverted ?
McGee :
In both games , that ’s been the theme .
This is in fact a sanctuary .
It ’s a place that is made up of experiences that she ’s had throughout life .
And we always are striving to be true to that .
Whatever she sees or experiences in Wonderland has to be derived from something that she might have seen or experienced in real life .
That ’s a really fun constraint , actually , because trying to find the surreal or trying to find the horror requires that you actually work within that idea .
It always ends up being that the results are really nice .
But yes , from a basic perspective she ’s always trying to return Wonderland to its more normal state .
Keep in mind that this is a character who has dealt with some very dark issues in her life , so it ’s always going to inform the place as she ’s seen it , even when she ’s returned it to so - called normal .

Some critical notes on the US anarchist group CrimethInc. following the publication of their book , Days of War , Nights of Love by webmaster of the Situationist website Bureau of Public Secrets , Ken Knabb in 2001 .
The reader should bear in mind the following :
Knabb : " It 's merely an email response written as a courtesy to someone who asked for my opinion , so it 's not quite as rigorous as it might have been if I had examined the book in detail and written a text for general circulation . "
Copy of an email , June 2001 ]
Note :
In this reponse , I was under the erroneous impression that the person who sent me the Crimethinc book ( " Days of War , Nights of Love " ) was one of the authors . ]
... Thanks also for the Crimethink book .
In answer to your request for comments , I do n't have time to go into any great detail , but here are some brief impressions :
On the positive side , the book is well written and communicates a number of good points .
In this regard it 's more interesting than most anarchist writings , which usually just repeat the same few basic ideas for the thousandth time .
And it is evident that your ideas are closely linked to actual experiences -- when you talk about the feel of freedom , the reader senses that you know what you 're talking about based on your own experiments and adventures .
It seems to me , however , that there are also some criticizable aspects .
Despite your cautions against ideology , your book is riddled with simplistic , unqualified declarations .
In some places you are admirably open and modest , but in others you come on like you have definitive answers to practically everything from the meaning of life to whether people should wear deodorant or not .
Many of your descriptions of radical struggles are rather simplistic .
One minor example out of many :
To describe the Paris Commune as " a sort of continuous anarchist festival for a few months , before the usual spoilsports regained control and slaughtered everybody " ( p. 83 ) is a really gross falsification of reality .
Even if there was a festive aspect that it is important to acknowledge , the Commune was also filled with suffering , self - sacrifice , patriotism , compromises , confusions , betrayals , sordid political intrigues , conflicting ideologies .
And part of the interest and importance of the Commune is precisely that its repressors were not " the usual spoilsports " -- i.e. the relation of forces and classes was complicated and in some ways unprecedented , the people involved were not totally clear about who were friends and who were enemies .
Readers who know nothing about the Commune will get an erroneous and trivialized impression of what went on , while those who actually know something about it may conclude that your social analyses are not to be trusted -- that you 're presenting things very selectively in order to reinforce your ideology .
Just as you present rebellious actions as almost purely GOOD , you tend to present the system as almost purely BAD .
In reality , just as most revolts and radical movements have been full of mistakes and limitations , many aspects of the present society are positive , or at least potentially so .
The very fact that humanity has survived to this point demonstrates this .
We all have a natural tendency to define our perspectives in these good vs. bad terms -- it makes it easier to drum up enthusiasm for struggle -- but when it gets too simplistic it falsifies reality and thus actually hinders any serious struggle .
There is also a recurring moralizing simplisticness .
It is good that you recognize the element of necessary hypocrisy and compromise in our lives .
But a lot of your agonizing over whether this or that practice is hypocritical is , to me , a phoney , nonexistent issue .
I do not view my options primarily in terms of whether I am " implicated " in capitalism , as if that were some sort of sin to be avoided at all cost .
Nor , conversely , do I consider that I am accomplishing anything very notable if I avoid some such compromise , as if radical struggle were a matter of more and more people gradually becoming less and less implicated in the prevailing system .
That perspective is just as simplistic as pacifists ' feeling that we will arrive at peace by more and more people becoming pacifists ( while failing to confront economic and other factors that engender wars despite most people 's preference for peace ) .
While I salute the sense of experimentation of your friend who tried to live off garbage pickings instead of buying food , it does not seem to me that such choices have much to do with radical strategy .
If you take May 68 , for example , the outcome hinged almost entirely on whether or not the workers occupying their factories would take that one additional step of restarting up necessary production and distribution under their own control .
In such a context , whether this or that worker had previously been " implicated " in the system can be seen as largely irrelevant .
( It is true , of course , that the workers ' previous habits of working , consuming , TV watching , etc. , undoubtedly contributed to their hesitancy to take that final step .
But that 's not at all the same thing as saying that the way to overcome capitalism is for people to withdraw from it as much as possible . )
I think that you could have made most of your points in far less space ( a pamphlet rather than a book ) .
There is also an impression of excessive self - importance .
I realize that your opening bit about the " spectre of crimethink " is at least partially ironic , but there still is a sense that you " crimethink agents " believe you are really hot stuff , a pole of international subversion , and that you are trying to mythologize yourselves ( so people will have an image of cool crimethink underground adventurers like they used to about Che Guevara or the Weathermen , etc. ) .
Without judging whether your present or potential importance justifies such posing , I think it 's usually more important to go in the other direction , to demystify yourselves and the intimidating images people have of radical underground heavies , rather than building them up .
I apologize for not giving more detailed examples of what I mean .
But I think that this should suffice to give you a general idea .
As it happens , a group in Australia recently sent me an issue of their " Theft " magazine ( it 's also online at http://www.theftmag.com ) and asked me for comments .
Although you will no doubt find some differences between yourselves and them , I think there are also a number of commonalities .
In any case , I am appending my remarks to them because I think that some of the more general points also apply to your book .
Cheers ,
Ken Knabb
***********************************************************
[ Knabb to Theft Magazine , 12 May 2001 ]
Dear Theft Magazine folks ,
I do n't have time to comment on Theft # 2 in any detail .
The most notable criticism I have is that the last chapter is sometimes rather simplistic .
While I think it 's fine to recommend that people seek pursuits that are enjoyable and satisfying to them , it seems to me rather silly to declare that life " should be " " perpetual ecstasy " etc .
This kind of " should be " amounts to little more than that you think it would be nice if things were that way .
It 's ultimately pretty meaningless , like saying that insects " should " have " the right " to live freely without being eaten by birds .
It 's a false reasoning which you have probably picked up from Vaneigem .
He rightly criticizes traditional leftism 's overemphasis on sacrificing for the cause , but then flips into an equally unjustified opposite conclusion that pleasure is the supreme criterion for everything , and then to the even more absurd implication that a successful revolution will somehow magically produce endless unalloyed pleasure .
Again , I think it 's good that you encourage people to reexamine their lives , to reduce addictive consumership , and to make space for relaxation and reflection .
But you have to be careful not to be too rigid in your recommendations .
" The more you consume , the less you live " makes a good graffiti , it conveys a good general point .
But it should n't be taken too literally , as if it were a precise scientific formula .
In your SHIT percentage test , for example , you more or less equate " the more of yourself is actually yours " ( a rather vague notion in any case ) with lower SHIT percentages .
This amounts to an inverse economic fetishization , a sort of anti-economic puritanism , as if enjoyment was always inversely proportional to the degree of economic taint .
Actually , of course , in many cases an activity that creates profit for someone may nevertheless be more enjoyable than another activity that puristically avoids the market .
The best things in life are not always free , even if they " should " be .
If you frequently present this kind of over - simplified formula , people with enough sense to know better will not take you seriously regarding the many other areas where you have valid points to make .
It 's also important to resist the temptation to be too specific .
It 's good to give a few examples to give people a clearer idea of what you 're talking about .
But if you fall into the " positivist " trap you end up trivializing your points .
Many of our problems do not have easy solutions .
One person in one situation may be better off to quit his job and try to get by in a different way .
Another person in another situation might be better off to get a job rather than spending his life half starved scrounging in garbage cans and living in the streets .
The choice involves a lot of factors ( does he have a family ?
what kind of jobs are available ?
what sort of social welfare is available if he does n't work ?
how risky are the alternative illegal expedients he might use ?
etc. ) that are more complex than simply declaring that " work time " is bad and " free time " is good .
Part of being genuinely " antiauthoritarian " involves recognizing that the ultimate solution to the " social question " involves leaving people to figure out their own solutions to many of their problems .
In this context , I would say that although your pamphlet contains many valid points , the general format strikes me as somewhat too similar to ordinary publicity -- collages of slogans and ads that add up to an overwhelming barrage of frantic bits of advice : " DO THIS AND YOU'LL FEEL GREAT ! " " AVOID DOING THAT , IT'S ALIENATING !" ...
To take just one example , you say " Day dreaming subverts the world ! "
But you could just as justifiably have said " Day dreaming helps preserve alienated society " ( by providing a psychological safety valve ) .
Try to resist the temptation to rigidly separate things into Good and Bad .
Most things are much more subtle and complex , they contain different aspects , they may even become transformed into their opposites .
It 's usually better to examine things as calmly as possible , so as to foster people 's own reflective thinking .
Have the faith that if you have really said something relevant to their lives , they themselves will figure out some appropriate conclusion without having simplistic formulas shouted at them .
I realize that in other parts of your pamphlet you do go into many of these issues in somewhat more nuanced detail .
But I think you will see what I mean about these general tendencies .
Cheers ,
Ken

When it comes to credit scores , there is a lot of information to absorb .
What are they ?
How do they affect you financially ?
What is a “ good ” score ?
What is the highest credit score available ?
Should everyone be striving to achieve a perfect score ?
This article will explain how your credit score is calculated , how you can improve your score and if it ’s necessary to have a perfect credit score .
So what is the highest credit score possible ?
The two most popular credit scoring models today remain VantageScore and FICO — and the highest score possible for both of those is 850 .
Keep reading to find out where you stand when it comes to your credit score .
What Is a Credit Score ?
Simply put , a credit score is a three - digit number that potential creditors use to assess how likely you are to pay your bills .
Scoring models look for patterns in your credit report data that historically have been associated with payment default .
Based on the prevalence ( or absence ) of these patterns , scoring models assign you a score that reflects your predicted riskiness relative to other consumers .
Check Your Credit Today
Although there are many different scoring models out today — some of which take into account alternative data , such as your income or how you handle your recurring monthly bills — the FICO and VantageScore models remain the most popular among lenders .
Both the FICO and VantageScore models have bands for scoring , which you can see below :
FICO 8 Scoring Bands Exceptional 800-850 Very Good 740-799 Good 670-739 Fair 580-669 Very Poor 300-579
The first company to release credit scores was Fair Isaac Corporation in 1989 .
It standardized the results from the credit reporting agencies .
In 2006 Equifax , Experian and TransUnion , the three major credit bureaus , launched their own credit score , called VantageScore .
It has similar scoring bands to FICO but includes slightly different information .
VantageScore 3.0 Scoring Bands Excellent 750-850 Good 700- 749 Fair 650-699 Poor 550- 649 Very Poor 300-549
Federal law entitles you to receive a free credit report from each credit bureau once every 12 months .
This can help you ensure all of your information is accurate and up to date .
In addition , some credit card companies now enable customers to view their free credit score online as part of their available account information .

How Is Your Credit Score Calculated ?
Your credit score is calculated from your credit report information , which includes the amount of debt you carry , how long your credit history is and how promptly you pay your bills , among other factors .
A higher score translates to a more dependable borrower , which inspires confidence in potential lenders — and lower rates .
Although the FICO and VantageScore models calculate your score a bit differently , they both use the same data in your credit report , which is all about your behavior concerning borrowing and repaying money .
How Your FICO Score Is Calculated
Your payment history is the No. 1 factor in a FICO score , and it accounts for 35 % of your score .
The next - biggest factor is your credit utilization rate — how much of your available credit you ’re using — which counts for 30 % of your score .
A tip :
To avoid lowering your score , it ’s recommended you use not more than 30 % of your total available credit .
How long you ’ve had credit counts for 15 % of your FICO score .
Your credit mix — the variety of loan types you have — counts for up to 10 % .
Recent applications for credit can influence your FICO score up to 10 % because when you apply for credit the lender will make a “ hard inquiry ” ( requesting your credit score ) , which typically lowers your score by a few points .
Check Your Credit Today
Although FICO does n’t assign percentage weights to certain information on your credit report , keep in mind that derogatory information such as foreclosures , accounts in collections and bankruptcies can cause your score to take a nosedive .
To quickly grasp how much weight FICO assigns to each category , see below :
Payment history : 35 %
Amounts owed : 30 %
Length of credit history : 15 %
Credit mix : 10 %
New credit : 10 %
How Your VantageScore Is Calculated
The VantageScore scoring model evaluates credit along the lines of how FICO does but characterizes their importance differently .
Like the FICO model , the most influential data in your score is your payment history .
The type and age of credit you have and your credit utilization ratio are “ highly influential . ”
Your total balances and debt are only “ moderately influential ” and your recent applications for credit and available credit are “ less influential .
Note that your VantageScore will also take a severe hit from derogatory information .
The VantageScore 3.0 model weighs your data like this :
Payment history : extremely influential

Do You Need To Have the Highest Credit Score ?
Would it be nice to have an 850 credit score ?
Of course — not only would you have bragging rights , but you ’d also likely gain access to the best rates available from lenders .
But do you need to have the highest credit score ?
No way .
Instead , you want to shoot for the highest “ band ” possible .
For example , if you have an 800 FICO score , you ’ll still be in the “ exceptional ” category .
If your VantageScore is 750 you ’ll be in the “ excellent ” band .
Even among the most disciplined consumers , few achieve the highest credit score possible .
In fact , less than 1.5 % of Americans are able to attain an 850 credit score , according to FICO .
Even then , credit scores change all the time , so it ’s not likely that any one person is maintaining an 850 FICO credit score at all times .
Striving to get the best credit score you can is a worthy pursuit .
You might be surprised at how many ways your credit score can influence your life .
It goes beyond just getting good terms on a loan .

A low score can actually cost you money .
For instance , companies you deal with on an everyday basis — utility companies , insurers , cellphone providers — might check your credit score and levy certain fees or charge you higher rates if you do n’t look like a good borrower .
A low score can also affect where you live .
Say you found a fantastic apartment and the landlord did a credit check and saw that you do n’t pay your bills .
Your low credit score will decrease the likelihood of a landlord renting to you .
You can even get your credit card account limit reduced or closed if your credit score bottoms out .
Your credit card company would also likely decline a request for a lower annual percentage rate or credit line increase if your credit is less than ideal .
Rather than push for the highest credit score , aim instead for a credit score range .
If you have a score of around 800 , you ’re in the end zone :
You ’re likely to receive the same interest rates and preferred treatment that you would get if your score was a perfect 850 .

Being in the “ 800 Club ” is something to brag about , so if you want to reach for the stars , go for it — but do n’t let backfield emotions lead the way .
Although it ’s possible to obtain the perfect credit score , you do n’t need it to receive the top benefits .
Your score is not entirely in your control , so keep this in mind and you can focus less on striving for perfection and more on enjoying all the things your responsible actions have afforded you .

How To Improve Your Credit Score
Do n’t settle for an average credit score .
A really high score is n’t impossible to get .
The way to improve your credit score — and work toward a perfect 850 credit score — is in these seven steps you can take right now :
Always pay your bills on time .
Eliminate derogatory accounts from your credit report .
Keep old accounts open to maintain a long credit history .
Keep your outstanding revolving debt to less than 10 % of your credit limits .
Maintain a diverse mix of credit accounts .
Extend credit lines by opening additional credit card accounts — but keep your balances low .
Be sure to check your credit score — and your credit report — every three months and report any errors .
Improving your credit score is a matter of building healthy financial habits and keeping your debt - to - income ratio low .
Katie Ross , education and development and housing manager for American Consumer Credit Counseling , a nonprofit that educates consumers on identity theft , credit , debt and budgeting , offered a few key tips for consumers looking to improve their credit scores .
You should avoid using your credit card if you ’re in a financial bind .
“ Finance charges and other fees will add to your debt burden , ” Ross said .
Do n’t get into the habit of making minimum payments .
“ If you pay only the minimum , it will take a long time to pay off your debt , ” Ross said .
“ For example , if you owe $ 5,000 on an account with 18 % APR , making 2 % payments will take over 44 years to pay off .
Also , you will have paid $ 12,431 in interest . ”
Make your payments on time , every time .
Paying off your debt might be difficult , but avoiding payments wo n’t make your life any easier .
“ Bad problems get worse fast when you have late fees and higher rates to pay during financial difficulty , ” Ross said .
Finally , do n’t max out your credit cards .
“ A credit card account close to its limit will cause a big drop in your credit score , ” she said .
Maxing out your account also puts you in danger of getting hit with over - limit fees .

High Credit Scores Can Indicate Great Financial Health
A high credit score can gain you access to the best lenders and the best rates available .
It can also make or break your qualification for just about any line of credit , including a credit card , car loan or mortgage .
If you want to borrow money , you need to prove you can handle credit and pay it back on time .
Think of every time you pay your debts as a touchdown and you ’ll be in the right frame of mind to set up an effective financial game plan .
Lenders use dozens of credit scores to measure consumers ’ creditworthiness , so make sure you know yours .
You should , because it has a significant impact on your financial standing .
If your score is low , remember that it ’s never too late to start rebuilding your credit .

Pilots fly their aircraft in formation in July 2008 over the annual show in Oshkosh , Wis .
Enlarge By Mike Paschal , AP
Two planes collide while landing July 27 , 2007 , in Oshkosh , Wis .
Accidents do n't deter air show aviators Flying enthusiast Roger Bock spent months planning to fly his " home - built " plane to the world 's largest air show .
His flight came to a tragic end a few hundred feet short of the runway in Oshkosh , Wis .
As Bock and fellow pilot John Linden prepared to land at the 2008 AirVenture show , Bock 's small plane got too slow , rolled violently and slammed to the ground , according to a federal accident report .
They died instantly .
About 10,000 aircraft will converge on Oshkosh this week , along with several hundred thousand fans , for what aviation devotees consider a trip to mecca .
If the past decade is any indication , there is a strong likelihood of tragedy .
Since 2000 , there have been 59 crashes associated with the show and at least one fatality each year .
" I think Oshkosh is very dangerous , " Bock 's widow , Karen , said at their Carnegie , Pa. , home .
" I really think that if he had been landing anywhere else , he would not have crashed . "
A USA TODAY review of dozens of accident reports reveals the crashes are a microcosm of what plagues general aviation pilots every weekend : running out of gas , flying too slowly and getting caught by bad weather .
The accident data show a host of other problems .
The Oshkosh show , which is sponsored by the Experimental Aircraft Association ( EAA ) , draws thousands of planes built at home by hobbyists .
Accident data show that such planes have about a five - fold higher risk of crashes .
To accommodate the huge increase in traffic , the airport adopts unusual procedures , landing as many as three planes at a time on the same runway and crowding taxiways with streams of planes .
The conditions have occasionally led to problems .
Flurry of flying Starting last week , the landing strips at Oshkosh 's Wittman Regional Airport began rumbling with activity in preparation for Monday 's air show kickoff .
Last year , Wittman was the busiest airport in the world over two days , recording as many as 3,554 landings and takeoffs during daylight hours , according to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
The airports that typically handle the most flights , Atlanta 's Hartsfield and Chicago 's O'Hare , do not come close to that during a full 24 hours .
FAA controllers compete for temporary assignments to work the show , where the thicket of traffic is a test of their skills .
Planes line up for landing miles away , and pilots must follow the staccato bursts of instructions from controllers .
Radio channels are so overburdened that pilots must remain silent , wagging their wings instead to acknowledge instructions .
Every last bit of pavement is utilized .
Some planes land on what are normally taxiways .
The airport 's longest runway is divided into three parts marked by color - coded dots , so more than one plane can land at a time .
Aircraft ranging from seaplanes to a fleet of historic DC - 3s to a giant C - 5 military transport jet will visit the area for this year 's show , EAA spokesman Dick Knapinski said .
Washington aviation lawyer Mike Pangia flies his 1943 Navy fighter to Oshkosh every year .
" It 's a wonder of the world , " he said .
" It must be one of the largest conventions of any kind . "
Amid the festive atmosphere of thousands of pilots camping beneath their planes and the daily acrobatic displays , there is another side to the show .
From 2000 through last year , an average of nearly six aircraft at the air show , or headed to or from the event , were involved in accidents or incidents , according to National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) case files .
In that time , 30 people died in accidents associated with the show , an average of three a year .
Some of the accidents are to be expected .
The shear volume of flights increases the odds something will go wrong , said the NTSB 's Jeff Guzzetti , head of the division that investigates small - plane accidents .
Though he has never conducted a formal study , Guzzetti suspects that at least some of the accidents happen because pilots are flying longer distances outside their comfort zone .
Records suggest he is right .
Four people headed to Oshkosh died in 2001 when a pilot who was not certified to fly in poor weather hit a patch of dense fog .
A man flying home with a newly purchased plane died in 2006 after running out of fuel after he failed to make sure the plane 's gas cap was on .
Investigators found he was not qualified to fly the plane .
Still , Guzzetti , like several safety experts interviewed , did not see the crashes as an indictment of the show .
He has attended the past 19 years and plans on " going until I die . "
Safety advice Tom Poberezny , president of the EAA , said the group emphasizes safety in advisories and courses it offers pilots but can't control what pilots do outside the show .
" What happens in Colorado and California ... it 's something we can't impact , " he said .
For pilots planning on attending the world 's largest fly - in , Bruce Landsberg , president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association 's Air Safety Foundation , offered some advice in a 2002 article .
After describing a series of mishaps he witnessed at a similar air show in the spring , the Sun 'n Fun Fly - in in Lakeland , Fla. , Landsberg said , " Expect the unexpected . "
" A touch of paranoia does n't hurt , " he added .

Six years ago archaeologists in York unearthed 80 skeletons .
Of the 60 or so complete skeletons , many showed signs of a violent death .
After years of research the York Archaeological Trust believes that they may have been gladiators .
One in three of the skeletons found had one arm at least 5 cm longer than the other .
This is consistent with the effect of one - sided work from an early age such as regular sword practice .
The cleaned up bones on the left are from the skeleton on the right .
Gladiator fights were brutal affairs .
This jaw bone shows evidence of a deep cut , probably inflicted by the fighter 's favoured weapon , a " gladius " sword , an example of which is shown below .
It 's not clear if the blow would have been fatal .
One of the skeletons had evidence of injuries inflicted by a large wild animal such as a bear , tiger or lion .
Here you can see the deep indentations to part of the pelvis .
On the right is a Roman marble relief showing a fight between a man and a lion .
One of the skeletons has what appear to be unusual solid metal leg rings .
They do n't appear to be shackles and the bones show signs of infection indicating they had been worn for some time .
They may have been symbolic , perhaps of slavery , the experts say .
Vanquished or dying gladiators were often finished off with a blow to the head .
This skull , showing the back of the head , has a long crack running from top left down to the bottom right , evidence of having received a heavy blow with a hammer type weapon .
Fifty of the 61 complete skeletons had been decapitated .
This cervical vertebra shows a clean cut to the " spinous process " indicating that a mortally wounded or losing fighter was dispatched with a sword thrust through the neck .

Sir Alex Ferguson has accused the Football Association of handicapping England at the World Cup through its failure to introduce a winter break to the Premier League season .
The Manchester United manager has been a long - time advocate of halting the season in January and believes England 's dire performances in South Africa provide overwhelming evidence to support his argument .
Among the many reasons offered for Wayne Rooney 's lacklustre World Cup was fatigue following the end of United 's domestic campaign , when the England striker also suffered an ankle injury in the Champions League quarter - finals .
Ferguson insists England 's problems are more deep - rooted and stem from the demand on players throughout December and by TV .
Whether his proposal will be considered , however , appears unlikely , as the issue is not on the FA 's agenda at present and was not mentioned in a wide - ranging statement on improving the national team from the organisation this week .
" The FA has to give the country the best possible chance of doing well in the World Cup , " said the United manager .
" Because of the nature of our game and because of the demands from TV to have a programme every week , the idea of a winter break , which I was first talking about 30 years ago in Scotland and have done since I came down to England , nothing has happened about it .
They must realise that , going into the World Cup , they have handicapped their team . "
Resting players after a gruelling festive period , Ferguson believes , could give England an opportunity to match Germany 's consistent success in international competitions .
He added : " The English season is exhausting .
Most Decembers we play between eight and nine games at the worst time of the year .
The pitches are heavier , the weather is worse and then in the second half of the season you 'll find a lot of players at all clubs carrying strains , pulls , but because of the importance of the games they keep on playing .
" And then when they get to the end of the season and have a major tournament like a World Cup or European Championship they are not 100 % fit , they can't be .
They need that rest factor which brings the energy back into the system .
Germany always take that month - long break in January and they always seem to do better in World Cups than anyone ever expects . "
Last week Ferguson conceded that Rooney will be haunted by his disappointing World Cup but is adamant that , at club level , the 24 - year - old who scored 34 goals last season is on an upwards trajectory that will see him become " the complete footballer " .
" He had an improvement in terms of his timing and movement in the penalty box and his positioning was improved from the previous season , " said the Scot , reflecting on last season .
" He got us over 30 goals and if he does that again and adds a little bit to his game then that is what we expect .
" The boy has got an incredible armoury of talent and what we have to do is to wait for that maturity .
We also do nurture it and try to advise and coach in a fashion which will improve his game .
But the most important thing I think he needs now is maturity and , when he gets that , I think you will see the complete footballer . "
Ferguson pinpointed refereeing decisions in United 's two league defeats by Chelsea as a major factor in the club 's failure to land a fourth successive title .
" I think there were two or three decisions against us , refereeing decisions , that killed us in both games , " he claimed .
" We only needed one point , if we had drawn one of the games we would have won the league . "
United warmed up for tomorrow 's pre-season friendly against Philadelphia Union by paying tribute to one of the city 's most famous fictional sons , Rocky .
In a break from the usual pre-season slog , their players recreated Sylvester Stallone 's pounding of the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum .
The United midfielder , Darron Gibson , has left the tour to return home to Ireland following the death of his grandmother .
He is expected to rejoin the squad before the tour moves on to Missouri .
Hi , folks .
This is Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee .
Stephanie Taylor , one of my co-founders , just sent out this email to our members .
She 's on a plane , so I wanted to share it with the Kos community which was such a big part of the Bill Halter movement experience :
Hey everyone ,
Last night was a really tough night .
You 've probably heard by now , but Bill Halter lost the Arkansas Senate primary to Blanche Lincoln in a squeaker .
The Democratic Party establishment and the White House teamed up with big corporations to protect one of the most corporate - owned senators in America -- and they barely won .
Today in news reports , the political insiders are gloating .
They 're proud that they beat thousands of people fighting for change .
But what the political establishment does n't realize is that the progressive movement built power in this election .
Bill Halter started nearly 20 points down .
He was n't taken seriously by most insiders .
But he gave Blanche Lincoln the scare of a lifetime with the help of a vibrant progressive movement -- thousands of people who committed time , talent , and small - dollar donations in the fight for change .
Why should they ?
Everyone in Washington made sure to avoid any strings being attached to the bailout that saved Wall Street and Goldman Sachs from ruin .
The problem now is that Goldman is certain that it ’s above the law of the land .
Unfortunately they ’re probably right as well .
They know they can get away with anything because they are on the short list of “ even bigger than too big to fail ” in the financial industry .
Until Washington decides to get serious about reform we will see more of this behavior .
There ’s a complete lack of appreciation for being saved and protecting their precious bonuses .
Phil Angelides , the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , said that while the overwhelming number of financial firms from which the FCIC has sought documents or information have complied , Goldman has not .
Instead , Goldman has been “ dumping ” an overwhelming volume of documents on the FCIC , which has a staff of just over 50 people .
“ We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our offices to dump a bunch of rubbish , ” Angelides said during a conference call following the announcement that the FCIC had sent Goldman a subpoena Friday .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard , backed by factional Labor Party warlords , has made a tilt at Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's leadership .
Mr Rudd has told a press conference that Ms Gillard visited him to request a leadership ballot .
Mr Rudd says the Labor caucus will vote on the party and Federal Government leadership at 9:00 am AEST .
" Earlier this evening Julia Gillard requested a ballot for the leadership .
I will be writing to the secretary of caucus to convene a special meeting at 9:00 am tomorrow morning , " he said .
" It 's important for these matters to be resolved quickly . "
Ms Gillard has confirmed she will run against her leader .
" I will be a candidate in tomorrow 's ballot , " she said .
Events moved quickly today as support for Mr Rudd collapsed around him , a situation first revealed by ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann .
Things came to a head late in the day as a number of Labor 's most senior figures , including Ms Gillard , met in Mr Rudd 's office .
The Prime Minister told the media he had lost the support of factional leaders in the party .
The Australian Workers Union , the Health Services Union and the right faction in many states have shifted their support to Ms Gillard .
" It has become apparent to me that a number of factional leaders no longer support my leadership , that is why it is imperative these matters be resolved , " he said .
" I was elected by the people of Australia to do a job .
I was not elected by the factional leaders of the Labor Party to do a job .
Although they may be seeking to do a job on me . "
But Mr Rudd says he believes he can win the leadership vote .
" We 've gone into some heavy weather of late and a few people have become , shall I say , a little squeamish at that , " he said .
" I 'm not for getting squeamish about those things , I am about continuing the business of reform and providing good strong proper government for the people of Australia , the people of Australia who elected me as Prime Minister , " he said .
Mr Rudd says if he wins the ballot he will not be giving ground to the right on issues like climate change and asylum seekers .
" If I return as the leader of the Government and Prime Minister , I will be very clear of one thing , this party and Government will not be lurching to the right on the question of asylum seekers , " he said .
He would not speculate whether Ms Gillard would stay on as Deputy PM if she lost the ballot .
But he defended his Government 's record , and said he was elected by the people of Australia , not the ALP 's factions .
" These are important reforms , infrastructure , health , hospital , closing the gap , also the apology .
As Prime Minister of the country I 'm proud of each and every one of these achievements , " he said .
Support for Gillard
ACT Labor Senator Kate Lundy says she will vote for Ms Gillard , who she says she will be an inspiring prime minister .
Australian Workers Union chief Paul Howes says his union is also backing Ms Gillard .
" Labor 's message had been lost for the last few weeks , and in fact months , under the Prime Minister 's leadership , " he told ABC's Lateline program .
" We have to look at what 's in the best interests of our members , of our union , to ensure that fairness remains in our members ' workplaces .
" We think that Julia Gillard is the best option to lead Labor to victory at the upcoming election . "
Cheating Tournaments
How to create tournaments that favor a player
Virginia Vassilevska is a post-doc at Berkeley , and she works in several aspects of computational complexity .
Her main area of expertise is in algorithms for various problems on graphs ; for example , she has worked on new algorithms for finding cliques in graphs .
Today I want to talk about some of Virginia ’s recent work on “ cheating . ”
I personally love the topic , and I think she has done some quite neat work on this problem .
Her work is on the complexity of “ cheating ” or “ fixing ” a single - elimination tournament .
This seems especially relevant today , since Wimbledon just started — it is the oldest and perhaps most important of all the Grand - Slam tennis tournaments .
More importantly it is a single - elimination tournament : lose one match and you go home .
Virginia ’s paper will be presented at this summer ’s AAAI .
This is a conference of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI ) , and this year it is in Atlanta on July 11 - 15 .
You might want to look at the list of papers — many of the papers are on exactly the same topics we have at STOC / FOCS .
There are papers on various algorithmic problems ranging from games , to economic problems , to routing problems , to approaches to solving SAT , and more .
I have never attended an AAAI conference , but I think I may start .
Easy for me this time , since I live in Atlanta .
The technical program looks very interesting , and I believe that many of the papers are relevant to complexity theory .
I am curious to see how the authors of papers at AAAI think about problems — perhaps they will have some new insights that will help us in our research .
Perhaps .
AAAI ’s conference does some things differently from how we do them at our main conferences .
For example , I noticed they have a senior track .
At first I thought great , finally something special for some of us who have been around a while .
But the truth is the track is for “ survey ” type talks .
Oh well .
The Senior Member Presentation Track provides an opportunity for established researchers to give a broad talk on a well - developed body of research , an important new research area , or a thoughtful critique of trends in the field .
I wonder if we should have this at STOC / FOCS ?
Would you like to hear one of the “ senior ” members talk about new ideas or trends ?
I am interested to see how these talks go .
Let ’s turn to Virginia ’s results on cheating .
Ratings
The names of the key concepts in this area are a bit confusing — this has nothing to do with Virginia , since the names are well established .
To make this discussion clearer , I feel I need to change the names a bit .
I hope this is okay .
I hope it does make it easier to follow .
As you would expect there are players — what other variable could be used for the number of players ?
A rating is a complete directed graph on the players : for every two distinct players and either
Think of as meaning that player always beats player — always .
Thus a rating is the bits of information of who beats whom .
Note , a rating is not the method used to decide anything .
It is just the name for all the information about who beats whom .
A rating is , of course , a “ tournament ” in the sense of graph theory .
Seems confusing — no ?
That is why I decided to use slightly different names for this discussion .
Right away there is an idealization here .
The assumption that a given player will always beat or lose to another player is clearly not true in real - life .
If it were true there would be much less interest in watching Wimbledon .
However , there are two reasons for making this assumption :
For one , if probabilities are added , then the computational complexity of cheating becomes much harder .
Even if the probabilities are restricted to be in the set this and many problems become NP - hard .
These results are due to Thuc Vu , Alon Altman and Yoav Shoham .
For another , even in the deterministic case the questions of how cheating works is already quite involved and interesting .
So we will continue to assume that the ratings are perfect .
If , then always beats .
Tournaments
A rating answers the question of whether or not a single player wins or loses to another player in head - to - head play .
The central question is to use this information to select the “ best ” player .
This is not easy , since as with voting problems there is no simple method for defining the best player .
Clearly , if one player can beat all the others , then there is no problem .
But if the rating has no such super - winner , then we need a mechanism to decide who is the best .
One popular method is the single - elimination tournament , which is what is being used right now at Wimbledon .
Such a method is just a binary tree : at the leaves are the players , and as they play the winner moves up to the ancestor node .
This continues until one player is at the root of the tree , and they are declared the “ best . ”
They get the silver trophy , they get millions in prize money , and they are declared the best .
See Virginia ’s paper for the formal definitions , but I hope it is clear what such a tree is .
For example if there were just four players , Alice , Bob , Fred , and Eva , then a possible tournament would be
Note Alice is the winner , but it could be that Eva beats Alice in head - to - head play .
Since they never play in this tree , Alice still wins .
Let ’s agree to call such trees tournaments .
Fixing Tournaments
Virginia proves a variety of interesting theorems — as usual see her pretty paper for the details .
Here I will give a high - level view of her results .
Suppose that is a rating of players .
The main question is when can we make a particular player the winner ?
This means : when is there a tournament so that when we play out the games the player is the winner .
Let ’s call this fixing the tournament in ‘s favor .
There are two kinds of results that Virginia proves .
First , there are necessary conditions on and for this to happen .
Clearly , there cannot be any player that beats everyone including .
If this were true , then there is no way to fix a tournament in ‘s favor .
Moreover , if the tree is balanced , then it is also easy to prove that must beat at least other players .
Second , Virginia proves some nice results about very strong players .
She shows that if is a “ super - king , ” then there always is a way to fix a tournament so that wins .
A player is a king provided for all other players either
or for some other player
Then is a super - king if is a king , but when there are at least players such that .
Theorem :
Let rate players .
If is a king and more over the number of so that is at least , then there is a tournament where wins .
Further this tournament can be constructed in polynomial time .
Open Problems
The main open question is : given a rating , determine if there is a way to fix a tournament so player wins .
She leaves open the question of whether or not this is NP - hard , or has a polynomial time algorithm .
I have no good intuition on this problem — I do not have a good guess whether the problem is easy or hard .
In the early days right after the discovery of the concept of NP - completeness , there was a “ theory ” advanced by Ian Munro .
He said that given a new problem , whether it was easy or hard was determined by the first person who thought about it .
If you looked at it first and tried to prove it was NP - complete , then it was hard ; if you first tried to find a polynomial algorithm , then it was easy .
According to this theory , it is too bad the first attempts at SAT were to prove that it was NP - complete .
I know Ian was kidding — he has a great sense of humor — but one wonders if there is something to this theory .
Finally , Ken Regan has a question : if the probabilities are “ consistent ” in the following technical sense , does this make deciding if a tournament can be fixed computationally easy ?
Assign to each player a skill rating , such as the Elo rating in Chess , which was created by Arpad Elo .
Let the probability of depend only on .
One can stipulate it to be 50 - 50 when , and be monotone - increasing in the difference .

Excellent article , Brad !
The thing is , material facts have no place in that unstable and spooky house - of - mirrors which Breitbart and his crew have fabricated so carelessly for themselves .
These are the kind of folks that are so used to lying to everyone else ( both as a paid profession and as a matter of habit ) , that as a consequence they even deceive themselves .
I mean , look at James OKeefe .
The guy puts on this big dog - n - pony show about pretending that he ’s “ not a conservative ” , that he ’s “ not interested in conserving anything . ”
He ’s a “ radical progressive ” , and he ’ll sure take you to task for suggesting otherwise .
He does this to lend an unconvincing veneer of variety to his drab and uniformly right - wing camp .
But the fact remains that O’Keefe IS a conservative , and this is made explicit by both his own words and actions .
O’Keefe works on behalf of explicitly conservative causes , he explicitly advocates for conservative ideals , he is bank - rolled by conservative extremists , he ’s received awards from conservative organizations , he ’s been trained through conservative activist groups , he speaks at conservative gatherings , and his own header for the Centurian ( the very magazine which he founded with funding from conservative think - tanks ) reads “ A Journal of Conservative Thought . ”
Okeefe IS a conservative , but he and his team refuse to admit that .
They insist on the stated lie that Okeefe is a “ radical progressive ” ... and they 'll shower you with Alinsky quotes from here - to - Timbucktoo to hammer the point home .
Like Beck ,
Okeefe is so used to lying , he has thus become the kind of person who simply denies what he had said or done five minutes beforehand .
This kind of self - deception ( at which Breitbart 's crew is only bested by Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin ) speaks to a person who is more than just a liar .
It speaks to a disturbing lack of reflection and honesty by a fragmented personality whose only touch - stone is the morbid hallucinations which he forces others to indulge .
Its speaks of the kind of person who would have you deny your own senses in favor of his contrived fantasy .
That ’s what Breitbart , his sites , his funders , his audience , and all his contributors are entirely about .
Facts have no place in that world .

SreeBee @4 provides some excellent insights , except that I do not believe that the word " conservative " aptly applies to the likes of Breitbart , Palin or the rest of the hard - right echo chamber .
I believe that former Vice President Henry Wallace was far more accurate when , on April 9 , 1944 , while our nation was engaged in a life - and - death struggle with fascism in Europe , Wallace produced an op - ed for The New York Times : The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of information .
With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money and more power .
They claim to be superpatriots , but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution .
They demand free enterprise but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest .
Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that , using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously , they may keep the common man in eternal subjugation .
American fascist appears a far more apt descriptor for this crowd whose prevarications have duped the useful idiots / know - nothings who call themselves the " tea baggers . "

Breitbart is a tool , Brad you have done an excellent job exposing this .
However Kagan herself is a someone that I am very skeptical of - to be light with my words .
( tool would be an appropriate term for her too )
Why ?
Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan has gotten an angry thumbs - down from 9/11 family members who say she played a key role in quashing a lawsuit that accused the Saudi kingdom of helping finance the terror attacks .
“ Kagan is the main reason why the Supreme Court ruled against the 9/11 families , ” said William Doyle , who lost his son in the Twin Towers .
aye mas ?
She filed a brief to the Supreme Court last May , arguing that the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act shielded Saudi princes from the suit ’s claims that they gave money to Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders or to charities that funneled funds to al Qaeda .
Kagan cited “ the potentially significant foreign - relations consequences of subjecting another sovereign state to suit . ”
The Supreme Court declined to hear the case .
Disgusting !
She is obviously for the Corporate Mega - Empire which deems it OK to blame 3000 deaths ( 9/11 ) on an innocent party ( Al Qaeda does not produce thermite ) and start subsequent global wars with costing ALL of us our very future .

@ Chris Hooten ( # 7 ) and Earnest A. Canning ( #8 ) Hello and good tidings to both of you !
Chris , I think you hit the nail on the head .
Like Glenn Beck , Breitbart displays all the classic symptoms of a serious tooter .
Beck has at least admitted that he ’s had a coke problem .
And if he isnt still using , then the drug has clearly had a permanently debilitating effect on his mind ( sort of like Rush with Oxycontin . )
But aside from his perpetual belligerence , Breitbart definitely oozes all the habitual lying , the creepy megalomania and the paranoid , fantasy - prone motivations typical of someone so enfeebled by that addiction .
His adoring and unquestioning fans have no idea what they are dealing with .
Earnest , I agree with you completely when you say ( quite eloquently , I might add ) “ that I do not believe that the word conservative aptly applies to the likes of Breitbart , Palin or the rest of the hard - right echo chamber . ”
Certainly , I know many people who identify as conservative , and who definitely do not represent the kind of insanity evidenced and marshaled by the likes of Breitbart or Palin .
And of course , Eisenhower would not have felt any common cause with our modern , hard - right extremists ... in fact , I think he explicitly warned against the kind of body which they now have become .
So indeed , I agree with what you are saying .
My point was that within this hard - right political continuum , we find a chronic and wide - spread inability to be candid , honest and accountable about ones own actions , background or words .
Breitbart , Palin and their ilk cannot be honest about anything they do or say .
It ’s really obvious , but their audience never questions them on this , and that is really creepy .
Certainly base hypocrisy , lying , hyperbole and back - peddling are not at all uncommon to either side of the political divide .
But ( almost in lock - step with Rove or Cheney ) Breitbart , Palin and Beck have somersaulted those qualities into something so monstrously refined , it belongs more properly to the Witch - Hammer than to civil political discourse .
O’keefe is a perfect example of that monolithic dishonesty .
His whole shtik about not being someone who identifies as conservative is belied by his explicitly ( and thoroughly ) fart - right resume .
But even when this is evident and in plain sight ( eg , his own title for his own college rag ) , he ’ll press out an unconvincing facade patterned with obscure Alinksy quotes and bold - faced denials about his actual , and transparently visible platform .
That deliberate obfuscation sends up a big red flag ---" this person cannot and will not be honest about the most basic and verifiable facts . ”
I ’m sure you ’ve seen that wonderful clip of Lewis Black ( gotta luv him ! ) calling out Beck for pretty much the same thing– Beck - “ I ’m not accusing Al Gore of being a Nazi or anything like that ... ”
Black -“ YES YOU ARE !!!!
YOU JUST DID !!!! ”
These people just do n’t seem to listen to themselves .
But what ’s infinitely more weird , is that there is a type of hypnosis / denial surrounding the whole thing –
“ You arent seeing what you ’ve actually seen me doing ... you are seeing that I ’d never accused Al Gore of being a Nazi ” - or “ I ( the founder of something I subtitled “ A Journal of Conservative Thought ” from a far - right think tank ) am not a conservative at all ... ” - or “ There is no racism in the Tea - parties ” , - or “ I never called myself a Maverick ” , - or “ I never encouraged people to target those who voted for Health Care reform ” , - or “ Despite my repeated refusals to interview with CNN when they called me about my bs ACORN tapes ( on the very day I released them ) , CNN is ignoring my bs story ! ”
Again , while lying and hypocrisy are all too prevalent in the political world ( bar none ) , these people have really actualized such a thoroughly altered “ ( un) reality ” , that it deserves to be in a different category all together .
Orwellian cliche ’s are far too common nowadays , but Beck , Palin , O’Keefe , Breitbart , and all of their colleagues and following have achieved such a complete approximation of Double Think it would do Oceania quite proud .
This is " Generation Rove . "
Anyhow guys , thanks for the replies , and have a great Spring !!!!

@ Earnest A. Canning ( #8 ) Hi again Earnest , I know I really poured out a lot above , but your reply gave me pause to consider another difference between the Breitbart style of far - right creepiness versus true conservatism .
The use to which Breitbart puts the internet is one centered around smearing .
Breitbart and his crew use partial / doctored sound - bytes and fragmented text to malign , embarrass , harass , misrepresent etc.. all as part of some politically motivated ( and utterly insidious ) online spectacle .
The constant breech of personal privacy which Breitbart has made his trade - mark OUGHT to be something to which real conservatives and libertarians would take exception .
By definition , they should .
But such ironies are part and parcel of the modern far - right .
E.g. , while claiming that Obama supporters were trying to indoctrinate children ( since a song sung by school - children about Black History Month mentioned Obama ) , groups like FeedomWorks REALLY DO force small kids to engage in over - the - phone political harassment dealing with subjects they are far too young to figure out .
It ’s like that movie , “ Jesus Camp ” .
I also think its interesting that , with his “ Big ” Sites , Breitbart has basically become the over - bearing , ultra - conformist , Borg - like assimilation - complex which the far - right claims to fear in both the UN and the Obama administration .
Again Earnest , thanks for the reply , and have a wonderful Spring !!!! (

Brian @ 9 ; Hooten @ 10 This is from Glenn Greenwald ’s blog of 5/10 / 10 .
It is one of a number he has written on the subject , all powerfully illuminating ... highly recommended .
Excerpts
It 's anything but surprising that President Obama has chosen Elena Kagan to replace John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court .
Nothing is a better fit for this White House than a blank slate , institution - loyal , seemingly principle - free careerist who spent the last 15 months as the Obama administration 's lawyer vigorously defending every one of his assertions of extremely broad executive authority .
The Obama administration is filled to the brim with exactly such individuals --- as is reflected by its actions and policies --- and this is just one more to add to the pile .
Obama chooses an individual with very few stated beliefs who makes the Right quite comfortable ( even as they go through the motions of opposing her ) .
As Kevin Drum writes : [ R ] ight now Obama has the biggest Democratic majority in the Senate he 's ever going to have .
So why not use it to ensure a solidly progressive nominee like Diane Wood instead of an ideological cipher like Kagan ? . . . .
When Obama compromises on something like healthcare reform , that 's one thing .
Politics sometimes forces tough choices on a president .
But why compromise on presidential nominees ?
Why Ben Bernanke ?
Why Elena Kagan ?
He does n't have to do this .
Unfortunately , the most likely answer is : he does it because he wants to .
... Obama would not want to choose someone like Diane Wood .
If you were Barack Obama , would you want someone on the Supreme Court who has bravely insisted on the need for Constitutional limits on executive authority , resolutely condemned the use of Terrorism fear - mongering for greater government power , explicitly argued against military commissions and indefinite detention , repeatedly applied the progressive approach to interpreting the Constitution on a wide array of issues , insisted upon the need for robust transparency and checks and balances , and demonstrated a willingness to defy institutional orthodoxies even when doing so is unpopular ?
Of course you would n't .
Why would you want someone on the Court who has expressed serious Constitutional and legal doubts about your core policies ?
Do you think that an administration that just yesterday announced it wants legislation to dilute Miranda rights in the name of Scary Terrorists --- and has seized the power to assassinate American citizens with no due process --- wants someone like Diane Wood on the Supreme Court ?
One final thought about Kagan for now .
As I said from the beginning , the real opportunity to derail her nomination was before it was made , because the vast majority of progressives and Democrats will get behind anyone , no matter who it is , chosen by Obama .
That 's just how things work .
They 'll ignore most of the substantive concerns that have been raised about her , cling to appeals to authority , seize on personal testimonials from her Good Progressive friends , and try to cobble together blurry little snippets to assure themselves that she 's a fine pick .
In reality , no matter what they know about her ( and , more to the point , do n't know ) , they 'll support her because she 's now Obama 's choice , which means , by definition , that she 's a good addition to the Supreme Court .
Our politics is nothing if not tribal , and the duty of Every Good Democrat is now to favor Kagan 's confirmation .

Brad , this really was a ridiculous critique of my article on Big Journalism .
As a former board member of the PDA , and as someone who had touted the support of Dennis Kucinich and John Conyers in his election campaign , I very much doubt that Mr. Bonifaz would dispute that his political views place him well to the left even within the Democratic party .
The fact that he had also supported the impeachment of Clinton could be viewed as only reinforcing this point , since most hardcore liberals viewed Clinton only slightly more favorably than most conservatives .
The primary point of my article was that multiple media outlets had covered Kagan 's political donations but had somehow missed ( or intentionally omitted ) her contribution to Bonifaz .
I actually downplayed the ultimate significance of this with regards to Kagan 's nomination .
I stand by my assessment of Bonifaz ' political orientation , but you are certainly entitled to disagree .

Morgen tried to defend his shameful " journalism " @ 14 with : Brad , this really was a ridiculous critique of my article on Big Journalism .
Not nearly as ridiculous as the critique you forwarded in your BJ article , however , wherein you suggest an absurd conspiracy theory --- with absolutely no evidence to support it in any way , even as absurd as it is --- that the Boston Herald is somehow working to protect Obama and Kagan by hiding a $ 500 donation to a constitutional attorney who specializes in non-partisan election law issues .
Not only did you fail to point out his adamant support of both the impeachment and conviction of Bill Clinton , but you also failed to point out his non-partisan work as the legal director of the non-partisan VoterAction.org , which has fought for clean elections for both Republicans and Democrats alike .
You attempted to smear a good person out of desperation to find something , anything , to support your partisan political agenda .
I appreciate that that 's what Andy Breitbart does , and what his sites are all about it , but it does n't make it any less loathsome and McCarthyesque .
The fact that he had also supported the impeachment of Clinton could be viewed as only reinforcing this point , since most hardcore liberals viewed Clinton only slightly more favorably than most conservatives .
Yes , it could be " viewed " that way , if one was so desperate to support an unsupportable smear that they were willing to twist and torture the facts to fit their agenda --- or , as the Downing Street Memos which Bonifaz helped publicized said , to " fix [ the ] intelligence and facts ... around the policy " .
The primary point of my article was that multiple media outlets had covered Kagan 's political donations but had somehow missed ( or intentionally omitted ) her contribution to Bonifaz .
What evidence do you have that they " intentionally omitted " it ?
Or even that it was NOT worth missing ?
You make a silly attempt at a high - tech lynching , without bothering to learn about who it is you are smearing , or even offering him the chance to respond to your silliness .
It is " journalism " at its very worst .
I actually downplayed the ultimate significance of this with regards to Kagan 's nomination .
I stand by my assessment of Bonifaz ' political orientation , but you are certainly entitled to disagree .
Guilt by association seems to be all that you folks have left .
It 's a shame , since there is much that legitimate criticism that you could bring against the Kagan nomination , but , as usual , you all go for the personal smears --- and ham - fisted ones at that .
Good luck with your campaign .

@ Morgan , # 14 , Hi Morgan of BJ fame , I have a question , somewhat off topic , regarding your place of employment .
Since you work for a site that claims to ferret out bias in the media , and since you claim to be concerned with “ misses ” and “ intentional omissions ” in the news , could you answer something ?
Why have n’t you addressed any of the faulty aspects of the ACORN videos from your own James O’Keefe ?
Even when questioned about it , why does your boss completely avoid the discussion ?
Can you explain why your boss , having known ( by his own admission ) what was on those tapes , opted to go with a misleading and strategically edited launch ?
Why , for example , is the tragic tale of “ Kenya ” ( “ Eden ” , or whatever ) and the physical peril which she claimed for her charges , almost completely ( if not totally ) edited out of O’Keefe ’s posted tapes ?
Why does the abusive pimp “ Sonny ” , who formed such an important part of Hannah ’s story to ACORN workers , play almost no role in O ’keefe ’s posted tapes ?
That ’s a pretty serious ( and obviously intentional ) omission .
( Consider this — if you have footage of Volda from Brooklyn ’s ACORN addressing Hannah on how to protect herself from “ Sonny ” , but then edit that footage to make it seem like she ’s advising Hannah to hide $ $ from the government , then that ’s not just an omission , that ’s a bold - faced lie . )
Why do these tapes have misleading titles that suggest horrific crimes like a “ child - prostitution ring ” , when that is not at all what the unedited tapes show any evidence for ?
Why are statements by ACORN members edited down to say things which they werent ?
Why does your employer continue to avoid these serious lapses in his own production ?
There ’s a saying , “ Clean your own house before faulting anyone else ’s " ... , you guys at BJ have a LOT of work to do explaining your own “ intentional omissions ” before you do anything else .
Otherwise , you just look like bold - faced liars and shameless hypocrites .

Last week Hank Shaw posted this piece on The Atlantic Food Channel about his favorite books for foragers .
It ’s an excellent list of must - reads for anyone interested in wild edible plants and mushrooms .
Here are a few more books that I ’d recommend adding to your library .
Two of my all - time favorite mushroom guides are 100 Edible Mushrooms by Michael Kuo and Edible Wild Mushrooms of Illinois and Surrounding States : A Field - to - Kitchen Guide by Joe McFarland and Gregory M. Mueller .
The later is absolutely essential for mushroom hunting in Illinois , Missouri , Wisconsin , Iowa , Indiana , or Kentucky .
For plants , I like The Forager ’s Harvest : A Guide to Identifying , Harvesting , and Preparing Edible Wild Plants by Samuel Thayer .
Unlike a lot of wild food guides out there , Thayer avoids recycling common misinformation about edible plants .
Plus , he focuses on plants that actually taste good – no survival food here !
Do you have a favorite foraging guide ?

WASHINGTON 
The effort to advance a major climate change bill through the Senate this summer collapsed Thursday even as President Obama signed into law another top Democratic priority  a bill to restore unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who have been out of work for six months or more .
Bowing to political reality , Senator Harry Reid , the Nevada Democrat and majority leader , said the Senate would not take up legislation intended to reduce carbon emissions blamed as a cause of climate change , but would instead pursue a more limited measure focused on responding to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and tightening energy efficiency standards .
“ We know where we are , ” Mr. Reid told reporters after reviewing the state of energy legislation with Senate Democrats and administration officials .
“ We know that we do n’t have the votes . ”
The decision was a major disappointment to conservation groups and lawmakers who had invested months in trying to negotiate legislation .
The House last year passed its own climate change bill , a proposal that has created a backlash for some politically vulnerable Democrats .
The outcome was also viewed as a setback by some utility executives who had hoped that Congress would set predictable rules governing carbon pollution .
PHILADELPHIA -
An airline pilot who used his cell phone to take photos up a teenager 's skirt at Philadelphia International Airport has pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy .
US Airways pilot Joseph Pereira was sentenced Tuesday in Philadelphia Family Court to one year of probation .
He will be evaluated for a sex offender treatment program .
Authorities say Pereira used his cell phone to take photos under the skirt of a 15 - year - old girl on June 24 .
US Airways spokesman Morgan Durrant says the 55 - year - old pilot from Wexford , Pa. , is suspended .
Pereira earlier resigned as a girls softball coach at North Allegheny High School , near Pittsburgh .
School officials said there have been no other complaints about Pereira in 13 years of coaching .
Two Americans driving back to El Paso , Tex. , last December after an afternoon across the border in Ciudad Juarez found themselves in the middle of Mexico 's drug war , alleging torture and police corruption from behind foreign bars , The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday .
Mexico 's military said it found two suitcases full of marijuana in the cab of the Americans ' pickup truck .
Two soldiers later testified that they drove the two Americans to a military compound on the outskirts of town , questioned them briefly , then turned them over to civilian authorities .
The Americans were charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell .
Shohn Huckabee , 23 , and Carlos Quijas , 36 , who are being held in a Ciudad Juarez jail , said Mexican soldiers planted the marijuana in their truck .
When they arrived at the military base , they said , they were blindfolded , tied up , hit with rifle butts , shocked with electricity and threatened with death .
Complaints about the military 's tactics have risen along with the death toll as authorities try to break the drug cartels ' stranglehold on Mexican society .
The human rights office of the state of Chihuahua , where Ciudad Juarez is located , is investigating some 465 cases of alleged abuse and torture of Mexican citizens by soldiers .
Gustavo de la Rosa , the office 's ombudsman in Ciudad Juarez , said he knows of about 70 cases in which soldiers are alleged to have planted evidence , including some involving suitcases packed with marijuana .
Allegations of mistreatment of suspects caught the eye of the U.S. Senate committee that oversees financial aid to Mexico for its war on drugs .
In an internal report , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it received allegations of serious human rights violations in Ciudad Juarez last year .
The report cites an unidentified young man picked up in El Paso who said he was arrested by the Mexican military in Ciudad Juarez and beaten and shocked .
The man said he was released after the military concluded he had no useful information about trafficking , the report says .
Huckabee said he was subjected to similar tactics .
" I believe what was done to me was torture , " he said in an interview .
" When I did not answer their questions , they shocked me with a wire that was in my hands .
My whole body froze up .
The pain went from bearable to a point where I could n't even talk . "
Mexican prosecutors said the two men were caught red-handed .
Two soldiers involved in their arrest testified at their trial that they counted 99 packages of marijuana in the suitcases , weighing more than 100 pounds .
In a written response to questions from The Wall Street Journal , the Mexican army said it briefly took the Americans to the military compound but did not torture them .
" We categorically deny that soldiers use these methods , and say their actions are in total adherence to the law , " the statement said .

Consumers are nervous , but the Dow , which was below 8,000 on the day President Obama was inaugurated , is now over 10,000 .
In a rational universe , American business would be very happy with Mr. Obama .
But no .
All the buzz lately is that the Obama administration is “ antibusiness . ”
And there are widespread claims that fears about taxes , regulation and budget deficits are holding down business spending and blocking economic recovery .
How much truth is there to these claims ?
None .
Business spending is indeed low , but no lower than one would have expected given widespread overcapacity and weak consumer spending .
Business leaders are feeling unloved , but giving them a group hug wo n’t cure what ails the economy .
Ask the Obama - is - scaring - business crowd for some actual evidence supporting their claim , and they ’ll tell you that business spending on plant and equipment is at its lowest level , as a share of G.D.P. , in 40 years .
What they do n’t mention is the fact that business investment always falls sharply when the economy is depressed .
After all , why should businesses expand their production capacity when they ’re not selling enough to use the capacity they already have ?
And in case you have n’t noticed , we still have a deeply depressed economy .
Ever since we heard that Nikon was joining the league of mirrorless cameras , the whole world 's been waiting for its arch rival to make the next move in the battle of smaller cameras .
Today , Canon finally gave away some hints about which camp it'll side with -- probably just sticking with traditional DSLRs , but smaller .
Canon 's Masaya Maeda did n't share any specific details , but here 's how he dodged Reuters ' inquiry : " It 's not a question of whether or not you have a mirror .
There is a consumer need for good - quality cameras to be made smaller .
We will meet this need . "
And to add some icing to that bland statement , Maeda reinforced that it would n't be a challenge for his company to retain a mirror ( hence a viewfinder , which is essential for obtaining better results and higher shooting rates ) in a smaller design , and that they 've made very small SLR cameras before ( likely in reference to the film era ) .
Whatever happens , here 's hoping that Canon 's new toy wo n't be any bigger than the much - loved G11
Part of the Series The Public Intellectual
We live at a time that might be appropriately called the age of the disappearing intellectual , a disappearance that marks with disgrace a particularly dangerous period in American history .
While there are plenty of talking heads spewing lies , insults and nonsense in the various media , it would be wrong to suggest that these right - wing populist are intellectuals .
They are neither knowledgeable nor self - reflective , but largely ideological hacks catering to the worst impulses in American society .
Some obvious examples would include John Stossel calling for the repeal of that “ section of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that bans discrimination in public places . ” [ 1 ]
And , of course , there are the more famous corporate - owned talking heads such as Glenn Beck , Charles Krauthammer , Bill O’Reilly and Rush Limbaugh , all of whom trade in reactionary world views , ignorance , ideological travesties and outlandish misrepresentations – all the while wrapping themselves in the populist creed of speaking for everyday Americans .
In a media scape and public sphere that view criticism , dialog and thoughtfulness as a liability , such anti-intellectuals abound , providing commentaries that are nativist , racist , reactionary and morally repugnant .
But the premium put on ignorance and the disdain for critical intellectuals is not monopolized by the dominant media , it appears to have become one of the few criteria left for largely wealthy individuals to qualify for public office .
One typical example is Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , who throws out inanities such as labeling the Obama administration a “ gangster government . ” [ 2 ]
Bachmann refuses to take critical questions from the press because she claims that they unfairly focus on her language .
She has a point .
After all , it might be difficult to support statements such as the claim that “ the US government used the census information to round up the Japanese [ Americans ] and put them in concentration camps . ” [ 3 ]
Another typical example can be found in Congressman Joe Barton ’s apology to BP for having to pay for damages to the government stemming from its disastrous oil spill .
This “ upscaling of ignorance ” [ 4 ] gets worse .
Richard Cohen , writing in The Washington Post about Sen. Michael Bennett , was shocked to discover that he was actually well - educated and smart but had to hide his qualifications in his primary campaign so as to not undermine his chance of being re-elected .
Cohen concludes that in politics , “ We have come to value ignorance . ” [ 5 ]
He further argues that the notion that a politician should actually know something about domestic and foreign affairs is now considered a liability .
He writes :
[ W ]e now have politicians who lack a child ’s knowledge of government .
In Nevada , Sharron Angle has won the GOP Senate nomination espousing phasing out Social Security and repealing the income tax as well as abolishing that durable conservative target , the Education Department .
Similarly , in Connecticut , Linda McMahon , a former pro wrestling tycoon , is running commercials so adamantly anti-Washington you would think she ’s an anarchist .
In Arizona Andy Goss , a Republican congressional candidate , suggests requiring all members of Congress to live in a barracks .
This might be tough on wives , children and the odd cocker spaniel , but what the hell .
Nowadays , all ideas are equal . [ 6 ]
The embrace of a type of rabid individualism , anti-intellectualism and political illiteracy is also at work in the Tea Party movement .
As social protections disappear , jobs are lost , uncertainty grows and insecurity prevails , Tea Party members express anger over a weakened social state that represents one of the few institutions capable of providing the capital , policies and safety nets necessary to protect those who have been shaken by the economic recession .
And , yet , in light of what Bob Herbert calls “ the most painful evidence imaginable of the failure of laissez - faire economics and the destructive force of the alliance of big business and government against the interests of ordinary Americans , ” [ 7 ] the Tea Party movement wants to abolish government and expand even more the deregulated capitalism that has unsettled the lives of so many of its members .
Ignorance prevails around both the movement ’s policy recommendations and its often racist protest against “ the election of a “ foreign born ’ – African - American to the presidency . ”
As J. M. Bernstein pointed out in a New York Times opinion piece :
When it comes to the Tea Party ’s concrete policy proposals , things get fuzzier and more contradictory : keep the government out of health care , but leave Medicare alone ; balance the budget , but do n’t raise taxes ; let individuals take care of themselves , but leave Social Security alone ; and , of course , the paradoxical demand not to support Wall Street , to let the hard - working producers of wealth get on with it without regulation and government stimulus , but also to make sure the banks can lend to small businesses and responsible homeowners in a stable but growing economy . [ 8 ]
As the belief in the libertarian agent , free of all dependencies and social responsibilities blows up in the face of the current economic meltdown , anger replaces critique and ignorance informs politics .
Bernstein thinks that members of the Tea Party are angry because they have been jolted into recognizing how fragile their so - called individual freedom actually is and that it is the government that is somehow responsible for making them feel so vulnerable .
Maybe so , but there is also something else at work here , less metaphysical and more pedagogical – a kind of intellectual vacuum produced at different levels of American society that cultivates ignorance , limits choices , legitimizes political illiteracy and promotes violence .
Another version of anti-intellectualism prevails in universities where students are urged by some conservative groups to spy on their professors to make sure they do not say anything that might actually get students to think critically about their beliefs .
At the same time , faculty are being relegated to nontenured positions and because of the lack of tenure , which offers some guarantees , are afraid to say controversial things inside and outside the classroom for fear of being fired . [ 9 ]
Moreover , as the university becomes more corporatized , intellectual and critical thought is transformed into a commodity to be sold to the highest bidder .
I am not suggesting that so called professed intellectuals are not influencing policy , appearing in the media or teaching in the universities , but that these are not critical intellectuals .
On the contrary , they are accommodating ideologues , content to bask in the politics of conformity and the rewards of official power .
Underlying this drift toward the disappearing critical intellectual and the erasure of substantive critique is a regime of economic Darwinism in which a culture of ignorance serves to both depoliticize the larger public while simultaneously producing individual and collective subjects necessary and willing to participate in their own oppression .
The cheerful robot is not simply an opprobrium for ignorance , it is a metaphor for the systemic construction in American society of a new mode of depoliticized and thoughtless form of agency .
With the advent of neoliberalism , or what some call free - market fundamentalism , we have witnessed the production and widespread adoption throughout society of what I want to call the politics of economic Darwinism .
As a theater of cruelty and a mode of public pedagogy , economic Darwinism undermines all forms of solidarity while simultaneously promoting the logic of unrestricted individual responsibility .
But there is more at stake here than an unchecked ideology of privatization . [ 10 ]
For example , as the welfare state is dismantled , it is being replaced by the harsh realities of the punishing state as social problems are increasingly criminalized and social protections are either eliminated or fatally weakened .
The harsh values of this new social order can be seen in the increasing incarceration of young people , the modeling of public schools after prisons and state policies that bail out investment bankers , but leave the middle and working classes in a state of poverty , despair and insecurity .
But it can also be seen in the practice of socialism for the rich .
This is a practice in which government supports for the poor , unemployed , sick and elderly are derided because they either contribute to an increase in the growing deficit or they undermine the market - driven notion of individual responsibility .
And yet , the same critics defend , without irony , government support for the rich , the bankers , the permanent war economy , or any number of subsidies for corporations as essential to the life of the nation , which is simply an argument that benefits the rich and powerful and legitimates the deregulated wild west of casino capitalism .
Of course , this form of economic Darwinism is not enforced simply through the use of the police and other repressive apparatuses ; it is endlessly reproduced through the cultural apparatuses of the new and old media , public and higher education , as well as through the thousands of messages and narratives we are exposed to daily in multiple commercial spheres .
In this discourse , the economic order is either sanctioned by God or exists simply as an extension of nature .
In other words , the tyranny and suffering that is produced through the neoliberal theater of cruelty is unquestionable , as unmovable as an urban skyscraper .
Long - term investments are now replaced by short - term gains and profits , while compassion is viewed as a weakness and democratic public values are scorned because they subordinate market considerations to the common good .
Morality in this instance becomes painless , stripped of any obligations to the other .
As the language of privatization , deregulation and commodification replaces the discourse of the public good , all things public , including public schools , libraries and public services , are viewed either as a drain on the market or as a pathology .
At the same time , inequality in wealth and income expands and spreads like a toxin through everyday life , poisoning democracy and relegating more and more individuals to a growing army of disposable human waste . [ 11 ]
The giant oil spill in the Gulf is rarely viewed as part of a much broader systemic crisis of democracy .
Instead , it is treated as an unfortunate disaster caused by corporate greed or negligence .
Celebrity culture puts much of the population in a moral coma and perpetual state of ignorance .
Coupled with a pedagogy of economic Darwinism that is spewed out daily in the mainstream media , large segments of the population are prevented from connecting the dots between their own personal troubles and larger social problems .
In this case , the larger structural elements of a corrupt economic system disappear , while the suffering and hardship continues and the bankers and other members of the financial criminal class run to the banks to deposit their obscene bonuses .
Under such circumstances , to paraphrase C. W. Mills , we are seeing the breakdown of democracy , the disappearance of critical thought and “ the collapse of those public spheres which offer a sense of critical agency and social imagination . ” [ 12 ]
Since the 1970s , we have witnessed the forces of market fundamentalism strip education of its public values , critical content and civic responsibilities as part of its broader goal of creating new subjects wedded to the logic of privatization , efficiency , flexibility , consumerism and the destruction of the social state .
Tied largely to instrumental purposes and measurable paradigms , many institutions of higher education are now committed almost exclusively to economic growth , instrumental rationality and preparing students for the workforce .
The question of what kind of education is needed for students to be informed and active citizens is rarely asked . [ 13 ]
Hence , it not surprising , for example , to read that “ Thomas College , a liberal arts college in Maine , advertises itself as Home of the Guaranteed Job ! ” [ 14 ]
Faculty within this discourse are defined largely as a subaltern class of low - skilled entrepreneurs , removed from the powers of governance and subordinated to the policies , values and practices within a market model of the university . [ 15 ]
Within both higher education and the educational force of the broader cultural apparatus – with its networks of knowledge production in the old and new media – we are witnessing the emergence and dominance of a form of a powerful and ruthless , if not destructive , market - driven notion of governance , teaching , learning , freedom , agency and responsibility .
Such modes of education do not foster a sense of organized responsibility central to a democracy .
Instead , they foster what might be called a sense of organized irresponsibility – a practice that underlies the economic Darwinism , public pedagogy and corruption at the heart of both the current recession and American politics .
The anti-democratic values that drive free - market fundamentalism are embodied in policies now attempting to shape diverse levels of higher education all over the globe .
The script has now become overly familiar and more and more taken for granted , especially in the United States and increasingly in Canada .
Shaping the neoliberal framing of public and higher education is a corporate - based ideology that embraces standardizing the curriculum , supporting top - down management , implementing more courses that promote business values and reducing all levels of education to job training sites .
For example , one university is offering a master ’s degree to students who commit to starting a high - tech company while another allows career officers to teach capstone research seminars in the humanities .
In one of these classes , the students were asked to “ develop a 30 - second commercial on their ‘ personal brand . ' ” [ 16 ]
The demise of democracy is now matched by the disappearance of vital public spheres and the exhaustion of intellectuals .
Instead of critical and public intellectuals , faculty are increasingly defined less as intellectuals than as technicians , specialist and grant writers .
Nor is there any attempt to legitimate higher education as a fundamental sphere for creating the agents necessary for an aspiring democracy .
In fact , the commitment to democracy is beleaguered , viewed less as a crucial educational investment than as a distraction that gets in the way of connecting knowledge and pedagogy to the production of material and human capital .
In short , higher education is now being retooled as part of a larger political project to bring it in tune with the authority and values fostering the advance of neoliberalism .
I think David Harvey is right in insisting , “ the academy is being subjected to neoliberal disciplinary apparatuses of various kinds [ while ] also becoming a place where neoliberal ideas are being spread . ” [ 17 ]
As a core political and civic institution , higher education rarely appears committed to addressing important social problems .
Instead , many have become unapologetic accomplices to corporate values and power and , in doing so , increasingly make social problems either irrelevant or invisible .
Steeped in the same market driven values that produced the 2008 global economic recession along with a vast amount of hardships and human suffering in many countries around the globe , higher education mimics the inequalities and hierarchies of power that inform the failed financial behemoths – banks and investment companies in particular – that have become public symbols of greed and corruption .
Not only does neoliberalism undermine civic education and public values , confuse education with training , but it also treats knowledge as a product , promoting a neoliberal logic that views schools as malls , students as consumers and faculty as entrepreneurs .
Just as democracy appears to be fading in the United States so is the legacy of higher education ’s faith in and commitment to democracy .
As the humanities and liberal arts are downsized , privatized and commodified , higher education finds itself caught in the paradox of claiming to invest in the future of young people while offering them few intellectual , civic and moral supports .
Higher education has a responsibility not only to search for the truth regardless of where it may lead , but also to educate students to make authority and power politically and morally accountable .
Though questions regarding whether the university should serve strictly public rather than private interests no longer carry the weight of forceful criticism they did in the past , such questions are still crucial in addressing the purpose of higher education and what it might mean to imagine the university ’s full participation in public life as the protector and promoter of democratic values .
What needs to be understood is that higher education may be one of the few institutions we have left in the United States where knowledge , values and learning offer a glimpse of the promise of education for nurturing public values , critical hope and a sense of civic responsibility .
It may be the case that everyday life is increasingly organized around market principles ; but confusing a market - determined society with democracy hollows out the legacy of higher education , whose deepest roots are moral , not commercial .
This is a particularly important insight in a society where the free circulation of ideas are not only being replaced by ideas managed by the dominant media , but where critical ideas are increasingly viewed or dismissed as banal , if not reactionary .
But there is more at stake than simply the death of critical thought , there is also the powerful influence of celebrity culture and the commodification of culture , both of which now create a powerful form of mass illiteracy that increasingly dominates all aspects of the wider cultural educational apparatus .
But mass illiteracy does more than undermine critical thought and depoliticize the public ; it also becomes complicit with the suppression of dissent .
Intellectuals who engage in dissent or a culture of questioning are often dismissed as either irrelevant , extremist , or un-American .
Anti-public intellectuals now dominate the larger cultural landscape , funded largely by right - wing institutes , eager to legitimate the worst forms of oppression as they nod , smile , speak in sound bites and willingly display their brand of moral cowardice .
At the same time , there are too few critical academics willing to defend higher education for its role in providing a supportive and sustainable culture in which a vibrant critical democracy can flourish .
As potential democratic public spheres , institutions of higher education are especially important at a time when any space that produces “ critical thinkers capable of putting existing institutions into question ” is under siege by powerful economic , military , and political interests . [ 18 ]
The increasing disappearance of any viable public sphere coupled with the reduction of the university to an outpost of business culture represents a serious political and pedagogical concern that should not be lost on either academics or those concerned about the purpose and meaning of higher education , if not the fate of democracy itself .
Democracy places civic demands upon its citizens and such demands point to the necessity of an education that is broad - based , critical and supportive of meaningful civic values , participation in self - governance and democratic leadership .
Only through such a formative and critical educational culture can students learn how to become individual and social agents , rather than merely disengaged spectators , able both to think otherwise and to act upon civic commitments that “ necessitate a reordering of basic power arrangements ” fundamental to promoting the common good and producing a meaningful democracy .
The current neoliberal regime that is wreaking havoc on the planet and the lives of millions cannot be addressed by future generations unless they have the capacities , knowledge , skills and motivation to think critically and act courageously .
This means giving them the knowledge and skills to make power visible and politics an important sphere of individual and collective struggle .
One measure of the degree to which higher education has lost its moral compass can be viewed in the ways in which it disavows any relationship between equity and excellence , eschews the discourse of democracy and reduces its commitment to learning to the stripped down goals of either preparing students for the workforce or teaching them the virtues of measurable utility .
While such objectives are not without merit , they have little to say about the role that higher education might play in influencing the fate of future citizens and the state of democracy itself , nor do they say much about what it means for faculty to be more than technicians or hermetic scholars .
In addition to promoting measurable skills and educating students to be competitive in the marketplace , academics are also required to speak a kind of truth , but as Stuart Hall points out , “ maybe not truth with a capital T , but … some kind of truth , the best truth they know or can discover [ and ] to speak that truth to power . ” [ 19 ]
Implicit in Hall ’s statement is an awareness that to speak truth to power is not a temporary and unfortunate lapse into politics on the part of academics : it is central to opposing all those modes of ignorance , whether they are market - based or rooted in other fundamentalist ideologies , that make judgments difficult and democracy dysfunctional .
In my view , academics have not only a moral and pedagogical responsibility to unsettle and oppose all orthodoxies , to make problematic the commonsense assumptions that often shape students ’ lives and their understanding of the world , but also to energize them to come to terms with their own power as individual and social agents .
Higher education , in this instance , as Pierre Bourdieu , Paulo Freire , Stanley Aronowitz , and other intellectuals have reminded us , cannot be removed from the hard realities of those political , economic and social forces that both support it and consistently , though in diverse ways , attempt to shape its sense of mission and purpose . [ 20 ]
Politics is not alien to higher education , but central to comprehending the institutional , economic , ideological and social forces that give it meaning and direction .
Politics also references the outgrowth of historical conflicts that mark higher education as an important site of struggle .
Rather than the scourge of either education or academic research , politics is a primary register of their complex relation to matters of power , ideology , freedom , justice and democracy .
Talking heads who proclaim that politics have no place in the classroom can as Jacques Ranciere points out “ look forward to the time when politics will be over and they can at last get on with political business undisturbed , ” especially as it pertains to the political landscape of the university . [ 21 ]
In this discourse , education as a fundamental basis for engaged citizenship , like politics itself , becomes a temporary irritant to be quickly removed from the hallowed halls of academia .
In this stillborn conception of academic labor , faculty and students are scrubbed clean of any illusions about connecting what they learn to a world “ strewn with ruin , waste and human suffering . ” [ 22 ]
As considerations of power , politics , critique and social responsibility are removed from the university , balanced judgment becomes code , as the famous sociologist C. Wright .
Mills points out , for “ surface views which rest upon the homogeneous absence of imagination and the passive avoidance of reflection .
A … vague point of equilibrium between platitudes . ” [ 23 ]
Under such circumstances , the university and the intellectuals that inhabit it disassociate higher education from larger public issues , remove themselves from the task of translating private troubles into social problems and undermine the production of those public values that nourish a democracy .
Needless to say , pedagogy is always political by virtue of the ways in which power is used to shape various elements of classroom identities , desires , values and social relations , but that is different from being an act of indoctrination .
Writing about the role of the social sciences , Mills had a lot to say about public intellectuals in the academy and , in fact , directly addressed the argument that such intellectuals had no right to try to save the world .
He writes :
I do not believe that social science will ‘ save the world ’ although I see nothing at all wrong with ‘ trying to save the - world ’ – a phrase which I take here to mean the avoidance of war and the re-arrangement of human affairs in accordance with the ideals of human freedom and reason .
Such knowledge as I have leads me to embrace rather pessimistic estimates of the chances .
But even if that is where we now stand , still we must ask : if there are any ways out of the crises of our period by means of intellect , is it not up to the social scientist to state them ? …
It is on the level of human awareness that virtually all solutions to the great problems must now lie . [ 24 ]
A large number of faculty exist in specialized academic bubbles cut off from both the larger public and the important issues that impact society .
While extending the boundaries of specialized scholarship is important , it is no excuse for faculty to become complicit in the transformation of the university into an adjunct of corporate and military power .
Too many academics have become incapable of defending higher education as a vital public sphere and unwilling to challenge those spheres of induced mass cultural illiteracy and firewalls of jargon that doom critically engaged thought , complex ideas and serious writing for the public to extinction .
Without their intervention as engaged intellectuals , the university defaults on its role as a democratic public sphere capable of educating an informed public , a culture of questioning and the development of a critical formative culture connected to the need , as Cornelius Castoriadis puts it , “ to create citizens who are critical thinkers capable of putting existing institutions into question so that democracy again becomes society ’s movement . ” [ 25 ]
For education to be civic , critical and democratic rather than privatized , militarized and commodified , educators must take seriously John Dewey ’s notion that democracy is a “ way of life ” that must be constantly nurtured and defended . [ 26 ]
Democracy is not a marketable commodity [ 27 ] and neither are the political , economic and social conditions that make it possible .
If academics believe that the university is a space for and about democracy , they need to profess more , not less , about eliminating inequality in the university , supporting academic freedom , preventing the exploitation of faculty , supporting shared modes of governance , rejecting modes of research that devalue the public good and refuse to treat students as merely consumers .
Academics have a distinct and unique obligation , if not political and ethical responsibility , to make learning relevant to the imperatives of a discipline , scholarly method , or research specialization .
But more importantly , academics as engaged scholars can further the activation of knowledge , passion , values and hope in the service of forms of agency that are crucial to sustaining a democracy in which higher education plays an important civic , critical and pedagogical role .
If democracy is a way of life that demands a formative culture , educators can play a pivotal role in creating forms of pedagogy and research that enable young people to think critically , exercise judgment , engage in spirited debate and create those public spaces that constitute “ the very essence of political life . ” [ 28 ]
Economic Darwinism shapes more than economies ; it also produces ideas , values , power , morality and regimes of truth .
Most importantly , regardless of its arrogance , it has to legitimate its power and theater of cruelty .
Challenging its modes of legitimation and misrepresentations at the point of production is precisely an important task and mode of politics that should be addressed by critical intellectuals .
Central ideological issues pushed by the advocates of neoliberalism extending from the myth of free markets , free trade , the limitless power of individual responsibility , the evils of the welfare state , the necessity of low taxes , the economic benefits of a permanent war economy , deregulation , privatization and commodification , along with the danger of giving the government any sense of public responsibility should be challenged head on in numerous venues by critical intellectuals .
As David Harvey points out , academics have a “ crucial role to play in trying to resist the neoliberalization of the academy , which is largely about organizing within the academy … creating spaces within the academy , where things could be said , written , discussed and ideas promulgated .
Right now those spaces are more under threat then they have been in many years . ” [ 29 ]
All the more reason for academics to view the academy as a viable sphere worth struggling over .
Intellectuals outside of the academy can also work to use their specific skills at various points of production to raise consciousness and the level of intellectual discourse in the spirit of creating agents capable of challenging and seeing beyond the existing neoliberal mode of economic Darwinism .
Such actions not only help intellectuals to engage in self - critical reflection , play a viable role in creating the conditions for emergent critical public spheres , but they also contribute to a formative culture of change that enables the development of a broad anti-capitalist movement .
What Harvey is rightfully suggesting is that academics can do more than “ teach the conflicts ” and provide the conditions that enable young people to speak truth to power .
They can also organize within the academy to prevent the ongoing militarization and neoliberalization of higher education .
They can work together with staff , students , part - time faculty , and other interested parties to form unions , embrace a notion of democratic governance and help to position the university as public sphere that can become a vital resource in which people can think , engage in critical dialog , organize and connect to a broader public and movements eager for economic and social transformation .
Academics can work to develop diverse intellectual institutes , sites and organizations both within and outside of North America to contest the right - wing media machine and its army of anti-public intellectuals .
Intellectuals trade in ideas , help to raise consciousness and are crucial to offering new coordinates for how to think about freedom , justice , equality , sustainability and the elimination of human suffering .
Jacques Ranciere is informative here in his call for intellectuals to engage in a form of dissensus , which he defines as an attempt to modify the coordinates of the visible and ways of perceiving experience .
Dissensus is an attempt “ to loosen the bonds that enclose spectacles within a form of visibility ….
within the machine that makes the “ state of things ” seem evident , unquestionable . ” [ 30 ]
Ideas matter not only because they can promote self - reflection , but because they can reconstitute our sense of agency , imagination , hope and possibility .
And it is precisely in their ability to extend the reach and understanding of how ideas , power and politics work not simply in the interest of domination , but also critical hope and collective struggle that the importance of ideas and the role of intellectuals matter in such dark times .
As the commercial machinery and repressive apparatuses run by the neoliberal and right - wing zombies undermine public space and condemn more and more people to the status of disposable populations , it is all the more crucial that academics , artists , and other intellectuals mobilize their resources in order to fight the loss of vision and the exhaustion of politics that has paralyzed American society for decades .
As stated in the manifesto from “ Left Turn , ” the key here is to “ link struggles that have for decades been seen as discrete , with a broad anti-capitalist project whose objective is the radical transformation of economic , political , personal and social relations . ” [ 31 ]
It is precisely over the creation of alternative democratic public spheres that such a struggle against neoliberal , economic Darwinism can and should be waged by academics , intellectuals , artists , and other cultural workers .
Higher education , labor unions , the alternative media and progressive social movements offer important sites for academics and other intellectuals to form alliances , reach out to a broader public and align with larger social movements .
Critical intellectuals must do whatever they can to nurture formative critical cultures and social movements that can dream beyond the “ mad - agency that is power in a new form , death - in - life . ” [ 32 ]
At the same time , they must challenge all aspects of the neoliberal disciplinary apparatus – from its institutions of power to its pedagogical modes of rationality – in order to make its politics , pedagogy and hidden registers of power visible .
Only then will the struggle for the renewal of peace and justice become possible .

At a moment when clarity is necessary in condemning the Israeli attack , when the entire world is looking to see if Washington is indeed a paper tiger when it comes to Israel , Obama caved to the Israelis in negotiating the UN Resolution .
The rationale according to Tapper :
I ’m told there wo n’t be any daylight between the US and Israel in the aftermath of the incident on the flotilla yesterday , which resulted in the deaths of 10 activists .
Regardless of the details of the flotilla incident , sources say President Obama is focused on what he sees as the longer term issue here : a successful Mideast peace process .
“ The president has always said that it will be much easier for Israel to make peace if it feels secure , ” a senior administration official tells ABC News .
The suggestion is that US condemnation of Israel would further isolate that country , and make further peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians even more difficult .
But if the US bars an independent study of the incident for Israel 's own inquiry , he will bury the peace process as well .
The Arab and Muslim world will see another Cheney in the White House , decorated with empty rhetoric about change .
Time after time , Netanyahu just pwns Obama ; and the US president just lets it happen .
Muddying a clear contravention of international law with weasel words about the self - defense of the flotilla is not good enough .
And if Obama thinks he will somehow placate the pro-Israel lobby by this , he is surely mistaken .
They want to destroy Obama 's presidency just as much as Netanyahu does .

From 1562 to 1598 , a series of bloody wars was waged in France between Catholics and Protestant Huguenots , collectively called “ The French Wars of Religion . ”
This particular series of European religious conflicts ended with the Edict of Nantes , which was essentially a truce providing some basic religious freedoms to both Catholics and Protestants .
The Edict of Nantes was issued in 1598 by King Henry IV and it ’s one of the reasons why he became popularly known as “ le bon roi Henri ” — “ the good king Henry . ”
Nine years earlier , Henry had became the legal heir to the throne , after King Henry III was assassinated by a fanatical Catholic monk .
Henry IV was a Huguenot , like his predecessor , when he inherited the crown .
And , although most of the country accepted him as King , many Catholics refused to recognize his authority — especially in the vitally important , Catholic - controlled city of Paris .
Henry decided to try to break the political and religious logjam and reunite the country by converting to Catholicism .
He did so in a very public ceremony at the basilica of Saint - Denis in Paris on Sunday morning , July 25 , 1593 .
That day , according to legend , he told a friend “ Paris vaut une messe . ”
( “ Paris is worth a mass . ” )
This famous quote ( sometimes given as “ Paris veult une messe ” ) was not actually recorded at the time .
It was attributed to Henry IV years later and is probably apocryphal .
However , Henry clearly did embrace the basic idea .
He felt it was worth converting if it meant he could gain control of Paris and unite the country under his rule .
Henry ’s conversion and his Edict of Nantes did unite the country and bring an end to the French Wars of Religion — but not to religious fanaticism .
In 1610 , good King Henry IV was assassinated in Paris by the Catholic zealot François Ravaillac .

TO refudiate or not to refudiate ?
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin defended her newly - created word today , then compared herself to Shakespeare in the realm of coining new terminology .
The word was " refudiate " - it was unclear if she meant refute or repudiate - and she first used it last week on Fox News 's Hannity show when she called on President Obama and his wife Michelle to " refudiate " the NAACP 's suggestion that the Tea Party movement was racist .
By today , " refudiate " had popped up again .
In a tweet addressing the Ground Zero mosque controversy , Ms Palin wrote : " Ground Zero Mosque supporters : does n't it stab you in the heart , as it does ours throughout the heartland ?
Peaceful Muslims , pls refudiate . "
Within hours , that tweet was deleted .
A second tweet asked " peaceful New Yorkers " to " refute the Ground Zero mosque plan " and a third suggested rejecting it .
Then came a fourth tweet , apparently acknowledging her language tussle : " ' Refudiate , ' ' misunderestimate , ' ' wee - wee 'd up . '
English is a living language .
Shakespeare liked to coin new words too .
Got to celebrate it ! ”
For the record , former President George W Bush used " misunderdestimate " and Mr Obama last year referred to people in Washington being " wee - wee 'd up " in August .
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs later tried to explain it away by saying , " I think wee - weed up is when people just get all nervous for no particular reason . "
Ms Palin's word has already made it onto urbandictionary.com , an online slang dictionary .

Android Market Frustrates Developers
Developers for Google 's mobile platform are growing increasingly frustrated by disappearing applications , purchasing issues and other problems stemming from the Android Market .
There have been difficulties since the inception of the Android Market , which is n't as tightly controlled as , for example , Apple 's App Store .
Many of the troubles involve applications that go missing from the Market -- they are there one day , and unavailable the next .
Following on the heels of that problem was a snafu that resulted in incorrect download counts , often resulting in counts that showed thousands fewer downloads than there should have been .
Fewer downloads means fewer profits for developers .
Although Google acknowledges the mistakes and says it 's fixing the issues , the problems continue .
One developer on an Android support forum , identified as " erxgus " said , " I am still not seeing my app on the Android Market either .
Try uploading it several times , and it 's still not on the market .
And this is on T - mobile , with Froyo client . "
Froyo is the latest iteration of the Android OS , version 2.2 .
It 's not just that apps are disappearing ; there are difficulties with paying for apps .
" If any of your apps are paid apps , it seems that people are getting stuck at Authorizing Purchase and never getting to download the apps , " said Android support forum member " Ryan R . "
Last week the Android Market was down completely for about a half hour , blogged a Google employee .
During that time , no apps at all were available to anyone , leaving customers just as frustrated as developers .
" Kellyvincent " complained about a problem that started " Yesterday , 4/27/10 . .
. nothing from the Market will download -- new apps or updates for existing ones .
I 've rebooted , removed battery and sim card , and nothing 's changed .
Stays stuck on ' starting download . ' "
Experienced Android developer and blogger Simon Judge weighed in with an overview of the problems and the steps he thinks Google needs to take to fix them :
He chalked up the disappearing apps issue to the fact that " Google has to enable phone models on the Android Market , " and hardware manufacturers are shipping phones before that 's happened .
Those customers , of course , want to get apps right away .
Blogs Judge :
It 's well known that people download most apps when they first buy a new phone .
Since people also tend to buy the latest phones , users get frustrated and developers get asked about a problem they can't solve .
Developers are also complaining about the lack of a well - defined process for dealing with these types of problems .
Bo Stone , for example , blogged about the lack of Google support :
What disturbs me deeply is that there 's really no support system for the Android Market .
The Market is not an open source so we have to rely on Google to fix any problems .
Yet there 's no bug tracking , no support phone or even e-mail or any way to file a problem ticket .
Google , locked in a fierce battle with Apple 's iPhone , facing competition from RIM with the BlackBerry and Microsoft with its upcoming Windows Phone 7 , needs to do everything in its power to keep its developers happy .
The apps are what primarily drive smartphone sales , and developers have choices .
If they 're losing money on one platform , they may quickly migrate to another .

This article originally appeared as " The Political Economy of Moral Hazard " in the Czech journal Politická ekonomie ( February 2006 ) : 35 – 47 .
A central occupation of economists is to analyze the nature , causes , and effects of incentives — the circumstances that are held to motivate human action .
Economists agree on the positive role that " good " incentives play to increase production .
They also agree that " perverse " incentives have an opposite impact .
One of these perverse incentives is called moral hazard , the subject of our present essay .
Moral hazard is the incentive of a person A to use more resources than he otherwise would have used , because he knows , or believes he knows , that someone else B will provide some or all of these resources .
The important point is that this occurs against B's will and that B is unable to sanction this expropriation immediately .
The mere incentive to rely on resources provided by others is not per se problematic .
For example , the announcement of a future inheritance might prompt the prospective heir to spend more in the present than he would otherwise have spent .
In such cases we would not speak of moral hazard .
A genuine moral - hazard problem appears however if A has the possibility to use B's resources against B's will and if he knows this .
Laymen would call A's incentives a " temptation to steal " or a " temptation to act irresponsibly . "
Economists , ever weary of moralizing , have espoused the technocratic expression " moral hazard . "
Thus the essential feature of moral hazard is that it incites some people A to expropriate other people B .
The B - people in turn , if they realize the presence of such a moral hazard , have an incentive to react against this possible expropriation .
They make other choices than those that they would consider to be best if there were no moral hazard .
Many economists have therefore concluded that moral hazard entails market failures ; it brings about a different allocation of resources than the one that would exist in the absence of moral hazard .
Conventional economic theory explains moral hazard as a consequence of the fact that market participants are unequally well informed about economic reality .
In other words , moral hazard results from " asymmetries of information " and the theory of moral hazard is therefore considered to be a part of the economics of information .
In the present paper we will criticize this conventional approach and propose an alternative .
We will argue that information asymmetries are just one among several causes of moral hazard .
Most importantly , they entail disequilibria and the expropriation of third parties only accidentally and ephemerally , because these third parties can avoid them by better judgment ( by anticipation ) .
By contrast , moral hazard also results from government interventionism ; and in this case it creates disequilibria and expropriation of a sort that cannot be avoided , not even in the absence of informational asymmetries .
We will first present the conventional " informational " theory of the causes and consequences of moral hazard .
Then we will study moral hazard on the free market and under government interventionism .
Finally we will outline how our findings fit the important case of government interventionism in money and financial markets .
The Conventional Theory of Moral Hazard
The fact that people act on the basis of different knowledge about the real world will hardly be contested .
The baker knows other things than the astronaut , the opera singer other things than the teacher of mathematics .
Neither can it be doubted that people are unequally well informed about the real world .
Some bakers know more about cakes , cake making , and the cake market than others , and so on .
In short , information asymmetries are a universal aspect of human life as we know it .
They are both a cause and a result of the division of labor .
There is no reason to suppose that they are a priori harmful or a sign of imperfection .
Conventional theory therefore stresses an additional condition to explain the emergence of moral hazard , namely , the separation of ownership and control .
Two main cases can be distinguished : co-ownership and agency contracts .
In the case of co-ownership , any one owner has control over a given piece of property , but not exclusive control .
Informational asymmetries can then produce moral hazard in conjunction with this separation of ownership and control .
Whenever one co-owner of a swimming pool cannot effectively monitor the activities of his fellow - owners , the latter have an incentive to swim without cleaning up , repairing the fences and so on , thus increasing their own ( monetary and psychic ) income at his expense .
Similarly , in the case of an agency contract , moral hazard can arise when an economic good is not effectively controlled by its owner ( the " principal " ) but by a different person called the " agent , " for example , by an employee .
Again , informational asymmetries produce moral hazard in conjunction with this separation of ownership and control .
The agent , who is fully informed about his own activities , has an incentive to act in his own material interest against the material interests of his less informed principal .
Whenever the principal cannot effectively monitor the activities of his agent , therefore , the latter has an incentive to increase his own ( monetary and psychic ) income at the expense of the former .
The standard case of moral hazard in an agency setting is an insurance contract .
Here the insurance company is the less informed principal and the insured person is the agent .
Automobile insurance , for example , creates a moral hazard for drivers ; it creates an additional incentive for risky driving because other people ( other clients of the insurance ) will pay a part of the costs of the agent 's accidents .
Similarly , in the presence of unemployment insurance , an unemployed person has an additional incentive to stay unemployed because other people will pay at least a part of his living expenses .
Or , in the presence of health insurance , insured people will have an additional incentive to engage in risky activities or lifestyles because others will pay at least a part of the treatment in case of illness or accidents .
However , moral hazard is in no way a particular problem of the insurance industry .
It can arise in almost any other field of human activity where there is a separation of ownership and control .
Employees can be subject to moral hazard to the extent that they can reduce their efforts without fearing reduced pay .
Debtors may be subject to moral hazard if they believe they can squander the money without negative consequences when they turn out to be incapable of paying back .
Certain auditing firms have been subject to moral hazard when they sold consulting services to the very companies they were supposed to audit ( for example , in the Enron case ) .
A central bank can produce moral hazard in the banking community if the commercial bankers perceive the central bank as a lender of last resort .
The IMF can produce moral hazard among debtor governments .
Taxpayers are said to be subject to moral hazard if they can evade high - tax regions , and so on .
Similarly , in the literature on public choice and constitutional political economy , governments and parliaments are often portrayed as agents prone to moral hazard , whereas the voters are the less informed principals .
It is a rather significant fact that , in the light of the conventional theory , information asymmetries produce moral hazard only in conjunction with the separation of ownership and control .
We will argue that the latter is indeed the decisive element , whereas information asymmetries are but a sideshow .
More to the point , we will argue that moral hazard systematically entails expropriation only when ownership and control of a resource are separated in a special way , namely , without the consent of the owner .
To demonstrate our contention , we will first analyze the voluntary separation of ownership and control , as it occurs on a free market and then turn to the most important case of involuntary separation , namely , the case of interventionism .
Moral Hazard on the Free Market
When we speak of a free market , we mean that each property owner has the unhampered right to use his property as he sees fit .
This includes the right to let other people use his property under conditions he approves , as well as the right to co-own property with other people .
In short , it includes purely voluntary separations of ownership and control .
The question we have to answer now is whether such a voluntary separation of ownership and control is per se likely to lead to any sort of expropriation due to information asymmetries .
In other words , we have to examine whether the conjunction of these two conditions is sufficient for one man to be able to enrich himself at the expense of another man , or whether , to the contrary , even in the presence of the combined two conditions , such expropriation of man by man is a contingent consequence .
We will argue that moral hazard does not necessarily entail expropriation whenever information asymmetries combine with a separation of ownership and control ; that , whenever moral hazard results from them accidentally , there are strong forces at work to eliminate expropriation ; and that moral - hazard - induced expropriation is therefore not only accidental , but also ephemeral on the free market .
The decisive fact on which we can base our argument is that the interplay between information asymmetries on the one hand , and the separation of ownership and control on the other hand , finds on the free market an effective antidote in expectations .
Consider the problem of principal - agent relationships .
Suppose the owner of a grocery shop hires a clerk for a salary of € 1,000 per month .
Suppose further that that the owner has various other shops to run and that he can therefore not effectively supervise his new clerk all the time .
According to the conventional theory , the clerk is likely to behave differently than he would in the permanent presence of his employer .
He can have longer naps over the lunch break , be sloppier in dealing with customers , and so on .
All of this , we can admit right away .
But the crucial question is : does the sloppy clerk necessarily enrich himself at the expense of his employer ?
Does the principal necessarily bear costs entailed by the unfaithful agent ?
Only if this were the case could we speak of expropriation .
But it is not the case .
The clerk does not necessarily enrich himself at the expense of the owner because the latter can anticipate the behavior of the former .
To the extent that he does anticipate it , the payment of € 1,000 would properly reflect the discounted marginal value product of sloppy labor .
And this is of course precisely what prudent employers do , on a free market , whenever they hire new people .
They discount the marginal value product of good or normal work by a factor that represents the risk of bad work due to lack of supervision .
The role of expectations can hardly be overstated in the theory of moral hazard .
To the extent that the expectations of the principal are correct , moral hazard on the part of the agent cannot lead to a situation in which the latter expropriates the former .
Moreover , principals acting on a free market do not merely have to rely on their foresight of the future actions of their agents .
They are also free to design contractual relationships in ways that minimize ( a ) the danger of moral hazard arising in the first place and ( b ) the danger of moral hazard , once there , affecting them negatively .
The insurance industry offers well - known illustrations .
In health insurance , for example , exclusions , deductibles , and copayments are tools intended to reduce moral hazard .
Similarly , moral hazard in road traffic has been effectively reduced with the help of radar controls and black boxes in vehicles .
Most importantly , on a free market , principals have the liberty to sever contractual relations with agents at any time .
The threat of being fired is probably the most powerful incentive to deliver diligent work rather than succumb to moral hazard .
Reputation effects and blacklists operate in the same direction .
Analogous considerations apply to all forms of co-ownership .
Here the various co-owners , being aware that the utilization of the common resource must be restricted to preserve its value , have an incentive to set up and accept rules for its use .
If the number of co-owners is high , individual capitalist - entrepreneurs might step in and provide the co-property and the rules , as for example in urban development .
The institutional settings designed to neutralize moral hazard are usually considered to be " second - best " solutions , as distinct from the " first - best " solutions that would exist in a world inhabited with human beings that enjoy perfect information .
Based on this distinction , some writers infer that competitive markets are inefficient in the presence of moral hazard .
In other words , moral hazard would be a systematic cause of market failures even on a free market .
However , the distinction between first - best and second - best solutions is a figment of the imagination .
It is based on the premise that human beings could choose to inhabit a world in which they would be endowed with perfect foresight and in which they would not need any institutions designed to deal with moral hazard .
Only in comparison to such an alternative world could the world that we know — the world with information asymmetries and moral hazard — be called inefficient .
But the alternative does not exist .
The only meaningful standards to evaluate the efficiency , say , of deductibles and copayments are other contractual provisions or similar devices that could be used to attain the same end .
Moral Hazard and the Definition of Property Rights
Before turning to the analysis of moral hazard under government interventionism , it might be useful to first consider the hybrid or intermediate case in which property rights are not clearly defined .
The case is not only interesting from a systematic point of view , but also because , in practice , for a great number of economic goods there are no clearly defined property rights .
Most notably we might think here of air and oceans and their inhabitants ; birds and fish are considered to be the commonwealth of humanity .
Human beings appropriate these resources with only feeble attempts at creating something like property rights .
Thus we have a system of co-ownership without rules .
Not surprisingly , the result is universal moral hazard ; everybody has an incentive to use the resource in question as much as possible .
This is a sure recipe for quick depletion , as has been known at least from the times of Aristotle .
In more recent years , the phenomenon has been called " tragedy of the commons . "
Now , in this practically highly important case , information asymmetries play no role whatever .
Moral hazard would be at work here even if each co-owner were perfectly aware of the activities of his fellow owners .
We could even say that moral hazard would be here at work especially in the case in which every co-owner was perfectly aware of the activities of his fellow owners .
Interventionism and Moral Hazard
Important though moral hazard stemming from a deficient definition of property rights might be in practice , it is no match for moral hazard that results from a forced separation of ownership and control .
To this type of moral hazard we turn now .
By a " forced " separation of ownership and control we mean a separation brought about against the will of its owner .
Although owners might be forced both by governments and by private parties , government interventionism is far more important in practice .
This is so not only because of the greater quantitative impact , but also because , in our western societies at least , interventionism is usually enshrined in the law and thus can be anticipated .
Let us first stress that government interventionism must not be confused with a mixed economy .
In the latter the government is one of several owners and it controls only its own property .
By contrast , an interventionist government commands other property owners to use their resources in a different way than these owners themselves would have used them .
In so doing , the interventionist government makes some person or group A ( for example itself ) the uninvited co-owner of other agent B's property .
The essence of interventionism is precisely this : institutionalized uninvited co-ownership .
Government makes itself the uninvited and unwanted co-owner whenever it taxes , regulates , and prohibits .
The specific forms of taxation , regulation , and prohibition are myriad .
The important fact is that any form of government interventionism , by its very nature , entails a forced separation of ownership and effective control .
Taxation means that the government proclaims itself the owner of ( a certain share of ) resources belonging to its subjects ; and that it forces them to eventually hand over these resources , which the latter would not have yielded voluntarily ( otherwise one would not speak of taxation , but of donations to the government ) .
Today taxation does not concern concrete physical items , but their monetary equivalent .
It follows that , until the tax is paid , the government imposes itself as the co-owner of virtually all physical assets of the taxpayers .
However , until the tax is paid , the resources in question are typically controlled by the citizen .
Regulation means that the government proscribes a certain use of certain resources .
This use is typically not the one that the citizens would have chosen ( otherwise the regulation would be pointless ) .
Again , the government thereby proclaims itself the co-owner of these resources .
Consider the case of price controls .
If the government fixes a minimum wage rate , it effectively proclaims itself the co-owner of workers , because it does not allow them to work under conditions they see fit .
And it also proclaims itself the co-owner of the capitalists or , more precisely , of the money that the latter plan to spend on labor .
However , the government does not permanently control the actions of the workers , and it does not interfere with other uses of the capitalists ' money .
Prohibition means that the government outlaws a certain use of certain resources altogether .
Again , it thereby proclaims itself the co-owner of all resources that could be put to the prohibited use .
For example , if it prohibits the production and sale of alcoholic beverages it effectively imposes itself as a co-owner of all resources that could be used for the production and sale of such drinks .
However , it does not interfere when those resources are used in other employments .
Interventionism does not abolish private property .
The citizens still have ownership and control of their property , even though they have to share both ownership and control with the government and its agents .
It is true that this forced co-ownership is usually a matter of degree .
Increased interventionism increases the share of government control of resources , though without outlawing other people 's simultaneous control of these same resources .
But the forced nature of the co-ownership itself is not a matter of degree .
It is a categorical and essential feature of any intervention , be it ever so small .
Government interventionism always and everywhere entails a forced separation of ownership and control .
It always and everywhere creates unwanted " partnerships " between the citizens and their government .
It follows that , by its very nature , it creates a moral hazard both for the citizens and for the government .
Most importantly , it creates a situation in which each of the parties involved ( the citizens on the one hand and the government on the other hand ) desires to expropriate the resources subject to interventionism at the expense of the other parties .
First consider the reaction of the citizens to taxation , regulation , and prohibition .
From the very fact that intervention entails forced co-ownership , it follows that the citizens have an incentive to evade the intervention .
They can to some extent evade it because they have some control of their property .
To avoid taxation , for example , they can choose to invest capital in a country with low taxes rather than in a country with high taxes ; they can choose to emigrate to low - tax countries rather than stay in high - tax places ; they can choose a profession that is less taxed than other professions ; or they can choose to make fraudulent declarations of their income and capital .
To evade regulations , they can choose not to buy or sell commodities subject to price controls , or they can choose to buy and sell them on the black market .
To evade prohibitions , they can buy and sell prohibited items on the black market .
However , operating on the black market is risky and thus very costly , and evasion to other countries is costly too .
Thus it follows that there is an incentive for the citizens to use a greater part of their property for personal consumption rather than invest it .
Hence , the general tendency of interventionism on the citizens is to entail excessive consumption and to make production more costly because of the necessity to evade the intervention .
But moral hazard also comes into play on the side of the government itself .
Governments rely on the resource use that comes through taxation and regulation .
They will therefore tend to tax more and regulate more in order to neutralize the ways in which the citizens evaded its previous intervention .
It will seek to " close the loopholes . "
We have here a basic mechanism of the dynamics of government interventionism .
Interventionist governments have an incentive to extend taxation to all branches of economic life ; to regulate industries that have so far escaped regulation ; and to beat into submission the countries that serve as tax havens .
The ultimate result is to reinforce the tendencies that we characterized above : excessive consumption and insufficient production ; in short , a general impoverishment of society .
It can hardly be overemphasized that it is not co-ownership per se that causes these excesses .
They are caused by the uninvited and unwanted co-ownership that springs from interventionism .
Notice that our foregoing analysis in no way depends on the existence of asymmetrical information .
We can assume for the sake of argument that all citizens are perfectly aware of the government 's activities , and that the government is also perfectly well informed about the activities of all citizens .
All of this would not alter the picture .
Government interventionism entails moral hazard both on the side of the government and on the side of the citizens .
And this moral hazard cannot be neutralized by choosing appropriate contractual devices , because it has no contractual basis at all ; it is imposed .
It can not be sidestepped by choosing to avoid the moral - hazard - prone situation altogether , because the situation itself is imposed .
The very meaning of interventionism is , as we have said , to overrule the choices of property owners .
And similarly , the workings of moral hazard cannot be eliminated or diminished by correct expectations , as in the case of moral hazard on the free market .
The case is exactly the reverse .
It is precisely when the citizens correctly anticipate how high the next tax will be , and when it will hit them , that a moral hazard will start bearing on them and incite them to evade the tax .
The Case of Fiat Money
Let us now turn to the discussion of an important case in which government interventionism produces moral hazard on a large scale : monetary interventionism .
The fundamental intervention , on which all other interventions in this field are built , is the imposition of a legal tender .
The latter is a means of payment that the market participants are obliged to accept , even if they made contracts that stipulated payments in terms of other media of exchange .
This intervention creates a moral hazard for the market participants to hoard or export the media of exchange that in their eyes are better than the legal tender , but which they are legally bound to use at par with the legal tender .
The paradoxical result is that only the legal tender — the medium of exchange that everybody seeks to avoid — remains in circulation .
Economists call this phenomenon " Gresham 's Law . "
But fiat paper money also creates moral hazard for citizens , banks , and governments because they sooner or later come to realize that the masters of the printing press have the power to bail out virtually any bankrupt firm or government .
All contemporary monetary systems are based on such legal tender privileges .
Paper money — as well as electronic money ( " central - bank liquidity " ) — does not compete with other monetary products on the free market , but is imposed by special privilege .
It is therefore called fiat paper money .
This institution is of great interest from the point of view of the theory of moral hazard .
In fact it entails moral hazard on the greatest imaginable scale , again , both on the side of its producer and on the side of its users .
Fiat paper money creates moral hazard for the producer because he has the possibility of creating ex nihilo virtually any amount of money and , thus , to buy virtually any amount of goods and services for sale .
The only limit to this capacity is the hyperinflation that invariably results in the case of a great inflation of the money supply .
But fiat paper money also creates moral hazard on the side of the money users — the citizens , the banks , and the governments — because they sooner or later come to realize that the masters of the printing press have the power to bail out virtually any bankrupt firm or government .
Thus they engage in more or less reckless financial planning , expecting that the monetary authorities will not allow a great mass of reckless planners to go bankrupt .
This speculation has been borne out by the last thirty years .
Public and private debts are at record heights all over the world .
Monetary theorists were aware of this danger early on , even though they did not use the word " moral hazard " in this context .
Here we should mention in the first place all defenders of sound money — that is — of competitive money , such as Ludwig von Mises , F.A. Hayek , Murray Rothbard , and many other economists of the Austrian School .
But neither has the problem escaped the attention of the champions of fiat money .
Nineteenth - century economist Walter Bagehot , who coined the term " lender of last resort , " warned that the central bank , while freely lending in times of financial duress , would have to avoid at any cost the impression that it would bail out the market participants .
Some sixty years later , Herbert Simon stressed the need for rules rather than discretion in economic policy , essentially for the same reasons .
And his disciple Milton Friedman reiterated this point even more famously in his proposal for a constant growth rate of the money supply .
The idea that rules could prevent large - scale moral hazard in a fiat paper money system defies human logic .
After all , the only possible use of a printing press is to produce more money than would have been produced on a free market .
What sense does it make to assert that this power could be handled responsibly ?
In analogy to a felicitous phrase from Anthony de Jasay , we might say that praising the virtues of monetary stabilization while maintaining legal tender laws for paper money is like using a chastity belt for Miss World while letting her keep the key .
Let us add , though , that , to make the analogy with our monetary constitution perfect , we would have to advertise day in day out in the New York Times that Miss World definitely owns the key to her chastity belt .
Financial bubbles are the unavoidable result of such a state of affairs .
If more or less every major participant to the financial market is subject to moral hazard , then in due time even the smaller traders realize that the bigger fish play the moral hazard card , and thus they too venture to set out on the same path .
This means that the market participants sooner or later come to base their plans on the availability of a far greater quantity of goods and services than is really available in the economy .
In short , paper money by virtue of its mere existence produces massive error on a large scale , until the bubble bursts in a crisis .
Again , as in the other cases of interventionism - induced moral hazard , these effects cannot be neutralized , avoided , or diminished through anticipations .
And this means that they cannot be managed through the management of expectations .
Mainstream economists have in the past thirty years labored to bring expectations into the picture of monetary policy .
The next thirty years will presumably be needed to take account of institutionalized moral hazard .
The problem is that our monetary system will not survive that long , if we can extrapolate the speed of the events of the past thirty years .
Two police officers stopped a teenaged freelance photographer from taking pictures of police cadets marching in an Armed Forces Day in London .
The officers claimed ( incorrectly ) that it was against the law to photograph minors without parental consent .
Then they pushed him down a set of stairs and detained him .
The photographer recorded the incident , including the officers claiming that they did n't need any law to detain him .
Jules Mattsson , the 15 - year - old photographer , is very , very good in this recording .
He knows his rights , he admirably keeps his cool as two lawless goons with badges harass him and detain him .
Kids like this give me hope for the future of the human race .
On the other hand , cops who invent imaginary laws and demand that the public abide by them — after the Association of Police Chiefs has made it abundantly clear that the police must not harass amateur and professional photographers .
" I was quickly and aggressively stopped by one of their adult officers asking me who I worked for , " he wrote on his blog .
" I responded that I was a freelance and upon being told I needed parental permission to photograph them , I explained this was a public event in a public place and that I did n't for editorial use . "
The audio recording begins minutes later with an officer initially arguing that it is illegal to take photographs of children .
He then claims that it is illegal to take images of army members and police officers .
Under laws that guarantee the freedom of press in Britain , there is no restriction on photography of children , police or armed forces in a public space .
There is new legislation to protect the identities of some police officers but only those working undercover or in instances where an officer genuinely believes a photographer is collecting data for terrorist purposes .
Officers claim they do n't need law to stop photographer taking pictures

Good story in the Village Voice today discussing how cops busted on steroids do n't make for smooth legal proceedings .
In the wake of numerous cases befouled by the misdeeds of NYPD narco cops , the department 's steroid scandal is now further deflating the judicial system .
Prosecutors in Brooklyn dismissed 54 narcotics cases late last week , bringing the total in that borough alone to 271 — and counting .
Incredible .
Cops busted for using or selling steroids are poisoning the prosecutors cases ; this does n't sound like a process for making the streets of New Yrok safer .
Here is one story :
Meanwhile , the still - simmering steroid scandal ( " Cops on Steroids , " December 19 – 25 , 2007 ) has just begun poisoning cases :
A prime example is the bust of gunman — and known scumbag — Gary Waters .
The ex-con was nabbed by cops in September 2006 with a fully loaded 9 mm handgun , an extra 15 - bullet magazine , 27 loose rounds , and a pair of handcuffs .
Since then , however , the arresting officer in the case , Vaughn Ettienne , and his supervisor , Sergeant Raymond Cotton , were suspended in the steroid probe , which has ensnared 29 cops who allegedly received illegal prescriptions .
Both Ettienne and Cotton tested positive for steroid use , according to law - enforcement officials .
After Waters 's lawyer read late last year in the Voice about the suspensions , he launched a " ' roid rage " accusation against both Ettienne and Cotton ( who signed off on the bust ) .
Last month , Brooklyn Supreme Court judge Michael Gary denied Waters 's request for access to the Brooklyn D.A. 's files in the steroid probe to determine whether there was any evidence to support his lawyer 's contention that the cops were in the throes of " ' roid rage " when they busted him .
But the judge ruled that Waters 's Legal Aid attorney , Adrian Lesher , already has a " good - faith basis " to question the cops — if they take the stand , as they normally would in such a case — about steroid use and its possible side effects .
It 's unlikely that this courtroom confrontation will ever materialize , however .
A spokesman for D.A. Charles " Joe " Hynes says that " our position right now is [ that ] the case is still going forward , " but sources in the office say a supervising assistant district attorney in charge of gun cases is leaning toward dismissing the case against Waters .
Ettienne and Cotton would too easily become targets for the defense , says a source .
In any event , cops will often become worthless as witnesses for the prosecution if they 're facing legal troubles of their own .
" My experience is that once cops get suspended , they generally do n't cooperate with us anymore " on their pending cases , the source says .
D.A. spokesman Jerry Schmetterer says the office will review other pending cases involving Ettienne , Cotton , and four other police officers suspended last November after testing positive for steroids , to determine whether those suspensions would adversely affect the cases stemming from the busts they made .
Schmetterer says he does n't know how many such cases have been worked on by the six cops .
Defense attorneys will jump all over the evidence for an increase in aggressiveness seen with anabolic steroid use :
Lesher wo n't comment on the case , but one of his motions notes that " anabolic steroids have been repeatedly cited by medical authorities as a reason for spontaneous and irrational aggressive behavior , " and contends that " ' roid rage was probably partially responsible for one of the most horrific instances of New York police brutality in modern memory , Justin Volpe 's sodomization of Abner Louima with a toilet plunger in 1997 . "
There may or may not be complete scientific evidence that anabolic steroids increase EVERY users aggression ; attorneys simply need to throw that doubt out there for jurors to ponder .
Officers have been plagued with corruption due to drugs and sex in the past , but now add steroid use to a list of corrupting influences .
And cite this compelling case made by the defense :

With the release of version 2.8 and enthusiasm amongst my current project 's collaborators , I 've fired up my latent interest in scala .
There 's a lot to like about scala : function and object orientation , message based concurrency and JVM garbage collection , JITing , etc ; it 's a really interesting language .
The initial creature comforts I 've been looking for are a development , build and test environment I can be productive in .
At present , it looks like the best tools for me to get rolling are IntelliJ , sbt and ScalaTest .
In this post , I 'll recount the setup I 've arrived at on a MacBook Pro ( Snow Leopard ) , so far so good .
Development :
I 've used Eclipse for years and there 's a lot I like about it but I 've also had stability problems , particularly as plugins are added / removed from the installation ( stay away from the Aptana ruby plugin , every attempt to use it results in an unstable Eclipse for me ) .
So I got a new version of IntelliJ ( " Community Edition " ) ; the Scala plugin for v2.8 does n't work with the IntelliJ v9.0.2 release so the next task was to grab and install a pre-release of v9.0.3 ( see ideaIC - 95.413.dmg ) .
I downloaded recent build of the scala plugin ( see scala - intellij - bin - 0.3.1866.zip ) and unzipped it in IntelliJ 's plugins directory ( in my case , " / Applications / IntelliJ IDEA 9.0.3 CE.app/plugins / " ) .
I launched IntelliJ , Scala v2.8 support was enabled .
Build :
I 've had love / hate relationships in the past with ant and maven ; there 's a lot to love for flexibility with the former and consistency with the latter ( hat tip at " convention over configuration " ) .
There 's a lot to hate with the tedious XML maintenance that comes with both .
So this go around , I 'm kicking the tires on simple build tool .
One of the really nice bits about sbt is that it has a shell you can run build commands in ; instead of waiting for the ( slow ) JVM launch time everytime you build / test you can incur the launch penalty once to launch the shell and re-run those tasks from within the sbt shell .
Once sbt is setup , a project can be started from the console like this : $ sbt update
You 'll go into a dialog like this :
Project does not exist , create new project ? ( y / N/s ) y Name : scratch Organization : ohai Version [ 1.0 ] : 0.1 Scala version [ 2.7.7 ] : 2.8.0 sbt version [ 0.7.4 ] :
mkdir project / build
vi project / build / Project.scala
import sbt . _ class Project ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends DefaultProject ( info ) with IdeaProject { // v1.2 is the current version compatible with scala 2.8 // see http://www.scalatest.org/download val scalatest = " org.scalatest " % " scalatest " % " 1.2 " % " test -> default " }
mkdir -p project / plugins / src
vi project / plugins / src/Plugins.scala
import sbt . _ class Plugins ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends PluginDefinition ( info ) { val repo = " GH - pages repo " at " http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/ " val idea = " com.github.mpeltonen " % " sbt-idea - plugin " % " 0.1 - SNAPSHOT " }
sbt update
sbt idea
Now I want sbt to not only bootstrap the build system but also bootstrap the IntelliJ project .
There 's an sbt plugin for that .
Ironically , bringing up the develop project requires creating folder structures and code artifacts ... which is what your development environment should be helping you with .
While we 're in there , we 'll declare our dependency on the test framework we want ( why ScalaTest is n't in the scala stdlib is mysterious to me ; c'mon scala , it 's 2010 , python and ruby have both shipped with test support for years ) .
So , fallback to console commands and vi ( I do n't do emacs ) or lean on Textmate .
Back in IntelliJ , do " File " > " New Module " > select " Import existing module " and specify the path to the " scratch.iml " file that that last console command produced .
Note how we declared our dependency on the test library and the repository to get it from with two lines of code , not the several lines of XML that would be used for each in maven .
Test :
Back in IntelliJ , right click on src/ main / scala and select " New " > " Package " and specify " ohai.scratch " .
Right click on that package and select " New " > " Scala Class " , we 'll create a class ohai . scratch .
Bicycle - in the editor put something like
package ohai .scratch class Bicycle { var turns = 0 def pedal { turns +=1 } }
package ohai.scratch.test import org.scalatest.Spec import ohai.scratch .
Bicycle class BicycleSpec extends Spec { describe ( " A bicycle , prior to any pedaling - " ) { val bike = new Bicycle ( ) it ( " pedal should not have turned " ) { expect ( 0 ) { bike.
turns } } } describe ( " A bicycle " ) { val bike = new Bicycle ( ) bike .
pedal it ( " after pedaling once , it should have one turn " ) { expect ( 1 ) { bike .
turns } } } }
Now to test our bicycle , do similar package and class creation steps in the src/test / scala folder to create ohai.scratch.test.BicycleTest:Back at your console , go into the sbt shell by typing " sbt " again .
In the sbt shell , type " test " .
In the editor , make your bicycle do more things , write tests for those things ( or reverse the order , TDD style ) and type " test " again in the sbt shell .
Lather , rinse , repeat , have fun .
Somewhere over the Pacific , Pabst Blue Ribbon began putting on airs .
[ #image : / photos / 590958862179605b11ad452a ]
That reliably blue - collar Milwaukee lager , later adopted by unbearable hipsters on the coasts , has turned up in China .
And P.B.R. , best known in the U.S. for being the cheapest beer on the grocery - store shelf , has — like so many expatriates before it — taken the move as an opportunity to change its image .
For a beer , that appears to involve an elegant glass bottle and a fantastically ridiculous price tag .
One bottle : forty - four dollars .
Bravo to Danwei for the story of how P.B.R. has been reborn as “ Blue Ribbon 1844 ” beer in China , advertised in magazines as a “ world famous spirit ” to be savored from a champagne flute .
As a recent advertisement in Window of the South magazine put it :
It ’s not just Scotch that ’s put into wooden casks .
There ’s also Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer 1844 .
Many world - famous spirits
Are matured in precious wooden casks
Scotch whisky , French brandy , Bordeaux wine …
They all spend long days inside wooden casks .
This is not the first time that P.B.R. has reinvented itself over the years .
Since it got its start in the nineteenth century , it has pitched itself in various ways to workers , families , and sports fans — as this good roundup shows .
But now , it seems , that a clever Chinese distributor has snatched up the license knowing full well about the Chinese fondness for trophies and ribbons .
( See : Olympics , 2008 ) .
Alcohol , as I described in a piece on China ’s love affair with wine , has become a prime tool for conspicuous consumption .
And “ Blue Ribbon 1844 , ” as its Chinese site assures us , has winner written all over it .
Patrick Stewart is celebrating his 70th birthday at Huddersfield University Sir Patrick Stewart , Mirfield 's most famous son , is marking his 70th birthday by returning to his home turf .
The Star Trek and X - Men actor is taking part in graduation ceremonies at Huddersfield University where he is in his second term as Chancellor .
Sir Patrick , who was knighted in June , admits he has recently been back to visit his old haunts in Mirfield .
He says his birthday is a chance to celebrate and reflect : " I 'm a bit dazed by it all , frankly , but delighted . "
Born in Mirfield on 13 July 1940 , Sir Patrick has come a long way since first treading the boards when he was still a child .
As a star of stage and screen both in Britain and in Hollywood he is certainly one of the world 's most famous actors .
Despite his stardom he says his West Yorkshire roots are incredibly important to him and that is why he is spending his birthday at Huddersfield University .
He says : " The University does figure very significantly in my life .
When , seven years ago , I was asked if I would be prepared to consider the job of Chancellor there I was still living in Los Angeles .
" I was homesick and wanting to find a good reason to relocate back to England .
" It was the tipping - point for me .
I came back and found that it gave me a chance to put something back into my local community . "
Sir Patrick was knighted at Buckingham Palace in June 2010
Those who only know Sir Patrick for his most famous film and TV roles might be surprised to discover that his early years in Mirfield were quite tough .
He remembers : " It was a very typical West Riding working class childhood and it was fine .
" These days people say , ' It must have seemed awful when you were growing up ' .
But , of course , you did n't know any different and everybody else was living in the same way .
" It was hand - to - mouth with my mother and me literally hiding behind the sofa when the rent collector came to the door .
"
Culminating in receiving his knighthood from the Queen in June 2010 , Sir Patrick says his return from the glitz and glamour of life in Los Angeles has seen him enjoying " the best years of my life " .
However , he admits his decision to come back to Britain was not without a few pre-performance nerves .
He says : " The first thing I did here was Anthony and Cleopatra with the Royal Shakespeare Company .
I remember standing behind the scenery on the press night writing the reviews in my head .
" They went along the lines of , ' Who does he think he is ? '
" But it has not turned out like that . "
His life has not been without its risks , says Sir Patrick .
Whether it was heading across the Atlantic to play Captain Jean - Luc Picard in Star Trek : The Next Generation or coming back to tread the boards in Britain , he says he has faced some difficult decisions .
He explains : " They have all been gambles , in a sense .
But without risk , without having a shot at something and not knowing whether you can pull it off or not , I find it stimulating in a strange kind of way .
I took a little drive around my neighbourhood .
It gave me goosebumps .
Sir Patrick Stewart " That 's what keeps me feeling youthful and certainly not feeling 70 .
" I was 40 a couple of weeks ago , that 's how it feels ! "
Before performing his duties at Huddersfield University on his birthday , Sir Patrick says he recently took a nostalgic trip to his old stomping ground in Mirfield .
He says : " I took a little drive around my neighbourhood .
It gave me goosebumps .
" I went past the house I was born in and lived in for 15 years - a one - up one - down in a yard .
" What was extraordinary was that distances and measurements have shrunk !
" I always thought the street I lived on was a long , steep street - it 's not .
It 's very short and not that steep at all . "
And Sir Patrick says once his 70th birthday is out of the way he will again be revisiting his childhood days .
He explains : " My life back then is very vivid to me and I 've started writing a little about it .
" I 'll be going back there in my head a great deal in the coming few years . "

CNN host Rick Sanchez let slip a telling admission in response to the deadly bombings in Uganda during his show yesterday , the fact that such attacks are “ helpful ” for the military - industrial complex agenda to take over and occupy third world countries under AFRICOM , the United States African Command .
Speaking with a former CIA agent , Sanchez stated , “ You know what ’s interesting about this , in a strange way the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are and if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys then so be it ” .
Watch the clip .
Sanchez is brazenly admitting that deadly terror attacks like the bombings in Uganda only aid the military - industrial complex agenda to take over and occupy third world countries .
Given the fact that such attacks help the geopolitical agenda of the powers that control the United States , who has the strongest motivation to carry out the attacks ?
We heard similar rhetoric back in 2008 when shocking excerpts of confidential recordings released under the Freedom of Information Act featured former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld talking with top military analysts about how a flagging Neo - Con political agenda could be successfully restored with the aid of another terrorist attack on America .
The tapes were released as part of the investigation into the Pentagon ’s “ message force multipliers ” program in which top military analysts were hired to propagandize for the Iraq war in the corporate media .
In the audio recording , Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong bemoans shrinking political support for Neo -Con war plans on Capitol Hill and suggests that sympathy for the military - industrial complex agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack .
Rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9/11 is wearing off and the “ behavior pattern ” of citizens in both the U.S. and Europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror .
DELONG : Politically , what are the challenges because you ’re not going to have a lot of sympathetic ears up there until it [ a terror attack ] happens .
RUMSFELD : That ’s what I was just going to say .
This President ’s pretty much a victim of success .
We have n’t had an attack in five years .
The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it ’s not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment .
The same thing ’s in Europe , there ’s a low threat perception .
The correction for that , I suppose , is an attack .
And when that happens , then everyone gets energized for another [ inaudible ] and it ’s a shame we do n’t have the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats … the lethality , the carnage , that can be imposed on our society is so real and so present and so serious that you ’d think we’d be able to understand it , but as a society , the longer you get away from 9/11 , the less … the less …
In a similar vein to CNN ’s Sanchez , Neo -Con writer Stu Bykofsky expressed his yearning for “ another 9/11 ” in order to “ help America ” restore its sense of “ outrage and national resolve ” in an August 2007 column for the Philadelphia Daily News .
Lt. -Col .
Doug Delaney , chair of the war studies program at the Royal Military College in Kingston , Ontario , told the Toronto Star in July 2007 that “ The key to bolstering Western resolve is another terrorist attack like 9/11 or the London transit bombings of two years ago . ”
The same sentiment was also explicitly expressed in a 2005 GOP memo , which yearned for new attacks that would “ validate ” the President ’s war on terror and “ restore his image as a leader of the American people . ”
In June 2007 , the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party Dennis Milligan said that there needed to be more attacks on American soil for President Bush to regain popular approval .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
These statements take on an even greater significance when we consider the fact that the U.S. military - industrial complex and the government has openly planned and even admitted to carrying out terrorist attacks as part of its geopolitical strategy .
Operation Northwoods , a plan signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon to to “ kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war ” made headlines in May 2001 when it was revealed by investigative journalist James Bamford in his book Body of Secrets .
Operation Ajax , a CIA program of false flag terror to crush Iran ’s first democratic government in the 1950’s , was responsible for the deaths of around 300 people .
The CIA admits to the program on their own website .
Then there ’s Operation Gladio , a “ decades - long covert campaign of terrorism and deceit directed by the intelligence services of the West — against their own populations ” run by NATO in collusion with the CIA , a campaign which included the 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station which killed 85 people .
Given this dark history , it ’s no surprise to learn that terror attacks in the modern age are still being directed by the same forces .
That ’s not to say that there are n’t Islamic fundamentalists who are perfectly willing to commit violence , but every major terror attack we have investigated leads back to the same players .
The most recent example of this was the November 2008 Mumbai massacre , an attack overseen by David Headley , a Pakistan - born American national and a CIA agent who has been protected from questioning by American authorities since the attack .
The consequences of the attacks in Uganda which killed 74 people will doubtless be used to further the integration of Africom , the African arm of the move towards global government under the United States African Command , and the events will also be exploited to pave the way for further U.S. military incursions and occupations of the continent in pursuit of controlling Africa ’s rich and untapped natural resources .
As CNN ’s Rick Sanchez rightly points out , this week ’s tragic terror attacks in Uganda will serve to be immeasurably “ helpful ” in the pursuit of both of these agendas .

“ The question is do the government have the right to put an obligation on schools to not allow any level of risk whatsoever ? ” asked Mrs Schonrock , who grew up in Kent and from the age of four took the bus to school with her six - year - old sister .
Teenage mother who made ' wicked ' false rape claim is jailed for 15 months
' Wicked ' : A judge told Jade Brooks that her claim that she was raped had done ' a great disservice ' to genuine victims
A young mother who falsely claimed she was raped by a teenager was yesterday locked away for 15 months .
Jade Brooks was 17 when she claimed the 18 - year - old had taken her into a copse and attacked her .
He was later arrested , subjected to an intimate examination , kept in a cell for 13 hours and grilled by officers under caution before being released on police bail .
It was a further two months before he was told no further action would be taken after Brooks 's story began to unravel .
Witnesses said they had seen her kissing and cuddling the young man shortly before the alleged attack near a disused railway station in Haverhill , Suffolk , and was laughing and embracing him immediately after they left the wooded area .
Brooks , who is now 19 , was also seen by a friend performing a sex act on the teenager at a house later that evening .
She wept and protested her innocence yesterday as she learned she would be separated from her month - old baby daughter while she serves time in a young offenders institution for perverting the course of justice .
Judge David Goodin said an innocent man had been arrested and had his liberty taken away because of Brooks 's ' wicked ' claim .
He also reprimanded her for doing ' a huge disservice ' to genuine rape victims .
Brooks was heavily pregnant when she was convicted following a four - day trial at Ipswich Crown Court in May .
Sentencing was delayed to allow her to recover from the pregnancy and for reports to be prepared .
Evidence : Ipswich Crown Court heard that Brooks consented to sex with the accused on the day of the alleged rape
During the hearing her victim described how he and two friends had been to a pub before meeting three girls , including Brooks , in the street .
He said she led him into the secluded spot for sex and later had sex with him again at a friend 's house .
' I did n't rape her .
She is just a liar and an attention seeker .
She has got no one to feel sorry for her , ' he added .
Brooks , of Bury St Edmunds , Suffolk , was reported by one of her friends to have been tipsy but not drunk on the night of the alleged attack in July 2008 .
She had allowed the man to touch her breasts and did n't seem uncomfortable with what was happening .
At no point during the time she was alone with him in the bushes did she scream , cry for help or raise her voice in any way .
The only comment she made afterwards was : ' I 've lost my shoe . '
She dealt a final , fatal blow to the rape case when she refused to give a video - taped interview to police .
Shereen Dyer , defending , told the judge yesterday her client accepted the jury 's verdict but stood by her version of events and insisted she had been telling the truth .
She had urged the court to pass a suspended sentence because of the damaging effect a term behind bars would have on Brooks and her young daughter .
However she could be released after serving half her sentence .
It was n't that long ago that solid state drives ( SSDs ) were DRAM - based and cost a fortune .
Then the proliferation of mobile devices requiring shock and vibration profiles that exceeded hard drives created a huge market for flash .
Prices dropped , and with more money available for R&D , the density increased dramatically .
It 's been a period of tremendous evolution for flash , but I believe dark clouds are forming on the horizon .
Let 's start with a little history to help me make my point .
I first heard more than 20 years ago that tape was dead , but it took data deduplication to make disk cheap enough to hurt tape sales .
So it was n't disk drives alone that were able to impact tape sales ; it was disk drives combined with new technology .
Now we 're hearing from some that flash drives are going to replace hard disk drives , and that the cost difference , though great now , will continue to decline .
Vendors are putting out charts showing the cost of flash drives and hard disk drives converging , which looks to me like some of the charts I saw for tape and disk more than 20 years ago .
I do n't think it 's going to happen any time soon , and the reasons have to do with lithography limits and disk drive density .
The Limits of Flash Lithography
The main driver of density for flash technology is the size of the lithography used to make chips .
I found some good data on Wikipedia , which I confirmed .
Here is the change in lithography since 1971 , and projected to 2022 :
1971 1975 1982 1985 1989 1994 10000 nm 3000 nm 1500 nm 1000 nm 800 nm 600nm
1995 1999 2000 2002 2006 2008 2010 2011 2018 2022 250nm 180nm 130nm 90nm 65 nm 45 nm 32nm 22nm 16nm 11nm
Much of the increase in flash density is related to the reduction in lithography .
You can see that from 2002 to 2010 , we had almost a two - thirds reduction in lithography size , allowing more things to be fit into the same volumetric space .
But it will take another 12 years before we get the same volumetric improvement again , or a 50 percent increase in time .
This is why if you chart flash density growth over the last five years , the pace of improvement has slowed .
There are significant challenges to making things ever smaller , which I am not going to address here , but here are a couple of links for further reading : Producing Integrated Circuits With X-ray Lithography and Wikipedia on Electron Beam Lithography .
The bottom line is that there are limits to how small things can get with current technology .
Flash densities are going to have data density growth problems , just as other storage technologies have had over the last 30 years .
This should surprise no one .
And the lithography problem for flash does n't end there .
Jeff Layton , Enterprise Technologist for HPC at Dell , notes that as lithography gets smaller , NAND has more and more troubles — the voltages do n't decrease , so the probability of causing an accidental data corruption of a neighboring NAND goes up .
" So at some point , you just can't reduce the size and hope to not have data corruption , " notes Layton .
Will Disk Drives Grow in Density ?
I have been amazed at the number of charts I see that show flash densities growing and disk drive densities stagnating .
We all know that drive density growth rates have slowed , but we have still gone from 1TB drives to 2TB drives to reports of 3TB and 4TB drives as soon as this year .
We have seen enterprise 2.5 - inch drives go from 300 GB to 600GB .
Yes , flash densities will continue to grow too , but so will disk densities .
Growth rates in storage tend to have periods of fast growth followed by slow growth , then the introduction of new technologies spurs fast growth again .
I believe that this cycle , which happens for many technologies , is already happening to flash .
The fast growth period from 2007 to 2009 was a trend line that was used to predict an amazing future .
Take two or three data points , plot the slope and you have predicted a truly amazing future .
It may work for pundits and vendors , but more often than not it does not work in the real world , at least for very long .
Disk drives are going to get denser .
Just as perpendicular recording was developed in the early part of the last decade and a growth spurt followed , some new technology such as heat - assisted recording will come along and do the same thing again .
The need for more and more data storage at a low cost is not going away , and the demand has not been lost on anyone .
Low - cost storage is important for many applications that need to store lots and lots of data , and that 's a point that 's firmly in favor of spinning disk .
If the need for cheap storage were not a perennial demand , then tape would have been dead as predicted more than 20 years ago .
Tape is still far cheaper over the long term than disk , and disk is still far cheaper than flash .
That wo n't change anytime soon .
When schools started closing months ago , we heard two loud requests from teachers in our community .
They wanted :
Those sounded like unambiguously good ideas , whether schools were closed or not .
Good pedagogy .
Good technology .
Good math .
We made both .
Here is the new loudest request :
Self - checking activities .
Especially card sorts .
hey @Desmos – is there a simple way for students to see their accuracy for a matching graph / eqn card sort ?
thank you !
Is there a way to make a @ Desmos card sort self checking ?
# MTBoS #iteachmath #remotelearning
@ Desmos to help with virtual learning , is there a way to make it that students cannot advance to the next slide until their cardsort is completed correctly ?
Let ’s say you have students working on a card sort like this , matching graphs of web traffic pre- and post - coronavirus to the correct websites .
What kind of feedback would be most helpful for students here ?
Feedback is supposed to change thinking .
That ’s its job .
Ideally it develops student thinking , but some feedback diminishes it .
For example , Kluger and DeNisi ( 1996 ) found that one - third of feedback interventions decreased performance .
Butler ( 1986 ) found that grades were less effective feedback than comments at developing both student thinking and intrinsic motivation .
When the feedback came in the form of grades and comments , the results were the same as if the teacher had returned grades alone .
Grades tend to catch and keep student attention .
So we could give students a button that tells them they ’re right or wrong .
Resourceful teachers in our community have put together screens like this .
Students press a button and see if their card sort is right or wrong .
My concerns :
If students find out that they ’re right , will they simply stop thinking about the card sort , even if they could benefit from more thinking ?
If students find out that they ’re wrong , do they have enough information related to the task to help them do more than guess and check their way to their next answer ?
For example , in this video , you can see a student move between a card sort and the self - check screen three times in 11 seconds .
Is the student having three separate mathematical realizations during that interval . . . or just guessing and checking ?
On another card sort , students click the “ Check Work ” button up to 10 times .
Instead we could tell students which card is the hardest for the class .
Our teacher dashboard will show teachers which card is hardest for students .
I used the web traffic card sort last week when I taught Wendy Baty ’s eighth grade class online .
After a few minutes of early work , I told the students that “ Netflix ” had been the hardest card for them to correctly group and then invited them to think about their sort again .
I suspect that students gave the Netflix card some extra thought ( e.g. , “ How should I think about the maximum y - value in these cards ?
Is Netflix more popular than YouTube or the other way around ? ” ) even if they had matched the card correctly .
I suspect this revelation helped every student develop their thinking more than if we simply told them their sort was right or wrong .
We could also make it easier for students to see and comment on each other ’s card sorts .
In this video , you can see Julie Reulbach and Christopher Danielson talking about their different sorts .
I paired them up specifically because I knew their card sorts were different .
Christopher ’s sort is wrong , and I suspect he benefited more from their conversation than he would from hearing a computer tell him he ’s wrong .
Julie ’s sort is right , and I suspect she benefited more from explaining and defending her sort than she would from hearing a computer tell her she ’s right .
I suspect that conversations like theirs will also benefit students well beyond this particular card sort , helping them understand that “ correctness ” is something that ’s determined and justified by people , not just answer keys , and that mathematical authority is endowed in students , not just in adults and computers .
Teachers could create reaction videos .
In this video , Johanna Langill does n’t respond to every student ’s idea individually .
Instead , she looks for themes in student thinking , celebrates them , then connects and responds to those themes .
I suspect that students will learn more from Johanna ’s holistic analysis of student work than they would an individualized grade of “ right ” or “ wrong . ”
Our values are in conflict .
We want to build tools and curriculum for classes that actually exist , not for the classes of our imaginations or dreams .
That ’s why we field test our work relentlessly .
It ’s why we constantly shrink the amount of bandwidth our activities and tools require .
It ’s why we lead our field in accessibility .
We also want students to know that there are lots of interesting ways to be right in math class , and that wrong answers are useful for learning .
That ’s why we ask students to estimate , argue , notice , and wonder .
It ’s why we have built so many tools for facilitating conversations in math class .
It ’s also why we do n’t generally give students immediate feedback that their answers are “ right ” or “ wrong . ”
That kind of feedback often ends productive conversations before they begin .
But the classes that exist right now are hostile to the kinds of interactions we ’d all like students to have with their teachers , with their classmates , and with math .
Students are separated from one another by distance and time .
Resources like attention , time , and technology are stretched .
Mathematical conversations that were common in September are now impossible in May .
Our values are in conflict .
It is n’t clear to me how we ’ll resolve that conflict .
Perhaps we ’ll decide the best feedback we can offer students is a computer telling them they ’re right or wrong , but I wanted to explore the alternatives first .

The conversation continues at the Computation Layer Discourse Forum .

Speculation that Alberto Contador may team up with Bjarne Riis in 2011 is growing after the Tour de France winner refused to sign a new deal with the Astana team in Paris on Sunday and issued a statement saying that he and Astana will go separate ways when their contract ends later this year .
During the Tour de France , Contador said he was likely to stay with Astana .
However his brother Fran is now negotiating a deal with a new team for 2011 .
The statement says Contador “ wants to have time to calmly explore all possibilities available to him for the coming seasons .
But so far none has been excluded . ”
The Astana team moved quickly to confirm the separation , saying : " By setting a dead line on July 25 evening of the arrival of the Tour de France and then extending it to 48 hours as he had requested , we thought we had complied with the wishes of Alberto Contador .
We have never put any pressure , we have always acted according to his will .
His decision to leave does not depend on us but on other outside proposals .
We respect his choice , and wish him good luck . "
According to a report in Wednesday 's Gazzetta dello Sport , Contador could be close to signing with Riis , who will has found new backing from US software company Sunguard .
Riis confirmed he has also secured a second major sponsor for his team but refused to say the name of the backer during the Tour de France .
Specialized has stepped in to save Riis ' team and will bring Contador to the team as replacement for Frank and Andy Schleck , who are leaving to create their own team in Luxembourg .
According to Gazzetta dello Sport , Specialized founder and chairman Mike Sinyard convinced Contador to team - up with Riis during the final days of the Tour de France .
As part of the deal , Spanish riders Benjamin Noval , Daniel Navarro , David De La Fuente and Jesus Hernandez expected to join Contador at Riis ' team .
Contador has a personal sponsorship deal with Specialized and Riis has an option to continue using the US company 's bikes for 2011 .
Specialized seem convinced that Contador , rather than Andy Schleck , offers the best chance of continued success in the Tour de France .
Bringing Alberto Contador and Fabian Cancellara together would also create a cobbled Classics and Tour de France dream team .
The firm is expected to complete pressure tests on the well after temporarily choking it off for the first time on Thursday .
The tests are designed to see whether the steel casing of the cap is sufficiently strong for the well to be shut off in the long term .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 28 June 2010
Speaking of an English movie from 1966 that England 's manager might have chosen for his World Cup squad 's viewing before its Algeria match , the piece below suggested Carry On Screaming , with the likes of Bernard Bresslaw playing Constable Slobotham .
That part was played by Peter Butterworth ; Bernard Bresslaw played the butler , Sockett .
At the insistence of their manager , England 's World Cup opponents prepared for the match against Algeria with a private screening of The Battle of Algiers , Gillo Pontecorvo 's harrowing 1966 film depicting scenes from their country 's war of independence .
Had Fabio Capello been choosing his squad 's pre-match movie from the same fateful year for English football , he might have chosen Carry On Screaming , a Pinewood production starring Kenneth Williams , Joan Sims , Charles Hawtrey , and , as PC Slobotham and Sgt Sidney Bung , Bernard Bresslaw and Harry H Corbett .
Once again England , under their £ 6 m manager , played as if their script had been written by an untalented farceur .
To draw level with Slovenia at the top of the group , to give their morale a boost , and to allow their manager an untroubled celebration of his 64th birthday , they needed to win tonight .
Instead they laboured to a goalless draw with a performance measurably worse than their opening display last week against the United States , with whom they now share second place in the group .
At least they managed an early goal in that one , a feat they never looked like matching tonight .
Watched by Prince William , the president of the Football Association , and Prince Harry , they laboured without coming close to scoring their second goal of the competition .
On a day when Germany , so authoritative in their opening victory over Australia , astonished the world by missing a penalty and losing to unfancied Serbia , England missed the chance to show that they are capable of improving as the tournament progresses .
At least there were no goalkeeping gaffes .
Few England players have been so exposed as David James was tonight , called in by Capello to replace Robert Green , the goalkeeper whose bizarre error allowed the USA to hold England to a draw on Saturday in Rustenburg .
James , who will be 40 on 1 August , is a 6ft 4in sometime Armani model , a frequent contributor of thoughtful columns to the Observer , and owns an estate car that runs on rapeseed oil .
He has played for England , on and off , since 1997 , amassing 60 caps without ever quite managing to establish himself as the unquestioned successor to Gordon Banks , Peter Shilton and David Seaman .
He holds the Premier League record for keeping clean sheets , but is probably better known for occasional inexplicable mistakes that brought him the unfortunate nickname of Calamity James .
Given the squad 's
No 1 jersey , he was upset to be dropped in favour of the ill - fated Green for the opening Group C match , and let the management know it .
Tonight he performed confidently enough , as modern England goalkeepers often do until fate intervenes .
Algeria also changed their goalkeeper , Raïs M'Bolhi taking over from Faouzi Chaouchi , whose error presented Slovenia with a winning goal less than 24 hours after Green 's embarrassment .
England 's idea of testing the newcomer 's nerve extended little further than a series of harmless shots from long range .
Their line - up including two of James 's Portsmouth colleagues , Algeria enjoyed far less possession of the ball , but for lengthy periods the most dangerous attacker on the pitch was not the vaunted Wayne Rooney of Manchester United but the north African side 's Karim Ziani , who plays for Wolfsburg in the German league .
The chants of " England ! " occasionally overwhelmed the persistent drone of the vuvuzelas , which sound rather less insistent now that South Africa are almost certain to be eliminated and the local fans are losing their initial fervour .
After tonight 's display , England 's supporters will be fearing the same fate .
The match ended with booing and next Wednesday 's fixture against Slovenia in Port Elizabeth could send the whole project , £ 6 m Italian super - coach and all , back to the drawing board .
With many teams abandoning the caution of the first set of matches in order to try for the wins that would put them in a good position to qualify for the knockout stage , the matches are becoming more open and exciting .
Today 's other match in England 's group , between USA and Slovenia , was a cracker of a 2 - 2 draw , with USA coming back from two goals down and scoring an equaliser through their coach 's son , Michael Bradley .
This tournament is giving nepotism a good name .
Diego Maradona 's son- in - law , Sergio Agüero , had a hand in two of Argentina 's goals against South Korea on Thursday .
Unfortunately Fabio Capello's son , Pierfilippo , is a lawyer by profession and , as an Italian national , unqualified to get England out of the hole in which they find themselves .
Addressing yesterday 's report of cloud - based iTunes streaming coming " soon " , 's well - connected Greg Sandoval reports that things still may not be as far along as many observers would like , as music labels have reportedly yet to sign on to the deal .
While it's hard to say what Boy Genius ' source meant by " soon " it 's worth noting that Apple has yet to obtain necessary licenses from the top four recording companies , according to multiple music industry insiders .
They added that Apple has indeed engaged in discussions with the music labels but the record execs have n't even seen all of the details yet .
The way some at the major labels see the situation , Apple could enable iTunes users to stream songs from a home computer to other gadgets without requiring new negotiation , but for Apple to stream music from the company 's servers to computers and other gadgets , the labels would require CEO Steve Jobs to cut a new deal , the sources said .
The report notes that Apple could try to press the issue and roll out a cloud - based streaming service without negotiating new deals with the music labels , although it would likely find itself in court to address whether such usage is permitted under current licenses .
So , unless Apple is ready to go to war over this , do n't expect an iTunes cloud service -- at least one offering music -- anytime soon .
Music insiders say that while that the whole sector would welcome an iTunes cloud service , negotiating the licenses will likely take months .
The possibility of a cloud - based streaming service for iTunes has been a hot topic of conversation since Apple 's acquisition of music streaming firm Lala Media late last year , as users look forward to the ability to access their music on a variety of Internet - connected devices without the need for manual syncing of content or significant local storage requirements .
MadSci Network : Medicine Query :
Hi Andrew
Thanks for your question , it has got to be one of the most interesting and amusing I�ve received .
I�m not really a fluid dynamicist , so other experts may be able to give a more accurate and detailed answer , but I have run my answer past a friend who has knowledge of fluid dynamics , and he agrees with me , so I hope I�ll be able to give you a layman�s explanation of what is going on ( I must note that my explanation is not based upon fluid dynamics ) .
But firstly two apologies :
One apology I have to make is to any females reading this �
I am assuming the person urinating is male , so you may wish to make adjustments for your own physiology .
The second apology is for my poor attempts at humour � forgive me , I �m only a scientist .
You ask why , when urinating , the urine seems to take a spiral or helical path on it�s way to the toilet ( assuming that �s where we�re aiming :-) , rather than a uniform path with a disc - shaped cross-section .
The first thing to note is that the opening of the urethra ( the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside world ) at the tip of the penis is not circular ; it is more of a slit .
So we immediately have a situation where the disc - shaped cross-section model is not valid .
But why does the flow of urine appear to twist on its way down ?
There are a number of effects going on , and I�ll try to explain them .
Firstly , I will assume that the urine is a liquid made up of discrete particles .
Because urine is a liquid , there is moderate attraction between the particles in the liquid .
This attraction is a result of gravitational attraction ( small particles such as molecules or atoms are attracted to each other in exactly the same way as planets are - even urine can be attractive :-) and electrostatic attraction ( some of the particles in the urine may not be electrostatically neutral , and opposing electric charges attract one another ) .
In a gas , the energy of the particles is such that the force of the attraction between particles can be easily broken and they can roam freely ; in a solid the attraction between particles is so strong that the particles are fixed into a lattice and cannot easily move .
Something in - between the two is true for a liquid , so we can think of any two particles in a liquid as being connected by an imaginary elastic band .
When we urinate , the urine does not flow at equal speed across the urethra � some parts of the liquid may flow faster than others .
So when the urine exits the body , parts of it are travelling faster than others .
Image if we were to fire two metal balls in the same direction at the same time , but one of them was set off travelling slightly slower than the other .
If you took a side - on view , you would see two similar , but different arcs that the two balls would take .
Now imagine that they are joined by an elastic band � the paths that the balls take would still be two arcs , but they would be slightly distorted .
Now imagine thousands or millions of these balls , fired in a stream , with differing speeds , many of them connected together by elastic bands of differing strength .
The result would look similar to what happens when you urinate .
Another reason that the path of the urine seems to spiral is that not every drop ( particle ) of urine leaves the body in a perfectly straight direction � some are ejected moving slightly to the right , or slightly to the left , and likewise in the vertical directions .
Because of the attraction mentioned earlier , the path of the urine is changed from that which we would expect .
Yet another reason is that air resistance will contribute to the path that urine takes .
For particles of similar size , shape and density , the change in speed due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity that the object is travelling at � so particles ( droplets ) of urine will experience a different force due to air resistance depending on how fast they are travelling .
Particles in the stream can be decelerated by other particles in the stream .
So , in essence , the path that the urine takes does not actually spiral , but is fairly complex ( some would say chaotic ) , and it is our brain trying to make sense of the shape it sees that makes us think the path is a spiral .
To answer the question about why the stream splits into two , I have two ideas : ( Warning � Personal information about a scientist�s toilet habits coming up ! ) - firstly , I�ve noticed that if I urinate with my foreskin over the head of my penis , sometimes the flow of urine seems to come more from outsides of the opening than the inside , so the stream forms a sort of � V - shape� � splitting into two .
Secondly , another explanation is that of air resistance and the attraction between the particles in the stream .
It may be possible that due to the factors discussed earlier , it is easier for the stream of urine to split into two than to stay as one stream .
I disagree with your statement that this is n�t real science .
For me , science is about asking the question � Why ? � about any area of life � whether that be � Why is the sky blue ? � or � Why does my urine seem to rotate as I pee ? � � and then looking for the answer in a rigorous way .
I hope this has answered your questions , if you are interested in the areas of science mentioned in this answer then I suggest you look at general textbooks on the following subjects : Newtonian / Classical Mechanics , Electrostatics , Fluid Dynamics .
A standard college physics textbook should discuss the above subjects .
However I would be surprised if there is an example of urinating in the textbooks � perhaps someone will write such an example one day :-)

Columbia , Tennessee ( a.k.a.
" The Mule Capital of the World " ) has a new defender : The Viper , a 20 - year - old masked man who patrols the town square carrying batons and ninja stars .
Police are n't impressed , but hey , someone has to defend those mules .

Columbia police spotted The Viper in the ~ 34,000 - person town 's public square last week .
They told the crime - fighter to quit the foolin ' and to stop defying the town 's " no masks " ordinance .
Nonetheless , citizens are curious about the self - anointed do - gooder .
Columbia bike shop owner A.C. Howell is warily optimistic about The Viper 's potential as an agent of justice :
The Viper , I believe .
Is n't he the Masked Viper ? [...]
I do n't know .
He needs something to do .
Probably needs a job .
I hope he 's looking out for my benefit .
I hope he 's guarding my store [...]
I welcome him to Columbia .
I hope he does some good .

We at io9 salute The Viper for his brave sartorial choices .
The forest green detailing is lush and not ostentatious , and his mask 's holes are ample enough to allow his eyes to breathe .
We are however less impressed with his name — " The Viper " is n't a moniker that screams civic confidence .
Seeing as how Columbia is the Mule Capital of the World , The Viper should rebrand himself as " The Mule " and carry around an arsenal of non-lethal oats and salt licks .
Criminals wo n't know what hit 'em .

The European Commission ’s smart grid initiative has been launched .
The European Electricity Grid Initiative ( EEGI ) proposes a nine year European research , development and demonstration program to be initiated by electricity transmission and distribution network operators to develop a next generation smart grid electricity network for Europe , which will deployed between 2010 to 2030 .
Its objectives are
Integration of renewable and distributed sources of electricity
Integration of national networks into a single European electricity market
Improved reliability of electricity supply
Customer participation
Support for electric vehicles
Efficiency
Business opportunities
The estimated cost for the nine - year period is € 2 billion with the financing being provided by the member states of the EU , the European Commission , and industry .
The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity ( ENTSO-E ) says that the European Commission supports the EEGI through its Seventh Framework Programme , but that the commitment of member states is necessary to support and fund the complete EEGI roadmap .
The roadmap for 2010 - 2018 and a detailed implementation plan for 2010 - 2012 have been published .
OTTAWA – The Conservative government is giving consumers permission to copy content for personal use , while expanding the ability of businesses to digitally lock their products to prevent anyone from actually doing it .
The government is once again trying to modernize copyright legislation – last updated when a cassette deck was still a standard feature on a stereo system – by introducing a bill that would finally legalize what thousands of Canadians have been doing for years .
That means it would no longer be against the law to record television programs for later viewing or copy songs from compact discs onto a computer so they can be transferred onto an MP3 player .
At the same time , the bill tabled in the House of Commons on Wednesday would make it illegal for consumers to break any technological protection measures – so - called “ digital locks ” – that prevent unauthorized access to the copyrighted material , with fines of up to a million dollars and five years in jail .
That is expected to be the most hotly debated aspect of the amendments contained in Bill C - 32 , as consumer advocates and online technology experts say this amounts to the government giving with one hand and taking away with the other .
“ If I lock my door and I say ‘ Go in and use the fridge ’ , the moment you break my lock , you ’re breaking and entering , even if I say ‘ Once you ’re in the house , you can use my fridge , ” said Toronto - based copyright lawyer Sheldon Burshtein .
That is because the proposed rules against circumventing technological protection measures trump virtually all the newfound freedoms contained in the bill , such as allowing schools greater flexibility in using copyrighted material in the classroom under so - called “ fair dealing ” exemptions .
“ We ’re quite disappointed by it , because although there is exception for educational and research purposes , it is essentially trumped by the anti-circumvention rules in the legislation , ” said David Robinson , associate executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers .
“ I think there is a real danger that the large publishing and entertainment industries are going to put locks on them as a way of increasing their profits and I think that is going to have a real impact on our ability in our sector to do research , to innovate and to be creative . ”
The provision would even override existing rights such as allowing journalists to use copyrighted material in news reporting .
The only exceptions are for technology firms that need to reproduce copyrighted material for research and development purposes such as security testing and consumers who want to switch their wireless device to another service provider .
Industry Minister Tony Clement , speaking at the Montreal offices of U.S. video game maker EA Games , said that market forces and trends will keep publishers , game makers and film distributors from using digital locks too heavily .
“ There will be lots of content that is not locked and for those areas where content is locked I ’m sure there will be lots of consumer pressure to provide other alternatives , ” said Clement .
“ We ’re not imposing locks on anyone . ”
Those calling for greater freedom in what consumers can do with legitimately obtained copyrighted material are not the only ones disappointed in the bill .
“ The bill will now allow format shifting and private copying without any compensation or recognition of the rights of creators and so we ’re clearly disappointed .
. . that it is in fact taking rights away from creators that we had under the current Act , ” said Stephen Waddell , national executive director for ACTRA .
The government has been under pressure from the United States and Europe to strengthen Canadian copyright law and bring it into line with international treaties , but the bill should quash any fears that companies will start making examples out of ordinary citizens by launching major lawsuits like those seen below the border .
The proposed legislation limits the amount for which companies such as record labels can sue individuals for accessing pirated materials , as long as it was not done for commercial purposes .
Current law does not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial infringements , so individuals could be sued for up to $ 20,000 for each work copied to a maximum of $ 1 million .
The new bill reduces the possible damages a judge could award in a non-commercial case to a one - time payment of up to $ 5,000 .
Still , the government is giving businesses a new legal avenue to sue online piracy sites that facilitate copyright infringement – so called “ enablers , ” according to the law .
The civil remedy adds to the existing criminal provisions that deal with pirate sites .
Internet service providers – those that provide Internet access in homes and businesses – are now required to notify a customer fingered by a copyright owner that he or she is allegedly illegally sharing files .
This is the third time the Harper government has attempted to change copyright legislation – the last bill , C - 61 , faced massive opposition from the public before dying when the 2008 election was called – and Clement has acknowledge he needs the support of another party to succeed .
Liberal heritage critic Pablo Rodriguez said his party is not yet ready to say yes or no .

“ We ’ll take the necessary time to consult with stakeholders and also the caucus , ” Rodriguez said in an interview Wednesday .
Charlie Angus , the NDP critic for digital issues , came out strongly against the bill because it does not provide for the compensation of artists , but said his party is willing to work on it .
“ We intend to produce a bill that will work , that will be fair to artists ( and ) that will make sure artists get paid , but will stop criminalizing citizens for accessing works that they paid for , ” Angus told reporters outside the Commons .
At the moment , if you download something from the DSiWare store ( downloadable games / programs for the DSi ) , the program will be linked to the DSi console you download it on , rather than to the account you downloaded it with .
Whilst the reasoning behind Nintendo doing this seems to make sense ( to prevent you from downloading the game onto all your friend 's consoles , while only you pay for it ) , there is a bit of a bump in their plan - a new handheld shaped bump , known as the 3DS .
If the current system stays in place , when DSi or DSiXL owners want to upgrade to a 3DS , they wo n't be able to bring their downloaded games ( that they 've paid for ) along with them to the new console .
Luckily , Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils - Aime says that Nintendo are aware of this , but has said that " until we move to a different type of approach , like an account based approach , you 're not going to be able to transfer the content " .
With Nintendo's current online approach being rather behind when compared to the other companies ( having to exchange friend codes unique for each game to play online , for example ) , an upgraded online service for Nintendo consoles has been long overdue .
Nintendo seem to have realised that people are tiring of the friend code method of multiplayer , with Pokémon Black and White allowing for random online matchmaking , so hopefully a new account based Nintendo online service is n't far away .
We just hope it's out before the 3DS is , or it could impair the sales of what could be the most successful handheld ever .
We 'll have more details closer to the 3DS 's launch , whenever that may be .
When the Fraser Paper Mill shut down in the northern New Hampshire city of Berlin in 2006 , many people wondered how the city would recover .
The mill , which had been in operation for over 100 years , was vital to the economic stability of the community .
The mill ’s closure evaporated hundreds of jobs , tens of thousands of dollars in tax revenue and closed the book on a century of history built around the paper industry .
Now , as New Hampshire is poised to pass a renewable portfolio standard ( RPS ) later this spring , a new chapter of economic progress based on renewable energy is unfolding for the city of Berlin .
LaidLaw Energy Group , a New York - based developer of independent renewable power plants , has proposed turning the Fraser Paper Mill into a 50 megawatt ( MW ) capacity biomass electrical generation facility that will utilize woodchips .
Because the mill ’s infrastructure is well suited for developing a power plant , it will be easier and cheaper for the company to construct the facility .
If completed in 2008 as planned , the biomass facility will create approximately 500 indirect and 40 direct jobs in timber - rich Coos County where Berlin is located .
While a power plant will require much less labor than the old paper mill , 540 jobs are a welcome addition to the area .
“ Clearly this project would help the local economy and many of the folks who have relied on the paper industry over the years , ” said Berlin City Manager Patrick MacQueen .
“ This project will be great for job creation and actually maintaining the jobs that get built . ”
A University of New Hampshire study released this February titled , “ Economic Impact of a New Hampshire Renewable Portfolio Standard , ” concluded that an adoption of 20 percent renewable energy will create thousands of jobs with wages much higher than the current state average , generate over $ 1 million in state revenue , and provide a “ newfound opportunity for NH residents to start businesses . ”
Former New Hampshire Congressman Charlie Bass , who recently joined Laidlaw Energy Group as Special Advisor to company President and CEO Michael Bartoszek , said that renewable energy projects like the Berlin biomass plant are important for economic growth and stability in the state .
“ I ’ve always been active in supporting alternative energy sources , so I ’m excited to be involved with [ the Berlin ] project .
Developments like this will truly benefit the state of New Hampshire and the rest of our country , ” Bass said .
Additional studies released over the last decade have indicated that a large - scale transition by the U.S. into a clean energy economy would significantly benefit the country by creating hundreds of thousands of domestic jobs , generate tens of billions of dollars in federal and state tax revenues , and help revitalize struggling communities .
According to a 2004 meta- analysis from of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory ( RAEL ) at the University of California , Berkeley , which examined 13 studies on the economic benefits of renewable energy , approximately 240,000 jobs could be created and maintained if the country passed a 20 percent by 2020 RPS .
If the U.S. relied solely on fossil fuels , the country would only maintain around 75,000 jobs .
“ We found that you get three to five times the amount of jobs in the renewables area than you do in fossil fuels , ” said Dan Kammen , director of RAEL and co-author of the meta- analysis .
“ The finding was not that there ’s some incredibly intrinsic , wonderful feature about renewables , even though I might think there is .
It was that these benefits go to the first victors . ”
That means local communities and states must act now in order to be part of the expected job growth .
The employment opportunities created by the renewable energy sector will be diverse — ranging from indirect manufacturing and construction jobs to direct facility design , operation and maintenance jobs .
States like California , Texas , and others in the Midwest that have been most aggressive in supporting the solar , wind and biofuel industries are going to see the largest growth in those employment areas noted Kammen .
For example , communities in the Midwestern Corn Belt are seeing a considerable economic boom because of the rapid growth of the biofuel industries .
A report released this February found that the ethanol industry created over 163,000 direct and indirect jobs , generated $ 4.9 billion in federal , state and local taxes and reduced the federal trade deficit by $ 11.2 billion in 2006 .
“ The renewable fuels industry is creating economic activity , it ’s creating jobs , it ’s generating income , it ’s generating tax revenue and it ’s paying for itself , ” said John Urbanchuk , Director of LECG LLC and author of the ethanol report .
“ And since most of these plants are located in rural areas , they are a significant impetus to rural economic development and economic growth . ”
When the U.S. finally adopts high amounts of renewable energy , there will undoubtedly be jobs lost in the fossil fuel industries .
But the country wo n’t restructure itself overnight , so companies and workers will have time to adapt to the evolving energy landscape .
“ Most of the big energy companies are rich — they are big and diversified .
There are efforts going on among all the big oil companies to invest heavily in renewables .
So I think you ’re not going to see job losses , you ’re going to see a shift , with the one exception of coal if the industry does n’t get on board with finding a way to make coal as close to carbon neutral as possible , ” said Kammen .
When Laidlaw finishes the 50 MW biomass plant in Berlin , the renovated paper mill will be a symbol for the new wave of economic development based on clean energy that is gradually emerging in the U.S.
Now it ’s up to states and local communities to decide whether they want to be part of the growth .
“ There is simply too much talk and not enough action right now , ” said former Congressman Bass .
“ Developing projects like the one in Berlin is how you change the paradigm . ”

Here in Australia the trade union movement has been a strong supporter of the aboriginal struggle for justice .
The Israeli massacre of 19 unarmed civilians on the freedom flotilla to Gaza brings to the fore the Israeli occupation of Palestine and its brutal treatment of the Palestinian people .
The blockade measn that Palestinians cannot rebuild their homes , schools , hospitals or mosques .
It condemns 65 percent of Gazan children to anaemia , and 61 percent of Gazans to food insecurity .
75 percent are dependent on food aid to live .
The International Trade Union Confederation has condemned ‘ the killing of as many as 19 persons in a boat convoy headed for Gaza today , and the wounding of many more , as an outrage . ’
The International Federation of Journalists ( IFJ ) ‘ reacted with shock at the news of the brutal attacks on civilians , including journalists , by Israeli forces in the assault on a flotilla that yesterday tried to breach the military blockade of the Gaza coastline in Palestine . ‘
“ We join the European Union in demanding a full inquiry which must be independent in order to be credible .
We condemn any attempt at the blackout and censorship of news by the Israeli authorities which is hindering journalists from giving an accurate account of what is happening , ” said Jim Boumelha , IFJ President .
The International Transport Workers ’ Union ( ITF ) , representing professional seafarers worldwide , was ‘ shocked and appalled by Israeli forces ’ attack on the lead ship of a humanitarian aid convoy , the Turkish vessel “ Mavi Marmaris ” . ’
The ITF denounced ‘ Israel ’s blockade of Gaza and calls on the international community to support a political solution in which a viable Palestinian state can play a full part in international trade and commerce , which would include the full restoration of transport links . ’
The Congress of South African Trade Unions was ‘ outraged at the murder by Israeli commandos ’ of at least twenty people – and injuries to a further 60 – as a result of their armed attack on a convoy of ships carrying aid to the people of Gaza . ’
COSATU played the key role in the overthrow of apartheid .
It went on to say :
COSATU also calls for greater support for the international boycott , divestment and boycott campaign against Israel , which is proving again to be violent and ruthless in attacking and murdering those who stand in its way .
We urge all South Africans to refuse to buy or handle any goods from Israel or have any dealings with Israeli businesses .
COSATU reaffirms its support of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to national sovereignty and the same human rights as any other people .
We demand the immediate end to the Israeli siege and the illegal occupation of the sovereign territory which has been violently seized from the Palestinian nation .
The Palestinian Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) strongly condemned the fatal attack by the Israeli navy on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip .
It sent Palestinian civil society ’s condolences to the families and friends of those killed by the Israeli assault and warmly salutes the principled solidarity and moral commitment of all those involved in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
The BNC called on international civil society to :
Mobilize for an emergency Global BDS Day of Action on Saturday 5 June 2010 — the 43rd anniversary of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank , including East Jerusalem
Pressure governments to start implementing trade sanctions and arms embargoes
We call specifically on transport and dock workers and unions around the globe to : Refuse to load / offload Israeli ships and airplanes , following the historic example set by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) in Durban in February 2009 and endorsed by the Maritime Union of Australia ( Western Australia ) .
Swedish dock workers are showing the way .
The Swedish Port Workers Union has given notice that it will blockade all Israeli ships and cargo to and from Israel handled by its members from June 15 until June 24 as a result of the unprecedented criminal attack on the peaceful ship convoy in Gaza .
In Wollongong , a major industrial centre and port south of Sydney , the South Coast Labour Council backed unions , including the Construction , Forestry , Mining and Energy Union , calling for a boycott of products and goods produced by Israel in illegal settlements of occupied Palestinian territories and will be urging the ACTU and all Trades and Labour Councils to follow suit .
The actions of the Israelis in killing unarmed aid workers show that this is a regime which only understands force .
The only peaceful force we ordinary workers have in response is our ability to withhold our labour .
I call on the ACTU , in defence of the Palestinians against the brutal apartheid regime of Israel , to support the international boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel and for all affiliated unions to implement bans consistent with this objective .
Today the Eleventh Circuit issued an unfortunate amended decision in Rehberg v. Hodges .
The case arose from an egregious situation in which , among other misconduct , a prosecutor used a sham grand jury subpoena to obtain the private emails of whistleblower Charles Rehberg after he brought attention to systematic mismanagement of funds at a Georgia public hospital .
The Court held that Mr. Rehberg 's privacy interest in his emails held by his ISP was not " clearly established " and therefore his claim against the prosecutors could not proceed .
The Court relied on a legal doctrine called qualified immunity , which holds that lawsuits against government officials for violations of constitutional rights cannot proceed unless those rights were " clearly established " at the time .
The Court declined to rule on whether individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their emails .
We 're disappointed in this decision .
Not only is it wrong for Mr. Rehberg , who had his emails turned over to a prosecutor based on a sham subpoena , but it 's troubling for the millions of individuals in the Eleventh Circuit who have their email stored with ISPs .
Our most sensitive and private thoughts , ideas and correspondence are contained in our emails .
The Fourth Amendment requires judicial supervision ( usually a warrant ) before the government can access your personal papers in order to protect against just the sort of abuse that Mr. Rehberg suffered -- a rogue government official seeking to get your emails from your ISP with no court oversight and then turning it over to others who seek to harm you .
While the decision is very bad news for Mr. Rehberg , the Court did take the opportunity to correct some erroneous analysis in the panel 's previous decision .
The earlier decision had held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply at all once an email was received by your ISP .
The Court had written that a " person also loses a reasonable expectation of privacy in emails , at least after the email is sent to and received by a third party " and that " Rehberg 's voluntary delivery of emails to third parties constituted a voluntary relinquishment of the right to privacy in that information . "
This is not the law , and the incorrect statements are no longer precedent .
In other words , the Court did not rule out the possibility that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in your email .
That is useful and will be important to other cases moving forward , as law professor Paul Ohm , who wrote an amicus brief in the case , has noted .
However , the Court did not rule that there was privacy protection for your emails either .
Rather than embracing the obvious conclusion that our constitutional protections need to be recognized for email content , the court ducked the question , claiming that email is simply too new a technology for them to decide whether the Constitution applies .
With all due respect , email is far too important to the daily lives of millions of Americans for its constitutional status to be unclear .
Email content must be protected by the Fourth Amendment whether stored with an ISP or not .
It 's long past time that the courts recognize that the constitutional privacy protections for our " papers " still apply when they are in digital form .
This is my maternity leave hobby .
While my baby is taking her nap , I try to imagine her dream and capture it .
VEGETABLE torte was not in my repertory until recently .
I thought there was something a wee bit fussy about it , something a bit ’ 80s .
But I kept encountering these non-pastry cakes and enjoying them , so it was time to make one of my own .
Getting it right takes a little time .
You really must grill ( or pan - grill ) or roast all the vegetables well  they have to become quite tender  before assembling the torte .
Ultimately , you want the vegetables to almost melt together .
Grilling is the technique of choice because it gives the vegetables a hint of smokiness .
You can use whatever vegetables you have on hand .
Eggplant , summer squash , bell peppers and mushrooms make a nice combination and are easy to grill , but I ’ve added layers of caramelized onions , leftover cooked spinach ( squeezed dry ) and lightly cooked tomato .
This recipe is a set of loose guidelines you can tweak at will .
The assembly is fun .
Start with eggplant , which provides a nice base , then add the other vegetables in repeating layers , being sure to press down a bit with a spatula now and then to keep the torte compact .
If you do n’t have fresh basil , use thyme or oregano , but in any case get some fresh herbs in there .
Top the torte with bread crumbs and Parmesan  not a thick , gooey layer , but enough to season the crumbs and create a crisp top .
Not the fastest or easiest recipe , but worth the work .

For decades research has shown that listening to music alleviates anxiety and depression , enhances mood , and can increase cognitive functioning , such as spatial awareness .
However , until now , research has not addressed how we listen to music .
For instance , is the cognitive benefit still the same if we listen to music whilst performing a task , rather than before it ?
Further , how does our preference for a particular type of music affect performance ?
A new study from Applied Cognitive Psychology shows that listening to music that one likes whilst performing a serial recall task does not help performance any more than listening to music one does not enjoy .
The researchers explored the ' irrelevant sound effect ' by requiring participants to perform serial recall ( recall a list of 8 consonants in presentation order ) in the presence of five sound environments : quiet , liked music ( e.g. , Rihanna , Lady Gaga , Stranglers , and Arcade Fire ) , disliked music ( the track " Thrashers " by Death Angel ) , changing - state ( a sequence of random digits such as " 4 , 7 , 1 , 6 " ) and steady - state ( " 3 , 3 , 3 " ) .
Recall ability was approximately the same , and poorest , for the music and changing - state conditions .
The most accurate recall occurred when participants performed the task in the quieter , steady - state environments .
Thus listening to music , regardless of whether people liked or disliked it , impaired their concurrent performance .
Lead researcher Nick Perham explains : " The poorer performance of the music and changing - state sounds are due to the acoustical variation within those environments .
This impairs the ability to recall the order of items , via rehearsal , within the presented list .
Mental arithmetic also requires the ability to retain order information in the short - term via rehearsal , and may be similarly affected by their performance in the presence of changing - state , background environments . "
Although music can have a very positive effect on our general mental health , music can , in the circumstances described , also have negative effects on cognitive performance .
Perham remarks , " Most people listen to music at the same time as , rather than prior to performing a task .
To reduce the negative effects of background music when recalling information in order one should either perform the task in quiet or only listen to music prior to performing the task . "

On what has to be one of the most awaited projects for the street - art enthusiasts to show up in Lisboa , FAILE came to blow everyone ’s expectations , including mine .
For over a week , I had the privilege to follow the process of building from up close .
I could n’t be more happy to know that people are walking and stopping by to see what it ’s all about .
I know there ’s some pics out already , but this post had to be written with some time and only after getting back a couple of times and seeing peoples reactions .
So , jump inside for extended and uncut version of the temple .
The background
The concept of freedom will be explored as a singular , unifying vision throughout PortugalArte10 .
This is of particular importance in Portugal , as it has only been within the last forty years that the country was able to release itself from dictatorship in a brave and bloodless revolution .
This development in the country ’s recent history has enabled Portugal to renew the spirit that drove the Portuguese to discover the New World .
A massive undertaking and one of the largest public art projects in the world will be presented to express this notion .
The world - renowned street art collective Faile will present the Temple Project , a giant sculptural installation in the heart of the city of Lisbon .
Faile are known worldwide for their ambitious public projects that have been mounted in such cities as New York , Shanghai , and London .
Using the physical street as a canvas for expressing their ideas , Faile is part of a global movement that has been embraced by audiences for its popular approach to artistic and creative expression .
This is a FAILE project executed for Portugal Arte ’ 10 .
The making of
A team of Portuguese workers help gave birth to this project during less than 2 weeks .
pics by Jorge Vieira
UPDATE : And these were just sent from the Patricks camera
The surroundings …
They had been to Portugal before , and have studied their lesson quite well .
If you look at the surrounding areas of Restauradores ( where the temple is located ) , this is what you ’ll see :
The integration of the temple Project within the very fabrics of the city will serve a crucial role in granting audiences the ability to engage and interact on their own terms .
After speaking with FAILE , the idea of building a temple which would be so well camouflaged in plain sight , that people would n’t be able to understand if it has been there for ages or not , was a good goal .
This concern to make it look “ right ” for the place it was in , resulted in a beautiful clash between Portuguese culture and their pop-culture style into an amazing piece of art .
Outside look
From some angles on the main square of Restauradores .
Inside look
The reliefs
The tiles
A bunch of different patterns , from the more typical ones , to the camouflaged skulls .
Surrounding the temple were these tile walls were you could read “ Savage Young Minds Sacred ”
The Prayer Wheels
Probably my favorite pieces from all the FAILE imagery .
I loved the wood tottems which I had the chance to check at the Lazarides this year , but being able to touch these and spin them where a must .
The mosaics
Turning some of their most known stencils / prints into these huge mosaic artworks gave the temple a final touch .
The Scuba - Horse
A beautiful sculpture making it the main piece in the center of the temple .
I ’d open a pool in my house just to have this one in it .
This sculpture was done with the talented artist Charlie Becker .
The iron
“ Nada Dura Para Sempre ” ( Nothing Lasts Forever )
Iron adorning the temple whether on the gates , on the roof or in front of each mosaic piece .
The extras
There where however some pieces that did n’t made the cut , and most likely you wo n’t find pics of those elsewhere .
I got lucky to have seen them when we were opening the crates that contained the material , and snapped a pic of this beauty .
The reactions
People ’s reactions have been amazing .
This is the high note of the project .
You know you have succeed when everybody just stops and wonders what that is all about , before stepping in to the temple to look around .
Some of the reactions I ’ve witnessed first hand were :
– During construction , an old man getting up to me asking what was that and how long would it last , to which I replied one month and he just said “ so much work for this to be up one month ?
It ’s beautiful , it should stay here ” .
– Tourists walking around with maps on their hands , looking to the temple , back to the maps and back to the temple , wondering what the hell that monument is , and why it ’s not on the maps .
( most common reaction )
– A man who said “ I heard there was some shit going on here , let ’s see what ’s this all about ” .
He sayed that in such a tone , that it looked like he was about to trash it .
But after approaching the temple he literally stayed 10 m just at the entrance looking and snapping some pics , while I waited for him to move away for me to take a pic .
And I waited … and waited !

Final words
I know this post is long and to finish it , I just hope they do get back and also have the chance to drop some of their stencils on the streets .
Who knows , maybe it ’s sooner than we think .
Was great meeting them .

A close ally of Gordon Brown has suggested to the BBC that Labour are close to conceding defeat in their efforts to do a deal to stay in power .
The BBC's Nick Robinson said he was told the Lib Dems had decided to back the Tories and Labour would regroup as the only " progressive " party .
It would clear the way for a Lib Dem and Tory deal which would see David Cameron becoming prime minister .
Mr Brown is understood to have spoken by phone to former PM Tony Blair .
He is in his office with his wife Sarah and close allies Lord Mandelson , Ed Miliband , Ed Balls , Douglas Alexander , Alastair Campbell and Sue Nye .
But a Downing Street source said Mr Brown would not announce his resignation until there was an announcement of any deal between Nick Clegg and Mr Cameron .
The Lib Dem and Conservative teams are still in talks at the Cabinet Office - four days after the UK general election resulted in a hung parliament .
Mr Cameron , Conservative leader , met Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in private for an hour earlier on Tuesday .
' Deliverability problems '
The BBC 's political editor said a senior Lib Dem source had told him that talks with Labour had been " amicable but problems remain on deliverability and Labour cohesion " while Labour sources said the Lib Dems had unaffordable tax and spending commitments .
Conservative MPs are due to meet at 2000 BST .
Lib Dem MPs , peers and the party 's ruling body , the federal executive , are to meet at 2030 BST , Mr Clegg must secure a majority of support from both groups before pressing ahead with any deal .
I hope they will make the right decision to give this country the strong , stable government that it badly needs and badly needs quickly

Send us your comments Labour MP rules out deal with SNP Nick Robinson : Head v hearts Q&A : A Tory - Lib Dem alliance ?
Talks between Labour and the Lib Dems began formally on Monday when Mr Brown announced he would be stepping down as Labour leader .
But several senior Labour figures have since warned against a coalition with the Lib Dems , particularly if the price involves offering them a referendum on changing the voting system to proportional representation .
Cabinet minister Andy Burnham told the BBC that Labour had to " respect the results of the general election and we can't get away from the fact that Labour did n't win " .
An aide said he was merely voicing concerns among colleagues .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said he had learned elements of the likely joint Tory - Lib Dem economic and business policy .
' Good discussions '
He said the Tory commitment to cut spending by £ 6bn this year would stand unless there was a big financial deterioration - while the Tories would adopt the Lib Dem plan to raise the tax - free allowance on income tax to £ 10,000 .
He also said any big increase in the inheritance tax threshold would not happen while the Lib Dems were part of the government .
Entering the Tory - Lib Dem talks on Tuesday afternoon , senior Conservative William Hague said they felt " very strongly that there should be a government with a strong and secure majority in the House of Commons and an elected prime minister " and had " come here to hear the Liberal Democrat response " .
Labour 's Ed Miliband said they had had " good discussions " with the Lib Dems earlier .
But some Labour figures - including David Blunkett and John Reid - have warned against a deal .
Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said talks had reached a " critical and final phase " and his party would " do our bit to create a stable , good government " .
BROWN TO STAND DOWN Tory ' final offer ' on vote reform Q&A : Brown 's decision to quit Gordon Brown 's rise and fall Labour leader : Runners and riders
In quotes : Resignation reaction
In pictures : Gordon Brown Both Labour and the Tories have been trying to woo the Lib Dems with promises on electoral reform to help them form a government , after the Conservatives won the most seats in Thursday 's election but fell short of an overall majority .
Labour say if the Lib Dems back them they will put the Alternative Vote system into law and then hold a referendum asking voters if they want a proportional representation voting system - a key issue for the Lib Dems .
Under AV , voters rank candidates in a constituency .
If no - one gets 50 % of votes the candidate finishing last gets eliminated and their second preferences are awarded to the remaining candidates .
This continues until one candidate passes the 50 % mark .
The Conservatives upped their offer to the Lib Dems to a promise of a referendum on changing the voting system from existing first past the post system to AV .
' Decision time ' Speaking on Tuesday morning Mr Cameron said his party had made a " very reasonable " offer to the Lib Dems and had put aside party interest in favour of the national interest - the Conservatives oppose changing the voting system .
Mr Cameron said : " It 's now , I believe , decision time , decision time for the Liberal Democrats and I hope they will make the right decision to give this country the strong , stable government that it badly needs and badly needs quickly . "

But former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC he was " very angry " as he had believed Mr Clegg was " acting in a very honourable way " before learning his team had been secretly meeting Labour .
Meanwhile David Miliband refused to be drawn on the progress of talks between the Lib Dems and Labour - but appeared to confirm he would stand to succeed Mr Brown as Labour leader , saying : " I 'm certainly not going to be saying anything more - and none of the candidates are going to be saying anything more . "
Senior Lib Dem and Labour figures have appeared to rule out a " rainbow coalition " involving the SNP and have said instead they could rule as a minority government , confident that the Scottish nationalists would not vote with the Conservatives .

Elected Reps. chose to hide details from American public for fear of reprisals from “ the big forces ” that run the media and the presidency
Steve Watson
Prisonplanet.com
Thursday , Jul 15th , 2010
Over 1,100 pages of previously classified Vietnam - era transcripts released this week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee highlight the fact that several Senators knew that the White House and the Pentagon had deceived the American people over the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident .
The latest releases , which document skepticism over the pretext for entry into the Vietnam war , date from 1968 .
Four years into the war , senators were at loggerheads with Lyndon B. Johnson .
At the time Foreign Relations Committee meetings were held behind closed doors .
It would take over thirty years for the truth to emerge that the Aug.
4 , 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident , where US warships were apparently attacked by North Vietnamese PT Boats – an incident that kicked off US involvement in the Vietnam war – was a staged event that never actually took place .
However , the records now show that at the time senators knew this was the case .
In a March 1968 closed session of the Foreign Relations Committee , Senator Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee , the father of former vice president Al Gore , noted :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ If this country has been misled , if this committee , this Congress , has been misled by pretext into a war in which thousands of young men have died , and many more thousands have been crippled for life , and out of which their country has lost prestige , moral position in the world , the consequences are very great , ”
Senator Frank Church , Democrat of Idaho , said in an executive session in February 1968 :
“ In a democracy you cannot expect the people , whose sons are being killed and who will be killed , to exercise their judgment if the truth is concealed from them , ”
Other senators were keen to withhold the truth about Tonkin in order not to inflame public opinion on the war :
Senator Mike Mansfield , Democrat of Montana , stated , “ You will give people who are not interested in facts a chance to exploit them and to magnify them out of all proportion . ”
Mansfield was referring to the proposed release of a committee staff investigation that raised doubts over whether the Tonkin incident ever took place .
The committee decided in the end to effectively conceal the truth , with Senator Church noting that if the committee came up with proof that an attack never occurred , “ we have a case that will discredit the military in the United States , and discredit and quite possibly destroy the president . ”
He also noted that if the senators were to follow up on their skepticism over Tonkin , “ The big forces in this country that have most of the influence and run most of the newspapers and are oriented toward the presidency will lose no opportunity to thoroughly discredit this committee . ”
The LBJ Presidential tapes , declassified and released in 2001 , prove that LBJ knew the Tonkin incident never happened .
After dressing down his Defence Secretary Robert McNamara for misleading him , Johnson then discussed how to politically spin the non-event and escalate it as justification for air strikes .
“ You just came in a few weeks ago and said they ’re launching an attack on us – they ’re firing at us , ” Johnson tells McNamara in one conversation , “ and we got through with the firing and concluded maybe they had n’t fired at all . ”
The NSA also deliberately faked intelligence data to make it appear as if two US ships had been lost in the “ attack ” .
Johnson used the 1964 false flag event to expand dramatically the scale of the Vietnam War by ushering in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , as well as to rope in much needed domestic support with the Congress and public .
Perhaps if the Foreign Relations Committee had n’t been so afraid of “ the big forces ” controlling America , a large percentage of the almost 60,000 American soldiers and 2 million Vietnamese people would n’t have lost their lives .
Sadly , modern day elected representatives have failed the American people in exactly the same way over the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .

Chinese workers revolt against the unions
17 June 2010
The recent strikes of Chinese workers at Honda plants and other factories over low pay and harsh working conditions have raised important issues for the working class internationally .
From the outset , the strikes have taken the form of an incipient rebellion , not only against management and local authorities , but against the state - controlled All China Federation of Trade Unions ( ACFTU ) , which openly functions as the industrial policeman for the Beijing regime .
The demand by workers for independent organisations or trade unions has prominently featured in many of the disputes .
At the Honda transmission plant in Foshan and Honda Lock in Zhongshan workers elected their own strike representatives to negotiate with management , rejecting attempts by ACFTU officials to intervene as “ mediators ” .
Workers bitterly denounced the ACFTU as the “ running dogs of the capitalists ” and “ traitors ” to the working class .
The eruption of strikes in China could take place in no other way than against the ACFTU apparatus .
The regime formed by the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) in 1949 was not based on genuine socialism but on Stalinism .
It was deeply hostile to the working class from the outset .
On entering the cities , the CCP ’s peasant armies suppressed all independent workers ’ struggles .
The new regime established the ACFTU as a bureaucratic means of control in the workplaces .
The CCP ’s class hostility to workers only intensified after it openly embraced the capitalist market in 1978 .
Terrified by the mass Solidarity strike movement in Poland in the early 1980s , Beijing sought to tighten its grip over the working class .
In 1982 , it removed the nominal right to strike from the constitution and in 1983 established the People ’s Armed Police to suppress domestic unrest .
In 1989 , as workers joined students demonstrating in support of democratic rights , the CCP sent tanks and troops to crush the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square .
Workers were arrested throughout the country .
In the immediate aftermath of the massacre , newly appointed CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin outlined the task of the ACFTU .
“ The biggest concern is workers ’ economic grievances .
If the workers rise up and rebel , we have a big problem .
Trade union organisations must remain alert to any attempt to form [ a Chinese equivalent of ]
Solidarity or similar political group , ” he said .
The Tiananmen Square massacre was a signal to international capital that the CCP would not hesitate to use whatever means were necessary to suppress the working class .
Foreign investment flooded into the country to take advantage of its vast reserves of cheap labour .
In the 1990s , the ACFTU played a key role in containing the numerous protests and strikes that erupted against the wholesale privatisation of state - owned enterprises , which resulted in the lay - off of tens of millions of workers .
Over the past decade , the ACFTU has aggressively expanded into the private sector , acting as an industrial police force for both local and foreign corporations .
Workers around the world confront similar obstacles .
While the AFL - CIO in the United States or the ACTU in Australia may have different origins to those of the Chinese ACFTU , the union bureaucracies in every country have , over the past 30 years , been transformed into apparatuses that work in the closest collaboration with government and corporations in suppressing any independent activity by the working class .
The trade unions have always been defenders of the profit system , seeking to use minor concessions as a means of preventing any wider revolt against the social order .
However , with the rise of globalised production , the watchword of the unions is not the reformist slogan “ a fair day ’s work , for a fair day ’s pay ” , but the never - ending striving for “ international competitiveness ” .
On behalf of employers , unions insist that workers sacrifice their jobs and conditions and produce more to be competitive with workers elsewhere .
Ideologically , the unions are hotbeds of chauvinism and protectionism , utilized to pit workers in one country against their class brothers and sisters elsewhere .
During the recent strikes in China , the AFL - CIO considered asking the Obama administration to investigate whether the suppression of the rights of Chinese workers constituted an “ unfair [ trade ] advantage ” .
In other words , the American unions had not the slightest concern in ending the ruthless exploitation of the Chinese workers — including by major US corporations .
The AFL - CIO ’s only interest in their “ rights ” was whether they could use the issue as a device to protect weaker sections of American capital and to divert attention from their own role in destroying the jobs , pay and conditions of US workers .
Like their class brothers and sisters in China , workers in the US and other countries can only defend their most elementary rights in a rebellion against the unions , which function , essentially , like the Chinese police - state ACFTU .
What is required is a complete break from the trade unions , and from the various middle class ex-radical organisations that keep workers chained to them .
As was done at Honda ’s plants in China , the first step is the election of rank - and - file committees of trusted workers to lead the struggle , and to turn out to other sections of workers facing similar problems .
Only in this way can a powerful independent movement of the working class be constructed to abolish exploitation at its source — the profit system itself .
Such a struggle raises crucial political questions .
In China , there are those who claim to be on the side of workers , who raise the demand for “ independent trade unions ” as an end in itself .
Han Dongfang , former leader of the Beijing Workers Autonomous Federation , who played a prominent role in the 1989 protests , now advocates “ depoliticised ” independent trade unions that are restricted to “ collective bargaining ” with employers .
His China Labour Bulletin published a report in May urging the CCP regime in Beijing to accept such trade unions as a more efficient and cost - effective means of containing the emerging workers ’ struggles .
It is vital that Chinese workers learn from the experiences of workers in other countries .
The AFL - CIO , which had its origins in the mass sit - down strikes of American auto workers in the 1930s , similarly depoliticised the unions as it witchhunted socialists after World War II and subordinated workers to the Democratic Party .
Today these unions operate arm - in- arm with government and the corporate elite .
The United Auto Workers ( UAW ) was directly involved in the Obama administration ’s “ bail - out ” of GM and Chrysler , sitting on the corporate boards as major shareholders , having pushed through agreements to slash wages and conditions .
Closer to home , the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ( KCTU ) emerged in the militant struggles of the South Korean working class in the 1980s against the military dictatorship .
There was no doubting the courage and determination of its leaders as they faced police state repression .
But their political perspective was limited to achieving union rights within the framework of capitalism .
The KCTU was legalised in the 1990s and played a critical role in suppressing opposition to the abolition of the life - long employment system .
Last year , the KCTU collaborated with the rightwing government of President Lee Myung - bak as it sent police to crush the protracted occupation of the Ssangyong Motor plant .
The crucial lesson is that militant struggle by itself is not enough .
As the second stage of the global economic crisis unfolds , workers in every country are confronting , in one form or another , a deepening onslaught on their living standards — often by the same international corporations .
As soon as they begin to fight for their rights , they confront the trade unions , operating as the industrial police for the government and the corporate elite .
It is not a matter of reforming the unions , which are organically incapable of leading any struggle against capitalism , but of organising a conscious revolt against these bureaucratic apparatuses on the basis of a socialist and internationalist perspective .
The only way that workers can defend their jobs , wages , living standards and basic rights is to unite globally in a common struggle to abolish capitalism and to reconstruct society to meet the needs of the overwhelming majority of humanity , rather than the profits of the wealthy few .

Israeli Border Police Demolish Cistern in Al Beqa ’a Valley
Hebron : Israeli border police demolished a rainwater cistern and removed irrigation pipes from several Palestinian fields in Al Beqa ’a Valley just east of Hebron on July 14 , 2010 , the second day of incidents in the area this month .
When international peace activists from Christian Peacemaker Teams arrived in the area at 9:30 am , the large bagger that had been used to break up the concrete of the cistern was just leaving the site .
The driver of a large tractor lifted scoops full of rocks and dumped them into the demolished cistern .
Also , workers cut and disposed of irrigation pipes laid in two fields .
The fields each measured 10 dunams ( approximately 40 acres ) .
One was a field of grape vines and the other field had tomatoes planted under grape vines .
In addition to dismantling the irrigation pipes , the workers also cut the twines that were holding up tomato plants .
At least seven families will be affected by this destruction , in total about 50 people .
A Palestinian friend of CPT who lives in Al Beqa ’a Valley explained the difficulties residents have in accessing water .
A water line has been install by the Palestinian Authority from a nearby village ; however , there is no water in the line .
There is a large aquiver of water in the Hebron region , and Mekorot , the Israeli water company , has a well along the Israeli bypass road Route 60 in Al Beqa ’a Valley which draws from this aquiver ( in Area C , which is under full Israeli military control ) .
Palestinian residents in Al Beqa ’a Valley had made arrangements to purchase water from Mekorot .
However , they never received as much water as they paid for .
With the demolition of several rainwater cisterns in the valley in the past year , the Palestinian residents felt that they had no other option but to tap into the Mekorot water line at the well site .
Palestinians alleged that some of the Israelis that were with the border police and DCO on July 14th were from the Mekorot Company .
Rather than preventing Palestinians from taping into the well at the source , the Israeli authorities destroyed the irrigation pipes in the fields of several families .
Each 200 m roll of irrigation drip pipe costs about 370NIS ( ~100 $US ) , and the connection piping costs about 2.5NIS for each inch .
For each dunam of vegetables it takes about 2 - 3 days to put the irrigation drip piping in place .
The cost of the materials and time that goes into growing produce is high .
Rather than prevent the ‘ theft ’ of water ( which is ironically from an aquiver under Palestine ) earlier in the season , the Israeli authorities instead waited until crops were almost ready for market .
Therefore this destruction is not meant to stop the ‘ theft ’ of water but to cause the highest impact on farmers in the region .
Two Thumbs Down on the Financial - Reform Bill
For those of you still recovering from Gary Becker ‘s take on immigration , you might want to skip his assessment of the financial - reform bill that looks set for passage .
But if you can stomach it , here are a few highlights :
A 2,300 - page bill is usually an indication of many political compromises .
The Dodd - Frank financial - reform bill is no exception , for it is a complex , disorderly , politically motivated , and not - well - thought - out reaction to the financial crisis that erupted beginning with the panic of the fall of 2008 .
Not everything about the bill is bad — e.g. , the requirement that various derivatives trade through exchanges may be a good suggestion — but the disturbing parts of the bill are far more important .
I will concentrate on five major defects , including omissions .
Becker ’s first objection :
The bill adds regulations and rules about many activities that had little or nothing to do with the crisis .
Here ’s an omission he dislikes :
[ T ] he bill essentially says nothing about Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae .
And here , in its trenchant entirety , is his final objection :
Many proposals in the bill will have highly uncertain impacts on the economy .
These include , among many other provisions , the requirement that originators of mortgages and other assets retain at least 5 % of the assets they originate , that many derivatives go on organized exchanges ( may be an improvement but far from certain ) , that hedge funds become more closely regulated , and that consumer be “ protected ” from their financial decisions .
Most of these and other changes in the bill are not based on a serious analysis of what contributed to the financial crisis , but rather are the result of political and emotional reactions to the crisis .
Usually , such reactions do more harm than good .
That is likely to be the fate of the great majority of the provisions of the Dodd - Frank bill .
Someday , if you ’re ever wondering why economists do n’t get elected to high office in this country , think back to this assessment by Becker .
Becker ’s co-blogger Richard Posner does n’t go into as much detail but is on the same page :
Georgia Grad Student Sues University Over Gay Sensitivity Training Jennifer Keeton says she was told to change her beliefs or be kicked out .
July 27 , 2010  -- A Georgia student studying counseling says her university went too far in requiring her to change her Christian beliefs on homosexuality before she 's allowed to graduate .
Backed by the Alliance Defense Fund , Jennifer Keeton has filed suit against Augusta State University after , she said , school officials threatened to dismiss her from its counseling program when she refused to participate in a " remediation " plan to increase her tolerance of gays and lesbians after she made it known that she believed homosexuality was a personal choice .
According to the lawsuit , filed earlier this month in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia , school officials told Keeton that she was failing to conform to professional standards because of her views on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues .
Click here to read Jennifer Keeton 's complaint against August State University .
" Jen has voiced disagreement in several class discussions and in written assignments with the gay and lesbian ' lifestyle , ' " read the university 's remediation plan , as quoted in the lawsuit .
" She stated in one paper that she believes GLBTQ ' lifestyles ' to be identity confusion . "
" Faculty have also received unsolicited reports from another student that [ Miss Keeton ] has relayed her interest in conversion therapy for GLBTQ populations , " the lawsuit 's quotation of the plan continued , " and she has tried to convince other students to support and believe her views . "
The remediation plan , according to court documents , included attending three workshops on diversity , a monthly two - page reflection on what she has learned from research into LGBT counseling issues , and increased exposure to gay populations .
The latter action came with the suggestion that she attend Augusta 's gay pride parade .
A second portion of the remediation plan includes more work to improve Keeton 's writing skills .
David French , senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund and also director of its Center for Academic Freedom , told ABCNews.com that the lawsuit on Keeton 's behalf is one of about a half - dozen similiar cases involving counseling or social work students in the last few years .
" It 's an emerging issue , without question , " he said .
Requiring a student to change his or her beliefs to graduate is " punishment of free speech . "
" That is not the role of the state and it is not within the power of the state , " he said .
Augusta State University declined to make school officials available for comment , and did not immediately provide a statement .
Georgia Graduate Student Believes Homosexuality is a ' Personal Choice '
The Arizona - based Alliance Defense Fund has advised Keeton not to speak publicly about her education at Augusta State or the pending lawsuit , but she stood up for her beliefs in a video produced and distributed by the Fund .
" While I want to stay in the school counseling program , I know that I can't honestly complete the remediation plan knowing that I would have to alter my beliefs , " she said .
" I 'm not willing to and I know I can't change my Biblical views . "
According to the lawsuit , Keeton had said both in class and in writing assignments that " she believes sexual behavior is the result of accountable personal choice . "
" Further , she has expressed her view that homosexuality is a ' lifestyle , ' not a ' state of being , ' " the lawsuit read .
" In certain personal conversations away from the classroom with friends and colleagues , Miss Keeton has shared her Christian faith , and commended its virtues and benefits , " the lawsuit said .
" In the course of such discussions , she has also communicated Christian viewpoints on matters related to sexual ethics . "
According to the lawsuit , which included several e-mails between Keeton and faculty , school officials said that they were n't trying to change her views or religious beliefs , but that it was " unethical " for her to apply her own personal viewpoints to other people " and not truly accepting that others can have different beliefs and values that are equally valid as your own . "
W. Mark Hamilton , executive director of the American Mental Health Counselors Association , said he could n't speak to the specific lawsuit against Augusta State University , but that 's it 's not unreasonable that a student be requested to take additional diversity training .
While the AMCA has not officially taken a stance on LGBT issues -- " We have members on both sides of the issue , " Hamilton explained -- they do expect their members to try to work with clients regardless of their sexual orientation .
" Most certainly our members would take a positive understanding position , " he said .
" I do n't think that most members or counselors would reject this client out of hand because of their beliefs .
Of course there 's always that option to terminate their relationship . "
But French said the decision to require a remediation plan came before school officials ever saw Keeton interact with a client .
" There no evidence she 's mistreated anybody , " he said .
" It is not part of the program to single out a Christian woman because of her religious beliefs . "
Swans are preparing to release My Father Will Guide Me Up A Rope To The Sky , their first original studio album in 14 years .
It ’s the long - awaited follow - up to the post - punk legends ’ expansive 1996 double - CD set Soundtracks For The Blind , which was billed at the time as Swans ’ final album .
A collection of live recordings bearing the name Swans Is Dead was issued soon after , and frontman Michael Gira formed a new group , Angels of Light – just two factors that appeared to put the band ’s demise beyond doubt .
Then , in 2009 , Gira began to drop hints that Swans as an entity was still extant , eventually posting a message on the band ’s website that simply read , “ SWANS ARE NOT DEAD ” .
It came as no surprise when , earlier this year , a Swans live tour – including a headline slot at Birmingham ’s Supersonic festival – was announced , along with the declaration that a brand new album was imminent .
Some details of the album have now emerged .
It ’s due out on September 10 , via Gira ’s own Young God imprint , and features guest appearances from Devendra Banhart , Mercury Rev ’s Grasshopper and Bill Rieflin .
It was recorded by Jason Le Farge at Seizure ’s Palace in Brooklyn , and Gira is currently mixing the record with Bryce Goggin at Trout Recordings .
The full tracklist has yet to be revealed , but confirmed titles are ‘ No Words / No Thoughts ’ , ‘ Reeling The Liars In ’ and ‘ Jim ’ .
You can listen to a demo of ‘ No Words / No Thoughts ’ over at Swans ’ myspace .
The band , led by the inscrutable , reliably confrontational Michael Gira were born out of New York ’s 1980s no wave explosion .
They ’ve explored a wide range of sonic and aesthetic territories over the years , from brutal noise and quasi-metal to industrial ambient , minimalist pop and heart - rending acoustic balladry .
“ One thing I want to point out right now : THIS IS NOT A REUNION , ” said Gira earlier this year .
“ It ’s not some dumb - ass nostalgia act .
It is not repeating the past .
I certainly never thought this day would arrive , but it ’s inevitable , it ’s here , it ’s fate , so I ’m succumbing to it . ”
A detail from the album ’s cover art , by Beatrice Pediconi , is pictured above .
The band ’s UK tour dates are as follows :
21 - Oct Cork Cyprus Avenue
22 - Oct Dublin Button Factory
24 - Oct Birmingham Supersonic Festival
25 - Oct Glasgow Arches
27 - Oct Brighton Concorde 2
28 - Oct London Koko Theatre

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Major League Baseball will consider expanding the use of instant replay after a botched call by an umpire cost a Detroit Tigers pitcher a perfect game , Commissioner Bud Selig said Thursday .

A baserunner was incorrectly ruled safe by umpire Jim Joyce with two outs in the ninth inning when the correct call would have given Armando Galarraga MLB ’s 21st perfect game .
“ As Jim Joyce said in his postgame comments , there is no dispute that last night ’s game should have ended differently , ” Selig said in a statement .
“ While the human element has always been an integral part of baseball , it is vital that mistakes on the field be addressed .
“ Given last night ’s call and other recent events , I will examine our umpiring system , the expanded use of instant replay and all other related features . ”
Selig has long opposed wide use of replays and only two seasons ago approved replays on questionable home runs .
The commissioner gave no timetable for a decision , but indicated it could take some time .
“ Before I announce any decisions , I will consult with all appropriate parties , including our two unions and the Special Committee for On - Field Matters , which consists of field managers , general managers , club owners and presidents , ” he said .
Selig praised all parties involved in the controversial end of Wednesday ’s game , including the umpire , who was clearly upset after seeing on replay that he had botched the call .
“ On behalf of Major League Baseball , I congratulate Armando Galarraga on a remarkable pitching performance , ” Selig said .
“ All of us who love the game appreciate the historic nature of his effort last night .
“ The dignity and class of the entire Detroit Tigers organization under such circumstances were truly admirable and embodied good sportsmanship of the highest order .
“ Armando and Detroit manager Jim Leyland are to be commended for their handling of a very difficult situation .
I also applaud the courage of umpire Jim Joyce to address this unfortunate situation honestly and directly . ”
After fending off most challenges to its independence and winning new powers to oversee big financial firms , the Federal Reserve has emerged from a bruising debate on the overhaul of U.S. financial rules as perhaps the pre-eminent regulator in the sector .
But that could only bring it added blame if things go wrong again .
Just a few months ago , amid populist anger at the Fed for failing to prevent the financial crisis of 2008 and bailing out Wall Street , Congress was talking of stripping the central bank of its supervisory oversight of banks or forcing it to submit to congressional audit of its interest - rate decisions .
Instead , the new law gives the Fed more power and a better tool box to help prevent financial crises .
It will become the primary regulator for large , complex financial firms of all kinds , such as American International Group , the insurer which built a massive derivatives portfolio that regulators did n't see until it was too late .
This is n't the first time Congress has expanded the Fed 's role .
After the Great Depression , it passed the Employment Act in 1946 , charging the Fed with averting the huge unemployment seen in the 1930s .
After the double - digit inflation of the 1970s , the Fed was formally given a dual mandate of promoting both price stability and maximum sustainable employment .
In the wake of the latest financial crisis , the Fed is effectively being told to add the maintenance of financial stability to its responsibilities .
The risks , however , are that the Fed still wo n't be able to prevent another crisis , and that it will be an even clearer target for blame if that occurs .
" The bill has good intentions , but I 'm worried about its implementation .
If I were the Fed , I 'd be seriously worried about being left holding the bag , " said Anil Kashyap , a professor at the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business .

If you 're Spanish , you 've probably spent the last 24 hours raising a few glasses of rioja to toast your team 's World Cup win .
And if you 're Dutch , you 've probably been drowning your sorrows in Grolschs and Heinekens .
Fans of the two teams awoke to drastically different realities today , but when you think about it , they did n't really have that much in common to start with .
As the two fantastic maps below show ( h/t Strange Maps ) , the Spanish love wine while the Dutch prefer beer .
Spain is Romantic , Catholic , mountainous , and mostly arid , while the Netherlands is Germanic , Protestant , flat , and soggy .
The Spanish founded breezy San Juan ; the Dutch built orderly Grand Rapids .
Their divergent characters were even apparent on the pitch yesterday when Spain 's crisp and creative style outlasted Holland 's solid and physical play .
While the Spanish may be in good spirits today , at least the Dutch can take solace in the fact that their economy is buzzing along at 4.3 percent unemployment while the Spanish rate is a staggering 19.9 percent .

Very Dutch ) .

Professor Phil Jones , the pivotal figure in the ' Climategate ' affair , is to assume the newly created post of director of research in the Climatic Research Unit , following his exoneration by the Russell review , the University of East Anglia said today .
Jones stood down from his role as director of the university 's Climatic Research Unit in November 2009 after an inquiry was announced into questions raised by the hacking and publication online of 13 years of emails between the professor and his colleagues .
" This [ new role ] will provide him with the opportunity to continue the world - leading research which has made CRU a household name , " said Professor Edward Acton , the University of East Anglia 's vice - chancellor .
Acton said that Jones 's new role would allow him to continue his climate research while others shouldered more of the administrative burden , including responding to Freedom of Information requests .
The Russell review was highly critical of UEA 's response to such requests .
Jones said in February that he had received death threats and had considered suicide " several times " following the intense scrutiny of his professional conduct when the emails surfaced online .
He added that he had lost a stone in weight and had been taking beta - blockers and sleeping pills .
" People said I should go and kill myself .
They said that they knew where I lived .
They were coming from all over the world , " he said .
But he said he had been encouraged by the love of his five - year - old granddaughter .
" I wanted to see her grow up . "
In March , he testified before the parliamentary science and technology select committee , and appeared gaunt and strained when facing cross-examination by MPs .
Reacting today to the Russell review and his reinstatement at the CRU , he said : " I am , of course , extremely relieved that this review has now been completed .
We have maintained all along that our science is honest and sound and this has been vindicated now by three different independent external bodies .
There are lessons to be learned from this affair and I need time to reflect on them before speaking in public , particularly given the scope of this report .
" Meanwhile , I would like to thank those who have supported me over this period and now I would like to concentrate on my new role as director of research in the CRU , which will allow me to focus my full attention on the science of climate change . "
The PlayPump : What Went Wrong ?
by Daniel Stellar | July 1 , 2010
Earlier this week , PBS ’s Frontline ran a story about the PlayPump , a technology that was supposed to bring drinking water to thousands of African communities by harnessing the power of children at play .
The title of the Frontline story , “ Troubled Water , ” indicates that all did n’t go as planned with the PlayPump .
As Frontline reports , dozens of PlayPumps in Mozambique sit idle , and in many villages , PlayPumps have been removed and hand pumps reinstalled .
The idea behind PlayPump is simple , and it ’s not hard to see why so many people got excited about it .
A merry - go - round type device is installed and connected to a water pump .
As children play on the merry - go - round , water is pumped into a storage tank , and is then available on demand .
Frontline originally reported on the technology in 2005 , leading to a tremendous amount of excitement , including support from Laura Bush and AOL founder Steve Case .
As the new Frontline story reports , however , it seems that PlayPump has n’t lived up to its original promise and even its strongest backers have had to admit that the large - scale roll - out they had originally planned was not realistic .
So , what went wrong ?
There are many ways to answer this question , some relating to the appropriate role of development agencies and philanthropic foundations .
Another thorny question , particular to PlayPump , is whether children playing is an appropriate source of energy for water .
As reporter Amy Costello says , the line between work and play is n’t as clear - cut as one would think .
In addition , though , I would contend that in many cases , the problem with PlayPump is that it was addressing the wrong problem .
PlayPump can only work in very specific types of situations : when there are large supplies of high - quality groundwater , close to the surface , and when present infrastructure is insufficient .
As we often argue at the Columbia Water Center , many times the root problem is due to actual water scarcity — not having enough supply to meet demand .
In these cases , a PlayPump will not be helpful , and indeed at least some appear to have run dry .
Similarly , if water is available but of poor quality , a PlayPump alone is not a viable solution .
Finally , for PlayPump to work , it must be in a setting where the supply it produces can meet the demand .
If demand is too great for its relatively modest capacity , there is the real threat of exploitation of children : to force them to keep “ playing ” in order to pump and meet demand .
The failure of PlayPump points to a huge problem in meeting water challenges — simply put , there is no panacea .
Water problems are very complex and come in a multitude of flavors .
In some very specific situations , PlayPump may be the right type of solution .
In most situations , though , it is imperative to first really understand the problem and to then design appropriate , tailored solutions .
It ’s also necessary to focus on the big picture , with an emphasis on water supply .
If sufficient supply is n’t available to start with , no amount of pumping , no matter how playful it may be , will help .
One impressive aspect of the PlayPump story is the dedication by some of its early proponents , including the Case Foundation and Save the Children , to learn from the experience .
We ’ll only be able to solve water challenges through innovation , and with that comes the risk of failure .
While in many ways PlayPump did n’t live up to its original promise , it would be a mistake to be overly critical of the project or its funders .
They tried something new , innovative and bold , and learned from the experience .
We can continue to learn from it , but let ’s also focus on what we do next .

Effing Complex
When it comes down to it , it is incredibly hard to imagine a more complex problem , with more systems - of - systems challenges and interactions and complexities with so many interlocking implications ( almost all negative ) ...
linkages of fossil fuel pollution to health problems ( from reduced IQs to asthma to cancers to ... ) , damage to infrastructure ( acid rain ) , security challenges and , oh by the way , global warming
acidification of the oceans due to absorption of CO2 and unknown impacts on life in the ocean ( including plankton & production of oxygen ) , future absorption of Co2 , etc ...
shifting weather patterns , including more precipitation occurring in severe weather events ...
that Global Warming , at least in near term , can actually lead to significantly more snowfall in some areas ( more moisture , more rain , and well , winter does n't disappear .
28 degrees F will see snow ... but so will 30 .
Etc ...
Of course , that list and discussion is almost endless -- endless because we are learning more , with essentially each passing day , about linkages and interactions of the impacts of our using the atmosphere as a trash pit on the climate , on ecosystems , on ourselves ...
[ NOTE : That climate change is such a complex subject -- as is the ( highly ) related domain of energy -- has one ' fun ' element for people who relish learning and systems - of - systems challenges .
If someone claims to know everything about these domains , do n't listen to them .
And , if you are n't learning something new virtually every day , well , you 're not really trying . ]
Effing Complex fosters Effing Easy ( 1 )
Sadly , this complexity makes it far too easy for serial deniers ( the Breitbarts of the climate world ) to confuse the situation ... in a culture that is addicted to America 's Got Talent or Bachelorette in Hawaii or UFC with a disdain for science , it is far too easy to confuse the situation especially when you have the interlocking of ideological , religious , and fiscal interests determined to wear blinders about what humanity is doing to the planet .
It is too Effing Easy to confuse the American ( and , well , other publics ) with deception , deceit , truthiness , and outright falsehoods ... especially when too many in the traditional media are accomplices through a devotion to " Faux and Balanced " journalism rather than truthful and honest reporting .
Looking past the Effing Hard to the Truly Effing Easy
The effing complexity of global warming is hard to exaggerate .
That it is effing easy to confuse people about the issues adds to the complexity .
And , these combine to foster massive effing frustration because , at the core , the solution ( the problem reducing policy paths ) is so clear cut and simple ... Truly Effing Easy !
It is simply the Three Rs :
Reduce ...
Reduce demand / use of nonrenewable things from fuels to minerals to ...
This includes greater efficiency ( getting the same thing for fewer inputs ) along with conservation ( determining to use / demandless ) .
They combine to lower our demand for energy , for production , for pollution .
( And , longer term but needing to be part of policy today , any sustainable path for humanity either includes massive ( MASSIVE ) reductions in individual demand or fewer people on the planet . )
Renew : Renewable energy and renew things ( reuse ) .
Remediate : recycle to enable reuse of core materials , plant Trees , make up for unavoidable use of polluting resources , etc ...
Now , was that really so hard ?
Or , is it Effing Easy ?
==============================================================
NOTES :
3 Rs are true for individuals , families , communities , businesses , governments , nations , global society ... it works , at all levels , in all societies ...
We are at an inflection point where every second of inaction pushes us closer to utter catastrophe and raises the near - term costs of action .
The situation 's urgency is too easy to understate .
In a dramatic display of the power feed - in tariffs have in driving markets , Italy installed more solar photovoltaics ( PV ) in 2009 than the entire U.S. Moreover , within the first quarter of 2010 , Italy ’s total installed solar PV capacity was expected to exceed that of the US .
Italy installed 720 megawatts ( MW ) of solar PV in 2009 , nearly all of that on rooftops .
In contrast , the U.S. installed 435 MW during the same period , according to a draft report by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council ( IREC ) .
Italy introduced a system of feed - in tariffs for solar PV in February , 2007 after concluding that the previous program of Tradable Green Certificates was not delivering the results desired .
By the end of 2007 , Italy had installed five times more solar PV than in the previous year .
Despite numerous bureaucratic roadblocks , the solar industry took off in 2008 and installed nearly 350 MW , then a record - breaking number .
Solar PV installations have been doubling since then and are expected to reach 1,500 MW in 2010 .
Italy is three - fourths the size of California , with which it is often compared because of their similarly - sized economies .
Italy has a population of 60 million , to California ’s 40 million .
The population of the U.S. is five times that of Italy .
Italy is now the world ’s second largest annual market for solar PV , after Germany .
IREC estimates that there was 1,250 MW of total installed solar PV capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2009 .
Currently , the U.S. is installing 40 - 50 MW per month , and Italy 125 MW per month .
At this pace , Italy surpassed the U.S. in total installed PV capacity before the end of the first quarter , likely by the end of February 2010 .
Italy is installing more capacity – 250 MW–every two months than California is installing per year .
By the end of 2010 , Italy will have a total installed capacity of more than 2,500 MW .
This is two and one - half times more capacity than is expected in California , and one and one - half times more than is expected in the U.S .
Italy ’s 2007 decree also set a solar PV target of 1,200 MW .
They reached their target earlier this year .
Unlike Spain , the government has no plans to cut the program dramatically .
The proposed revision to the feed - in tariff program ( conto energia ) , currently waiting approval , reduces the tariffs and sets a new target of 3,000 MW for the three - year period from 2011 to 2013 .
The revisions are expected to be approved sometime this summer .
The proposal cuts the tariffs 18 % in three equal steps of 6 % during each of the first three quarters in 2011 .
According to Gruppo Imprese Fotovoltaiche Italiane ( GIFI ) , 93 % of all solar PV in Italy is installed on rooftops in distributed applications .
Data from Gestore dei Servizi Energetici indicates that about one - fourth of all Italian solar PV installations are less than 20 kilowatts ( kW ) in size , or about 300 MW .
< 3 kW : 6 %
> 3 kW < 20 kW : 21 %
> 20 kW < 200 kW : 23 %
> 200 kW < 1,000 kW : 36 %
> 1,000 kW : 14 %
Paul Gipe has written extensively about renewable energy for both the popular and trade press .
He has also lectured widely on wind energy and how to minimize its impact on the environment and the communities of which it is a part .
BP is being accused by a US congressional committee of ignoring warnings , violating its own industry guidelines , and choosing risky procedures in the hope of cutting costs and saving time in the days leading up to the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was served notice on Monday by the committee on energy and commerce that it intends to subject him to the most rigorous inquisition the company has yet faced in the 56 - day - old crisis .
A letter from the committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , said " time after time , it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense " .
Hayward 's hearing will take place on Thursday , towards the end of a crucial week in which the tensions between US politicians and BP are likely to escalate .
Barack Obama will tonight make his first address to the American people from the Oval Office , underlining the scale of the catastrophe now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and vowing to hold BP to account for the environmental damage wrought by its eight - week - old oil spill .
Obama is expected to use the speech to outline plans to force the firm to set up an independently monitored multibillion - dollar fund to compensate victims of the spill .
He will also lay out a detailed timeline of how the worst of the calamity could be contained .
Hours before the broadcast , the energy and environment sub-committee of the House of Representatives will call senior BP officials in front of it to answer questions on the company 's handling of the crisis .
Then tomorrow , Obama will hold his first meeting with a team of top BP staff led by the chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , and expected to include Hayward who has so far avoided a face - to - face encounter with the president .
But it will be the forensic questioning of Hayward in front of Thursday 's committee on energy and commerce upon which BP 's fate now potentially hangs .
Waxman 's advance letter runs to 14 pages and contains damaging allegations gathered during previous hearings .
Five days before the 20 April explosion , the letter contends , BP was warned by its own drilling engineer that this was a " nightmare well " .
Yet the firm went on to make five crucial decisions that the committee alleges put profit before safety .
BP , at this point , was up against the clock , attempting to complete drilling so that the Deepwater Horizon rig could be moved to another location , avoiding overrun costs .
The five accusations levelled at BP by the committee are :
• That it adopted a cheap design for the well , choosing a single casing rather than a more sophisticated design , despite the fact that its own analysis found strongly in favour of the latter .
" The decision appears to have been made to save time and reduce costs , " the letter says .
• BP went with the cheapest option of using just six " centralisers " , which hold the casing in the centre of the borehole , despite being advised by its contractors Halliburton to use 21 .
Halliburton warned that the well had a " SEVERE gas flow problem " and that using six centralisers would risk the success of the procedure .
• BP decided not to carry out an acoustic test designed to measure the efficacy of the cementing of the well to block off gas flows .
The test would have cost $ 128,000 and taken an extra 12 hours .
An independent engineer who gave evidence to the committee said it was " unheard of " not to perform the test and slammed the decision as being " horribly negligent " .
• BP failed to check the proper workings of the new well system by circulating drilling mud from its bottom to the surface .
Halliburton suggested the lack of a full test was due to BP 's desire for speed .
• The firm did not install a critical piece of equipment that locks the wellhead and the casing at the level of the sea floor .
The absence of the " lockdown sleeve " has been identified as one possible cause of the explosion .
Waxman 's letter concludes that BP must answer to the committee for possible " carelessness and complacency " that " inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants and the workers on the rig .
The new offensive by Congress came as Obama began a two - day visit to the stricken region .
After he had landed in Gulfport , Mississippi , he likened the environmental impact of the Deep Horizon explosion to the impact on the national psyche of 9/11 .
In an interview with the website Politico , he said : " In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come . "
The comparison drew some angry responses from families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
BP has now passed a 72 - hour ultimatum set for it by the Obama administration to come up with a more focused plan for how to bring the spill under control .
Worst - case scenarios , estimated by US government scientists , suggest that up to 40,000 barrels of oil could be spewing out into the Gulf each day , with only 15,000 barrels currently being collected by a cap placed over the wrecked well .
The company has outlined a series of methods it intends to implement that it claims will see the amount of captured oil rise to up to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July .
The 'ass kickers '
Henry Waxman
The Democrat congressman is famous for in 1994 forcing chiefs of tobacco giants to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive .
He will seek the same killer punch against Tony Hayward on Thursday , when BP 's CEO appears before a panel of the House energy and commerce committee .
Expect him to press Hayward hard on whether BP put profit before safety .
Ed Markey
With a long track record of holding power to account – from the nuclear electricity industry to the US government over torture – Markey has become a leading critic of BP 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon crisis .
" They are either incompetent or they are lying , " he has said of BP chiefs .
Today the Democratic congressman will call BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , as well as the bosses of rival oil companies in front of his House energy and environment sub-committee .
Likely line of questioning : why BP 's estimates of the size of the spill have been so massively wide of the mark .
Robert Gibbs
Barack Obama 's press spokesman , who has been " kicking ass " on the president 's behalf , has been accused of whipping up anti-British feeling by referring to British Petroleum rather than BP , the firm 's rebranded name .
He has also used such fruity language as : " We will keep our boot on the throat of BP " .
Gibbs says the administration is just focused on what 's right .
Thad Allen
The US coastguard admiral who Obama put in charge of the clean - up operation last week issued BP with a 72 - hour ultimatum to come up with solid plans on how to contain the leak .
Allen has been careful in his criticisms of BP until now , saying it has generally been co-operative .
But daily media exposure of Allen , in which he has come across as energetic and action - oriented , has only served to make BP look all the more incompetent .
IGO , Calif . —Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko , his budget under pressure in a weak economy , has laid off staff , reduced patrols and even released jail inmates .
But there 's one mission on which he 's spending more than in recent years : pot busts .
The reason is simple :
If he steps up his pursuit ...
Dogfight !
Bird fight ?
Whatever it is , this clip imparts three important lessons : 1 . Respect birds ' space .
2 . Always put a camera on your RC plane .
3 . Our pale blue dot planet might just be some cosmic raven 's terrifying eyeball .

Space boffins believe they may be on the verge of discovering a vast , hidden network of tunnels beneath the surface of the Moon .
Collapsed pit-crater shaft leading down to a sub-selenean tunnel ?
The tunnels are n't thought to be the work of long - extinct ( or perhaps still surviving ) intelligent moon aliens , perhaps driven to adopt a subterranean existence by a notional disappearing atmosphere aeons ago .
Nor is any involvement by Tibetans , Elvis or others seeking a secluded dwelling far from prying human eyes suspected .
Instead , top moonologists think that they may be on the track of " lava tubes " not dissimilar to those of Earth .
A lava tube , unsurprisingly , is a tube in solid surrounding rock along which at some point liquid lava has flowed ( or is still flowing , in some Earthly cases ) .
View down into an Earthly lava tube .
When the lava cools and solidifies , there is often an open space left above its surface , forming a tunnel .
In some cases , parts of the roof of such a tunnel will collapse , forming a so - called " pit crater " .
If the pit crater forms while the lava is still flowing , it will have a smooth bottom .
If the collapse happens once the lava has hardened , the bottom of the pit crater will be home to a pile of rubble .
Scientists analysing results from our old friend the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , placed into a very low Moon orbit by NASA so as to map our satellite in great detail , believe they may have found such pit craters - so pointing the way to sub terranean selenean lava - tube tunnels .
" To date , we have about ten candidate pits awaiting confirmation , " report boffins at the LRO Camera team .
" Do these pits provide access to open lava tubes ? " they ask .
That 's a question which the LRO scientists will attempt to answer by snapping pics from the LRO at such angles - and with the Sun at such a position in the sky above - that they could spot overhangs indicating whether or not the possible lava - tube tunnels are still " open and accessible " .
President Obama has lately stated that there will be no manned return to the Moon , as had formerly been planned ( indeed without the Moon - return plans it is unlikely that NASA would have bothered to send up the LRO ) .
However there are less ambitious plans for robotic visits to Earth 's satellite - some of them even , perhaps , featuring a tunnelling mole - cruiser subselenean probecraft .
Humanity may yet one day gaze upon the mysteries lying hidden in the Moon 's unseen , cavernous tunnel complexes - if only by proxy . ®
Imagine if your brain lost its working memory -- the ability to hold and manipulate information in your mind 's eye .
That 's the plight faced by millions of people with neurofibromatosis type 1 , or NF1 .
The genetic condition affects one in 3,500 people and is the most common cause of learning disabilities .
Now a UCLA research team has uncovered new clues about how NF1 disrupts working memory .
Published in the July 12 online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the findings suggest a potential drug target for correcting NF1 - related learning disabilities .
NF1 is caused by mutations in a gene called neurofibromin , or Nf1 , which makes a protein with the same name .
Previous mouse studies led by principal investigator Dr. Alcino Silva , a professor of neurobiology and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , showed that the Nf1 protein is essential for controlling the release of a neurotransmitter called GABA , which regulates brain cell activity .
Mutated versions of the protein cause too much GABA to be released , dramatically altering communication between brain cells .
In the current study , Silva and colleagues found that mice carrying Nf1 mutations showed higher levels of GABA in the brain region that regulates working memory .
The findings imply that excess GABA hinders the activity of neurons in the brain , thus interfering with working memory .
" We focused on a region of the prefrontal cortex that is critical for working memory in mice and compared it to its equivalent region in humans , " said study co-author Carrie Bearden , an associate professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA .
" When NF1 patients performed tasks that required working memory , they displayed reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex .
The results were very similar to what we discovered in our mouse model . "
The team asked NF1 patients to perform a series of memory tasks while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan that measured blood and oxygen flow to various areas of the brain .
More blood and oxygen flow indicates greater brain activity .
Compared to healthy volunteers , the NF1 patients showed less activity in the part of the prefrontal cortex that controls working memory .
" The NF1 patients ' brain cells did n't fully activate in the prefrontal cortex , as in healthy people , " Bearden said .
" Patients ' brain activity levels also predicted their success rate in the experiment .
The less activity we saw in this brain region , the worse they performed on the tasks . "
" Our research implies that the increased release of GABA interferes with working memory in NF1 , " said the study 's first author , Carrie Shilyansky , a graduate researcher in neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
The UCLA findings suggest that learning disabilities caused by Nf1 mutations could potentially be corrected with a drug that normalizes the excess GABA 's effect on brain cells .
The authors are currently studying the effect of the drug lovastatin on learning and health issues in NF1 patients .
The study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health , the Children 's Tumor Foundation , Neurofibromatosis Inc. and the U.S. Army .

Urgent action needed ... APNIC 's chief scientist Geoff Huston .
Internet experts derived a solution to the problem several years ago , which involves moving to a new protocol , IPv6 , that provides trillions of addresses for every person on the planet .
But most of the internet industry - including ISPs and websites - have been reluctant to make the necessary investments to move to IPv6 .
The issue has been compared to Sydney running out of phone numbers when using a seven - digit system , which was solved by adding a 9 to the front of all numbers .
But with the internet the solution is much more complex than that , as all devices that connect to the net will need to be reconfigured or upgraded .
Geoff Huston , chief scientist at APNIC , which allocates IP addresses for the Asia - Pacific region , has been trying to raise awareness of the problem for 10 years .
He says the rise of smartphones , PCs and internet - connected appliances means the address pool will run dry within a year , decades quicker than even he predicted .
Huston said one of the biggest impediments to solving the problem was the sheer scale - all devices on IP v4 will need to be upgraded to support IP v6 , as the two versions are n't backwards compatible .
Consumers will need to upgrade the software on their computers and networking equipment and , in some cases , buy completely new hardware .
" This is almost like a lot of the other challenges we face in society like climate change ... if everyone does something , the right thing will happen , but if one individual does the right thing , it does n't make a difference , " said Huston .
" Your ISP needs to do a lot of work , and if you 're not willing to pay more money to your ISP , your poor old ISP has got to spend [ extra ] money without [ extra ] income . "
Huston said that , once the available internet addresses ran out , a kind of black market for IP addresses would be created where " those services that have the highest capacity to pay will still be able to get more addresses , but those who ca n't get denied " .
Upfront costs of moving to the new protocol will be high but Huston said delays would push costs even higher .
As a stop - gap measure , Huston said ISPs would begin forcing multiple customers and devices to share single internet addresses , which would lead to common web applications ceasing to work .
Huston pointed to web applications such as Gmail , Google Maps and iTunes as examples of those that would break .
" Over the years unless we embark on IPv6 then the internet will get slowly more and more strangled and applications will work in stranger ways , " Huston said .
James Spenceley , chief executive at wholesale ISP Vocus , gave another example of an application that might cease to work under a shared IP address system : internet telephony .
" A VoIP phone needs to have a certain port number , so across 20 customers only one of them will work , " he said .
" An internet service that resembles the service today might become a premium service , where you do have a unique IP address , [ but ] you might pay more . "
Fortunately , some vendors have taken steps to support the move to IPv6 .
The Windows and Mac operating systems both support the new protocol , as do some smartphones such as the iPhone .
Australian ISP
Internode is the first to offer IP v6 as a commercial service .
Providers of popular web services such as Google and Facebook are also making good progress in adopting IPv6 .
Google 's chief internet evangelist and one of the founding fathers of the internet , Vint Cerf , appeared in an online video in June urging ISPs to do more to transition to IPv6 .
Loading " Moving from IP v4 to IPv6 is a little like changing the roads and tyres while continuing to drive along in your car , " said Lindsay from Internode .
" It 's been expensive , it 's been time - consuming and it does n't produce an immediate return on investment so it's the kind of thing that is n't popular with CFOs .
However , it 's laying an important foundation for what happens over the next few years as it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain IP v4 addresses . "
Today , a judge put off a decision on whether to bar Los Angeles from enforcing its new medical marijuana ordinance against four collectives , leaving the scores of dispensaries that have filed suit in limbo more than three weeks after the law became effective .
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Mohr said that he believed the city ’s ordinance was imperfect , but also said he was not certain the defects violated the rights of collectives forced to shut down by June 7 , when the law went into effect .
“ It looks to me as if this statute ’s got some shortcomings , ” he said .
But Mohr appeared to tilt slightly toward the city ’s argument , saying the City Council ’s efforts to regain control over public safety issue — the explosive increase in the number of dispensaries — may be valid even if flawed .
“ The city is very clearly trying to get control of the situation , ” he said .
A decision to grant preliminary injunctions could bring a halt to the city ’s efforts to close about 400 dispensaries and might force the City Council to revise the law .
Although the injunctions would apply to four dispensaries , scores more would probably seek similar orders .
The stores seeking the injunction are Green Horizon Collective in Chatsworth , 420 Caregivers in Hollywood , 420 Collective in Mar Vista and Organic Healing Center in Eagle Rock .
David Welch , who represents 44 dispensaries in two lawsuits , said the impact of the delay was huge .
He has advised his clients to keep their dispensaries closed until there is a decision .
“ We ’re going to fight until it ’s done , ” he told about 30 dispensary operators in the hall after the hearing .
Several declined to give their names when asked to comment , fearful of retribution from the city and cognizant of Welch ’s advice to be careful when talking to the media .
“ The doors are closed , but the meter is running , ” said one operator who is still paying rent and hoping to reopen .
William W. Carter , the chief deputy city attorney , argued that Los Angeles had a rational basis for limiting the number of dispensaries , noting that they have drawn armed robbers and created nuisances in some neighborhoods .
“ The ordinance is attempting to restrict or minimize the number of targets , ” he said .
After hours of questioning , Mohr concluded the pivotal issue is whether the City Council can restrict the dispensaries to those that registered with the city in 2007 .
Welch argued that the provision violates the due process and equal protection rights of collectives that did not register because it was based on an expired moratorium .
Under a moratorium on new outlets that became effective Sept. 14 , 2007 , all existing dispensaries were required to register by Nov. 13 , 2007 .
But a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge said in an earlier decision that the council failed to follow proper procedures when it extended the ban beyond 45 days , making it invalid at the time of the registration deadline .
Mohr appeared to agree .
“ I will tell you it ’s an imperfect basis , ” he said to Carter .
“ But it ’s still a rational basis , ” Carter responded .
“ It ’s based on the lay of the land at a certain date . ”
The city ’s attorneys argued that if the council had made a mistake , it was simply procedural , could have been easily remedied and should not invalidate the ordinance .
Mohr asked both sides to submit additional briefs by July 23 , and he will rule after that .
The judge also rejected several other arguments the dispensaries made against the ordinance .
He said it did not matter that they may not have known about the requirement to register .
“ Ignorance of the law is no excuse .
That ’s fundamental , ” he said .
And he said that the city ’s decision to give business tax certificates to dispensaries did not confer a vested property right .
“ I ’m very much on the city ’s side on that , ” he said .
Five no-hitters , two perfect games and another gem that was spoiled by an umpire .
By now , San Francisco Giants broadcaster Mike Krukow and others around baseball are beginning to expect a piece of pitching history every week .
" I do .
I ca n't explain it , " said Krukow , who pitched in the majors from 1976 - 89 .
" Amazing .
I think it 's pretty cool .
The Year of the Pitcher . "
Monday night in a 5 - 0 victory over the Detroit Tigers , becoming the fifth big leaguer to turn the trick during a season of mastery on the mound .
The last time there were five no-hitters in one year was 1991 , when Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan threw one of seven in the majors .
Now , arms are in charge again — so much so that no -hit alerts seem commonplace .
Ho hum , another shutout .
Complete game ?
Yawn .
" Pitching has gotten better , " Rays manager Joe Maddon said .
" I do n't know that the hitting has gone back a bit , but the pitching has definitely gotten better . "
The numbers back him up .
Fourteen times a pitcher has carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning this year .
That 's the most through July 26 since at least 1974 , as far back as such records go at STATS LLC .
As a comparison , it happened six times by that date last season .
" I do n't know if there are any explanations for it , " Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said .
" It runs in cycles and you just go through it . "
CC Sabathia got it started with a near no - no at Tampa Bay on April 10 , and the list of close calls features youngsters from Ricky Romero and Travis Wood to established stars such as John Lackey and Daisuke Matsuzaka .
Of course , several finished the job .
Oakland left - hander Dallas Braden retired all 27 batters against Tampa Bay on May 9 and Philadelphia ace Roy Halladay duplicated the feat 20 days later at Florida , making this the only season besides 1880 to include a pair of perfect games .
Arizona 's Edwin Jackson and Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez also threw no-hitters — not to mention the perfect game Detroit right - hander Armando Galarraga was denied because of a missed call at first base by umpire Jim Joyce .
" It 's pretty unbelievable .
I do n't know .
It 's not an easy thing to do , " said Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz , who tossed a no-hitter in his second major league start on Sept. 1 , 2007 .
" I do n't remember ever hearing about it happening like this .
Maybe guys are preparing a little bit better and sticking to their game plan throughout the game .
It takes a lot of luck to do it .
That 's one of the key things .
You 've got to have a couple of good plays in the field . "
Ted Lilly of the Chicago Cubs and Gavin Floyd of the crosstown White Sox even had dueling no-hitters going into the bottom of the seventh inning at Wrigley Field on June 13 .
Tampa Bay has been involved in three no-hitters this season , shut down by Braden and Jackson before Garza 's gem Monday on a night when the Rays did n't manage a hit themselves until Matt Joyce 's sixth - inning grand slam off Tigers starter Max Scherzer .
" Pitching is starting to take over the game and that 's good , " Florida right - hander Ricky Nolasco said .
" That 's the way it should be . "
That figures , coming from a pitcher .
But there are several reasons why baseball 's balance of power has swung to the guys on the mound .
Among them :
— Testing for steroids and amphetamines .
— An increased emphasis on defense .
— The sport - wide spread of bat - breaking cut fastballs .
— Advances in medicine that help revive injured arms .
— Better teaching and competition at youth , college , minor league and international levels .
" These are the best pitchers in the world , and the pitchers that have thrown the no-hitters are pretty darn nasty , " Houston third baseman Chris Johnson said .
" If they are on their game , it 's a battle .
These guys have a chance to do it every night . "
Former big league pitcher and current Los Angeles Angels broadcaster Mark Gubicza has a simple theory of his own .
" I think the resurgence of the power arm is why .
Outside of Dallas Braden , who does n't have overpowering stuff but spots the ball pretty well , you can see an overwhelming majority of pitchers now that have plus fastballs in the 93 -96 ( mph ) range and sometimes top out at 98 .
There are more of them that we 've seen probably since maybe the late 60s and early 70s , " he said .
" Unless the ( radar ) guns are n't right , I 've never seen so many guys with such good fastballs .
And when you have a guy who can spot a fastball , you can be very successful . "

AP Baseball Writers Fred Goodall and Janie McCauley , AP Sports Writers Doug Tucker and Kristie Rieken , and AP freelance writers Mark Didtler and Michael Wagaman contributed to this report .
It ’s time to put our heads together to envision “ the perfect 10 ” .
This is a time of great innovation and change in the Linux world , with major new initiatives from powerful groups bringing lots of new ideas , new energy and new code .
Thanks to the combined efforts of Google , Intel , IBM , Canonical , Red Hat , Oracle , Cisco , ARM , many other companies , Debian and other projects , a hundred startups and tens of thousands of professional and inspired contributors , the open source ecosystem continues to accelerate .
We need to bring the best of all of that work into focus and into the archive .
For millions of users , Ubuntu represents what Free Software can do out of the box for them .
We owe it to everybody who works on Free Software to make that a great experience .
At the Ubuntu Developer Summit , in May in Belgium , we ’ll have a new design track , and a “ cloud and server ” track , reflecting some major focal points in 2010 .
They will complement our ongoing work on community , desktop , kernel , quality assurance , foundations and mobile .
Our new theme is “ Light ” , and the next cycle will embrace that at many levels .
We have a continued interest in netbooks , and we ’ll revamp the Ubuntu Netbook Edition user interface .
As computers become lighter they become more mobile , and we ’ll work to keep people connected , all day , everywhere .
We ’ll embrace the web , aiming for the lightest , fastest web experience on any platform .
The fastest boot , the fastest network connect , the fastest browser .
Our goal is to ensure that UNE is far and away the best desktop OS for a netbook , both for consumers and power users .
On the other end of the spectrum , we ’ll be lightening the burden of enterprise deployment with our emphasis on hybrid cloud computing .
Ubuntu Server is already very popular on public clouds like EC2 and Rackspace , and now that Dell supports the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud for private cloud infrastructure , it ’s possible to build workloads that run equally well in your data center or on the cloud .
We ’ll focus on making it even easier to build those workloads and keep them up to date , and managing the configurations of tens , or tens of thousands , of Ubuntu machines running in the cloud .
It ’s not all about work .
We do n’t just want to be connected to the internet , we want to be connected to each other .
Social from the Start is our initiative to make the desktop a collaborative , social place .
For the past five years , we ’ve all been shifting more and more data into the web , to a series of accounts and networks elsewhere .
Now it ’s time to start to bring those social networks back into our everyday computing environment .
Our addressbooks and contact lists need to be synchronized and shared , so that we have the latest information everywhere – from mobile phones to web accounts .
So there ’s a lot to do .
I hope you ’ll join us in shaping that work .
Introducing the Maverick Meerkat
Our mascot for 10.10 is the Maverick Meerkat .
This is a time of change , and we ’re not afraid to surprise people with a bold move if the opportunity for dramatic improvement presents itself .
We want to put Ubuntu and free software on every single consumer PC that ships from a major manufacturer , the ultimate maverick move .
We will deliver on time , but we have huge scope for innovation in what we deliver this cycle .
Once we have released the LTS we have plenty of room to shake things up a little .
Let ’s hear the best ideas , gather the best talent , and be a little radical in how we approach the next two year major cycle .
Meerkats are , of course , light , fast and social – everything we want in a Perfect 10 .
We ’re booting really fast these days , but the final push remains .
Changes in the toolchain may make us even faster for every application .
We ’re Social from the Start , but we could get even more tightly connected , and we could bring social features into even more applications .
Meerkats are family - oriented , and we aspire to having Ubuntu being the safe and efficient solution for all the family netbooks .
They are also clever – meerkats teach one another new skills .
And that ’s what makes this such a great community .
Here ’s looking at the Lynx
Lucid is shaping up beautifully , but there ’s still a lot to be done to make it the LTS we all want .
Thanks to everyone who is bringing their time , energy and expertise to bear on making it outstanding .
And I ’m looking forward to the release parties , the brainstorming at UDS , and further steps on our mission to bring free software to the world , on free terms .

People have concerns besides simply prolonging their lives .
Surveys of patients with terminal illness find that their top priorities include , in addition to avoiding suffering , being with family , having the touch of others , being mentally aware , and not becoming a burden to others .
Our system of technological medical care has utterly failed to meet these needs , and the cost of this failure is measured in far more than dollars .
The hard question we face , then , is not how we can afford this system ’s expense .
It is how we can build a health - care system that will actually help dying patients achieve what ’s most important to them at the end of their lives .
For all but our most recent history , dying was typically a brief process .
Whether the cause was childhood infection , difficult childbirth , heart attack , or pneumonia , the interval between recognizing that you had a life - threatening ailment and death was often just a matter of days or weeks .
Consider how our Presidents died before the modern era .
George Washington developed a throat infection at home on December 13 , 1799 , that killed him by the next evening .
John Quincy Adams , Millard Fillmore , and Andrew Johnson all succumbed to strokes , and died within two days .
Rutherford Hayes had a heart attack and died three days later .
Some deadly illnesses took a longer course : James Monroe and Andrew Jackson died from the months - long consumptive process of what appears to have been tuberculosis ; Ulysses Grant ’s oral cancer took a year to kill him ; and James Madison was bedridden for two years before dying of “ old age . ”
But , as the end - of - life researcher Joanne Lynn has observed , people usually experienced life - threatening illness the way they experienced bad weather — as something that struck with little warning — and you either got through it or you did n’t .
Dying used to be accompanied by a prescribed set of customs .
Guides to ars moriendi , the art of dying , were extraordinarily popular ; a 1415 medieval Latin text was reprinted in more than a hundred editions across Europe .
Reaffirming one ’s faith , repenting one ’s sins , and letting go of one ’s worldly possessions and desires were crucial , and the guides provided families with prayers and questions for the dying in order to put them in the right frame of mind during their final hours .
Last words came to hold a particular place of reverence .
These days , swift catastrophic illness is the exception ; for most people , death comes only after long medical struggle with an incurable condition — advanced cancer , progressive organ failure ( usually the heart , kidney , or liver ) , or the multiple debilities of very old age .
In all such cases , death is certain , but the timing is n’t .
So everyone struggles with this uncertainty — with how , and when , to accept that the battle is lost .
As for last words , they hardly seem to exist anymore .
Technology sustains our organs until we are well past the point of awareness and coherence .
Besides , how do you attend to the thoughts and concerns of the dying when medicine has made it almost impossible to be sure who the dying even are ?
Is someone with terminal cancer , dementia , incurable congestive heart failure dying , exactly ?
I once cared for a woman in her sixties who had severe chest and abdominal pain from a bowel obstruction that had ruptured her colon , caused her to have a heart attack , and put her into septic shock and renal failure .
I performed an emergency operation to remove the damaged length of colon and give her a colostomy .
A cardiologist stented her coronary arteries .
We put her on dialysis , a ventilator , and intravenous feeding , and stabilized her .
After a couple of weeks , though , it was clear that she was not going to get much better .
The septic shock had left her with heart and respiratory failure as well as dry gangrene of her foot , which would have to be amputated .
She had a large , open abdominal wound with leaking bowel contents , which would require twice - a- day cleaning and dressing for weeks in order to heal .
She would not be able to eat .
She would need a tracheotomy .
Her kidneys were gone , and she would have to spend three days a week on a dialysis machine for the rest of her life .
She was unmarried and without children .
So I sat with her sisters in the I.C.U. family room to talk about whether we should proceed with the amputation and the tracheotomy .
“ Is she dying ? ” one of the sisters asked me .
I did n’t know how to answer the question .
I was n’t even sure what the word “ dying ” meant anymore .
In the past few decades , medical science has rendered obsolete centuries of experience , tradition , and language about our mortality , and created a new difficulty for mankind : how to die .
One Friday morning this spring , I went on patient rounds with Sarah Creed , a nurse with the hospice service that my hospital system operates .
I did n’t know much about hospice .
I knew that it specialized in providing “ comfort care ” for the terminally ill , sometimes in special facilities , though nowadays usually at home .
I knew that , in order for a patient of mine to be eligible , I had to write a note certifying that he or she had a life expectancy of less than six months .
And I knew few patients who had chosen it , except maybe in their very last few days , because they had to sign a form indicating that they understood their disease was incurable and that they were giving up on medical care to stop it .
The picture I had of hospice was of a morphine drip .
It was not of this brown - haired and blue - eyed former I.C.U. nurse with a stethoscope , knocking on Lee Cox ’s door on a quiet street in Boston ’s Mattapan neighborhood .
“ Hi , Lee , ” Creed said when she entered the house .
“ Hi , Sarah , ” Cox said .
She was seventy - two years old .
She ’d had several years of declining health due to congestive heart failure from a heart attack and pulmonary fibrosis , a progressive and irreversible lung disease .
Doctors tried slowing the disease with steroids , but they did n’t work .
She had cycled in and out of the hospital , each time in worse shape .
Ultimately , she accepted hospice care and moved in with her niece for support .
She was dependent on oxygen , and unable to do the most ordinary tasks .
Just answering the door , with her thirty - foot length of oxygen tubing trailing after her , had left her winded .
She stood resting for a moment , her lips pursed and her chest heaving .
Creed took
Cox ’s arm gently as we walked to the kitchen to sit down , asking her how she had been doing .
Then she asked a series of questions , targeting issues that tend to arise in patients with terminal illness .
Did Cox have pain ?
How was her appetite , thirst , sleeping ?
Any trouble with confusion , anxiety , or restlessness ?
Had her shortness of breath grown worse ?
Was there chest pain or heart palpitations ?
Abdominal discomfort ?
Trouble with bowel movements or urination or walking ?
She did have some new troubles .
When she walked from the bedroom to the bathroom , she said , it now took at least five minutes to catch her breath , and that frightened her .
She was also getting chest pain .
Creed pulled a stethoscope and a blood - pressure cuff from her medical bag .
Cox ’s blood pressure was acceptable , but her heart rate was high .
Creed listened to her heart , which had a normal rhythm , and to her lungs , hearing the fine crackles of her pulmonary fibrosis but also a new wheeze .
Her ankles were swollen with fluid , and when Creed asked for her pillbox she saw that Cox was out of her heart medication .
She asked to see Cox ’s oxygen equipment .
The liquid - oxygen cylinder at the foot of the neatly made bed was filled and working properly .
The nebulizer equipment for her inhaler treatments , however , was broken .
Given the lack of heart medication and inhaler treatments , it was no wonder that she had worsened .
Creed called Cox ’s pharmacy to confirm that her refills had been waiting , and had her arrange for her niece to pick up the medicine when she came home from work .
Creed also called the nebulizer supplier for same - day emergency service .
She then chatted with Cox in the kitchen for a few minutes .
Her spirits were low .
Creed took her hand .
Everything was going to be all right , she said .
She reminded her about the good days she ’d had — the previous weekend , for example , when she ’d been able to go out with her portable oxygen cylinder to shop with her niece and get her hair colored .
I asked Cox about her previous life .
She had made radios in a Boston factory .
She and her husband had two children , and several grandchildren .
When I asked her why she had chosen hospice care , she looked downcast .
“ The lung doctor and heart doctor said they could n’t help me anymore , ” she said .
Creed glared at me .
My questions had made Cox sad again .
“ It ’s good to have my niece and her husband helping to watch me every day , ” she said .
“ But it ’s not my home .
I feel like I ’m in the way . ”
Creed gave her a hug before we left , and one last reminder .
“ What do you do if you have chest pain that does n’t go away ? ” she asked .
“ Take a nitro , ” Cox said , referring to the nitroglycerin pill that she can slip under her tongue .
“ And ? ”
“ Call you . ”
“ Where ’s the number ? ”
She pointed to the twenty - four - hour hospice call number that was taped beside her phone .
Outside , I confessed that I was confused by what Creed was doing .
A lot of it seemed to be about extending Cox ’s life .
Was n’t the goal of hospice to let nature take its course ?
“ That ’s not the goal , ” Creed said .
The difference between standard medical care and hospice is not the difference between treating and doing nothing , she explained .
The difference was in your priorities .
In ordinary medicine , the goal is to extend life .
We ’ll sacrifice the quality of your existence now — by performing surgery , providing chemotherapy , putting you in intensive care — for the chance of gaining time later .
Hospice deploys nurses , doctors , and social workers to help people with a fatal illness have the fullest possible lives right now .
That means focussing on objectives like freedom from pain and discomfort , or maintaining mental awareness for as long as possible , or getting out with family once in a while .
Hospice and palliative - care specialists are n’t much concerned about whether that makes people ’s lives longer or shorter .
Like many people , I had believed that hospice care hastens death , because patients forgo hospital treatments and are allowed high - dose narcotics to combat pain .
But studies suggest otherwise .
In one , researchers followed 4,493 Medicare patients with either terminal cancer or congestive heart failure .
They found no difference in survival time between hospice and non-hospice patients with breast cancer , prostate cancer , and colon cancer .
Curiously , hospice care seemed to extend survival for some patients ; those with pancreatic cancer gained an average of three weeks , those with lung cancer gained six weeks , and those with congestive heart failure gained three months .
The lesson seems almost Zen : you live longer only when you stop trying to live longer .
When Cox was transferred to hospice care , her doctors thought that she would n’t live much longer than a few weeks .
With the supportive hospice therapy she received , she had already lived for a year .
Creed enters people ’s lives at a strange moment — when they have understood that they have a fatal illness but have not necessarily acknowledged that they are dying .
“ I ’d say only about a quarter have accepted their fate when they come into hospice , ” she said .
When she first encounters her patients , many feel that they have simply been abandoned by their doctors .
“ Ninety - nine per cent understand they ’re dying , but one hundred per cent hope they ’re not , ” she says .
“ They still want to beat their disease . ”
The initial visit is always tricky , but she has found ways to smooth things over .
“ A nurse has five seconds to make a patient like you and trust you .
It ’s in the whole way you present yourself .
I do not come in saying , ‘ I ’m so sorry . ’
Instead , it ’s : ‘ I ’m the hospice nurse , and here ’s what I have to offer you to make your life better .
And I know we do n’t have a lot of time to waste . ’ ”
That was how she started with Dave Galloway , whom we visited after leaving Lee Cox ’s home .
He was forty - two years old .
He and his wife , Sharon , were both Boston firefighters .
They had a three - year - old daughter .
He had pancreatic cancer , which had spread ; his upper abdomen was now solid with tumor .
During the past few months , the pain had become unbearable at times , and he was admitted to the hospital several times for pain crises .
At his most recent admission , about a week earlier , it was found that the tumor had perforated his intestine .
There was n’t even a temporary fix for this problem .
The medical team started him on intravenous nutrition and offered him a choice between going to the intensive - care unit and going home with hospice .
He chose to go home .
“ I wish we ’d gotten involved sooner , ” Creed told me .
When she and the hospice ’s supervising doctor , Dr. JoAnne Nowak , evaluated Galloway upon his arrival at home , he appeared to have only a few days left .
His eyes were hollow .
His breathing was labored .
Fluid swelled his entire lower body to the point that his skin blistered and wept .
He was almost delirious with abdominal pain .
“ Sometimes I just want to curl up with a good book and burn it . ”

They got to work .
They set up a pain pump with a button that let him dispense higher doses of narcotic than he had been allowed .
They arranged for an electric hospital bed , so that he could sleep with his back raised .
They also taught Sharon how to keep Dave clean , protect his skin from breakdown , and handle the crises to come .
Creed told me that part of her job is to take the measure of a patient ’s family , and Sharon struck her as unusually capable .
She was determined to take care of her husband to the end , and , perhaps because she was a firefighter , she had the resilience and the competence to do so .
She did not want to hire a private - duty nurse .
She handled everything , from the I.V. lines and the bed linens to orchestrating family members to lend a hand when she needed help .
During a 40 - minute ride on that highway , a tractor hauling gravel was seen driving the wrong way , a milk truck stopped in the road so its driver could urinate and motorists swerved to avoid a bicycle cart full of wooden tables in the fast lane .
Drivers chatted on mobile phones as they steered stick - shift cars and wove across lanes .
Side mirrors were often turned in or were nonexistent .
A cluster of women in saris holding small children waited anxiously for a gap in traffic so they could race across the highway .
Opposite them , a group of young men in office attire waited to cross in the other direction .
The breakdown in road safety has many causes , experts say .
Often , the police are too stretched to enforce existing traffic laws or take bribes to ignore them ; heavy vehicles , pedestrians , bullock carts and bicycles share roadways ; punishment for violators is lenient , delayed or nonexistent ; and driver ’s licenses are easy to get with a bribe .
Kamal Nath , India ’s minister of road transport and highways , said in an interview that highway safety was a “ priority ” for the national government .
“ Road safety is one of the major issues ” the ministry is addressing , he said .
The ministry is reviewing the Motor Vehicles Act and , three years after a government - backed committee recommended that a national road safety board be established , it has introduced legislation to that effect in Parliament .
International safety experts say the Indian government has been slow to act .
Bringing down road deaths “ requires political commitment at the highest level , ” said Dr. Etienne Krug , director of the department of violence and injury prevention at the World Health Organization .
India ’s government is “ just waking up to the issue , ” he said .
Mr. Nath , who was India ’s commerce minister before moving to the Highway Ministry last year , has increased highway expansion plans and is raising $ 45 billion from private investors to extend India ’s 3.3 - million - kilometer , or 2 - million - mile , road network .
The expansion is an integral part of keeping the economy , now at about 9 percent growth a year , humming , Mr. Nath says .
Government planners warn that fatalities are unlikely to decline soon .
When highways are built , “ there are always more accidents , ” said Atul Kumar , chief general manager of road safety with the National Highways Authority of India , part of Mr. Nath ’s ministry .

Transcript.pdf
Patricia Smith Churchland , UC President ’s Professor of Philosophy at UC San Diego , focuses on neuroethics and attempts to understand choice , responsibly and the basis of moral norms in terms of brain function , evolution and brain - culture interactions .
Her books include Brain - Wise ; Neurophilosophy : Toward a Unified Science of the Mind - Brain ; and On the Contrary , with husband Paul M. Churchland .
Paul M. Churchland is Professor of Philosophy at UC San Diego .
With his wife and philosophical partner , Patricia , he has been an advocate of “ eliminative materialism ” , which claims that scientific theories about the brain do not square well with our traditional common sense beliefs about the mind .
Among his books are Matter and Consciousness : A Neurocomputational Perspective and The Engine of Reason , The Seat of the Soul .

A group of top Israel Navy reserves officers on Sunday publicly called on Israel to allow an external probe into its commando raid of a Gaza - bound humanitarian aid flotilla last week , which left nine people dead and several more wounded .
In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi , the Navy officers denounced the commando raid as having " ended in tragedy both at the military and diplomatic levels . "

" We disagree with the widespread claims that this was the result of an intelligence rift , " said the officers .
" In addition , we do not accept claims that this was a ' public relations failure ' and we think that the plan was doomed to failure from the beginning . "
" First and foremost , we protest the fact that responsibility for the tragic results was immediately thrust onto the organizers of the flotilla , " wrote the officers .
" This demonstrates contempt for the responsibility that belongs principally to the hierarchy of commanders and those who approved the mission .
This shows contempt for the values of professionalism , the purity of weapons and for human lives . "
The Navy officers ' letter came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his top ministers to deliberate a United Nations proposal to create a joint international committee alongside Turkey and the United States to investigate the circumstances of the deadly raid .
The cabinet was also to discuss the creation of an internal committee to look into the incident .
Netanyahu earlier Sunday rejected the idea of an international panel , and reiterated that Israel had the right to conduct its own investigation .
Netanyahu discussed the proposal for a multinational panel with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a telephone call on Saturday but told cabinet ministers fon Sunday that Israel was exploring other options , political sources said .
" I told [ Ban ] that the investigation of the facts must be carried out responsibly and objectively , " Netanyahu told ministers .
" We need to consider the issue carefully and level - headedly , while maintaining Israel 's national interests as well as those of the Israel Defense Forces . "
Back in the bad old days of the Cold War — when mutual nuclear annihilation was a policy option — a culture of secrecy arose in Washington .
What wise observers understood even then was that while governments tried to keep secrets from each other , their chief concern was to keep secrets from their own people .
Considering what had been done in the name of the United States , from Mafia assassination plots against foreign leaders to murder , corruption and coups d’état , that concern was quite sensible .
And there was hell to pay when the hidden history began to emerge .
During the nine years since 9/11 the national security state has doubled or tripled in size , with huge annexes in the private sector — and the culture of secrecy has metastasized simultaneously .
As The Washington Post reports in a landmark series titled “ Top Secret America , ” by Dana Priest and William Arkin , the dimensions of the security colossus are stunning .
It is nothing less than a fourth branch of government , so large , so powerful and so wealthy that no other branch can even grasp it , let alone control it .
How big ?
Nobody knows exactly , not even the Post investigative team , after two years of research that gathered many thousands of public records , including government contracts , intelligence reports and corporate documents , and included interviews with exceptionally knowledgeable sources .
But Priest and Arkin , whose work ought to be read by everyone , say that there are as many as 1,271 government entities and 1,931 private companies “ working on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States , ” with an estimated 854,000 people — far more than live in the city of Washington , D.C. — holding top- secret security clearances . ”
More than 30 building complexes for top - secret intelligence outfits are either under construction now or have been built since September 2001 ; altogether , these buildings occupy 17 million square feet of space .
Nobody in the White House , the Congress or any of the intelligence agencies , including the new Office of the Director of National Intelligence , seems to have the capacity to manage the complex tangle of agencies , companies and off - the - books entities that are supposed to protect us from violent extremism .
After reviewing the way that the Defense Department oversees its most sensitive intelligence and operational programs last year , retired Army Lt. Gen. John R. Vines told the Post reporters that he found the morass almost incomprehensible : “ I ’m not aware of any agency with the authority , responsibility or a process in place to coordinate all these interagency and commercial activities .
The complexity of this system defies description . ”
Calling this thing a “ system ” is a bit misleading .
But does the leviathan offspring of government and corporation make us safer ?
That , too , is difficult to determine — in fact , it is impossible to determine , as the writers explain , because with “ so many employees , units and organizations , the lines of responsibility began to blur . ”
We have no way of knowing precisely what the national security complex does with the hundreds of billions of dollars in its shrouded budgets .
What we do know is that billions of dollars are wasted through redundancy , corruption and sheer overgrowth .
Too many agencies are performing the same tasks , such as shutting down terrorist money transfers and generating too many reports for anyone to read .
Most disturbing is that so many critical functions are outsourced to private corporations , primarily loyal to shareholders and management .
The role of these corporations and their lobbyists , who controlled the creation of the Department of Homeland Security during the George W. Bush administration , is a challenge to democracy of unprecedented proportions .
But despite presidential promises of transparency , the Barack Obama administration is fostering more secrecy , not less — which is exactly the wrong way to cope with this problem .
Our democracy and our security both depend on bringing this monstrous bureaucracy to heel — and that can only be done in the sunlight .
Joe Conason writes for The New York Observer .

The third in the trilogy is a comedy , but in a bittersweet way
Many men like to think themselves impervious to Hollywood 's traditional tearjerkers , but is the newly - released Toy Story 3 a sign that moviemakers are gaining new powers to make them weep ?
Middle - aged men are not " supposed " to cry during movies .
But there 's a been a groundswell of admissions that Toy Story 3 is having just such an effect , and that it might be part of a growing trend of more subtle emotion inducing on the silver screen .
Hardy film critics in the US have admitted feeling weepy after watching the film and when it opens in the UK on Friday the same effect will be easily observed .
Jeff Zegas , 56 , is typical of the responses to the film in the US .
" I had tears in my eyes .
It was so touching about Andy , when he was saying goodbye . "
From a very young age , males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry Prof Mary Beth Oliver
The third film in the trilogy shows
Andy , the owner of the toys , as a 17 - year - old about to leave for university .
He has to decide what to do with the toys .
Critics have identified the themes of growing - up , leaving home and loyalty .
Particularly powerful is the bittersweet idea - to a parent - of a child leaving home .
Parents can be filled with nostalgia for their own youth , sadness at the distance from their offspring , but happiness that they are going out into the world , eventually to reproduce the cycle .
There have always been tearjerkers , playing on the fact that some audiences ' idea of a good time is to have a good cry .

Over the years misty eyes have been generated by the death of Bambi's mother , the killing of the kestrel in Kes , the ending of Titanic , or Jenny 's death in Love Story .
And yet men , if they have felt weepy during these films , have often tried to be surreptitious about it .
That 's because there are expectations about their behaviour , says Prof Mary Beth Oliver , of Penn State University , co-author of the academic paper An Examination of Factors Related to Sex Differences In Enjoyment of Sad Films " .
" For many men , there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of ' female ' emotions like sadness and fear .
From a very young age , males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry , and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons are n't followed . "

It 's probably not that grown men are pilloried for crying during films , rather that they are the victims of subtle gestures .
Raised eyebrows might be the response to over - effusive expression of emotion .
" There are certain ' arenas ' where male crying is deemed appropriate like the loss of a favourite sporting team , the death of a parent , or war , " says Prof Oliver .
" We can see many of these sorts of arenas reflected in ' male ' tearjerkers like Field of Dreams or Brian 's Song . "
Indeed , some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon .
The idea of sacrifice for a " brother " is a more suitable source of emotion .
And not only is crying in movies not seen as a " male " thing , it also has an age bias .
" In general , there 's some research to support the idea that going to the movies to ' have a good cry ' is a young person 's game - probably part of the developmental task of exploring intense feelings as well as a way to bond with your peers , " says Prof Marie - Louise Mares , of the communication arts department at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
ANALYSIS - WHAT MAKES US CRY ?
Image copyright Other Prof Mary Beth Oliver is an expert on the effects of the media .
I used to think of tearjerkers as sad films .
Now , however , I am beginning to think that when we watch " sad " films , we 're really watching something that is helping us search for meaning - what is the purpose of life ?
What is valuable ?
How can I grapple with questions of the human condition ?
And in many respects , these questions necessarily are about life 's joys , but also its tragedies , too .
When we reflect on meanings , we reflect on life ( and death ) , time passing , our place in it , etc .
This is meaningfulness , and I believe that many films help us grapple with these types of questions .
10 things that make blokes cry
" Adults generally report less of this as they grow older - there are plenty of other things to make one feel blue and there 's often less time and energy to spend on making oneself sob . "
The significance of Toy Story 3 is perhaps that it induces male weepiness despite nothing archetypally " sad " happening .
No - one dies , no - one gives their life for another , there is no life - changing tragedy - all 's well that ends well .
It perhaps is the inheritor of films like It 's a Wonderful Life , with it 's unrelentingly happy and yet extremely tear - inducing ending .
Another Pixar animation , last year 's Up , also had segments which had a wide range of the audience weepy .
And critics have identified a hefty dose of pathos in recent complex family - relations films Cyrus and The Kids Are Alright .
These family dynamics and rites of passage may be what can get the emotions going of an otherwise sobre adult filmgoer .
" Young children will have very little sense of the poignancy of the story , " says Prof Mares .
" Research suggests that actions rather than emotions are most salient and vivid for young viewers , unless the emotion is writ very large .
" On the other hand , it makes perfect sense that the story would resonate with adults - for them , it can prompt memories of their own moments when everything was in flux and adulthood stands ahead with endless options .
That 's a very bittersweet thing to look back on , given that the options soon start closing . "
Death of youth
And the emotions in films like Toy Story 3 are enhanced by the presence of children at one 's side .
" I wonder whether part of the tug of the heart strings also comes from the anticipation that your own kid , who 's cheerfully munching popcorn next to you , will soon be growing up and moving on out , " says Prof Mares .
" As a parent myself , I 'm constantly torn between wishing that my kids would hurry up and grow up already and wanting them to stay my kids . "
Any parents who cried during ET will identify with all of this .
For the most part tearjerkers may still mostly come in the form of cutie animals and photogenic young people dying .
But there certainly seem to be signs that Hollywood 's emotional range is expanding .
Unless the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) is given the power to conduct random checks on organisations for compliance with data protection law and issue penalties based on those checks the European Commission will take action , it said .
The ICO must also be given the powers to assess other countries ' data protection regimes before international transfers of information from the UK are made , the Commission said .
The Commission has sent the UK a ' reasoned opinion ' , the second step in a three stage process of enforcing EU directives when countries do not pass them fully into law .
" The case concerns the implementation of the EU ’s 1995 Data Protection Directive both in UK law ( the Data Protection Act of 1998 ) and its application by UK courts , " said a Commission statement .
" The Commission has worked with UK authorities to resolve a number of issues , but several remain , notably limitations of the Information Commissioner 's Office 's powers . "
The first stage of the Commission 's formal process when taking countries to task is to send nations a Letter of Formal Notice .
If the response to that is unsatisfactory then a Reasoned Opinion is sent .
Countries have two months in which to comply with the Reasoned Opinion .
If they do not then that country is referred to the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) , Europe 's highest court .
" However , in over 90 % of infringement cases , Member States comply with their obligations under EU law before they are referred to the Court , " said a Commission explanation of the process .
" If the Court rules against a Member State , the Member State must then take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment . "
The Commission said that the UK must also change the law on people 's rights to have their information deleted by organisations .
" Courts in the UK can refuse the right to have personal data rectified or erased .
The right to compensation for moral damage when personal information is used inappropriately is also restricted , " it said .
" These powers and rights are protected under the EU Data Protection Directive and must also apply in the UK .
As expressed in today ’s reasoned opinion , the Commission wants the UK to remedy these and other shortcomings . "
The Commission has consistently complained to the UK about its implementation of the Data Protection Directive .
Complaints first emerged in 2004 and resurfaced in 2007 and last year .
In 2007 the Commission found fault with the UK's transfer into law of 11 of the Data Protection Directive 's articles , almost a third of the whole Directive .
These deficiencies included the issues raised this week .
Those same issues also formed part of Commission complaints in 2004 .
Last year the Commission said that the Data Protection and Privacy and Electronic Communication Directives were not properly implemented in the UK .
The Commission was responding to concerns over controversial Phorm advertising technology .
I am happy to announce the book made the bestseller list ; ranked at # 2 !

The residents of Columbia Tennessee can sleep safer at night knowing “ the Viper ” is patrolling the streets .
20 year old Christian Hardee is walking around town in tights and a mask “ looking for crimes to report ” .
“ I ’m just a guy trying to do what ’s right , in tights ”
Whether he ’s a complete nutjob , or just a bored college student is for you to decide .
The Daily Herald : Man dons costume to fight crime .
By day , he ’s a mild - mannered college student studying chemistry .
But at night , he becomes the Viper , a superhero looking to stamp out crime in Columbia .
Christian Tyler Hardee , 20 , caught the attention of Columbia police officers when they spotted him wearing a mask and green - and - black tights about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday near the Bicycle Shop on the Square .
But the aspiring superhero assured police he was working for good not evil .
He told officers he was on the prowl in search of crime to report .
Hardee , a self - professed comic book nerd , said he knows he ’s just a regular college student without super - human powers , and his behavior might be viewed as strange by some .
But for Hardee , dressing as a superhero is a way to inspire the community to stand against wrongdoing and perform acts of charity .
“ I am just a guy trying to do what is right , in tights , ” he said .
During his patrol of Columbia , he donned under armor , carried two plastic sticks and wore a utility belt .
On the belt , he stowed a screw driver , wrenches and a cell phone to quickly call police if he stumbled across crime .
Officers also found ninja throwing stars inside his car parked near the Bicycle Shop , according to a police report .
Columbia Police Lt. Michelle Jones said the department does not need the assistance of a superhero to keep the city ’s streets safe .
She discouraged the public from patrolling the streets while dressed in costumes .
“ We always encourage the public to be good witnesses but not actively get out and look for crime , ” she said .
Police determined Hardee was not breaking any laws , other than a city ordinance that prohibits wearing a mask that obscures the face in public .
He was advised of the ordinance and was not cited .
Jones said detectives interviewed Hardee and encouraged him to stop his patrols .
Investigators are worried he could frighten the public or hurt himself or others .
Hardee said he will continue to look for crime but without the full costume .
To date , he has not stumbled upon criminal activity .
The 20 - year - old studies chemistry and art at Union University in Jackson .
He hopes to land a job with his chemistry degree , make some money and then embark upon a career as a comic - book artist once he is financially secure .
“ I am not out of touch with reality . … I am just a normal guy , ” he said .
“ I know what happens in the movies does n’t happen in real life . ”
He also wants everyone to know he is not trying to inspire children to follow in his footsteps , and he did not don the costume in search of publicity .
“ If I wanted attention , I would go streaking or something , ” Hardee said .
Could you live trash - free ?
A young couple spent the past year figuring out whether that 's possible .
Their answer : absolutely .
" It was actually a lot easier than we expected , " says Amy Korst , 26 , a recently laid - off high school teacher in Dallas , Ore .
She and husband Adam bought only items they could recycle or compost to avoid adding to landfills .
Their only trash for 12 months -- about 75 scraps such as eight used razor blades , a burned - out light bulb , two Theraflu pouches and a broken Christmas ornament -- fits in a shoebox that weighs about 4 pounds .
The Korsts are among a growing number of Americans trying to lighten their landfill load in a country where the average person generates 4.5 pounds of trash each day .
" Their experiment shows we 've come some distance , but there 's still more we can do " to live sustainably , says Eric Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defense Council , a private environmental group .
Recycling rates have skyrocketed , from 6 % of solid waste in 1960 to 33 % in 2008 , the Environmental Protection Agency reports .
The amount of trash generated , after increasing for decades , has stabilized since 2005 .
" Part of this is recession - related , " Goldstein says , noting people have less money to spend .
Yet there 's also an increasing desire to live more simply , says Colin Beavan , who launched the No Impact Project after his family spent a year trying to live without using any power or generating any trash in Manhattan .
He wrote a book about it .
" There 's a huge amount of grass - roots efforts to change how we live , " he says , noting that 10,000 people have signed on to do his one - week , zero - waste challenge since October .
This fall , he 'll run his week - long " carbon cleanse " at 11 universities .
" What 's difficult is the habit change , " Beavan says .
He completely changed how he shopped for groceries , bringing bags or containers to buy from bulk bins .
" It 's a mind - set change , " says Amy Korst , who began her " Green Garbage Project " on July 6 , 2009 , and finished it this month .
" If we can't recycle it , we do n't buy it . "
She started a compost bin in the backyard , grew produce and negotiated with a Safeway manager to be able to take food home from the meat and cheese counters in her own containers .
" I have a kit in each car , " she says , that includes mesh produce bags water bottles , coffee mugs and Tupperware containers .
If they go out to dinner , they bring a container for leftovers .
Whatever she can't recycle curbside , she takes to a recycling depot , or in the case of batteries , an electronics store .
The year , though relatively smooth , was not without its challenges .
Take Halloween , for instance , with all its individually - wrapped candies .
She and Adam debated what to do .
" I 'm not giving them ( kids ) pencils , " she told him .
" We went ahead with candy .
I have this " trash is a splurge " attitude , " she says .
For Christmas , though , she skipped using candy canes as tree ornaments .
She says she and Adam were always bothered by the trash they 'd see backpacking in the wilderness .
After reading Barbara Kingsolver 's Animal , Vegetable , Miracle : A Year of Food Life ( P.S. ) , about eating only home - grown food , she asked herself : " What can I do ? "
Korst plans to write a book about her experience and keep living trash - free .
She says , " There 's no way I could go back , because it ended up being so easy . "
The Weekly Standard ’s blog has been the go - to source for those of us who follow the various astroturf groups springing up to hype the looming Iranian nuclear threat .
First , there was the end - of - April launch of Keep Israel Safe .
Keep Israel
Safe is a joint project of Tom Rose , the former publisher of The Jerusalem Post and current contributing editor at The Weekly Standard , and Gary Bauer , a major player in the Christian right , long - time Kristol buddy , and charter member of The Project For a New American Century .
During his tenure at the The Jerusalem Post , Rose gained notoriety for pushing the paper ’s editorial stance hard to the right and alienating his staff .
After Rose was fired from the paper in 2004 , Bret Stephens , a former editor in chief at the Post and current Wall Street Journal columnist and editorial board member , wrote :
So many of us have been waiting for this day , and fighting for it , that we may be forgiven for thinking that Tom ’s departure brings our problems to an end .
It does not .
It will be some time before we can undo the damage he wrought :
To our finances , to our reputation , to our business relationships , to our morale , to the quality of our editorial product ….
What we can say is that , with Tom gone , we can begin to address our problems in a rational and purposeful way .
Rose responded with a $ 2 million defamation lawsuit against Stephens .
The case was dismissed by the trial judge , whose disposition was upheld by the appeals court .
Rose is also a right - wing radio talk show host who also founded America ’s Voices for Israel , “… a US based not - for - profit organization that brings American radio and television talk show hosts broadcast [ sic ] their programs live from Israel for a week , ” according to his agent ’s website .
On Tuesday , The Weekly Standard ’s blog was at it again , pushing the freshly minted Stop Iran Now , complete with its first ( and perhaps only ) ad .
Of course , that insufficiently bellicose presidents , particularly Democrats , should be compared to Neville Chamberlain has , over the past 40 years or so , become a neo - conservative cliche , but that did n’t stop the folks at Stop Iran Now from running it yet again ( and again and again and again ad Hitlerum ) .
If Obama does n’t “ stop Iran now , ” then he obviously will be responsible for a world war and a new Holocaust .
So who is Stop Iran Now ?
It is a project of Citizens United , a conservative group which appears to specialize in producing documentaries and was immortalized earlier in January by the Supreme Court ’s extremely controversial 5 - 4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling that the First Amendment permits corporations to fund independent political broadcasts in elections to federal office .
The group ’s list of productions includes : Nine Days That Changed The World ; Generation Zero ; Rediscovering God In America II ; Perfect Valor ; Ronald Reagan : Rendezvous With Destiny ; We Have The Power ; The Path to 9/11 ; Hype : The Obama Effect ; Hillary : The Movie ; Gingrich : Rediscovering God In America ; Border War : The Battle Over Illegal Immigration ; ACLU : At War With America ; Broken Promises : The UN at 60 ; and Celsius 41.11 : The Truth Behind the Lies of Farenheit 9/11 .
It ’s clear that Stop Iran Now is the latest in a long series of politically motivated campaigns produced by Citizens United .
Director of Citizens United , David Bossie , has an impressive history of far - right partisanship and a bad habit of crossing the line into unethical territory .
In 1992 , CBS News reported that Bossie harassed the family of a young woman in Arkansas , Susann Coleman , in an attempt to prove that she had committed suicide as a result of an affair with Bill Clinton .
Bossie was subsequently hired as an investigator by Sen. Lauch Faircloth and then by Rep. Dan Burton during the Whitewater hearings , but his willingness to cut corners resulted in his firing by then - House Speaker Newt Gingrich , which is saying something .
SourceWatch writes :
While The Weekly Standard keeps promoting groups like Keep Israel Safe and Stop Iran Now as grassroots movements , they appear instead to be the organizational expressions of fiercely partisan individuals with substantial means at their disposal ( like Kristol himself ) .
And they are trying hard to move the United States closer to war with Iran .
Palestine : Amnesty International diagnoses collective punishment
Amnesty International reacted to Israel ’s decision June 17 to allow more civilian goods into Gaza by condemning that nation ’s continuing siege of 1.4 million Gazans as collective punishment .
Quoted by IMEMC News , Amnesty spokesperson Malcolm Smart called upon Israel to “ comply with its obligations as the occupying power under international law . ”
He criticized Israel also for destroying Gaza ’s economy through barriers placed on exports of goods and free movement of residents .
Interference with Gazans seeking medical care outside the enclave was seen as particularly odious , a point reinforced by the World Health Organization ’s condemnation the next day of non-functioning medical equipment at Gaza City ’s Ash - Shifa Hospital .
The blockade excludes spare parts and servicing engineers .
Cambodia : Garment workers plan big strike
Despite Labor Minister Vong
Soth ’s plea two weeks earlier to delay strike action pending completion of negotiations , the Free Trade Union of Workers , representing 86,000 garment workers , on June 15 announced a three - day strike in mid-July .
The union is demanding a monthly minimum wage increase from $ 50 to $ 70 , according to phnompenhpost.com .
Union head Chea Mony asserted , “ All the workers should raise their voices in order to achieve a reasonable salary and better conditions for work . ”
An Interior Ministry spokesperson warned of legal consequences if the strike leads to violence .
The potential strike is also aimed at supporting 87 workers unable to work at the Tack Fat garment factory following their refusal to accept in - factory job transfers .
Uzbekistan : Summit promotes Russia - China cooperation
The June 11 summit meeting in Tashkent of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) was the occasion for solidifying relations between Russia and China .
In their third encounter this year , Presidents Hu Jintao and Dmitri Medvedev reaffirmed plans for humanitarian and cultural exchanges , widened commercial ties , and Medvedev ’s upcoming visit to China .
SCO member nations China , Russia , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan agreed to new internal administrative measures and to procedures for admitting new member states .
The summit reaffirmed collective efforts aimed at dealing with the world economic crisis and promoting regional stability and economic development .
Representatives of Mongolia , India , Pakistan and Iran attended as observers .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an invited guest .
Angola :
Oil riches fuel social gains
A recent nationwide survey , undertaken by the government and UNICEF and reported by Afrol News on June 15 , showed progress toward five of eight Millennium Development Goals : malnutrition ; education ; gender balance ; child survival and malaria ; and HIV / AIDS .
Since 2002 , malnutrition is down 12 points to 23 percent , and 76 percent of age - appropriate children attend school , although primary school completion rates lag .
Maternal mortality remains high , and only 42 percent of people have access to safe drinking water , a backward step .
Angola , ranking 143rd out of 158 nations in the UN 2009 Human Development Report is criticized for corruption in oil income distribution .
Some 30 percent of governmental spending , derived overwhelmingly from oil exports , is now dedicated to social programs .
Honduras : Violence mounts
Outside Tegucigalpa on June 14 , gunmen killed television reporter Luis Arturo Mondragon , the ninth journalist killed this year .
Attempts on her life forced television journalist Karol Cabrera to escape to Canada a week earlier .
Amidst agitation by public sector workers for wage increases and a national minimum wage , two men gunned down Oscar Molina , a beverage union leader ’s brother - in - law , on June 10 .
In mid-June , gunfire spared labor leaders Carolina Pineda and José Luis Baquedano , the latter active with the National Resistance Front .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier in June had urged Latin American leaders to accept the present government , successor to that of coup - deposed Manuel Zaleya , a “ left - leaning president , ” according to The New York Times .
Iceland : Fraud investigators have worldwide beat
Following collapse of the Icelandic Banks Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir in 2008 , proprietors and directors have lived abroad .
Parliament last month blamed them for extracting “ inappropriate loans from the banks , ” reported estrategumtrading.com on June 14 .
Alleging theft of $ 2 billion , Glitner Bank liquidation overseers are suing former bank officers for fraud in a New York court .
They are also targeting auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for obscuring fraudulent transactions .
The worldwide assets of former bank director Jon Asgeir Johannesson have been frozen , among them two top- end New York City condominiums worth $ 25 million .
And former President Sigurdur Einarsson of Kaupthing Bank “ does not intend to return to Iceland so they can arrest him , ” preferring instead to reply on rights afforded him in Great Britain .

African and U.S. officials reaffirmed their support this week for the African Union - led battle against al Shabaab , the Islamist militant group that controls much of Somalia .
But these international efforts are being hobbled as African troops come under criticism for indiscriminately shelling Somali civilians .
The battle to bring stability to long - lawless Somalia , and to win the sympathy of its people , has played out in a giant open - air market in Mogadishu , where Somalis who buy vegetables , spaghetti , clothing and fuel are ...
The U.S. attorney for Arizona does n't like the state 's new immigration law , and in fact , is part of the Department of Justice lawsuit challenging its legality .
Dennis Burke says border enforcement is the better way to fight illegal immigration .
But while Burke 's office wo n't play a role in the criminal prosecution of Senate Bill 1070 violators if the law goes into effect Thursday , he does expect his employees to be advocates for anyone who feels their rights were violated as part of its enforcement .
Supporters of the law say its wording prohibits racial profiling , while opponents say its ambiguity opens the door for the possibility that minorities will be targeted .
Arizona 's immigration law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It states that an officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
Burke plans to use his civil - rights division to prosecute complaints of racial profiling stemming from the new law .
Burke 's office has no investigatory abilities , but he and his staff are encouraging anyone who believes their civil rights have been violated to contact the FBI at 602-279-5511 .
The FBI would investigate the allegations and then the U.S. Attorney 's Office could file federal charges against any individual or law - enforcement agency that discriminates based on race , color , sex , disability , religion or national origin .
Burke also is taking on the law itself .
He works for Attorney General Eric Holder and is part of the Department of Justice , which was one of seven groups to file lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of SB 1070 .
He was among the half - dozen federal attorneys at the table for last week 's court hearing and the only one Judge Susan Bolton greeted personally - even before acknowledging the presence of Gov. Jan Brewer .
" I have the authority to bring any and all federal charges in the district of Arizona , " Burke said .
" My main task is to defend the federal government in court in Arizona . "
The Department of Justice asked Bolton to prevent the law from going into effect Thursday .
Bolton has not yet issued a ruling .
Burke calls the law " unconstitutional , unworkable , unfunded and confusing . "
He agrees that the federal government needs to do more to combat illegal immigration .
But he said SB 1070 is the wrong way for Arizona to respond and instead touts his office 's efforts .
He said there was a time when the office had to turn down cases that dealt with less than 500 pounds of marijuana or illegal immigrants without serious felony records trying to come back into the U.S.
Not anymore , Burke said .
He said he has added 11 prosecutors to the Tucson office in the past year to allow for more prosecution of border - enforcement and immigration cases .
He said his office has improved its relationship with Mexico , increasing the number of crime suspects extradited to the U.S. , working more with Mexican officials on joint investigations and training Mexican prosecutors to better prosecute their own criminals .
He said his office has also started paying more attention to the guns and money traveling from the U.S. to Mexico instead of just targeting drugs and people being trafficked in the opposite direction .
" We 've been confiscating millions of dollars in ways we have n't done before , " Burke said .
" That , more than anything , takes out a drug cartel . "

TORONTO – Two Air Canada passengers were pulled from their Orlando - bound flight before takeoff from Toronto ’s Pearson Airport after another passenger spotted them watching video of the 9/11 terror attacks .
QMI Agency columnist Joe Warmington , on his way to cover the Conrad Black story in Florida , was on the same plane when another passenger alerted the flight crew after spotting the young boy watching video on his iPod of the planes smashing into the World Trade Centre , just before the plane took off for U.S. airspace .
“ Other passengers and our crew became concerned , ” Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick told the Sun Wednesday .
“ The passengers were deplaned and following an investigation allowed to travel ( Wednesday ) morning .

Men in some communities are being forced into marriage because their families suspect they are gay or bisexual , the government has revealed .
The Forced Marriage Unit ( FMU ) says there has been a surge in such cases .
Over the past year , the number of calls from men to the unit increased by 65 % , from 134 in 2008 to 220 in 2009 .
Experts believe the figures are only the " tip of the iceberg " , as the issue tends to be under - reported for both sexes .
In all , 1,682 forced marriages were reported to the FMU – a joint Home Office / Foreign Office body – last year .
Of those , the calls suggest , 14 % involved a man being forced into a union .
But the unit believes the true figure may be as high as one in five .
Most victims are aged from 15 to 24 , but the FMU recently received a call to its helpline from a 62 - year - old widower whose family was trying to force him to marry a 35 - year - old woman because they no longer wanted to care for him .
Cases also include an underaged man taken to Pakistan and forcibly engaged to his five - year - old cousin .
Most calls come from men linked to Pakistan , followed by India and Bangladesh .
But it has also received calls from British men with links to the Middle East , Africa and eastern Europe .
According to the FMU , such incidents traditionally increase during the summer , when holidays abroad are taken .
" Professionals and communities can be very intolerant towards men being forced into marriage , even if they have learnt to be sympathetic to women in the same situation , " said the spokesman for the FMU .
" It can be hard to persuade people to believe it even happens . "
" But the threats to these young men are very real .
We received a call recently from a young man taken to Pakistan .
He did n't know he was going to be married , and when he refused , he was locked in a room .
Every day , his father came in to beat him – we 're talking broken legs and sexual abuse . "
While the vast majority ( 86 % ) of victims it sees are female , the FMU says men are being forced into marriage because they are gay or bisexual , or because their families suspect that they are .
It can also be a result of family commitments to relatives abroad or their own expectations , securing visas or an attempt to control their son's behaviour or protect a family 's reputation .
" This kind of abuse must not be tolerated , " said Lynne Featherstone , the equalities minister .
Just two weeks ago , the FMU took a call from a young man living in Leicester whose family had locked him in his bedroom after discovering that he was gay .
He told the FMU that his family were downstairs , discussing whether they should take him to India and either kill him , abandon him there or marry him off .
The Albert Kennedy Trust , a charity for homeless lesbian , gay , bisexual and transsexual young people , recently reported a rise in the number of young gay Muslims contacting it for help .
By the end of May , there had been 88 calls to the FMU from men for help .
" Boys and men who are forced into marriage find it harder to ask for help than women , " said Jeremy Browne , the Foreign Office minister for consular policy .
" Of course , women make up the majority of forced marriage victims , and over 1,400 reports of women facing this abuse were dealt with by the FMU last year .
But people often do n't realise that men can be victims of forced marriage too . "
Men and women who have been forced into marriage , or who fear they are about to be forced , can apply for a forced marriage protection order .
Since their introduction in 2008 , more than 150 orders , which can also be applied for by others acting on a person 's behalf , have been taken out .
Workers for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Service prepare to net an oiled pelican in Barataria Bay , Louisiana , last Saturday ( Image : Petty Officer 2nd Class John Miller / US Coast Guard )
Brown pelicans dripping with oil are quickly becoming the poster children of the ongoing Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
As oil slicks continue to lap at the pelicans ’ breeding grounds in coastal Louisiana , armies of wildlife rehabilitators are frantically trying to catch and scrub the contaminated birds clean .
What does it all mean for the long - term survival of the species – just months after they were taken off the US endangered species list ?
How endangered is the brown pelican ?
The species as a whole is n’t about to go extinct as a result of the oil spill : as 400,000 out of a total global population of 650,000 live in Peru .
Roughly 60 per cent of the subspecies Pelecanus occidentalis carolinensis breed along the Gulf coast , where many nest on the barrier islands off Louisiana that have already been exposed to oil .

The slicks threaten the birds and their fragile wetland habitat only a few months after brown pelicans were removed from the US federal endangered and threatened species list in November last year .
The birds had been on the list since 1970 after the pesticide DDT poisoned and nearly wiped out pelicans across the country .
At the time Louisiana , where the pelican is the official state bird , lost its entire population .
After years of resettling individual birds from Atlantic coast populations , Louisiana was able to boast the largest brown pelican population of any Gulf state , with 16,000 nesting pairs in 2004 .
Will the spill cause brown pelican populations to crash and require them to be relisted ?
It ’s still too early to say , simply because no one knows how much oil will have been spilt by the time the leak is finally plugged .
The US Endangered Species
Act requires federal biologists to keep close tabs on pelican populations for the first five years after delisting .
If populations drop significantly in the Gulf , brown pelicans could be relisted , even if populations along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts remain stable .
“ It is n’t rocket science , ” says Roger Helm , chief of environmental quality for the US Fish and Wildlife Service .
“ If you have a small population and you whack it hard , there is going to be a significant impact . ”
How are oiled birds rescued from the spill and cleaned ?
Only a small fraction of oiled birds are ever found – many die at sea or on remote shores .
Those that are found and can be approached are covered with vegetable oil to loosen up the crude oil before being cleaned with dishwashing liquid .
Wildlife rehabilitators continually make subtle tweaks to this process to try to increase survival rates , such as minimising stress with the help of improved enclosures and longer rest periods .
Birds are also given water and electrolytes while they are cleaned to keep them hydrated .
Those thought to have swallowed oil may be given coal or indigestion medication to reduce the amount of oil absorbed by their digestive system .
Do the cleaned birds stand a chance of survival or should they be killed humanely ?
The International Bird Research Rescue Center , one of two organisations heading up the treatment of oiled birds in the Gulf , claims that 50 to 80 per cent of the birds treated survive at least to the point of where they can be released back into the wild .
This is a major improvement from just 4 per cent during the organisation ’s first oil spill response in 1971 .
The survival rate following release is more difficult to determine and is subject to controversy .
The biologist Silvia Gaus recently called for oiled birds to be killed humanely , claiming 99 per cent of released animals die within days or a few weeks due to stress or kidney and liver damage from ingesting oil .
But several reports , including a pair of recent small - scale radio - tracking studies , suggest cleaned birds have a good chance of long - term survival even compared with birds that were never oiled .
Survival prospects also vary depending on the species and spill conditions .
What will happen to the pelicans once they are released ?
The US Fish and Wildlife Service is releasing rehabilitated pelicans on Florida ’s Atlantic coast .
Federal biologists hope the birds will remain in their new locations as reintroduced birds from the Atlantic coast formed new colonies in Louisiana in recent decades .
While this may work for young birds , breeding adults are likely to make their way back to their nest sites and , depending on how quickly they return , they could be exposed to oil once again .
To ensure the long - term survival of brown pelicans along the Gulf coast , significant work may be needed in coming years to restore the wetlands and fisheries that the birds depend on for breeding and feeding .
At the time of posting 442 oiled birds had been captured and roughly a dozen brown pelicans had been released while a large number remained in holding pens .
What are the costs of the rehabilitation programme , and who foots the bill ?
Figures from the clean - up of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill put the cost at $ 15,000 per marine bird for a total of 627 birds released .
This covers building rehabilitation centres , staff and helicopters and private boats .
The cost of caring for wildlife after recent oil spills has amounted to roughly 1 per cent of the total clean - up costs .
Police arrested a worker at an Oklahoma City bar this month after a fight caused most of a man ’s nose to be severed , according to a police report released Monday .
The man ’s injuries are not life - threatening , police said .
Adan Abraham Zapata , 32 , of Oklahoma City , is accused of using a 34 - inch sword to slash a patron of the El Ausente bar on April 3 , the report states .
Zapata was booked into jail on complaints of assault with a deadly weapon and destroying private property and since has been released on bail , jail records show .
The victim and some friends were playing pool at the bar at 7317 NW 10 about 7:20 p.m. April 3 when Zapata and the group got in a confrontation , according to the report .
Zapata told the men to leave and followed them into the parking lot .
Zapata stood behind the group ’s car and hit it with the sword as the people tried to leave , the report states .
One of the bar patrons got out of the car in an attempt to stop him , and Zapata cut him on his shoulder , nose and finger by slashing him with the sword , police said .
Zapata told police he was the owner of the bar , but other employees said he had only been working there for several months , according to the report .
Officers could not find the part of the nose that was cut off , the police report states .

How much hotter is Venus than Earth ?
( Not as much as you might first suppose )
by Roger Bourke White Jr. , copyright May 2006
Introduction
Venus has a reputation for being hot , really hot !
And the reputation is well deserved .
Its surface temperature is roughly 750 degrees Kelvin ( 500C , 900 F ) which is hot enough to melt lead .
That 's hot , all right !
But that is comparing surface temperatures between Earth and Venus , and there are other ways of comparing temperatures .
One of those is comparing the atmospheric temperatures .
Comparing atmospheric temperatures is useful if you want to know how much difference there is in the greenhouse effect between Earth and Venus .
Greenhouse effect is the warming of a planet ’s surface caused by the difference in the way atmospheres treat light radiation and infrared radiation .
Light can pass through greenhouse gases without being affected , infrared radiation gets blocked .
It ’s like the difference between seeing the sun a sunny day and a cloudy day -- for infrared , carbon dioxide always acts like cloudy .
So the light part of sunlight can penetrate to the earth ’s surface quickly and easily and warm it , but the infrared created by this warmed earth ’s surface is much slower at leaving .
This causes the greenhouse effect temperature rise .
Greenhouse effect is in the news in the 2010 ’s because it is part of the climate change controversy .
And related , popular science writers tell us that runaway greenhouse effect is the main culprit behind Venus 's blazing hot surface temperature compared to Earth's .
But is that really so ?
How much more is the greenhouse effect on Venus than on Earth ?
To answer these questions , you have to compare atmospheric temperatures .
Comparing Atmospheres
Venus 's atmosphere is hotter than Earth's , but it is also thicker and composed mostly of carbon dioxide rather than nitrogen ( the pressure of nitrogen in both atmospheres is close to the same ) .
Being mostly carbon dioxide has little direct effect on the temperature , but being thick has a lot of effect .
Venus 's atmosphere has 93 times Earth 's pressure at the planet 's surface , and that high pressure affects the temperature , a lot .
That high - pressure atmosphere means that comparing Earth 's surface temperature to Venus 's surface temperature is an apples - to - oranges comparison when you are talking about how hot the two atmospheres are .
A more apples - to - apples comparison of atmospheres is to compare Venus 's air temperature at the 1 Bar level ( 50 KM above the surface ) to Earth 's temperature at the 1 Bar level ( at the surface ) .
Earth 's average surface temperature is 288 Kelvin while Venus 's 1 Bar temperature is 360 Kelvin .
Venus 's atmosphere is hotter than Earth 's by 72 degrees Celsius ( 72C/161 F ) .
This is quite a bit smaller than the roughly 500 degree difference in surface temperatures , but not even all of this is caused by runaway greenhouse effect .
( this information about Venus ' 1 Bar temperature comes from the NASA site Tables of Atmospheric Parameters for the Planets with thanks to Lyle Huber )
A still more apples - to - apples comparison is to factor out the temperature rise due to the extra solar radiation Venus gets .
Venus ’s position closer to the sun allows it to get 1.9 times more radiation than Earth does .
If you were to set Venus 's atmospheric temperature high enough for it to lose radiation at 1.9 times Earth 's rate , what temperature would you have to take it to ?
( Let ’s continue to use the 1 Bar level for this question . )
To find out , you use the Stefan - Boltzmann law .
That law states that the energy radiated by a planet ( any " black body " , actually ) will equal a constant , “ sigma " , times the temperature forth - powered ( E radiated = Sigma * T^4 ( Kelvin ) ) .
Note that radiation goes up as the fourth power of temperature , so the planet temperature does not have to rise much to double its radiation rate .
Earth 's average surface temperature is 288 K , so Venus 's 1 Bar temperature , to radiate off the extra solar energy , would have to rise to 340K .
360 K is actual temperature of Venus at 1 Bar. So 20C/68 F ( 360 K - 340K ) is how much of Venus 's excess heat is due to having more greenhouse effect , and all other miscellaneous effects , than Earth does .
Only 20 degrees , the difference between a freezing winter day and a comfortable summer day on Earth .
That 's a long way from the 500C degrees of difference that comes from comparing surface temperatures .
Let ’s summarize those differences .
Earth 's surface is at 288 K and Venus 's surface is at 755K .
To get Venus 's temperature down to Earth 's temperature take out :
• 386 degrees for adiabatic expansion from 93 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere ( the cooling that happens as the pressure of a gas drops )
• 52 degrees for Venus 's extra solar radiation
• 20 degrees for Greenhouse effect , and all other plus and minus effects ( such as thick cloud cover )
It turns out that most of Venus 's " extra " surface heat is due to the adiabatic compression caused by the high pressure , the next most is caused by extra solar radiation , and greenhouse effect is a distant third .
The implications of this temperature analysis
First , we Earthlings need not fear that a runaway greenhouse effect is going to stoke Earth 's surface to 700 + degrees Kelvin , like Venus 's is now .
That will only happen if Earth 's atmospheric pressure at the surface rises dramatically , and that will happen only if the surface temperature rises high enough for the surface to start baking carbon dioxide out of limestone -- basically , having the surface act like a planet - wide lime kiln .
Second , whatever caused Venus to end up with such a different atmosphere from Earth 's must have taken place at much lower temperatures and pressures than Venus is currently experiencing .
Once again , whatever caused the difference between Earth and Venus either had to prevent Venus 's calcium deposits from steadily absorbing the atmosphere 's carbon dioxide and becoming limestone , or had to reverse that process later in the planet 's history ( the lime kiln effect I just talked about ) .
One difference between Earth and Venus is plate tectonics .
Perhaps Earth 's plate tectonics steadily cycled calcium up to the surface , and Venus 's surface never had a similar effect .
Or , you can look at this difference from the reverse point of view : Earth had something special happen in its early history that allowed a lot of calcium oxide to come in contact with a lot of carbon dioxide and steadily leech it from the atmosphere .
Perhaps the early oceans of Earth allowed this to happen , and Venus had no comparable early oceans .
Third , Venus can be looked upon as a " gas giant core " .
Venus is a gas giant type planet , except that it lacks the thick covering of hydrogen and helium that make up most of the atmosphere of the outer gas giant planets .
Perhaps the heat of the inner solar system kept that final step of collecting a huge gas covering from happening , perhaps something else .
Had Venus collected a thick blanket of hydrogen and helium , the surface temperature would be even hotter , and that high surface temperature would have allowed the hydrogen to chemically combine with both the nitrogen and the carbon dioxide .
The result would have been large quantities of ammonia , methane , and water , which are the constituents of the clouds of the outer gas giants .
It is likely that the outer gas giants got their clouds of ammonia , methane , and water by having their hydrogen mix with carbon dioxide and nitrogen at a furnace - hot rocky core surface similar to Venus's .
In Conclusion
Venus 's atmosphere is hotter than Earth's , but the part of that excess heat that is due to Venus having more greenhouse effect than Earth is only about 20 degrees .
The rest of the difference is due to the high pressure of the atmosphere at the surface and the more intense radiation Venus receives from the sun .
Runaway greenhouse effect does not explain how Venus came to be Venus and Earth came to be Earth .
We need to look elsewhere to explain that difference .
We also need to be aware that Venus 's planetary evolution may be the more average case and Earth 's evolution is the exception .
It may be that in most star systems , the inner planets are either Mars / Mercury / Moon style with vanishingly thin atmospheres , or Venus types with thick atmospheres , and medium thick Earth types come up only when the circumstances are very special .
PS
This essay was inspired by a rather unusual chain of thought .
In 2005 I went to see that science disaster movie , Day After Tomorrow , about an Instant Ice Age befalling Earth .
In it , the chief scientist claims that at the center of a huge hurricane - like storm , stratospheric air is falling straight to the Earth 's surface and producing a deadly insta-freeze .
" Ha ! " thinks I , “ that would never happen because the stratospheric air would warm as it compresses , and actually come to the surface hotter than the air that was currently there ! "
A year later , I put this line of thought together with Venus and came up with the foundation for this essay .
This essay lead to the essay on the “ ooze zone ” in gas giants , and that essay lead to the “ Pressure Point ” story in Honeycomb Comet .
Where threads of science thinking can lead to is fascinating .

Just as May ’s jobs report appeared deceptively robust , swollen by 411,000 workers hired by the federal government to help with the Census , so the June report appears deceptively anemic , as the government shed 225,000 of those workers .
Signs of strength could be spotted .
The 83,000 private sector jobs created in June more than doubled the count in May .
In the first six months of 2009 , the nation lost 3.7 million private sector jobs ; during the first six months of this year it gained 590,000 .
Manufacturing continued a modest revival , as plants added 9,000 jobs , bringing the total for such jobs to 136,000 since January ( manufacturing shed two million jobs early in this recession ) .
Amusement , gambling and recreation businesses added 28,000 .
Health care inched up 9,000 , for a 12 - month gain of 217,000 jobs .
And professional firms continued to add temporary workers , 21,000 last month .
In past recessions , such hiring often was a precursor of permanent hires .
President Obama offered restrained applause for the jobs report even as he acknowledged the economy remained weak .
“ Make no mistake  we are headed in the right direction , ” Mr. Obama told reporters before boarding Air Force One to fly to West Virginia for the funeral of Senator Robert C. Byrd .
“ We ’re not headed there fast enough for a lot of Americans .
We ’re not headed there fast enough for me either . ”
Indeed , the economy needs to add about 130,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with new workers entering the market .
The labor pool is packed with 15 million Americans looking for work , and state and local governments cut another 10,000 jobs in June , cuts likely to accelerate this summer .
The weeks leading up to Friday ’s report offered a grim rat - a - tat - tat of statistics pointing to a slowing economy .
Auto sales fell , housing sales plunged and unemployment claims rose to a peak higher than is normal for an economic recovery .
Some people whose iPhones have developed problems say they have been accused of damaging them and that Apple has refused to pay for repairs .
The Apple user guide states that if your phone has been damaged by water then it 's not serviceable .
But some people told the BBC's Watchdog programme that their broken phones had not suffered water damage .
Apple told Watchdog the following :
" If an iPhone has been damaged by liquid , the service or replacement is not covered by the Apple one year limited warranty or an AppleCare Protection Plan ( APP ) .
It would be eligible for Out Of Warranty Service .
Currently , if a customer takes their iPhone to an Apple Retail Store , the warranty will only be void due to liquid damage if all indicators have been triggered . "
A wordy headline , to be sure , but a pleasing one nonetheless .
We came across HTC's Chinese web portal listing the Desire as coming with Android 2.2 ( with Sense ! ) and simply had to ping the official source for confirmation .
It turns out the info up there is no mistake : all HTC Android handsets shipping to China -- which includes the Wildfire and Tianyi -- will do so with Froyo preloaded , cutting down on your upgrade angst at least until the Gingerbread man comes a'knocking .
HTC has also reiterated that a 2.2 update for its phones already on the market will be delivered " very soon , " so if all goes well , we should be looking at a Froyo - dominated August in the land of High Tech Computers .

The recent decoding of a cryptic cup , the excavation of ancient Jerusalem tunnels , and other archaeological detective work may help solve one of the great biblical mysteries :
Who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls ?
The new clues hint that the scrolls , which include some of the oldest known biblical documents , may have been the textual treasures of several groups , hidden away during wartime — and may even be " the great treasure from the Jerusalem Temple , " which held the Ark of the Covenant , according to the Bible .
The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered more than 60 years ago in seaside caves near an ancient settlement called Qumran .
The conventional wisdom is that a breakaway Jewish sect called the Essenes — thought to have occupied Qumran during the first centuries B.C. and A.D. — wrote all the parchment and papyrus scrolls .
But new research suggests many of the Dead Sea Scrolls originated elsewhere and were written by multiple Jewish groups , some fleeing the circa - A.D. 70 Roman siege that destroyed the legendary Temple in Jerusalem .
" Jews wrote the Scrolls , but it may not have been just one specific group .
It could have been groups of different Jews , " said Robert Cargill , an archaeologist who appears in the documentary Writing the Dead Sea Scrolls , which airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET / PT on the National Geographic Channel .
( The National Geographic Channel is part - owned by the National Geographic Society , which owns National Geographic News . )
The new view is by no means the consensus , however , among Dead Sea Scrolls scholars .
" I have a feeling it 's going to be very disputed , " said Lawrence Schiffman , a professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University ( NYU ) .
Dead Sea Scrolls Written by Ritual Bathers ?
In 1953 , a French archaeologist and Catholic priest named Roland de Vaux led an international team to study the mostly Hebrew scrolls , which a Bedouin shepherd had discovered in 1947 .
De Vaux concluded that the scrolls ' authors had lived in Qumran , because the 11 scroll caves are close to the site .
Ancient Jewish historians had noted the presence of Essenes in the Dead Sea region , and de Vaux argued Qumran was one of their communities after his team uncovered numerous remains of pools that he believed to be Jewish ritual baths .
His theory appeared to be supported by the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves , some of which contained guidelines for communal living that matched ancient descriptions of Essene customs .
" The scrolls describe communal dining and ritual bathing instructions consistent with Qumran 's archaeology , " explained Cargill , of the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) .
Dead Sea Scrolls : " Great Treasure From the Temple " ?
Recent findings by Yuval Peleg , an archaeologist who has excavated Qumran for 16 years , are challenging long - held notions of who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls .
Artifacts discovered by Peleg 's team during their excavations suggest Qumran once served as an ancient pottery factory .
The supposed baths may have actually been pools to capture and separate clay .
And on Jerusalem 's Mount Zion , archaeologists recently discovered and deciphered a two - thousand - year - old cup with the phrase " Lord , I have returned " inscribed on its sides in a cryptic code similar to one used in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls .
To some experts , the code suggests that religious leaders from Jerusalem authored at least some of the scrolls .
" Priests may have used cryptic texts to encode certain texts from nonpriestly readers , " Cargill told National Geographic News .
According to an emerging theory , the Essenes may have actually been Jerusalem Temple priests who went into self - imposed exile in the second century B.C. , after kings unlawfully assumed the role of high priest .
This group of rebel priests may have escaped to Qumran to worship God in their own way .
While there , they may have written some of the texts that would come to be known as the Dead Sea Scrolls .
The Essenes may not have abandoned all of their old ways at Qumran , however , and writing in code may have been one of the practices they preserved .
It 's possible too that some of the scrolls were n't written at Qumran but were instead spirited away from the Temple for safekeeping , Cargill said .
" I think it dramatically changes our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls if we see them as documents produced by priests , " he says in the new documentary .
" Gone is the Ark of the Covenant .
We 're never going to find Noah 's Ark , the Holy Grail .
These things , we 're never going to see , " he added .
" But we just may very well have documents from the Temple in Jerusalem .
It would be the great treasure from the Jerusalem Temple . "
Dead Sea Scrolls From Far and Wide ?
Many modern archaeologists such as Cargill believe the Essenes authored some , but not all , of the Dead Sea Scrolls .
Recent archeological evidence suggests disparate Jewish groups may have passed by Qumran around A.D. 70 , during the Roman siege of Jerusalem , which destroyed the Temple and much of the rest of the city .
A team led by Israeli archaeologist Ronnie Reich recently discovered ancient sewers beneath Jerusalem .
In those sewers they found artifacts — including pottery and coins — that they dated to the time of the siege .
( Related : " Underground Tunnels Found in Israel Used In Ancient Jewish Revolt . " )
The finds suggest that the sewers may have been used as escape routes by Jews , some of whom may have been smuggling out cherished religious scrolls , according to Writing the Dead Sea Scrolls .
Importantly , the sewers lead to the Valley of Kidron .
From there it's only a short distance to the Dead Sea — and Qumran .
The jars in which the scrolls were found may provide additional evidence that the Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of disparate sects ' texts .
Jan Gunneweg of Hebrew University in Jerusalem performed chemical analysis on vessel fragments from the Qumran - area caves .
" We take a piece of ceramic , we grind it , we send it to a nuclear reactor , where it 's bombarded with neutrons , then we can measure the chemical fingerprint of the clay of which the pottery was made , " Gunneweg says in the documentary .
" Since there is no clay on Earth with the exact chemical composition — it is like DNA — you can point to a specific area and say this pottery was made here , that pottery was made over here . "
Gunneweg 's conclusion :
Only half of the pottery that held the Dead Sea Scrolls is local to Qumran .
Scroll Theory " Rejected by Everyone "
Not everyone agrees with the idea that Dead Sea Scrolls may hail from beyond Qumran .
" I do n't buy it , " said NYU 's Schiffman , who added that the idea of the scrolls being written by multiple Jewish groups from Jerusalem has been around since the 1950s .
" The Jerusalem theory has been rejected by virtually everyone in the field , " he said .
" The notion that someone brought a bunch of scrolls together from some other location and deposited them in a cave is very , very unlikely , " Schiffman added .
" The reason is that most of the [ the scrolls ] fit a coherent theme and hang together .
" If the scrolls were brought from some other place , presumably by some other groups of Jews , you would expect to find items that fit the ideologies of groups that are in disagreement with [ the Essenes ] .
And it 's not there , " said Schiffman , who dismisses interpretations that link some Dead Sea Scroll writings to groups such as the Zealots .
UCLA 's Cargill agrees with Schiffman that the Dead Sea Scrolls show " a tremendous amount of congruence of ideology , messianic expectation , interpretation of scripture , [ Jewish law ] interpretation , and calendrical dates .
" At the same time , " Cargill said , " it is difficult to explain some of the ideological diversity present within some of the scrolls if one argues that all of the scrolls were composed by a single sectarian group at Qumran . "
Caves Were for Temporary Scroll Storage ?
If Cargill and others are correct , it would mean that what modern scholars call the Dead Sea Scrolls are not wholly the work of isolated scribes .
Instead they may be the unrecovered treasures of terrified Jews who did not — or could not — return to reclaim what they entrusted to the desert for safekeeping .
" Whoever wrote them , the scrolls were considered scripture by their owners , and much care was taken to ensure their survival , " Cargill said .
Heidi has been writing comedy for over ten years and writing about herself in the third person for over ten minutes now .
She moved to London from Australia 11 years ago but that ’s neither here nor there .
Heidi has written in many formats but she never had the slightest interest in stand up , due to a lifelong fear of public speaking and bats ( bats are n’t related to stand up but it felt so cleansing to admit the first fear she wants to get all her fears off her chest now – her third and most recent fear is talking about herself in the first person ) .
However one day , she had a nice little horrifying 3 am realisation that she was not being very clever about her life or career strategy .
To distract her from addressing this , her brain instead suggested a load of jokes that would only work on stage .
But she still had the crippling stage fright to contend with .
However fate would step in as Heidi stumbled across this phenomenal piece of advice on the World Wide Internet …
Its sassy and hilarious use of the word ‘ ASS ’ got her attention and its no - nonsense reality check made her realise she had nothing to fear but fear itself , a phrase she came up with all on her own right there on the spot .
Heidi took a screen grab of the image ( she was n’t made of money ) and printed it at work to then stick on her wall .
The results were immediate !
Within a week she had done her first ever open mic and several colleagues had tried to give her £ 15.99 for the poster , assuming she had left the price in the screen grab because she must be selling it .
The stand up night was the most exhilarating , and bowel cleansing evening of her life and she never looked back , because this other poster had told her not to .
She now gigs regularly , all in the hope to one day earn enough money from stand up to buy this beautiful print because the thumbnail is too small to tell her what is written under ‘ possibilities ’ and she is pretty sure it ’s going to be beautiful .

Intellectuals , particularly academic intellectuals , tend to favor socialism and interventionism .
How was the American university transformed from a center of higher learning to an outpost for socialist - inspired culture and politics ?
As recently as the early 1950s , the typical American university professor held social and political views quite similar to those of the general population .
Today — well , you 've all heard the jokes that circulated after the collapse of central planning in Eastern Europe and the former USSR , how the only place in the world where Marxists were still thriving was the Harvard political science department .
More generally , US higher education often looks like a clear case of the inmates running the asylum .
That is , the students who were radicalized in the 1960s have now risen to positions of influence within colleges and universities .
One needs only to observe the aggressive pursuit of " diversity " in admissions and hiring , the abandonment of the traditional curriculum in favor of highly politicized " studies " based on group identity , the mandatory workshops on sensitivity training , and so on .
A 1989 study for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching used the categories " liberal " and " conservative . "
It found that 70 percent of the professors in the major liberal arts colleges and research universities considered themselves liberal or moderately liberal , with less than 20 percent identifying themselves as conservative or moderately conservative .
( Of course , the term " liberal " here means left - liberal or socialist , not classical liberal . )
Christopher Cardiff and Daniel Klein have recently examined academics ' political affiliations using voter - registration records for tenure - track faculty at 11 California universities .
They find an average Democrat : Republican ratio of 5:1 , ranging from 9:1 at Berkeley to 1:1 at Pepperdine .
The humanities average 10:1 , while business schools are at only 1.3:1 .
( Needless to say , even at the heartless , dog - eat - dog , sycophant - of - the - bourgeoisie business schools the ratio does n't dip below 1:1. )
While today 's Republicans are hardly anti-socialist — particularly on foreign policy — these figures are consistent with a widespread perception that university faculties are increasingly unrepresentative of the communities they supposedly serve .
Now here 's a surprise :
Even in my own discipline , economics , 63 percent of the faculty in the Carnegie study identified themselves as liberal , compared with 72 percent in anthropology , political science , and sociology , 76 percent in ethnic studies , history , and philosophy , and 88 percent in public affairs .
The Cardiff and Klein study finds an average D:R ratio in economics departments of 2.8:1 — lower than the sociologists ' 44:1 , to be sure , but higher than that of biological and chemical engineering , electrical engineering , computer science , management , marketing , accounting , and finance .
A survey of American Economic Association members , examined by Daniel Klein and Charlotta Stern , finds that most economists support safety regulations , gun control , redistribution , public schooling , and anti-discrimination laws .
Another survey , reported in the Southern Economic Journal , reveals that " 71 percent of American economists believe the distribution of income in the US should be more equal , and 81 percent feel that the redistribution of income is a legitimate role for government .
Support for these positions is even stronger among economists with academic affiliations , and stronger still among economists with elite academic affiliations . "
Why do so many university professors — and intellectuals more generally — favor socialism and interventionism ?
F. A. Hayek offered a partial explanation in his 1949 essay " The Intellectuals and Socialism . "
Hayek asked why " the more active , intelligent and original men among [ American ] intellectuals … most frequently incline toward socialism . "
His answer is based on the opportunities available to people of varying talents .
Academics tend to be highly intelligent people .
Given their leftward leanings , one might be tempted to infer from this that more intelligent people tend to favor socialism .
However , this conclusion suffers from what empirical researchers call " sample selection bias . "
Intelligent people hold a variety of views .
Some are lovers of liberty , defenders of property , and supporters of the " natural order " — i.e. , defenders of the market .
Others are reformers , wanting to remake the world according to their own visions of the ideal society .
Hayek argues that exceptionally intelligent people who favor the market tend to find opportunities for professional and financial success outside the Academy ( i.e. , in the business or professional world ) .
Those who are highly intelligent but ill - disposed toward the market are more likely to choose an academic career .
For this reason , the universities come to be filled with those intellectuals who were favorably disposed toward socialism from the beginning .
This also leads to the phenomenon that academics do n't know much about how markets work , since they have so little experience with them , living as they do in their subsidized ivory towers and protected by academic tenure .
As Joseph Schumpeter explained in Capitalism , Socialism , and Democracy , it is " the absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs " that distinguishes the academic intellectual from others " who wield the power of the spoken and the written word . "
This absence of direct responsibility leads to a corresponding absence of first - hand knowledge of practical affairs .
The critical attitude of the intellectual arises , says Schumpeter , " no less from the intellectual 's situation as an onlooker — in most cases also as an outsider — than from the fact that his main chance of asserting himself lies in his actual or potential nuisance value . "
Hayek 's account is incomplete , however , because it does n't explain why academics have become more and more interventionist throughout the twentieth century .
As mentioned above , during the first half of the twentieth century university faculty members tended to hold political views similar to those held by the general population .
What caused the change ?
To answer , we must realize first that academics receive many direct benefits from the welfare state , and that these benefits have increased over time .
Excluding student financial aid , public universities receive about 50 percent of their funding from federal and state governments , dwarfing the 18 percent they receive from tuition and fees .
Even " private " universities like Stanford or Harvard receive around 20 percent of their budgets from federal grants and contracts .
If you include student financial aid , that figure rises to almost 50 percent .
According to the US Department of Education , about a third of all students at public , 4 - year colleges and universities , and half the students at private colleges and universities , receive financial aid from the federal government .
In this sense , the most dramatic example of " corporate welfare " in the US is the GI Bill , which subsidized the academic sector , bloating it far beyond the level the market would have provided .
The GI Bill , signed by President Roosevelt in 1944 to send returning soldiers to colleges and universities , cost taxpayers $ 14.5 billion between 1944 and 1956 .
Federal spending on the latest version , the Montgomery GI Bill , is projected at $ 3.2 billion in 2006 alone .
To see why this government aid is so important to the higher education establishment , we need only stop to consider for a moment what academics would do in a purely free society .
The fact is that most academics simply are n't that important .
In a free society , there would be far fewer of them than there are today .
Their public visibility would no doubt be quite low .
Most would be poorly paid .
Though some would be engaged in scholarly research , the vast majority would be teachers .
Their job would be to pass the collective wisdom of the ages along to the next generation .
In all likelihood , there would also be far fewer students .
Some students would attend traditional colleges and universities , but many more students would attend technical and vocational schools , where their instructors would be men and women with practical knowledge .
Today , many professors at major research universities do little teaching .
Their primary activity is research , though much of that is questionable as real scholarship .
One needs only to browse through the latest specialty journals to see what passes for scholarly research in most disciplines .
In the humanities and social sciences , it is likely to be postmodern gobbledygook ; in the professional schools , vocationally oriented technical reports .
Much of this research is funded in the United States by government agencies , such as the National Science Foundation , National Institutes of Health , the National Endowment for the Humanities , the USDA , and others .
The large universities have tens of thousands of students , themselves supported by government - subsidized loans and grants .
Beyond university life , academics also compete for prestigious posts within government agencies .
Consider my own field , economics .
The US federal government employs at least 3,000 economists — about 15 % of all members of the American Economic Association .
The Federal Reserve System itself employs several hundred .
There are also advisory posts , affiliations with important government agencies , memberships of federally appointed commissions , and other career - enhancing activities .
These benefits are not simply financial .
They are also psychological .
As Dwight Lee puts it :
Like every other group , academics like to exert influence and feel important .
Few scholars in the social sciences and humanities are content just to observe , describe , and explain society ; most want to improve society and are naive enough to believe that they could do so if only they had sufficient influence .
The existence of a huge government offers academics the real possibility of living out their reformist fantasies .
It 's clear , then , that there are many benefits , for academics , to living in a highly interventionist society .
It should be no wonder , then , that academics tend to support those interventions .
Economists , in particular , play active roles as government advisers , creating and sustaining the welfare state that now surrounds us .
Naturally , when government funds their research , economists in applied fields such as agricultural economics and monetary economics are unlikely to call for serious regulatory reform in their specialty areas .
Murray Rothbard devotes an interesting chapter of Man , Economy , and State , to the traditional role of the economist in public life .
Rothbard notes that the functions of the economist on the free market differ strongly from those of the economist on the hampered market .
" What can the economist do on the purely free market ? " Rothbard asks .
" He can explain the workings of the market economy ( a vital task , especially since the untutored person tends to regard the market economy as sheer chaos ) , but he can do little else . "
Furthermore , economists are not traditionally popular as policy advisors .
Economics teaches that resources are limited , that choices made imply opportunities forgone , that our actions can have unintended consequences .
This is typically not what government officials want to hear .
When they propose an import tariff to help domestic manufacturers , we economists explain that this protection will come only at the expense of domestic consumers .
When they suggest a minimum - wage law to raise the incomes of low - wage workers , we show that such a law hurts the very people it purports to help by forcing them out of work .
On and on it goes .
As each new generation of utopian reformers promises to create a better society , through government intervention , the economist stands athwart history , yelling " Remember the opportunity cost ! "
Over the last several decades , however , the role of the economist has expanded dramatically .
Partly for the reasons we discussed earlier , the welfare state has partly co-opted the profession of economics .
Just as a higher murder rate increases the demand for criminologists , so the growth of the welfare / regulatory state increases the demand for policy analysts , antitrust consultants , tax and regulatory experts , and various forecasters .
To some degree , the increasing professionalization of the economics business must share the blame for this change .
The economists ' premier professional society , the American Economic Association , was itself created as an explicitly " progressive " organization .
Its founder , the religious and social reformer Richard T. Ely , planned an association , he reported to a colleague , of " economists who repudiate laissez - faire as a scientific doctrine . "
The other founding members , all of whom had been trained in Germany under Gustav Schmoller and other members of the younger German Historical School — the so - called Socialists of the Chair — were similarly possessed with reformist zeal .
The constitution of the AEA still contains references to the " positive role of the church , the state and science in the solution of social problems by the ' development of legislative policy . ' "
Fortunately , the AEA subsequently distanced itself from the aims of its founders , although its annual distinguished lecture is still called the " Richard T. Ely lecture . "
If asked to select a single event that most encouraged the transformation of the average economist from a critic of intervention to a defender of the welfare state , I would name the Second World War .
To be sure , it was the Progressive Era that saw the permanent introduction of the income tax and the establishment of the Federal Reserve System .
And it was during the Great Depression that Washington , D.C. first began to employ a substantial number of economists , to join such central - planning organizations as the National Resources Planning Board .
Still , even in those years , the average economist favored free trade , low taxes , and sound money .
World War II , however , was a watershed event for the profession .
For the first time , professional economists joined the ranks of government planning bureaus en masse :
To control prices , as with the Office of Price Administration , led by Leon Henderson and later John Kenneth Galbraith .
This group included prominent " free - market " economists such as Herbert Stein and George Stigler .
To study military procurement ( what later became known as " operations research " ) with Columbia University 's Statistical Research Group ( including Stigler , Milton Friedman , Harold Hotelling , Abraham Wald , Leonard Savage ) , or with the Army 's Statistical Control Group , which was led by Tex Thornton , later president of Litton Industries , and his " Whiz Kids . "
The most famous Whiz Kid was Robert McNamara , Thornton 's leading protégé , who later applied the same techniques to the management of the Vietnam War .
Before World War II the primary language of economics , in the English - speaking world , was English .
Since then , however , economic theory has come to be expressed in obscure mathematical jargon , while economic history has become a branch of applied statistics .
It is common to attribute this change to the 1947 publication of Paul Samuelson 's mathematical treatise , Foundations of Economic Analysis , and to the development of computers .
These are no doubt important .
However , it is likely the taste of central planning that economists — even nominally free - market economists — got during World War II that forever changed the direction of the discipline .
What about other public figures , what Hayek called " second - hand dealers in ideas " — the journalists , book editors , high - school teachers , and other members of the " opinion - molding " class ?
First , intelligent and articulate liberals ( in the classical sense ) tend to go into business and the professions ( Hayek 's selection - bias argument ) .
Second , many journalists trade integrity for access ; few are brave enough to challenge the state , because they crave information , interviews , and time with state officials .
What does the future hold ?
It is impossible to say for sure , but there are encouraging signs .
The main reason is technology .
The web has challenged the state - university and state - media cartels as never before .
You do n't need a PhD to write for Wikipedia .
What does the rise of the new media , new means of sharing information , new ways of establishing authority and credibility , imply for universities as credential factories ?
Moreover , as universities become more vocationally oriented , they will find it hard to compete with specialized , technology - intensive institutions such as DeVry University and the University of Phoenix , the fastest - growing US universities .
Home schooling , the costs of which are greatly lowered by technology , is also on the rise .
And traditional media ( newspapers and network news ) are of course rapidly declining , and alternative news sources are flourishing .
The current crises in higher education and the media are probably good things , in the long run , if they force a rethinking of educational and intellectual goals and objectives , and take power away from the establishment institutions .
Then , and only then , we may see a rebirth of genuine scholarship , communication , and education .
Phoenix Motorcars just lived up to its namesake by rising from the ashes of its 2008 Chapter 11 filing to announce that they ’re back and not just that , they almost ready to start deliveries of the worlds first full - production electric SUV .
In an announcement at FedFleet 2010 ( July 13th - 15th ) Phoenix said ;
“ Phoenix Motorcars is proud to introduce the first all - wheel drive electric pickup truck ready for fleet procurement . ” stated Bryon Bliss , VP Sales and Marketing for Phoenix Motorcars .
“ The FedFleet 2010 conference provides an ideal opportunity to debut our enhanced Sports Utility Truck .
We will begin deliveries later this year . ”
This surprising news is a strong indication that Phoenix Motorcars are back , in a big way .

Fies started drawing his webcomic Mom's Cancer when his mother was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer .
" I wanted to share my family 's story , " he told me .
" I thought of it as drawing a map so that other people following along behind us and having similar experiences would know what to expect . "
He discovered that comics were the perfect medium to tell his story .
" I accompanied my mother to chemotherapy one day and drew a little sketch of her in the chair getting her chemotherapy .
I decided that in that one sketch I 'd somehow captured something essential to that day and to that moment that I would n't have been able to any other way .
Something about the combination of one picture with a few words told more than either the picture or the words alone would have been able to . "

Fies uses the tools of comics to illustrate metaphors in a literal way .
He drew his mother drowning in medical jargon , for example , and walking the tightrope that was balancing her medication .
" In comics I 'm able to apply these metaphors literally ... a unique application of a unique medium . "
Doctors , nurses and patients are increasingly using graphic art to unpack their experience of medicine and disease .
I attended the first ever academic conference on the subject Comics and Medicine : Medical Narrative in Graphic Novels last month at the University of London , where doctors , nurses , patients and comic book artists shared their experiences of medical themes in comic books .
The medical comic Rex Morgan , M.D .
Paul Gravett , a historian and promoter of comics , told me doctors have been playing roles in comics for a long time .
" One of the first that came out was called Rex Morgan , M.D. , one of these long - running , continuity , serialised daily strips in the American papers . "
It was created in 1948 by psychiatrist Nicolas P. Dallis under the pseudonym Dal Curtis .
In the 1950s , two comic books about doctors stood out : Psychoanalysis and MD , published by EC Comics .
In 1955 , when the two titles were first published , they were charting new territory for comics .
Until then no comic had dealt soberly and realistically with the medical profession and psychoanalysis .
They tapped into the public 's feeling of respect – bordering on awe – for doctors in 1950s America , and the hope that new areas of medicine could bring miracle cures .
Psychoanalysis comic book
" Right back when comics began over a hundred years ago , the envisaged readers were adults rather than children , " said Ian Williams , a GP and comic book artist who helped organise the conference .
" Then somewhere along the line they 've been kind of hijacked by people writing for teens and adolescents or children , and that has stuck . "
He said comics have had to battle for years against unfortunate stereotypes .
" But there was a watershed in the 1980s when serious , long , graphic novels started being produced , which have had great critical acclaim .
And over the last 10 years graphic novels have been reviewed in broadsheet newspapers and academic journals .
Now there 's a huge cohort of comics scholars who are looking at all forms of graphic narrative . "
At Penn State University Medical School , Michael Green teaches medical students how to make and appreciate comics .
" I think comics are relevant to medicine in a number of ways , " he said .
They can help students learn about the doctor - patient relationship , how to communicate bad news , informed consent , empathy and the experience of illness from a patient 's perspective .
Cancer Vixen graphic novel .
" There 's a growing number of adult - themed graphic stories which address medically relevant themes , " he said .
He singles out three that have recently been published : Mom 's Cancer ; Cancer Vixen , about a woman 's experience with breast cancer ; and Stitches by David Small , about recollections of a childhood experience with cancer .
" Each of these illustrates and writes about an important aspect of the illness experience . "
In 2005 , Mom 's Cancer won an Eisner award – the comic book industry 's equivalent of an Oscar – for " best digital comic " .
Fies said this professional recognition was " amazing " and the reaction from the medical community equally heart - warming .
Image : Brian Fies
" I got notes from nursing instructors in Australia who said they were using Mom 's Cancer to train their students , " said Fies .
" I got an email from a cancer physician in Arizona who invited me to come speak to his group , some of whom said they would change the way they did their jobs because of what I 'd written .
That 's immensely gratifying .
That 's huge !
That 's more impact than I expected to have on anything in my life . "
The web is spearheading a revolution in comics , allowing creators to reach a global readership .
MK Czerwiec , an HIV and hospice care nurse , was one of the first medical practitioners to publish her work , Comic Nurse , online , and collections are also published periodically in print .
Stitches by David Small .
Czerwiec has encouraged medical students to follow her lead and reflect on their experiences through comics .
" We did an exercise in which we asked students to draw a diagnosis as if they were a patient receiving it , and we also asked them to draw a different diagnosis as if they were a doctor giving it , " said Czerwiec .
" When they drew diagnoses as a doctor , they drew disembodied body parts , but when they drew as a patient they drew embodied experiences of illness , with reference to an emotional reaction and to their whole families and lives . "
She believes comics give the opportunity to tap into both the right and left sides of the brain for insight into an experience .
" Words can access one thing , but when you challenge yourself to make images you access something totally different .
It 's very powerful to put those two things together . "
Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary .
Comic artists are n't restricting themselves to physical illnesses , either .
Williams recommends a graphic novel by Justin Green about obsessive compulsive disorder .
" I must admit , it seems a little strange to tell a room full of doctors they should be reading Binky Brown meets the Holy Virgin Mary , " he said , " but I think the tide is turning . "
He believes medical comics are a valuable resource for educating healthcare professionals .
" I think they can be used as a window into the experience of that patient , " he said .
" I see healthcare professionals reading comics to get an idea of the ' patient experience ' – what it 's like to go through these illnesses . "
And their entertainment value should not be forgotten .
" I think these works are so superbly complex and subtle , I think they can be enjoyed over and over again ; they can be dissected or enjoyed ; read purely for the artwork or enjoyed on so many levels , " said Williams .
Gravett points out that not every kind of graphic novel is suitable for patients or family members .
" But there are graphic novels that are really going to be useful .
Something like Mom's Cancer really does answer a lot of key questions that people have when they first have cancer in the family . "
Adults ' instinctive aversion towards comics as a serious medium will change , he believes , " as people realise they simply are n't automatically kids ' stuff or humorous – that they can deal with [ medical issues ] very powerfully , and very effectively ...
It 's an extraordinarily rich language which we 're only just discovering and inventing , and learning to really exploit to its fullest . "

Final update to this post , 21 Aug 2010 .
On a serious note , I wanted to draw your attention to the news today about Dick Cheney ’s latest heart setback .
The reports have , on their face , been fairly upbeat , with Cheney himself issuing a statement about the surgery he had last week to implant a pump to help his heart overcome his congestive heart failure .
The surgery was a success , Cheney is resting comfortably , etc .
But reading between the lines , you ’re left with the distinct impression that Cheney , 69 , is entering the late stages of congestive heart failure , that his prognosis is not very good , and that the available treatment options are very limited .
That ’s my lay person rendering after a close read of this afternoon ’s reports .
Here ’s a more informed read from TPM Reader JK :
I ’m a surgeon and just read your wire story about Dick Cheney getting a Left Ventricular Assist Device ( LVAD ) placed .
The story downplays the seriousness of that procedures … once you ’ve got an LVAD in place , it means your heart is essentially incapable of working on its own and has no potential to improve .
While LVAD outcomes have been improving , and some patients live months or even years with one of these devices in place , this is a HUGE operation with MAJOR associated morbidity and mortality .
If he ’s not listed for a heart transplant , his days are seriously numbered .
Life on an LVAD is n’t something I ’d wish on my worst enemy … an axiom that this situation really tests .
He ’s in for a rough time .
We ’ve known for a long time that Cheney is suffering from serious heart disease .
He has known his fate and been upfront about it .
But it does appear that things have entered a new and more serious stage , even if he and everyone else knew it would come eventually .

The Gulf oil spill is the latest in a series of warnings that we must reduce our dependency on petroleum with an eye toward moving away from oil entirely .
While “ getting off oil ” remains a distant goal , we can choose to halt oil expansion today .
Technologies exist to improve the efficacy of biofuels and to stretch the availability of existing petroleum supplies through increased efficiency .
Rather than choosing more offshore drilling , we can choose demand - side innovation to meet our current energy needs without the risks associated with further oil expansion .
Biofuel , and biodiesel in particular , can help mitigate the need for additional oil supply .
According to Emerging Markets Online , total worldwide biodiesel production alone took off from 2.2 million tons in 2002 to an estimated 11.1 million tons in 2008 .
However , first generation biofuels will likely be limited to 10 - 20 percent of global liquid fuel consumption , largely due to constraints in feedstock and infrastructure .
Therefore , we must make the most of every gallon of biofuel .
Successfully doing so requires addressing a number of problems .
Biodiesel , for instance , presents several significant deficiencies when compared to diesel fuel .
Most significantly , biodiesel contains less energy value than petrodiesel , leading to increased fuel consumption and reduced engine power output .
Other problems include limited oxidation and storage stability , a tendency to form deposits , corrosion issues , cold flow problems and questionable stability from diverse feedstocks .
These limitations are greatly exacerbated with the increasing content of biodiesel in fuel blends , from B5 to B30 and higher .
These negative characteristics reduce biodiesel ’s overall green profile for efficiency and emissions .
Yet as a green product , biodiesel can be made significantly “ greener , ” by improving the fuel so that it performs more like regular diesel .
One way to help achieve this is through the use of already available fuel enhancing technologies .
International Fuel Technology , Inc. , ( IFT ) for example , has developed a fuel efficiency enhancing additive that helps biodiesel blends to function similarly to diesel .
It allows less biodiesel to be consumed compared to non-additized biodiesel for the same energy output .
This technology not only improves the biofuel ’s environmental footprint , but reduces the amount of biodiesel needed for a given power output , expanding biofuel capacity and further offsetting oil use .
Another line of IFT additives provides oxidation stability to biodiesel and its blends .
This is crucial to smooth operation of biodiesel blends and for long term storage stability .
As biofuels continue to expand and become more efficient , we must also take advantage of technologies that permit us to use less oil in the first place .
The rail industry , for instance , is increasingly seeking to reduce costs and improve its environmental footprint with better fuel efficiency .
Rail offers an excellent opportunity for employing such demand - side technology , as the industry is highly centralized among regional operators and is among the more predictable forms of transportation , allowing for reliable demonstration and fuel efficiency analysis .
Rail can help us reduce the need for expanded oil supply by increasing the fuel economy of petrodiesel , which is heavily used by trains around the globe .
International Fuel Technology has developed an additive that “ atomizes ” the fuel injected into a train ’s diesel engine combustion chamber , burning the fuel more completely and emitting less waste .
The technology achieves 3 - 6 percent greater fuel economy and reduces atmospheric emissions .
If a 4.5 percent diesel fuel efficiency gain were extended beyond rail to all U.S. diesel fuel consumption , we would eliminate the need for over 2.2 billion gallons of diesel every year .
When combined with other demand - side savings opportunities , the potential to reduce oil consumption is significant .
By making the most of biofuels and the petroleum we already have access to , we can reduce our need for continued oil expansion .
Technologies for demand management , improved efficiency and conservation are available and expanding .
The optimal choice for our fuel future is not to require any extra oil .
We simply have to choose .
Dr. Sergio Trindade , International Fuel Technology ’s Director of Science & Technology , is a globally recognized consultant and expert in sustainable energy and alcohol fuels .
His experience within the international energy field is abundant , especially concerning alternative energies .
Dr. Trindade is a Co-laureate of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize as a member of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
He also served as the Assistant Secretary - General of the United Nations ( UN ) for Science and Technology for five years and continues to provide consulting to the UN system , including the World Bank , and many other organizations regarding energy and environmental issues .
He holds a PhD. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and a BS in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
In a recent blog post , Ross Douthat describes the " trouble with meritocracy , " or our belief that the best and brightest ( as measured by their SAT scores and GPA ) should all attend the same elite universities :
Part of the problem with meritocracy is that it homogenizes in the name of diversity :
It skims the cream from every race and class and population , puts all of the best and brightest through the same educational conveyor belt , and comes out with a ruling class that ’s cosmetically diverse but intellectually conformist , and that tends to huddle together rather than spreading out to enrich the country as a whole .
This is Christopher Lasch ’s lament in “ The Revolt of the Elites ” — that meritocracy co-opts people who might otherwise become its critics , sapping local communities of their intellectual vitality and preventing any kind of rival power centers from emerging .
The obvious rejoinder to any critique of meritocracy is that , like democracy , it 's the worst system except for all the others that have been tried .
Nevertheless , I think it 's still worth considering ways in which our meritocratic institutions - I 'm looking at you , Harvard - can improve their outcomes and help mitigate the very real problem of social homogenization .
The first thing to note is that homogenization happens automatically : we naturally construct our social network so that it consists mostly of people like us .
( Sociologists refer to this failing as the self - similarity principle . )
In 2007 , Paul Ingram and Michael Morris conducted a study of business executives at Columbia University .
The executives were invited to a cocktail mixer , where they were encouraged to network with new people .
Not surprisingly , the vast majority of executives at the event said their primary goal was to meet “ as many different as people as possible ” and “ expand their social network ” .
Unfortunately , that ’s not what happened .
By surreptitiously monitoring the participants with electronic devices , Ingram and Morris were able to track every conversation .
What they found was that people tended to interact with the people who were most like them , so that investment bankers chatted with other investment bankers , and marketers talked with other marketers , and accountants interacted with other accountants .
Instead of mixing with new people , the leaders made small talk with those from similar backgrounds ; the smallness of their social world got reinforced .
According to Ingram and Morris , the only successful networker at the event was the bartender .
So far , so obvious .
However , it 's important to note that cultivating diverse social networks - connecting with people who think differently - comes with real , tangible benefits .
Consider this interesting study led by Martin Ruef , a sociologist at Princeton .
He began by interviewing 766 graduates of the Stanford Business School , all of whom had gone on to start their own business .
Ruef was most interested in the structure of their social networks .
He noticed that most entrepreneurs had a rather homogenous collection of contacts .
They might have lots of friends , but all of their friends came from the same place and were interested in the same things .
This is n’t particularly surprising :
We naturally self - segregate .
But not every entrepreneur had such a self - similar network of friends .
In fact , Ruef discovered a small subset of business people who were embedded in diverse social structures .
They did n’t just hang out with colleagues and close friends .
Instead , these entrepreneurs maintained a large number of “ weak ties ” with people at different companies and from different backgrounds .
Their social networks were varied and undirected , full of surprising interactions and “ informational entropy ” .
These entrepreneurs made a habit of hanging out with people who told them unexpected things ; they chatted with acquaintances and struck up conversations with random strangers .
Ruef then analyzed each of these entrepreneurs using an elaborate metric of innovation .
He measured the number of patents they ’d invented and kept track of all their trademarks .
He rated the originality of their products and gave them bonus points if they ’d “ entered an unexploited niche ” or pioneered a new marketing method .
He then compared these innovation rankings to the structure of the entrepreneur ’s social networks .
The results were impressive : Business people with entropic networks were three times more innovative than people with predictable networks .
Because they interacted with lots of different folks , they were exposed to a much wider range of ideas and “ non-redundant information ” .
Instead of getting stuck in the rut of conformity - thinking the same tired thoughts as everyone else - they were able to invent startling new concepts .
There is something unsettling about Ruef ’s data .
We think of entrepreneurs , after all , as individuals .
If someone has a brilliant idea for a new company , we assume that they are inherently more creative than the rest of us .
This is why we idolize people like Bill Gates and Richard Branson and Oprah Winfrey .
It 's also why we invest in the meritocracy :
We believe that we can identify talent in isolation .
But Ruef ’s analysis suggests that this focus on the singular misses the real story of entrepreneurship .
Unless we take our social circle into account - that collection of weak ties and remote acquaintances who feed us unfamiliar facts - we 're not going to really understand the nature of achievement .
Behind every successful entrepreneur is a vast network .
And this returns us to meritocracy .
It 's not enough to simply take the smartest kids and make them smarter .
What 's just as important is teaching these young people to seek out strangers , to resist the tug of self - similarity and homogenization .
Diversity can seem like a such a vague and wishy - washy aspiration , but it comes with measurable benefits .
To the extent our meritocratic institutions diminish our social diversity - are your college buddies just like you ?
- they might actually make us less likely to succeed .
Perhaps Bill Gates knew what he was doing when he dropped out of Harvard .
Global asbestos lobby keeps the asbestos market going despite proof that asbestos causes cancer and other fatal diseases .
Heard of asbestos ?
It is the terrible toxin used in insulation and construction that can kill you by giving you lung cancer , mesothelioma and asbestosis .
It is banned or restricted in at least 52 countries due to its great danger .
In another sad case of anti-environmental activism , however , the news is that a global network of asbestos lobbyists have spent about $ 100 million on maintaining a market for asbestos around the world , especially in the developing world .
This is what an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found .
Despite knowing that asbestos is a carcinogen , it is still being widely used around the world due to immoral marketing .
As a result of this marketing campaign , asbestos is booming among the rural poor in India and a federal inspector has had to battle the industry for a quarter of a century in Brazil .
Russia , producing almost 1 million tons of asbestos each year , is also a major user of it , and China is now the world ’s largest asbestos consumer .
“ It ’s totally unethical .
It ’s almost criminal .
Asbestos cannot be used safely , ” said Jukka Takala , director of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work , with regards to this completely immoral asbestos marketing campaign .
Does this short - term profits over people ’s lives and health campaign remind you of anything ( i.e. the long - surviving tobacco lobby ; the anti-climate change lobby ; the big ag chemical and GMO lobby ) ?

His career spans decades of film and television , but Stargate fans will always remember Maury Chaykin as the brilliant and manipulative Goa’uld Nerus on Stargate SG - 1 .
CBC
News is reporting that Chaykin has passed away , at the age of 61 .
( His cause of death has not been reported . )
Born in Brooklyn , New York in 1949 , Chaykin studied drama in New York and moved to Toronto after college .
There he entered the Canadian theater scene in the mid-1970s , and also found work in front of the camera .
He appeared in such films as My Cousin Vinny , Iron Eagle II , and Dances With Wolves .
On television , Chaykin played the title character in the Nero Wolfe mystery series .
His many credits also include La Femme Nikita , Due South , CSI , Boston Legal , and Entourage .
Most recently , he appeared in the recurring role of Sam Belcher in the series Less Than Kind .
Chaykin ’s first appearance on Stargate came in the ninth season episode “ Beachhead , ” when Nerus deceived General Hank Landry and Stargate Command to help give the Ori an upper hand .
He became a prisoner on Earth ( doing most of his scenes opposite Beau Bridges ) , and was eventually set loose and returned to the former System Lord Baal ( Cliff Simon ) in the episode “ Off the Grid . ”
Maury Chaykin is survived by his wife , actress Susannah Hoffmann , and their daughter .
Our thoughts and prayers are with them in this difficult time .

Perhaps the only thing worse than a war criminal is an unrepentant one .
And so it with Barack Obama 's predecessor .
Just months after former Vice President Dick Cheney boasted , " I was a big supporter of waterboarding , " George W. Bush joined him by announcing , " I 'd do it again . "
President Bush 's endorsement of the use of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques against 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other terrorism suspects came during an appearance before a business audience in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
As CNN reported :
" Yeah , we waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , " the former president said during an appearance at the Economic Club of Grand Rapids , Michigan , according to the Grand Rapids Press .
" I 'd do it again to save lives , " he added .
If that sounds familiar , it should .
Back in February , Dick Cheney bragged to ABC's Jonathan Karl is almost the exact same terms :
" I was a big supporter of waterboarding .
I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques ... "
And in that same interview , Cheney confirmed that the both Bush legal team that invented the spurious rationale for detainee torture and those implementing it were merely following orders :
" The reason I 've been outspoken is because there were some things being said , especially after we left office , about prosecuting CIA personnel that had carried out our counterterrorism policy or disbarring lawyers in the Justice Department who had -- had helped us put those policies together , and I was deeply offended by that , and I thought it was important that some senior person in the administration stand up and defend those people who'd done what we asked them to do . "
There are only two problems with the Bush - Cheney tag team defense of waterboarding .
The first , of course , is that it did n't save lives .
As ThinkProgress noted :
Waterboarding Mohammed 183 times did n't save any lives .
In fact , Mohammed told U.S. military officials that he gave false information to the CIA after withstanding torture .
Additionally , a former Special Operations interrogator who worked in Iraq has stated that waterboarding has actually cost American lives : " The number of U.S. soldiers who have died because of our torture policy will never be definitively known , but it is fair to say that it is close to the number of lives lost on Sept. 11 , 2001 . "
Just as important , with their admissions Bush and Cheney are in essence confessing to war crimes which the Obama administration is both morally and legally obligated to prosecute .
As Scott Horton concluded in Harper 's regarding Cheney 's game of chicken :
" What prosecutor can look away when a perpetrator mocks the law itself and revels in his role in violating it ?
Such cases cry out for prosecution .
Dick Cheney wants to be prosecuted .
And prosecutors should give him what he wants . "
Writing on February 15th , Professor Jonathan Turley lamented that President Obama had turned his back on the law :
It is an astonishing public admission since waterboarding is not just illegal but a war crime .
It is akin to the vice president saying that he supported bank robbery or murder - for - hire as a public policy .
The ability of Cheney to openly brag about his taste for torture is the direct result of President Barack Obama blocking any investigation or prosecution of war crimes .
For political reasons , Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have refused to carry out our clear obligations under international law to prosecute for such waterboarding .
Indeed , before taking office , various high - ranking officials stated that both Obama and Holder assured them that they would not allow such prosecutions .
While they denied it at the time , those accounts are consistent with their actions following inauguration .
Sadly , Turley has it exactly right .
During his confirmation hearings , Attorney General Eric Holder unequivocally declared , " waterboarding is torture . "
But Holder also reassured Republicans that " we do n't want to criminalize policy differences that might exist " with the outgoing Bush White House .
And even after releasing the Bush torture team legal memos , President Obama agreed with Holder 's restatement of the classic GOP " criminalization of politics " defense :
" In releasing these memos , it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution ...
This is a time for reflection , not retribution .
I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke .
We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history .
But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
Nothing , that is , but the preservation of the rule of law .
( This piece also appears at Perrspectives . )

El juez de la Audiencia Nacional , Santiago Pedraz , ordenó hoy la busca y captura de los militares estadounidenses el sargento Thomas Gibson , el capitán Philip Wolford y el teniente coronel Philip Camp a los que acusa indiciaramente de la muerte del cámara español de Telecinco José Couso , fallecido a causa de un disparo cuando se encontraba en el Hotel Palestina el 8 de abril de 2003 .
Con ello , pretende poder extraditarlos a nuestro país para que sean juzgados por estos hechos en la Audiencia Nacional .
Pedraz ha solicitado también al Consejo General del Poder Judicial ( CGPJ ) permiso para desplazarse a Iraq , entre los próximos meses de octubre y noviembre , a fin de investigar los hechos sobre el terreno , informaron fuentes jurídicas .
El auto dictado hoy por el titular del Juzgado Central de Instrucción número 1 es consecuencia de la decisión del Tribunal Supremo de reabrir este caso , que había sido archivado por la Sala de lo Penal de la Audiencia Nacional al entender que Pedraz no tenía base suficiente para seguir investigando la muerte del cámara .
Pedraz acuerda de esta forma practicar las diligencias que ya ordenó y que no se realizaron anteriormente después de que el Tribunal Supremo obligara por segunda vez a la Audiencia Nacional a reabrir la investigación en un fallo que adelantó el pasado 6 de julio .
Así , pide tomar declaración a los periodistas de las televisiones Al Jazeera y Abu Dhabi para que aclaren como se produjeron los ataques a sus respectivas instalaciones y reitera la comisión rogatoria cursada a Iraq .
Una comisión que estaría formada , detalla , por él mismo , el secretario judicial y un funcionario de su juzgado , el fiscal y las partes " si estiman oportuno acudir " y los periodistas en calidad de testigos Olga Rodríguez , Jon Sistiaga y Jesús Manuel Hernández .
Subraya que , " teniendo en cuenta que los hechos acaecieron " durante la administración Bush , " podría existir la posibilidad de una efectiva cooperación ( antes denegada ) " por parte del Gobierno de Barack Obama y vuelve así a pedir la declaración de los tres imputados , así como reclamar al Departamento de Estado , de Defensa y de Justicia toda la documentación sobre los hechos .
Según el juez , la persona que dio la orden fue el teniente coronel Philip de Camp , al mando del regimiento de blindados número 64 de la Tercera División de Infantería Acorazada del ejército norteamericano , que se la transmitió al capitán Philip Wolford , quien a su vez autorizó al que " materialmente realizó el disparo " , el sargento Thomas Gibson , contra el hotel Palestina de Bagdad .
Y ello " pese a saber " que el edificio estaba en zona civil " así como que el mismo estaba ocupado por periodistas y población civil , de tal forma que podría causar la muerte de alguna persona " .
Couso , que se encontraba filmando en desde la habitación 1403 , fue alcanzado por la metralla , lo que le provocó la muerte horas después en el hospital " Ibn Nafis " de Bagdad , así como la del reportero de la agencia " Reuters " Taras Protsuyk , que se encontraba en otra altura , mientras que otros tres periodistas resultaron heridos de gravedad .
En marzo de 2006 , la sección segunda de la Sala de lo Penal de la Audiencia Nacional archivó las diligencias ordenadas por Pedraz al considerar que se trató de un " acto de guerra contra enemigo erróneamente identificado " y declaró la falta de jurisdicción para juzgar los delitos imputados .
La familia de la víctima recurrió esta decisión ante el Supremo , que ordenó a la Audiencia Nacional investigar este caso , pero en julio del año pasado la Sala de lo Penal de este tribunal volvió a revocar el procesamiento de los tres militares y ordenó al instructor que concluyera el sumario y que lo elevara a la Sala de lo Penal para poder acordar el archivo .
Caamaño asegura que España colaborará con Pedraz
El ministro de Justicia , Francisco Caamaño , ha asegurado que , si el juez de la Audiencia Nacional Santiago Pedraz pide colaboración jurídica internacional tras haber ordenado la búsqueda y captura de los tres militares estadounidenses presuntamente responsables de la muerte del cámara español de Telecinco José Couso , España " por supuesto " tramitará lo que el magistrado solicite .
" Si así lo determina el juez con la colaboración jurídica internacional , por supuesto , como hacemos con todos los mandamientos judiciales , órdenes que por decisión de los jueces tienen que ser tramitadas " , ha recalcado .
Ha añadido que la decisión de reabrir el caso es del Supremo , que " ha decidido que tenía que abrir la investigación " y que la de Pedraz " la adopta en el ejercicio de su independencia " , por lo que todos deben respetarla .
​​What ’s Sarah Palin been smoking ?
The former Alaska Governor said Wednesday night that while she opposes marijuana legalization , law enforcement should not focus its energy on such a “ minimal problem . ”
Politico .
Palin made the comment during an appearance on the Fox Business Network with Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , reports Andy Barr at
Congressman Paul , a libertarian , said that enforcing marijuana laws specifically and the War On Drugs in general is a “ useless battle , ” a point with which Palin partially agreed , although she made clear that she does not support legalization .
Make up your mind , Sarah — should pot be legal , or not ?
​” If we ’re talking about pot , I ’m not for the legalization of pot , ” said former GOP vice presidential candidate Palin .
“ If somebody ’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody any harm , then perhaps there are other things our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems we have in society , ” Palin said in her typically tortured syntax .
Palin then advised law enforcement officers to “ not concentrate on such a , relatively speaking , minimal problem we have in the country . ”
“ Listening to Ron Paul ’s opposition to marijuana laws and Palin ’s reluctance to defend them , you start to wonder if anyone in the right - wing activist movement still cares about fighting a war on marijuana , ” wrote Scott Morgan at StoptheDrugWar.org
The half - term Alaska governor has confessed that she used to smoke pot in her youth , but claims she dropped the habit since she “ did n’t enjoy it . ”
“ I ca n’t claim a Bill Clinton and say that I never inhaled , ” she confessed to Anchorage Daily News in 2006 .
Marijuana was legal under Alaska ’s libertarian drug laws during Palin ’s youth .
In 1975 , a landmark ruling by the Alaska Supreme Court allowed adults to have small amounts of marijuana for personal use .
However , that ruling was overturned in 2006 when a law was passed re-criminalizing the herb in Alaska .
Palin said that legalizing pot would “ send the wrong message ” to children .
A kangaroo has reportedly been sighted in the wild on a road in Ballinabracky , near Kinnegad , Co Meath .
Gardaí have confirmed they are investigating the claims .
The MBA reports : Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly Survey
The Refinance Index decreased 14.3 percent from the previous week and the seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 5.7 percent from one week earlier .
...
“ Purchase and refinance applications dropped this week , even after an adjustment for the Memorial Day holiday .
Purchase applications are now 35 percent below their level of four weeks ago , as homebuyers have not yet returned to the market following the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of April , ” said Michael Fratantoni , MBA ’s Vice President of Research and Economics .
“ Although rates remained essentially flat , refinance applications dropped this past week for the first time in a month .
Despite the historically low rates , many homeowners have already refinanced recently , remain underwater on their mortgages , have uncertain job situations , or have damaged credit following this downturn , and therefore may not qualify to refinance . ”
...
The average contract interest rate for 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages decreased to 4.81 percent from 4.83 percent , with points decreasing to 1.02 from 1.05 ( including the origination fee ) for 80 percent loan - to - value ( LTV ) ratio loans .

The purchase index has collapsed following the expiration of the tax credit suggesting home sales will fall sharply too .
This is the lowest level for the purchase index since February 1997 .
Pentagon scientists working with MIT and Harvard researchers have developed a paper - thin shape - shifting structure capable of transforming into a toy boat or a paper plane by itself .
This development is of course the first step towards real - life Transformers .
The system is the result of DARPA research kicked off in 2007 to investigate the possibilities of creating programmable matter capable of forming everything from a wrench to body armor .
This is the first result from the work , a kind of programmable origami made from stiff polymer tiles and 25 thin foil actuators .
In function , a programmer creates the desired three - dimensional shape , the system analyzes the shape , determines the steps necessary to get there , and proceeds to fold up on its own .
Researches hope to use this kind of technology to develop better armor , on - site replacement parts , and vehicles which can adapt to an environment on the fly .
One day they hope to be able to create an amorphous material without such joints , more of a fluid which mold itself into any kind of shape on command .

Offshore Drilling Moratorium Reimposed
The Department of the Interior has , unwisely and unnecessarily , reimposed the ban on deep water offshore drilling .
Doug Mataconis · · 36 comments
After being rebuffed in Court , the Department of the Interior has issued a new order barring most deep sea offshore oil drilling :
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar reissued a moratorium on deepwater offshore drilling Monday , after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the White House ’s appeal of a lower court decision to halt the drilling ban .
The reinstated ban will “ protect communities , coasts , and wildlife as oil and gas companies implement adequate safety measures to reduce the risks associated with deepwater drilling operations and to ensure they are prepared for blowouts and oil spills , ” wrote the Interior Department in a statement .
The ban wo n’t apply to shallow water drilling activities , which , the department said , “ do not present the same type or level of risks as deepwater drilling operations can continue to move forward if operators are in compliance with all safety and environmental requirements , including the safety and environmental requirements implemented through recent Notices to Lessees . ”
The new ban will be in effect until November 30 or until such time as Salazar deems that drilling can move forward safely , the department said .
It is supported , said a departent statement by an “ extensive record ” indicating that the operations “ would pose a threat of serious , irreparable , or immediate harm or damage to the marine , coastal , and human environment . ”
The delay , it said , “ would allow time for the implementation of new safety reforms aimed at preventing further drilling accidents . ”
Quite obviously , this will be headed back to Court .
However , since the main reason that the original moratorium was struck down was because the Judge found that it was not supported by sufficient expert opinion to be considered a proper agency order under the Administrative Procedure Act , that previous dismissal technically does n’t bar the Administration from taking a second bite at the apple .
Assuming that this order includes a legally sufficient independent support , which I would have to imagine that it does since the Judge was fairly clear about what the deficiencies were , it ’s likely to fare better in Court than the previous Order did .
That does n’t mean it ’s a good idea , though .
This strikes me as a rather heavy - handed use of agency power with very little evidence that it ’s actually necessary .
Additionally , it ’s likely to continue to have a devastating economic impact on Louisiana and the rest of the Gulf Coast that depends on the drilling industry as a significant source of income .
Already one drilling rig has left of Gulf of Mexico , headed to the waters off Egypr where there is no moratorium .
One can assume that it ’s sister rigs wo n’t be far behind .
Even after the oil spill is stopped and the cleanup underway , this is going to continue harming the people of Louisiana unnecessarily .
Image Data Handling
After I installed OpenCV I wanted to get started with some image manipulations .
The concept is pretty simple with Computer Vision being defined as basically “ the transformation of data from a still or video camera into either a decision or a new representation ” bradski .
OpenCV provides a certain procedure for loading the data of the images .
So the first thing I did was get comfortable with some of the basic image handling protocol .
# include " stdio.h " # include " highgui.h " int main ( int argc , char * * argv ) { IplImage * img = 0 ; if ( argc < 2 ) { printf ( " Usage : Accepts one image as argument
" ) ; exit ( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; } img = cvLoadImage ( argv [ 1 ] ) ; if ( !img ) { printf ( " Error loading image file %s
" , argv [ 1 ] ) ; exit ( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; } cvNamedWindow ( " Example1 " , CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ) cvMoveWindow ( " Example1 " , 100 , 100 ) ; cvShowImage ( " Example1 " , img ) ; cvWaitKey ( 0 ) ; cvReleaseImage ( &img ) ; cvDestroyWindow ( " Example1 " ) ; return EXIT_SUCCESS ; }
Get the code from my Git Repository
If you need help with Git , follow this quick introduction – Getting Started With Git
It ’s pretty clear from here why OpenCV is so user friendly , it ’s interface is notably intuitive .
My impression of the highgui.h header thus far leads me to believe it is host to the display functions which post all of the image data , as it ’s name “ highgui ” suggests .
IplImage * img = 0 ;
IplImage is a data structure , it is used to store image data .
It got it ’s name from it ’s home , Intel , and it stands for Image Processing Library ( IPL ) Image .
Here ’s a taste of what it looks like .
typedef struct _IplImage { int nSize ; /* sizeof ( IplImage ) */ int ID ; /* version ( =0 ) */ int nChannels ; /* Most of OpenCV functions support 1,2,3 or 4 channels */ int alphaChannel ; /* Ignored by OpenCV */ int depth ; /* Pixel depth in bits : IPL_DEPTH_8U , IPL_DEPTH_8S , IPL_DEPTH_16S , IPL_DEPTH_32S , IPL_DEPTH_32 F and IPL_DEPTH_64 F are supported */ char colorModel [ 4 ] ; /* Ignored by OpenCV */ char channelSeq [ 4 ] ; /* Ditto */ int dataOrder ; /* 0 - interleaved color channels , 1 - separate color channels .
cvCreateImage can only create interleaved images */ int origin ; /* 0 - top - left origin , 1 - bottom - left origin ( Windows bitmaps style ) */ int align ; /* Alignment of image rows ( 4 or 8 ) .
OpenCV ignores it and uses widthStep instead */ int width ; /* Image width in pixels */ int height ; /* Image height in pixels */ struct _IplROI * roi ;/* Image ROI .
If NULL , the whole image is selected */ struct _IplImage * maskROI ; /* Must be NULL */ void * imageId ; /* " " */ struct _IplTileInfo * tileInfo ; /* " " */ int imageSize ; /* Image data size in bytes ( ==image -> height*image -> widthStep in case of interleaved data ) */ char * imageData ; /* Pointer to aligned image data */ int widthStep ; /* Size of aligned image row in bytes */ int BorderMode [ 4 ] ; /* Ignored by OpenCV */ int BorderConst [ 4 ] ;/* Ditto* / char *imageDataOrigin ;/*
Pointer to very origin of image data ( not necessarily aligned ) - needed for correct deallocation */ } IplImage ;
Most of it is pretty intuitive , but I ’m sure I ’ll learn more about some of it ’s more obscure data members soon .
A problem I faced next was ; given an image , how do I extrapolate all of that data ?
That ’s where the next function came in .
IplImage * cvLoadImage ( const char* filename , int iscolor ) ;
filename - name of the file to be loaded iscolor - Specifies colorness of the loaded image :
If >0 , the loaded image is forced to be color 3 - channel image ;
If 0 , the loaded image is forced to be grayscale ;
If < 0 or omitted , the loaded image will be loaded as is with the number of channels depending on the file .
This is an impressive function .
It parses through it 's argument , interprets all the information , and fills in that IplImage structure with all the data and finally returning a pointer to the IplImage .
It allocates the appropriate memory size and has support for the following formats
Windows bitmaps - BMP , DIB
JPEG files - JPEG , JPG , JPE
Portable Network Graphics - PNG
Portable image format - PBM , PGM , PPM
Sun rasters - SR , RAS
TIFF files - TIFF , TIF
Notice however that I assign it to img. img is a pointer to the IplImage .
That data structure is large and bulky , so passing it around by value would be costly in overhead .
Alright , so I 've got an image loaded into my program here , how do I output it ?
What I learned next is that have you create your own windows for data output .
int cvNamedWindow ( const char* name , int flags ) ;
name - Name of the window which is used as window identifier and appears in the window caption .
flags -
Flags of the window .
Currently the only supported flag is CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE .
If it is set , window size is automatically adjusted to fit the displayed image while user can not change the window size manually .
The first parameter , the character array , is the name I used to refer to this exact window throughout the rest of the program , and the second is the windows size .
There is something interesting to note here , the window variable name " Example1 " is also the name that appears on the window after it is displayed ...
I have n't found any workarounds for this yet .
I 'm not sure if there is a need , but what if you want to make multiple windows with the same name , but need to refer to them independently throughout the program ?
Please let me know if you find a solution .
Now I noticed when the window appeared it was always in the corner ... mathnathan does n't like this ...
So a simple little move window function served me great here .
void cvMoveWindow ( const char* name , int x , int y ) ;
name - Name of the window to be relocated .
x - New x coordinate of top - left corner y - New y coordinate of top - left corner
Remember , " Example1 " is now the string literal I had to use to refer to that window .
The next two parameters are ints .
They simply refer to the ( x , y ) coordinates where the window 's upper left corner will be .
I got an image loaded and a window up , so then I needed to put the image in the window .
OpenCV provides a function which displays an IplImage * pointer in an existing window , in my case " Example1 " .
void cvShowImage ( const char* name , const CvArr* image ) ;
name -
The name of the window .
image -
The image to be shown .
Now the image is displayed in the window I created .
Hooray .
Note , if the window was set with CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE flag , then the window will resize to fit the image , otherwise the image will be resized to fit in the window .
To make the window go away I simply waited for any key to be pressed .
int cvWaitKey ( int delay=0 ) ;
delay -
The delay in milliseconds .
When given a parameter of less than or equal to 0 , this function simply pauses the program and waits for a key to be pressed .
Any positive integer will pause the program for that many milliseconds .
This is the only function within highgui for event handling .
Being the good little C programmer that I am , I freed the allocated memory used to hold the image .
void cvReleaseImage ( IplImage ** image ) ;
image - The IplImage structure you wish to be released .
Be sure to take note that this function expects a pointer to the IplImage * .
So you should submit the address using the reference operator ' & '.
Lastly I destroyed the window .
void cvDestroyWindow ( const char* name ) ;
name -
The name of the window you wish to destroy .
I 'm quite fond of this function , they really gave it a great name .
Programming suddenly got way more fun !
Compiling
The program is ready to go , but building it was n't as easy a gcc myprogram .c it required linking to the OpenCV libraries .
This can be a nuisance , however OpenCV makes linking to their stuff a breeze when using CMake .
If you 're new to CMake and would like a quick introduction , check out my Getting Started with CMake tutorial .
When I built OpenCV from source in the previous post , it produced an OpenCVConfig.
cmake file ( making it easy ! ) for me to put into my CMakeLists .
txt file .
cmake_minimum_required ( VERSION
2.6 ) project ( examples ) include( $ENV{OpenCV_DIR}/OpenCVConfig.cmake ) include_directories ($ {OPENCV_INCLUDE_DIR} ) add_executable ( example1 example2-1.cpp ) target_link_libraries ( example1 $ { OpenCV_LIBS} )
Plain and simply that 's all there was too it .
I saved that as my CMakeLists .
txt file , moved into the build directory , ran cmake , then make , and tested my program with some sample pictures .
SUCCESS !
Applying a Gaussian Transformation
Using my new found image handling skills I attempted to smooth an image using cvSmooth ( ) .
There are a few minor additions to the previous program .
# include " stdio.h " # include " highgui.h " # include " cv.h " int main ( int argc , char * * argv ) { IplImage * img = 0 ; IplImage * out = 0 ; if ( argc < 2 ) { printf ( " Usage : Accepts one image as argument
" ) ; exit ( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; } img = cvLoadImage ( argv [ 1 ] ) ; if ( !img ) { printf ( " Error loading image file %s
" , argv [ 1 ] ) ; exit ( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; } out = cvCreateImage ( cvGetSize(img ) , IPL_DEPTH_8U , 3 ) ; cvNamedWindow ( " Example1 " , CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ) ; cvMoveWindow ( " Example1 " , 100 , 100 ) ; cvNamedWindow ( " Output " , CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ) ; cvMoveWindow ( " Output " , 300 , 100 ) ; cvShowImage ( " Example1 " , img ) ; cvSmooth ( img , out , CV_GAUSSIAN , 3 , 3 ) ; cvShowImage ( " Output " , out ) ; cvWaitKey ( 0 ) ; cvReleaseImage ( &img ) ; cvReleaseImage ( & out ) ; cvDestroyWindow ( " Example1 " ) ; cvDestroyWindow ( " Output " ) ; return EXIT_SUCCESS ; }
Get the code from my Git Repository

First off , I added cv.h into the mix here .
This is where I found all of my Computer Vision toys .
To be able to see the before and after I created another pointer to an IplImage * data structure to store the transformed data which I called , out .
I learned another method for creating an image without using the cvLoadImage ( ) function , which I garnished here .
IplImage * cvCreateImage ( CvSize size , int depth , int channels ) ;
size -
The images width and height depth - Bit depth of image elements .
Can be one of : IPL_DEPTH_8U - unsigned 8 - bit integers IPL_DEPTH_8S - signed 8 - bit integers IPL_DEPTH_16U - unsigned 16 - bit integers IPL_DEPTH_16S - signed 16 - bit integers IPL_DEPTH_32S - signed 32 - bit integers IPL_DEPTH_32 F - single precision floating - point numbers IPL_DEPTH_64 F - double precision floating - point numbers channels - Number of channels per element , pixel , in the image .
I got the size automatically using cvGetSize .
CvSize cvGetSize ( const CvArr* arr ) ;
arr -
The array header
The function cvGetSize returns number of rows ( CvSize : : height ) and number of columns ( CvSize : : width ) of the input matrix or image .
If I were to have the *roi pointer pointing to a subset of the original image , the size of ROI ( Region Of Interest ) is returned .
The next parameter is an int , and is the bit depth of the image elements .
Lastly it wants the number of channels for the image .
That is the number of channels per element ( pixel ) , which can be 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 .
The channels are interleaved , for example the usual data layout of a color image is : b0 g0 r0 b1 g1 r1 ...
Although in general IPL image format can store non-interleaved images as well and some of OpenCV can process it , cvCreateImage ( ) creates interleaved images only ....
How sad ...
And finally here is the transformation .
void cvSmooth ( const CvArr * src , CvArr * dst , int smoothtype=CV_GAUSSIAN , int param1=3 , int param2=0 , double param3=0 ) ;
src -
The source image , to be smoothed .
dst -
The destination image , where to save the image .
smoothtype - Smoothing algorithm to be employed CV_BLUR_NO_SCALE ( simple blur with no scaling ) - summation over a pixel param1 ×param2 neighborhood .
If the neighborhood size may vary , one may precompute integral image with cvIntegral function .
CV_BLUR ( simple blur ) - summation over a pixel param1 × param2 neighborhood with subsequent scaling by 1/( param1 •param2 ) .
CV_GAUSSIAN ( gaussian blur ) - convolving image with param1 × param2 Gaussian kernel .
CV_MEDIAN ( median blur ) - finding median of param1 × param1 neighborhood ( i.e. the neighborhood is square ) .
CV_BILATERAL ( bilateral filter ) - applying bilateral 3x3 filtering with color sigma=param1 and space sigma=param2 .
param1 - The first parameter of smoothing operation .
param2 - The second parameter of smoothing operation .
In case of simple scaled / non - scaled and Gaussian blur if param2 is zero , it is set to param1 .
param3 - n case of Gaussian parameter this parameter may specify Gaussian sigma ( standard deviation ) .
If it is zero , it is calculated from the kernel size : sigma = ( n/2 - 1 ) * 0.3 + 0.8 n=param1 for horizontal kernel n=param2 for vertical kernel .
Using standard sigma for small kernels ( 3×3 to 7×7 ) gives better speed .
If param3 is not zero , while param1 and param2 are zeros , the kernel size is calculated from the sigma .
Your source image and destination image are self explanatory , the next parameter is your smoothing algorithm and
the other 3 parameters depend on the smooth type , here is another reference to the various smooth types .
brasdki
I then displayed the output image in the " Output " window and was a good little C programmer and cleaned up after myself .
So those are the changes in the new program .
It takes an image as input , makes a copy , creates two windows , displays one image , runs the other through a smoothing filter , then displays that one aswell !
Easy stuff .
Here is the output I received after running a picture of myself through the filter .
COOL !!

Functional testing or system testing of software is defined as software testing activities conducted on a complete , integrated system to evaluate the system compliance with its specified software requirements .
System testing falls within the scope of black box testing and should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic .
Other software testing practices like Acceptance Testing and Behavior Driven Development ( BDD ) cover the same activity in a software development project .
Many open source and commercial tools exist to cover the functional software testing activity for desktop , web or mobile applications .
Amongst the most famous functional software testing tools you can find Cucumber , Specflow , Selenium , TestNG , RSpec , Capybara or Watir .
This is a sketch of how to provide highly concurrent read and update access to sorted paged lists while requiring minimal locking .
This particular trick has probably been covered before but if so I ’ve missed it and have n’t seen anyone else using it .
I implemented it a long time ago in a closed - source and now - defunct piece of software .
It worked really well , and I ’ve never since seen it done quite this way .
There was some thought that it might be patentable and a literature search back then came up empty .
But I ’d be amazed if this were n’t being used here and there ; who knows , maybe it ’s crept into the undergrad CS curriculum while I was n’t looking .
Page Table · Suppose we have a large ordered list containing some type that the “ < ” operator works with , and we ’ve organized it into pages ; we access them through a simple page table whose entries need contain only a base value for the page and a pointer to it .
Searching ·
For this to work , we assume we can search both the page table and the pages in a way that depends only on the ordering of the elements , and can tolerate duplicate elements ( as in where the same object appears in two or more successive slots in a page ) .
An example of such an algorithm is binary search , which is in fact what I used in my implementation , and I think is generally a good choice .
Reading ·
To find something in the list , you search the page table to find which page it ’s in , then search the appropriate page , then you ’re done .
If you just want to retrieve information , you do n’t need to acquire any locks at any time .
Shuffling ·
This is the lowest level of the process by which we actually or add or delete items from the table .
I think the explanation will run smoother if I cover shuffling first .
Let ’s consider a page in the table as a number declaring the element count , and then a series of numbers representing the items .
For example , a page with four items represented as numbers :
4 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40
Now suppose we want to add the value 15 , which will fall between 10 and 20 .
Let ’s assume there are more slots available in the page ; the count 4 describes the number that are actually used .
I ’ll refer to this process as shuffling - in .
First we add a duplicate of the top element in space one off the declared end of the page .
4 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 40
Now we increment the element count .
5 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 40
Now we shuffle the elements up , going from the top down .
5 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 30 , 40
5 : 10 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 40
Finally , we over - write the occupant of the correct position with the new value .
5 : 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40
Note that at every point in this process , a binary search through the page , based on the declared number of elements , will produce a correct result , assuming it can tolerate the presence of duplicates ( which binary search by default does ) .
I ’ll call the inverse process shuffling - out ; here we shuffle out the newly - added 15 .
First , we copy the to - be - deleted element ’s right neighbor on top of it , creating a duplicate of the neighbor , and repeat the process until we ’ve reached the top of the page .
5 : 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40
5 : 10 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 40
5 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 30 , 40
5 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 40
Finally we decrement the element count .
4 : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 40
Once again , at no point during the shuffle have we disrupted anyone ’s ability to binary - search the page correctly .
Simple Updates · Shuffling - in and shuffling - out allow a writer to update a page of the list while readers are active , without getting in their way .
Thus an updater who wants to add or delete an element from the list needs to do the following :
Search the page table to find out which page will be affected .
Acquire an update lock on that page .
Shuffle in or out .
Release the lock .
Difficult Updates ·
Things are a bit more complex when the page table needs to be updated , which happens in two cases :
When a page is too big and needs to be split , or is too small and needs to be merged with another ( or alternately , is empty and needs to be removed ) .
It turns out that you can shuffle the page table too .
It ’s a bit more complex ; for example when you ’re splitting a page with X entries whose base value is N into two pages with approximately X / 2 entries the second of which has base value N2 , you ’d do this :
Acquire the page table update lock , then the lock of the page to be split .
Construct the new page , starting at N2 , with the top half of the entries .
Shuffle it into the table .
There will now be a bunch of entries duplicated between the big page beginning at N and the small page beginning at N2 , but that wo n’t keep a reader ’s search from running correctly .
Change the count declaration in the page starting at N. Release the locks .
Similarly , merging small pages requires a bit of housekeeping around the shuffle , but it ’s not rocket science and is left as an exercise for the reader .
The trick is to keep things sorted and usable by read - only code at all times .
Finally , there ’s a corner - case to the simple update where you delete the lowest entry in a page ; this also requires locking the page table .
Hot Lock ·
In my implementation , I had every updater acquire the page table lock long enough to look at the target page and figure out whether the page table would need to be updated , then , assuming not , release it before it went to work on the target page .
I was worried that that lock would get hot and bottleneck the system , so I thought of some dodges including storing page metadata in the page table , and taking a two - pass approach with back - off ; going straight to the page and then if it needed splitting or merging , backing off and acquiring the page - table lock .
Tuning and Experience ·
In practice , the page - table lock was n’t a problem , probably since the amount of work involved in seeing if a page is going to split or merge is very small .
Another sin of omission was that I never bothered to merge pages , just deleted them if they emptied out entirely .
I was actually worried about cache coherency ; when the system is running hot , it ’s absolutely the case that two processes will be issuing simultaneous read and write requests to the same address at the same time .
But the algorithm is pretty resistant to update latencies and I never observed any problems in practice .
Obviously this is not transactional ; a reader process can fail to see an insertion that started some time ago if the updater is shuffling its way through a large page .
There ’s only one obvious tuning parameter : page size .
In my implementation there was a very high query rate but with less than 10 % updates , and whatever page size I picked more or less at random on the first time through was good enough .
It was fairly small ; my intuition was that the cost of big shuffles would be higher than the cost of searching a larger page table .
This was done in a C program ; the entries were fixed - size structs packed into huge mmap - backed buffers , so the entries were all just 64 - bit pointers .
I did n’t even persist the page - table or page structures , just constructed them when the program started up .
The locking primitives were basic POSIX stuff , ca n’t remember which .
I could run hundreds of processes handling immense numbers of queries and quite a few updates per second through about as much memory as you would reasonably put on a generic Debian server a decade - and - a - bit ago .
I never actually figured out how fast it would go or how to tune it because it was never the critical point in the system .
My intuition is that you could distribute it across multiple systems without too much pain , but I have n’t thought it through .
I have n’t really any useful information about the range of update patterns and frequencies that this scheme might tolerate before becoming unworkable .
My intuition is that there are some patterns where it ’ll outdo quite a few of the other off - the - shelf options , but I have no hard evidence .
That ’s All Folks ·
The other night , I had insomnia and for some reason thought about this trick , and figured out I should write it down before I forget it , in case someone else finds it useful .
Remember how awesome and clever Futurama was the other night ?
Well , if you missed it , your chances to see it in its original form might be slowly dwindling .
It seems that Comedy Central has wiped out the reference in the dialogue to the " EyePhone 2.0 . "
So , while we do n't have any conspiracy theories brewing about what happened , it 's a pretty odd thing to scrub , and we figure there are two possibilities : either Comedy Central is trying to cover their on this one , or they got a late night email from ... someone .
Thankfully , nothing disappears on the internet , so you can check out both clips and see for yourself after the break .

Lawmakers who want to prevent thousands of teacher layoffs but oppose spending more money on the war in Afghanistan face a dilemma in Congress this week .
Funding to prevent layoffs of thousands of teachers across the country is being blocked by “ deficit - hawks ” in Congress .
To try to get around that stonewall , Democratic leaders have attached funding for education jobs to the $ 30 billion supplemental war appropriations measure requested by President Obama .
Late Tuesday night , House Democratic leaders announced they had put together a war spending bill that , along with the $ 30 billion for the Afghanistan troop surge , includes a $ 10 billion Education Jobs Fund to help local school districts avoid approximately 140,000 teacher layoffs when schools reopen in September .
It also provides $ 5 billion to fill a shortfall in Pell Grant funding for low - income college students .
Another roughly $ 30 billion would fund police and firefighter jobs , disaster assistance , foreign aid , border security , and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange .
Bowing to right - wing pressure , House Democratic leaders said these funds would be paid for by cutting money previously appropriated in the stimulus bill and other bills for things like community development and rural Internet projects .
They said unspent defense funds would also be used to cover the costs .
The Senate passed a $ 59 billion version of the war funding bill on May 27 .
A $ 23 billion emergency education jobs funding measure introduced in the Senate by Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , went nowhere because of the deficit frenzy being whipped up by Republicans , with support from some Blue Dog Democrats .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been pressing Congress to approve the war funding before the congressional July 4 recess .
Progressive House members have pushed for a separate vote on the war money .
Some Congressional Progressive Caucus members say they will vote against the entire supplemental funding bill if they are not given a chance to vote against the war funding separately , Roll Call reported .
“ Those who want to vote to continue funding the war that I disagreed with and they want should be allowed to make that vote , ” said Rep. Barbara Lee , D - Calif. , who has opposed the Afghanistan war from its start .
“ For those of us who want to see the creation of jobs , Haiti [ earthquake aid ] , all of the other domestic priorities , we should have a separate vote . ”
“ Do n’t ask people like me to have to vote for a bill that provides funding for teachers and funding for a war , ” said Rep. Jim McGovern , D - Mass .
“ It ’s not right to do that . ”
But , according to Roll Call , Democratic leaders feel that , without the cover of the war money , “ moderate ” Democrats cowed by the Republican deficit - cutting hysteria will not support the education and other domestic funding .
Rep. Robert Andrews , D - N.J. , told Politico , “ Our problem right now is a significant number of moderates do n’t want to vote for the domestic spending and a significant number of progressives do n’t want to vote for the war funding . ”
Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Lynn Woolsey , D - Calif. , a leading opponent of spending more for the war , suggested to Roll Call that Blue Dog Democrats should vote to “ support the basic needs of people in this country . ”
“ I know they have their pay - for business , ” she added , “ but then they should start looking at taking money out of defense , and that would pay for a lot . ”
House leaders were said to be considering holding separate votes on the war spending and the other programs , but then combining the measures into one bill .
This would allow antiwar lawmakers to register their opposition to the war funding .
Congressional Democrats are reportedly assessing the mood of voters in their districts :
Do voters think cutting the deficit is more important than preventing mass teacher layoffs ?
Should teacher jobs , help for veterans suffering from Agent Orange disease , or Pell Grants , depend on spending more money for war ?
Grassroots public education and peace advocates have a challenge on their hands this week : get the message to Congress .
Both the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers have set up special web pages where public education supporters can contact their members of Congress and ask them to pass the Education Jobs Fund .
Meanwhile Peace Action is urging calls to members of Congress asking for no more war funding and asking them to co-sponsor HR 5015 , the Feingold - McGovern bill which would set an Afghanistan withdrawal timetable .
Calls can be made via the Peace Action website or to 1-800-427-8619 .

The HTC Evo has already crept up on the Nexus One when it comes to Android handset market share , though it has a long way to go before it becomes the dominant Android handset .
That 's according to mobile advertising firm Chitika , which gathered data on 821,201 of its ad impressions for the first two weeks of June .
Chitika says that the HTC Evo has already grabbed 1.93 percent of the mobile ad market , nearly matching the 2 percent held by the Nexus One .
Considering that the Nexus One has been available to users since January and the HTC Evo only launched on June 4 , it certainly looks as if users have taken significantly more interest in the Evo .
Part of the reason may be the marketing push behind the two phones — at least anecdotally , it seems as if I 'm bombarded with more ads for the Evo outside of the Internet than I have ever seen for the Nexus One .
The most dominant Android handset was the Motorola Droid , which made up 33.75 percent of the mobile ad market .
This is no surprise , as the Droid had some of the most aggressive ( and clearly effective ) marketing of any Android - based phone to date .
The HTC Hero and HTC Droid Eris came in second and third with 9.9 and 8.2 percent respectively .
A full 8.13 percent of Android - based phones were unidentifiable : " [ T ]rue to Android ’s open - source and incredibly diverse nature , some 8 % of the operating system ’s traffic in the sample was from unrecognizable devices or devices with extremely low usage , " wrote Chitika .
A smattering of others took up the rest of the pie .
As for carriers , it 's clear which one ( in the US at least ) that Android users prefer : nearly half were on Verizon compared to only one percent on AT&T .
There was a larger group of Android phone users on " N/ A " than on AT&T , according to Chitika 's data , making us wonder whether a similar trend might happen one day if and when Apple decides to roll out a CDMA version of the iPhone .
Tip For Avoiding Trouble From Law Enforcement While Transporting Marijuana
As a non-medical pot smoker , I have had to be vary careful to avoid the long arm of the law .
When it comes to driving with marijuana I have a pretty good track record , other then one time when I was caught in a bad position .
Whenever I ;m driving with weed , I follow a few simple rules .
These rules are nothing crazy or insane and they will not bail you out of every spot but they have worked for me so maybe they will help you .
P.S. check your state ’s laws to stay current with your specific state ’s legal limits .
Know what you are facing in the worst case scenario .
1. Keep your paperwork legit .
Be sure to have insurance , driver ’s license and current registration handy and know where it is .
Trying to find that stuff when you ’re stoned is n’t fun , which leads my to number 2 …
2. Do n’t put your pot in the same spot as your insurance and registration .
This one I learned the hard way when I got stopped one night .
I reached in the glove box to pull out my paperwork and there was my bag of weed right on top .
Luckily , the officer did n’t see it but I ’m not taking that chance again .
3. Do n’t smoke pot in while driving in city limits .
This rule is n’t necessarily set in stone but , unless it can’t wait , try and save your smoking for the freeways and highways ( or home ) .
Also , do n’t hotbox your car , as this is just asking for trouble .
4. Do n’t leave your vehicle littered with pipes and roaches .
It gets to a point that you have so much stuff in your car that could get you in trouble , even a busy cop with bad eyesight would have to bust you .
Always keep weed and paraphernalia out of plain view .
5. Do n’t consent to a search unless you want trouble .
A police officer will search high and low for anything that could get you in trouble .
I had a friend once who thought that they had nothing in the car consent to a search .
The police ended up finding an empty bag with a few small flakes of weed in it and my friend wound up getting arrested .
6 . When possible , put your stash in the trunk .
I have a jacket with zipper pockets that I use to carry my weed .
I just throw the jacket in the trunk and you ca n’t smell it in the cabin .
7.Be sure your car is in good working order .
This includes taillights , license plate lights , headlight and turn signals .
Basically anything and everything that could get you pulled over .
I spent a week in jail for a broken license plate light .
Shit happens .
8.Control the odor .
If you ca n’t kinda smell weed chances are a cop will pick it up right away .
I keep a bottle of body spray or cologne with me at all times just to be safe .
9 . Do n’t be nervous .
Cops are trained to watch for non-verbal clues and being shaky and nervous is an obvious sign that something could be up .
Just relax , think about something else and ( mostly ) forget you even have it .
10 . Finally , do n’t be stupid .
Do n’t drive around town on a Friday night with more weed than is needed or anything unnecessarily reckless .
The more chances you take , the more likely you are going to find yourself in some sort of trouble .
Also , these rules apply when you are a passenger too , as you can find yourself in just as much trouble as the driver , another lesson I learned the hard way .
Bottom line , a police officer can do whatever they want and make your life really , really difficult .
You may have you case thrown out later but you will still be out your time and weed , so it still sucks .
I know that there are more , but this is just a basic rundown so feel free to add anything I did n’t include .
Below is maybe one of the best videos ever made .
Well worth the time to check it out .
Tom Lolis , who studies English literature , was looking through volumes of religious writings at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library last fall when he came across something unexpected .
It was a manuscript by British theologian John Portage , written around 1660 .
Portage ’s work has been much studied by scholars , including Lolis .
But here was a document that none of them knew existed .
“ I kind of lucked out , ” said Lolis , who is working on a post - doctoral fellowship at the library .
Many feel the same way when they discover the rare - book library , which is run by UCLA but located in Jefferson Park .
Brick walls hide it from passersby , and most UCLA undergraduates have never heard of it .
But those who know the library say it is unmatched and unforgettable .
“ The Clark Library is the greatest unknown literary treasure in Los Angeles , ” said Kathleen Thompson , who with her husband owns Michael R. Thompson Booksellers , a rare bookshop that works closely with the institution .
“ The minute we saw it 40 years ago we fell in love with it , and our love has only grown . ”
The library was built in 1924 for the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist and bibliophile Williams Andrews Clark Jr .
He named it for his father , a wealthy Montana banker and copper baron who served a term in the U.S. Senate .
Many details of the library reflect the younger Clark ’s personal style and history .
The bookcases in the reading rooms include copper mined by his family .
Clark , who loved chamber music and founded the L.A. Philharmonic , had the drawing room designed to hold concerts .
Clark ’s taste gave the building and its five - acre grounds a unique charm that remains today .
Original furniture manufactured in 1920s Pasadena stands in the reading rooms , and a grand piano occupies the drawing room .
Throughout the building , paintings personally commissioned by Clark hang on the walls .
Outside , carefully trimmed gardens and statues invite readers to pause in their studies .
Clark ’s influence also appears in the books themselves .
Experts say his foresight is a major reason the library continues to stand out .
Instead of hunting the most sought - after Elizabethan texts , he focused on later writers such as John Dryden and Oscar Wilde .
The collection — which has grown to include 110,000 rare books and a large archive of manuscripts and documents — draws researchers from around the world , said Bruce Whiteman , the head librarian .
Scholarship is very much a part of Clark ’s legacy , Whiteman said .
“ Clark was n’t one of those collectors who treated his collection as personal property ; he responded openly to scholars who wanted to study his books .
In that sense , you see why he gave the library to a public institution . ”
In 1926 , Clark donated the collection ( then around 13,000 books ) and the library grounds , along with a $ 1.5 million endowment , to the Southern Branch of the University of California , which later became UCLA .
The school assumed full control when Clark died in 1934 .
His will contained only one restriction — that books could only leave the library for repairs .
The endowment covers book purchases and library maintenance , while UCLA pays staff salaries .
The library is open to the public , but readers must register and provide photo identification .
On a typical day , 10 to 12 people visit , Whiteman said .
Summers are the busiest time because that ’s when scholars from other universities are free to travel .
Each year , the library hosts a visiting professor who plans a series of literary conferences , and offers several graduate fellowships .
The library also produces a winter concert series .
Dr. Paul Chrzanowski certainly liked it .
A nuclear physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , Chrzanowski spent years building up a Shakespeare collection , the playwright ’s works as well as texts he may have read .
The collection grew to 72 books , published between 1479 and 1731 .
It was appraised at just under $ 2 million .
In 2009 , Chrzanowski decided to donate it to the Clark Library .
“ It just felt right , ” he said .

Mobile apps , such as DocScanner ( iPhone / Android ) , are available for on - the - go and casual document scanning .
If you 're really taking the leap into a paper - free existence , however , you 're going to need an actual scanner suited for the job .
Nowadays , with the proliferation of inexpensive multifunction printers , you may already have one .
Many multifunctions not only have a flatbed scanner but a sheet - fed document scanner as well .
Additionally , if you can scan to an SD card ( or other flash media ) your scanner may be able to create multi-page PDFs for you without even connecting to your computer .
If not — or if you 'd just prefer to go all out — there are a number of scanners that are designed to help you .
Here 's a short list :
Advertisement
Finding a used sheet - fed scanner is always a nice way to save some money , and when you 're finished scanning your paper you can always sell it yourself to recoup some of the cost .
Scanning software is another choice in the process , and there are several :
Advertisement
No matter what you choose , you 're going to discover that you can't approach all paper in exactly the same way .
You 'll want to consider the following :
The different types of paper you 'll be scanning and if your scanner can handle each size .
Whether or not you 'll be scanning color documents and documents printed on non-white paper .
If you 'll need software that can perform OCR .
If you 'll need to scan any double - sided materials .
The types of documents you 'll be scanning .
For example , are they all typed - text documents or will you be scanning handwritten notes as well ?
Advertisement
While it would be next to impossible to cover every type of paper you may encounter , below are a few common varieties and tips on how to handle them .
Notes
Taking notes on a laptop may be the easiest way to eliminate paper from the get - go but it 's not always possible .
If you have to take notes on paper — or if you prefer it — you have the option of either using a smart pen device , scanning your notes manually or both .
Advertisement
If you choose a digital pen , like the LiveScribe Pulse , Logitech io , and IRISNotes , you can capture handwritten notes as you write them .
Some offer software that converts your handwriting into typed text .
Scanning can be a drag when you have a notebook , but notebooks with removable or tear - out pages are an easy way to simply add the notes to your sheet - fed scanner .
If you have a traditional notebook , however , there is a trick to removing pages cleanly and easily .
Advertisement
One last thing to keep in mind when scanning notes is whether or not your scanner can handle double - sided pages on its own .
If it can't , you 'll have to choose between manually scanning each side of the page on your own or only using one side of the paper when writing your notes .
Receipts
Receipt scanning has become especially popular because of all the benefits it provides when doing your taxes .
Receipts are also important in warranty claims and occasionally when reselling your old purchases .
They 're easy to lose so a digital copy is very handy , especially when you introduce OCR into the equation .
Being able to search the text in your receipts makes finding the information you need quick and simple .
Advertisement
Because some receipts get especially long , not all sheet - fed scanners can handle them .
Neat makes a few products design to handle receipts .
There are also mobile apps , such as QuickPic and JotNot Scanner , that can scan receipts on the go .
If you 're having trouble scanning a receipt because of its size , one work - around is cutting the receipt into pieces that will fit on a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper and taping them to it .
This will give the scanner , whether it 's sheet - fed or flatbed , a size it recognizes .

Business Cards
Business card scanning can come with some of the same issues you 'll encounter with receipts .
If you have a large collection already , you 've probably noticed sizes and materials can vary quite a bit .
You may even end up with circular cards .
While you can use many of the same tricks as you would with receipts , there are plenty of dedicated business card scanners .
Because of the odd forms business cards sometimes take , you may find , on occasion , that a camera works best — even a mobile phone camera .
There are a number of mobile apps that handle business card scanning .
WorldCard Mobile ( iPhone ) , scanR ( iPhone / Android / Blackberry / Nokia S60 ) and ScanBizCards ( iPhone ) are a few options .
Manuals
The wonderful thing about digitizing instruction manuals is that you generally do n't have to .
Most manuals can be downloaded from the product manufacturer 's site .
If you can't find them by searching for the product code , you may have luck by searching for a code printed on the manual .
Many manuals will display a string of numbers printed on the front or back .
Search for those and you may find the PDF you 're looking for .

Reading Material ( Books , Screenplays , Etc. )
Chances are you wo n't be digitizing your entire collection of literature just yet .
Scanning a book is a far more complex process than just about anything else you 'll deal with .
Wikipedia outlines the process pretty thoroughly , and companies like Atiz provide the complex equipment and software to get the job done , but DIYBookScanner.org will help you do it yourself .
Instructables and Eric Mack each provide tutorials for scanning textbooks yourself .
Of course , you do n't always have to scan books yourself .
Dreamhost 's ePubBud digitizes your children 's books for free .
Google Books has already scanned several books that are available online for free .
The Internet Archive , Free eBooks and others provide free digital literature as well .

Sheet Music
Sheet music can be scanned like any other single or multi-page document , however it 's important to note that some sheet - fed scanners can introduce artifacts into more complex documents .
In some cases a flatbed scanner may be better .
Alternatively , you may not have to scan your sheet music at all .
Many instrument - specific MIDI files can be converted into playable sheet music .
Most sequencing software provides the option to view MIDI data as sheet music , and products like Sibelius and Finale can import MIDI files for further arrangement .
MIDINotate ( Windows ) and Rosegarden ( Linux ) are simpler options , and Apple 's GarageBand ( Mac ) can easily import MIDI data and display it as sheet music .
8 notes.com also offers a free online converter if you do n't want to install any software at all .

Photos
Nowadays digital cameras capture more than just pictures .
Digital photos come with exchangeable image file format ( EXIF ) data and , in some cases , location information .
Old photos are just photos , but fortunately software like A Better Finder Attributes ( Mac ) , XnView ( Windows ) , and jhead ( Linux ) can help add EXIF data to your scanned images .
Advertisement
Actually scanning the images can be a challenge , too .
Some sheet - fed scanners can cause artifacts in photos , so flatbed scanners may be a better option .
The scan itself comes with its own set of issues .
Post - scan you may have to correct color and image orientation .
You 'll need to choose an adequate resolution .
Additionally , if you scan several photos in a flatbed scanner you 'll need to separate each photo .
Image detection and orientation correction is something newer scanning software can often handle automatically , but be sure before making your image scanning software selection .
The resolution you choose can be important as well , but if you are scanning low resolution photos , a higher DPI setting is n't going to make a difference .
300 DPI is a good minimum ( about the equivalent of a 2 megapixel photo ) , but 600 DPI ( about the equivalent of an 8 megapixel photo ) is generally the sweet spot for photo scans .
Once your photos have been scanned , you may want to bring them into Photoshop ( or other image - editing software ) to clean and sharpen them up as well as correct color .

Negatives and Slides
Scanning negatives and slides is a little more complex than your average image because light needs to pass through the film in order to digitally capture the image .
Dedicated negative and slide scanners exist , but flatbed scanners with transparency adapters will work just fine .

Because scanning negatives and slides involves enlarging a tiny image , dust can become a big problem .
You do n't want to actually touch the negative or slide , but you can remove dust using a can of compressed air .
You 'll also want to clean off the scanner bed each time you scan to avoid dust as well .
Compressed air will work here as well , but dust wipes are also very effective .
Advertisement
When performing the actual scanning , the software included with your scanner may be your best option .
You 'll want to select specifically what you 're scanning , as you 're not necessarily looking to scan the negative but rather the positive reproduction of the negative .
Once your scan is complete , you can treat it like you would any other image .

Audio
Most everyone knows how to rip CDs , but dealing with older media can be a greater challenge .
Additionally , maintaining a digital music collection often means leaving behind album artwork , lyric books and more — but it does n't have to .

Album Art and Booklets
Finding album art is easy nowadays .
A Google Image , Amazon , or albumart.org search will often turn up what you 're looking for .
Even iTunes can locate album artwork on its own .
Booklets , on the other hand , are harder to come by .
Since iTunes added digital booklets to albums , and those digital booklets are in the PDF format , you can scan accompanying materials from your CDs and attach them to the corresponding album in iTunes .

Scanning is covered comprehensively in the paper and image sections of this guide , so let 's assume you 've managed to scan in the booklet .
Adding it to iTunes involves the same process as any other compatible file : drag it onto your iTunes library or choose " Add to Library " from the File menu and select the scanned PDF .
The only remaining step is to edit the ID3 tags to match the corresponding album .
To do this simply select the PDF you just imported , choose " Get Info " from the File menu , and type in the name of the album with which you want the PDF to appear .
This will cause the PDF to appear with music in album view and show up in searches for that particular album .
Cassette Tapes
Audio cassettes are actually very simple to digitize .
Because most cassette players provide an 1/8 " stereo output and most desktop and laptop computers also provide a 1/8 " stereo input , you can buy a cheap 1/ 8 " stereo cable and connect the two together .
You can use any software capable of recording audio on your computer to capture the output of the cassette player .
Just press play on the cassette player and record in your audio software of choice .
Advertisement
The process is , of course , a little more complex than just simply recording .
The digital recording you end up with may not be up to your standards .
You 'll want to at least normalize the audio levels of the recording , if not each track individually , before exporting each track separately .
There are also tools like BIAS SoundSoap that can help remove imperfections in the recordings , such as crackle and hum .
Roxio Spin Doctor is software designed to help make the entire process easier .
If you need a free application for recording audio , Audacity is available for Windows , Mac and Linux .
For more information on digitizing cassette tapes , check out Rick Broida 's post .

LPs
Digitizing your old LPs is a similar process , but you either need a digital turntable or a pre-amp to use an existing one .
The ART USB Phono Plus v2 is a USB pre-amp , bypassing the need for an audio input on your computer .
However , if you 'd prefer to use your computer 's audio input and a standard pre-amp , that will work just fine as well .

While analog audio enjoys a retro-resurgence , tapes are becoming a lost format in the video world .
With many digital formats forgoing tapes entirely , it 's becoming more difficult to digitize your old media .

Tapes ( VHS , Hi8 , Etc. )
Analog - to - digital video converters are the most common tools for digitizing your old tapes .
In fact , your DV camera may have conversion capabilities .
If you can input composite audio and video or s-video to your DV camera you can use it to digitize just about any analog source .
All you 'll need to get it onto your computer is software that can handle a DV stream .
Pretty much any video editing software made in the last decade can capture DV so you wo n't be hard - pressed to find something .
Apple 's iMovie and Final Cut Express / Pro ( Mac ) , Windows Movie Maker ( Windows ) , and Kino ( Linux ) are just a few examples .
If you do n't have a DV Camera , you can also use TV Tuner cards with composite input or DV bridges made specifically for the purpose of converting analog video .
For more information , Videohelp.org covers the analog - to - digital conversion process in greater detail .
While newer video recording formats tend to avoid or minimize the pitfalls of quality degradation through use , VHS tapes do not provide that luxury .
You may find that when digitizing especially worn - out VHS tapes , the digital signal will cut out due to something as minor as a little jitter .
This is due to a break in the timecode on the VHS tape .
The simplest way around this issue is to obtain a high - quality , professional VHS deck with a time - base corrector .
The time - base corrector will generate the timecode instead of the actual tape and this will prevent the jitter .
While these decks were once fairly expensive , you can now find them used online for a fairly reasonable price .

Most analog video formats can be digitized by utilizing a converter , but in the case of Hi8 tapes you have another option .
Sony created Digital8 camcorders that have the ability to digitize Hi8 tapes in - camera and output a DV signal .
Though the suggestion so far has been to save video in the DV codec , with enough video you 'll need a significant amount of disk space to store it .
If you 're comfortable with more aggressive compression , encoding your newly digitized videos in MPEG4 or H.264 will help save a significant amount of space .
Encoding at a data rate of around 2 mbps and an audio data rate of 192 kbps should provide you with a smaller file and a negligible loss of quality .

DVDs
DVDs have n't taken the turn towards obsolescence yet , but if you want to back up your DVD collection , take copies with you on your portable media player or just have a completely file - based collection of your movies you need to rip them .
Lifehacker 's covered the topic of DVD - ripping pretty extensively in the following articles :

Storage and Organization
If you 've made it this far , we 've talked about creating a ton of files .
With thousands of new documents , pictures , songs and videos you 'll need a plan to keep things organized .
Ultimately this will be defined by you , but storage options will help you dictate what you 'll do with your newly digitized life .

Local Storage
The easiest method of storage is buying a large external hard drive and organizing the files in a simple folder structure .
The upside is the simplicity of it .
The downside is that you have no backup .
If you do n't plan to store your files anywhere online , you 'll want to — at the very least — purchase redundant storage so a hard drive failure wo n't necessarily cause the loss of your data .
Configuring a RAID Array is the more common and best methods of accomplishing this , but keeping a separate copy is also a good idea as RAID gives you data parity but not necessarily a backup .
If you do keep a separate backup , storing it in a fire safe box or somewhere outside of your home will reduce the risk of losing your data .

If you want to share your digitized life with others in your home , you might consider a network - attached storage ( NAS ) device .
Data Robotics offers very simple solutions with few features while Netgear , Synology , HP , DELL , Seagate , Western Digital , Buffalo , Linksys , Iomega and others offer more feature - rich NAS devices of varying complexity .
You can also build your own .

Cloud Storage
While local storage is somewhat of a necessity , keeping local backups is n't .
With excellent online backup tools available for free or very little money , storing your data in the cloud is another option .
Online storage does n't necessarily need to be an exact replica of your local drive .
An alternative to storing your data using a backup service is posting your media to social media sites .
There are several options for video and photos .
OfficeDrop ( formerly Pixily ) hosts your documents .
You 're not confined to using traditional storage and bearing the associated costs thanks to a number of free and low - cost sites that handle it for you .
The exchange ?
You may have to settle for a lower quality copy of your digitized life .

Talking about storage is a lot like talking to a lawyer : they 're always going to give you a conservative response .
It 's easy to say you need to keep three copies of everything and go through as much trouble as you can bear to ensure you never lose your precious data .
There 's nothing inherently wrong with this approach but it 's not necessarily realistic for many people .
When deciding how you 're going to store your digitized life , be sure to factor in a storage and organization process you 'll actually follow .
Find a balance that allows you to keep your data safe while not overwhelming you with too much extra work .
Although this guide is comprehensive , digitizing your life is an enormous process that can never be covered by a single post .
If you 're digitizing your life — or any part of it — and have something to contribute , please post in the comments .

Ex -Bischof Mixa erhält Pension von 5.400 Euro monatlich - aus Steuergeldern Florian Rötzer
Die Kirche hat den gestrauchelten Bischof aus dem Verkehr gezogen , dem Staat liegt er weiter auf Geldbeutel , damit es dem Geistlichen materiell an nichts fehlt
Bayerischer Bischof müsste man sein .
Die werden nämlich wie zahlreiche Kanoniker , Vikare oder Direktoren und Erzieher an kirchlichen Schulen nicht etwa von den 1,2 Milliarden Euro bezahlt , die der Staat an Kirchensteuer für die katholische Kirche einzieht .
Das bringen alle Steuerzahler auf , um die Kirche und ihre Würdenträger zu unterstützen .
Beide Kirchen erhalten jährlich allein 450 Millionen Euro von allen Steuerzahlern zusätzlich zur Kirchensteuer für Personalkosten der Bischöfe , Pfarrer und Theologen .
Und allein dem Bistum Augsburg , an dem Mixa tätig war , zahlt der Staat 2010 17,608 Millionen Euro an " Pflichtabgaben " .
2009 waren es noch knapp 17 Millionen .
Das gilt selbstverständlich auch für schwarze Schafe wie Bischof Mixa , der wegen Verfehlungen genötigt wurde zurückzutreten , auch wenn er sich lange zierte und lieber versetzt werden wollte .
Dabei ging es um Vorwürfe , als Pfarrer Stiftungsgelder missbraucht zu haben , um seine Neigungen zum Alkohol und zum prügelnden Strafen von Heimkindern , aber auch um Falschaussagen .
Angeblich soll er zudem junge Priesterseminaristen aus dem " Collegium Willibaldinum " in seine Privatgemächer eingeladen , um mit ihnen in die Sauna zu gehen .
Schwamm drüber , möchte man sagen .
Aber der gefallene " Würdenträger " der katholischen Kirche , der als Bischof vom Staat , also von den bayerischen Steuerzahlern , mit vermutlich 8.000 Euro Grundgehalt nicht schlecht honoriert wurde , ist nur von gewissen Ämtern zurückgetreten , wie man hört .
Vielleicht auch um sicher zu gehen , dass der umtriebige Ex-Bischof nichts mehr anstellt , wird er seinen Ruhestand in einem Frauenkloster zubringen - nämlich bei den Franziskanerinnen der Maria - Stern - Schwestern in Fünfstetten im Landkreis Donau - Ries .
Wenn er will , darf er aber weiterhin seelsorgerisch tätig sein und Sakramente spenden .
Man schafft den Mann für die Öffentlichkeit also beiseite und stellt ihn innerkirchlich weitgehend kalt , aber von wirklicher Buße scheint man im Vatikan nichts zu halten , bei Mixa selbst ist davon sowieso keine Rede .
Er lässt es sich mit Steuergeldern gut gehen , die ihm ein Einkommen und einen Wohlstand sichern , der weit über das hinausgeht , was die meisten Menschen nicht nur im Ruhestand , sondern auch arbeitend erwarten können .
Als Geistlicher schmäht man den Luxus und das Materielle nicht , und die katholische Kirche scheut sich nicht , ihren gestolperten Würdeträger weiterhin vom Staat bezahlen zu lassen , anstatt zumindest hier finanziell einzuspringen .
Da sei Gott vor .
Mixa erhält jedoch nicht nur weiter Steuergelder in Höhe von 5.400 Euro monatlich brutto , also 70 Prozent seines früheren Bischofsgehalts , wie das bayerische Kultusministerium bestätigte , sondern auch eine Aufwandsentschädigung als früherer Militärbischof .
Die Kosten für den Alterswohnsitz trägt wohl die Kirche und damit auch zum Teil alle Steuerzahler .
Es wird Mixa also wahrscheinlich nicht an reichlich Wein , gutem Essen , schönen Reisen und teurem Mobiliar fehlen .
Image caption Professor Dawkins said he would never want to indoctrinate children in atheism
Atheists could set up their own schools in England under the government 's education reforms , Education Secretary Michael Gove has said .
Mr Gove said he would be " interested " in proposals from individuals such as atheist Professor Richard Dawkins .
Last month Prof Dawkins , who wrote The God Delusion , said he liked the idea of starting a " free - thinking free school " .
Under Mr Gove 's " free schools " plan , parents , teachers and others will be able to set up their own schools .
But Mr Gove said he would not choose such a school for his children .
Answering questions from MPs on the Commons education select committee on Wednesday , Mr Gove said : " One of the most striking things that I read recently was a thought from Richard Dawkins that he might want to take advantage of our education legislation to open a new school , which was set up on an explicitly atheist basis .
" It would n't be my choice of school , but the whole point about our education reforms is that they are , in the broad sense of the word , small " l " , liberal , that they exist to provide that greater degree of choice . "
' Sceptical and critical '
Mr Gove , whose two children attend a church primary school , told the cross-party group of MPs that he " recognised that there are some people who explicitly do not want their children educated in a faith - based setting " .
" One of the principles behind our education reforms is to give people the maximum amount of choice so that those people , and they may not themselves necessarily have a very strong religious faith , but who believe that the ethos and values of faith - based education are right for their child , have that choice but others who want a different approach can take it as well . "
Speaking after the hearing , Mr Gove said he had seen a reference to Professor Dawkins expressing an interest in establishing a school .
" If Professor Dawkins wants to set up a school we would be very interested to look at an application . "
In June , Prof Dawkins said in a conversation on the Mumsnet website : " I like the idea very much , although I would prefer to call it a free - thinking free school .
" I would never want to indoctrinate children in atheism , any more than in religion .
Instead , children should be taught to ask for evidence , to be sceptical , critical , open - minded . "
It was one of those moments when you try something new and you know what the joy of good food is .
So said resident sis after we had practically inhaled a lunch of mildly sweet and delicate gravad lax from Kinvara Smoked Salmon ( proving that you do n’t have to be famous to get quoted on this blog , but it does help if you ’re related ) .
She ’s in good company as far as her opinion of Kinvara ’s smoked salmon goes .
Nigel Slater and Jeffrey Steingarten are among the noteworthy food writers who have had kind words to say on that particular subject .
Having worked my way through the samples very kindly sent to me , I ca n’t say that I would object to finding any of them on my plate ( though the gravad lax remains a particular favourite ) .
And though it is fair to say that you should do very little to good smoked salmon except eat it , I think that there ’s nothing wrong with using some classic potato salad to provide a soft , creamy filling around which to wrap a slice of perfectly smoked salmon .
But there again , I would say that .
You can quote me if you like .

This part hardly needs a formal recipe – just wrap your slices of salmon around a dollop of potato salad , serve with a wedge of lemon and some dill and you ’re done .
Apart from eating the end result , that is , but I was taking that part as read .
The amount of filling you can add to a slice of salmon will naturally depend on the size of the slices you have .
The slices of Kinvara smoked salmon were around 15 cm long and between 5 cm and 8 cm wide and I filled them with 2 heaped tablespoons of the salad .
Adjust according to the size of slices you have .
You could serve a couple of these as a starter , say , or for a lunch serving , have two or three of these with an additional helping of the salad on the side , along with some brown soda bread .
You ’ll need : Smoked salmon , sliced fairly thinly , with individual slices large enough to be formed into a small filled roll
Potato and egg salad ( see below )
Lemon wedges to serve
Chopped dill to garnish The Steps : Scoop around 2 heaped tblsp of potato salad onto the centre of each slice of smoked salmon and form into a roll .
onto the centre of each slice of and form into a roll .
Garnished with chopped dill and serve with a lemon wedge .
The Results :
As many filled smoked salmon rolls as you have slices of salmon .

Alex , your method did n’t work for me immediately but I found a method
that works for me and may help others .
I have a MacBook Pro ( 64 - bit ) running OS X 10.6 .
Like others , I wanted to run Ruby 1.9.2 ( latest ) and wxRuby 2.0.1
( latest ) .
I use RVM to install Ruby 1.9.2 ( and manage my ruby versions ) .
( See http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac)
By default , RVM builds the Ruby 64 - bit version ( only ) .
I finally found a post that indicates how to build both 32 - bit and
64 - bit versions of Ruby .
Briefly , here ’s how users can get both built :
rvm install ruby - 1.9.2 - head -C --with-arch=x86_64,i386
Here ’s how to check what you have :
file which ruby | perl - pe ‘ s|^.*/| | ’
( Which will produce output like this : )
ruby : Mach - O universal binary with 2 architectures
ruby ( for architecture x86_64 ) : Mach - O 64 - bit executable x86_64
ruby ( for architecture i386 ) : Mach - O executable i386
Visit :
http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=35
And , download this gem :
wxruby - ruby19-2.0.1-x86-darwin-9.gem
Now , install the gem ( no sudo required ) :
( Note , you may want to cd to your Downloads folder . )
gem install wxruby - ruby19- 2.0.1-x86-darwin-9
Successfully installed wxruby - ruby19- 2.0.1-x86-darwin-9
Create a wxruby test script ( wxtest.rb ) :
#!/usr/bin/env arch -i386 ruby
require ‘ wx ’
include Wx
App.run do
frame = Frame.new ( nil , : title =>
‘ So far , so good … ’ )
frame .show
end
And run it :
ruby wxtest.rb
Ok , so this particular working set produced a window .
So , we ( or I anyway ) have a way to proceed .
Alex -
I hope this somehow helps you find out what the problem
( 32 - bit vs 64 - bit ) might be .
Any thoughts ?
Cheers ,
Ridge
Ich schreib ' doch nicht einfach 'ne Mail ... Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Zum gefühlten 100.000sten Mal beklagt das BKA , dass die Löschung von seiner Meinung nach kinderpornographischen Seiten nicht schnell genug möglich ist .
Den unbürokratischen
Weg klammert man weiterhin aus .
Der deutsche BKA - Mitarbeiter ist offensichtlich ein Mensch , dessen Handeln davon bestimmt ist , dass es in irgendeiner Form " obrigkeitlich " wirkt .
Sich mit dem gemeinen Pöbel auf eine Stufe zu stellen , ist eine Zumutung , die dem deutschen Strafverfolger par excellence sofortig Kopfschmerzen einbringen würde , weshalb ein wenig Mitleid für seine prekäre Lage sein muss .
Da sitzt also dieses Muster an Redlichkeit in seinem Büro und langweilt sich .
Was soll man auch tun an einem solch schönen Tag , wenn die spannende Überwachung von Pizzabäckern und Soziologen gerade durch Gerichte gestoppt wurde und es keine Honigt ...
Homepages mehr zu kontrollieren gibt ?
Doch die Rettung naht in Form einer Meldung : auf Homepage xy , URL wie folgt : (... ) ist kinderpornographisches Material zu sehen .
Anders als der gemeine Mitbürger stürzt sich aber der BKA - Mitarbeiter nicht sofort in ein Meer aus Aktionismus , nein , er betritt mit Verve den Dienstweg und geht langsam auf diesem voran , bis er irgendwann sieht , dass es anscheinend auf der Straße zur Kinderpornographie immer noch viele Fahrende gibt , so dass ein Stoppschild angeraten wäre .
So ähnlich muss man es sich wohl vorstellen , wenn man hört , dass zum x- ten Male das BKA beklagt , dass die Löschung von Seiten mit kinderpornographischen Inhalten zu lang auf sich warten lässt .
Diesmal gibt es als Sahnehäubchen für die bekannten " Argumente " noch eine Studie .
Die Studie sagt im wesentlichen wenig aus , so fehlen beispielsweise ( zumindest bisher ) die Gründe dafür , dass die Seiten weiterhin online sind .
Handelt es sich um Seiten , die in den jeweiligen Staaten legal sind ?
Nimmt die Ermittlung in den jeweiligen Staaten viel Zeit in Anspruch ?
Woran liegt es im Detail ?
Darüber schweigt die Studie sich bisher aus .
Wer sich den Dienstweg , den der emsige Mitarbeiter nimmt , anschaut , den verwundert es nicht , dass es beim BKA länger dauert als bei einem " Otto Normalmelder " , bis die Provider reagieren .
Das vom BKA angewendete Verfahren zum Löschen von Kinderpornos umfasst derzeit in der Regel noch verschiedene Stufen .
Die Polizeibehörde kontaktiert nach Hinweisen der deutschen Internet - Beschwerdestelle zunächst meist kooperierende Strafverfolgungsstellen in den ausgemachten Ländern oder das zentrale Netzwerk Interpol .
Und da sind wir beim Elitebewusstsein des redlichen BKA - Mitarbeiters .
Nein , für ihn wäre das viel zu profan , einfach den Provider _formlos_ zu kontaktieren wie jeder Hans und Franz , da muss es schon hochoffiziell zugehen .
Da kann der Wissenschaftliche Dienst sagen , was er will , einfach mal eine Mail an abuse@ ... schreiben ist für das BKA viel zu gewöhnlich .
Natürlich drückt man das höflicher aus und meint , dass aus Respekt vor der Strafverfolgung und der Gesetzeslage im anderen Land sowie dem Provider man nicht einfach mal so Einfluss nehmen könne .
Dabei wäre eine banale Mail in formloser
Art ja nicht einmal eine Einflussnahme , sondern lediglich ein Hinweis , der , wie sich ja bei Experimenten durch Private zeigte , durchaus zu schnellen Reaktionen seitens der Provider führt .
Aber sehen wir es mal von der Warte des BKA aus :
Da will man unbedingt die seit langem von El Chefe , Jörg Ziercke , geforderten Netzsperren , hat sich so viel Mühe gegeben , die falschen Zahlen gemeinsam mit der jetzigen Bundesarbeitsministerin zu veröffentlichen und zu wiederholen und extra Verträge mit den Providern ( Geheimverträge , wie es sich in einer Demokratie gehört , wenn es um Strafverfolgungsinteressen geht ) geschlossen und jetzt soll das alles für die Katz gewesen sein ?
Jetzt soll man kurz _mailen_ oder _telefonieren_ ?
Nein nein , das geht so gar nicht , da muss es schon etwas mehr sein .
Lange Dienstwege , hochoffizielles Agieren und Netzsperren eben - das ganze Programm .
Da hat man doch auch wieder was zu tun und .
Und wenn der harte Arbeitstag vorbei ist , dann schaltet man das Licht und die Besorgnis aus und lässt beides auch bis zum nächsten Tag im Offline - Modus .
Nicht , dass noch ein BKA - Mitarbeiter auf die Idee kommt , die Seite einfach inoffiziell und privat zu melden .
Glenn Beck Announces
He May Go Blind in a Year Glenn Beck announced that he has macular dystrophy and may be blind in a year .
Jul. 21 , 2010  --
During a tearful speech , Glenn Beck announced that he " might go blind in the next year " due to a rare eye condition known as macular dystrophy .
After having difficulty focusing his eyes , Beck went to see an eye doctor and was told he could be blind within a year , or not , depending on the progression of his disease .
The announcement came during Beck 's final keynote speech of his " American Revival " tour in Salt Lake City , Utah , and was used illustrate a point Beck was making about the blessings of God .
" After I stopped feeling sorry for myself , I truly came to a place which is the greatest blessing : Lord , if you need my eyes , they 're yours .
They were yours the whole time anyway .
Thank you for letting me see as far as I have , " he said .
But the Fox News talk show host may have been speaking figuratively when he referred to his possible blindness , as macular dystrophies , by definition , only result in the loss of macular , or central vision , leaving the peripheral vision intact .
" Macular dystrophies lead to a very slow , progressive deterioration of central vision , " says Dr. Sophie Bakri , associate professor of Ophthalmology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
Dr. Bakri has not examined Beck but is an expert in vitreoretinal diseases like macular dystrophy .
" Although in the advanced stages , patients may be ' legally blind ' and unable to drive or read the newspaper , their peripheral vision remains unaffected and they are able to see light , shadows and some large letters . "
Beck could have any one of a number of forms of macular dystrophy , all with different symptoms and prognoses , but representatives for Beck refused to comment on the record about more specific details of his condition .
Given his age , 46 , it is most likely that Beck has a form of retinal macular dystrophy , says Bakri , and unfortunately , there are currently no treatments for these disorders .
This means that it is likely the conservative commentator will slowly lose his central vision , his ability to recognize faces , to read , and to perform other tasks that require the ability to see detail .
Glenn Beck May Become Partially Blind
" With what we know now about his symptoms , the bottom line is that it appears he has a macular problem that has a risk of getting worse and damaging his vision , " says Dr. Michael Marmor , a retinal specialist at Stanford University School of Medicine and clinical correspondent with the American Academy of Opthalmology .
The speed of his condition 's progression , however , is unknown , says Bakri , as it varies from case to case , hence the prognosis of " you could be blind in a year , or not " , as Beck reported .
Macular Dystrophy and Best's Disease
Vania Klee , 21 , a student in Sacramento , Calif. , has been experiencing the gradual vision loss of macular dystrophy since she was born .
" I was n't diagnosed until I was five .
[ Then ]
I could n't see very far , only five to 10 feet in front of me and I had consistent headaches because I was constantly straining my eyes . "
Klee has vitelliform macular dystrophy , a genetically inherited form of dystrophy that affects the retina and causes progressive loss of central vision .
When it strikes patients at a younger age , it tends to be more severe and is known as Best 's Disease .
The macula is the most sensitive part of the retina , the light - sensitive covering on the back of the eyeball , explains Dr. Alan Glazier , an opthalmologist based in Rockville , Md .
" The small spot [ of the macula ] is responsbile for most of your vision .
It allows you to see detail , to read , recognize faces , and drive , " he says .
When the macula degenerates , you have difficulty performing these tasks .
At this point , Klee can still read , but only in size 16 font or larger and she uses a cane to help her navigate at night , as her condition affects her night vision .
" I was in denial for a while , but I can't really hide the fact that I can't see that well .
I will never be able to drive , I can't recognize faces , and that kind of hits me hard sometimes , " she says .
Klee attended a school for low vision after high school that taught her Braille and other skills to help her live independently given her degenerating vision .
" I 've had so much support from my family and friends and now from the blind community , " she says , and this has helped her get through the ups and downs of her disease .
Though he has not examined Beck , Glazier felt that it was most likely , given his symptoms and age , that he also suffers from vitelliform macular dystrophy , of the adult - onset variety .
" If it is vitelliform , then there is no treatment , which is probably why he 's so devastated , " he says , referring to Beck 's tearful explanation of his future loss of vision .
Beck sought solace in his faith and also in humor .
He tried to make light of his prognosis in Saturday 's speech , bemoaning the fact that he loves to read but will be " too darn lazy to learn Braille . "

Loofah sponges , also known as luffas or sponge gourds , require a long , warm growing season to reach full maturity , and may not fully ripen in cool climates .
In USDA plant hardiness zones 5 through 10 , however , loofah plants typically thrive and produce sponges before the first frost .
Mature fruits become sponges after harvesting and drying , and because these vigorous , climbing plants cannot tolerate cold temperatures , they are treated as annuals and discarded at the end of the growing season .
In addition to the valuable fruits , loofah sponge plants also produce yellow , edible flowers and attractive foliage and vines .
Start loofah seeds indoors in cell packs in mid April to ensure all danger of frost has passed .
Soak the seeds in warm water for 24 to 48 hours prior to planting in the cell pack to initiate germination .
Dampen the soil in the cell packs once every three to four days to keep it from drying out completely .
Loofah sponges , also known as luffas or sponge gourds , require a long , warm growing season to reach full maturity , and may not fully ripen in cool climates .
Transplant loofah sprouts into the garden during mid-May .
Choose a planting site that receives full sunlight and is near a fence or trellis at least 5 to 6 feet high .
Form small hills in the soil 4 to 6 inches in height and 6 feet apart .
Plant one to three loofah sprouts in each hill .
Apply a 1 - to 2 - inch layer of organic mulch to the soil surrounding the loofah hills .
Replenish the mulch whenever necessary to keep the layer at about 2 inches thick .
Do not pile the mulch on top of the hills , as this can result in disease and prevent growth .
Transplant loofah sprouts into the garden during mid-May .
Apply a 1 - to 2 - inch layer of organic mulch to the soil surrounding the loofah hills .
Water loofahs once every five days to keep the soil consistently moist , yet not soggy .
Apply water directly to the soil , as moist foliage is more susceptible to pests and disease .
Do not water on weeks that receive more than 2 inches of rainfall .
Reduce watering frequency to once every week during late summer .
Fertilize loofah sponge plants once each month using a complete 10 - 10 - 10 NPK fertilizer to provide plenty of nutrition for vine , flower and fruit formation .
Decrease the frequency of fertilization to once every two months during late summer .
Apply according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Water loofahs once every five days to keep the soil consistently moist , yet not soggy .
Decrease the frequency of fertilization to once every two months during late summer .
Train the loofah sponge vines to climb the support structure by hanging each vine over the fence or trellis as it grows , and soon the vines will begin to climb on their own .
Use garden twine to secure young vines to the structure if necessary .
Never allow fruit to sit on the ground , as it will quickly rot and become unusable .
Harvest loofah sponges immediately after the first frost of the season when the outer skin on the fruit begins to turn yellow and brown .
Grip and twist the sponge from the vine gently until it breaks off .
Tip
Turn the loofah fruit into a sponge by breaking off the bud end of the fruit and shaking out all of the seeds .
Submerge in water for five to seven minutes , then remove the outer skin and pulp .
Trim any excess material from the sponge and allow to air dry in a sunny location for six to eight hours .
Store in a dry location until ready to use .
Use grass clippings or chopped leaves as organic mulch for loofah plants .
On Saturday night Clive Tyldesley announced that the favourite to succeed José Mourinho at Internazionale was Sinisa Mihajlovic .
Admittedly the ITV gurgler - in - chief probably only brought it up in a vain bid to stop himself mentioning " that night in Barcelona " , but even so .
Julie Burchill once observed that rock 'n ' roll turns us into our parents .
One minute you are full of youthful vigour , the next you are wailing " Où sont les Electric Chairs d'antan ? " while your kids roll their eyes and turn up the volume on Spotify .
Sport has a similar effect .
Mindful of that spirit ‑sapping detail , I have strenuously tried to avoid becoming like certain Radio 5 Live personalities who wonder " how a certain Brian Clough would have coped with this situation " with the regularity and reverence of a US evangelical preacher asking : " What would Jesus do ? "
At the mention of Mihajlovic , however , my grip on the remaining shreds of my self - esteem loosened momentarily and I found myself muttering : " You know what ?
There just are n't the grumpy bastards in the game any more . "
During the 1990s , you see , the Yugoslavia captain stomped around the football pitches of the world with such a malign cast to his puss he made Roberto Rivelino look like one of the girlies from High School Musical .
He first came to my attention when he was playing for Sampdoria .
At Samp it seemed he took every free - kick that was within 40 yards of the opposition goal .
His technique was simple : he trundled up from a great distance , and furiously smacked the ball over the defensive wall and straight into the stands .
He did this so often in a game at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in 1998 against the club he may soon coach , Inter , that after half an hour I started to believe he must have spotted a bloke in row G he suspected of making amorous overtures to his wife .
The extraordinary thing was that Mihajlovic was by no means the only really , severely cross-looking footballer of the period .
You only have to think of Roy Keane – purple - headed , pop-veined , teeth - bared like a man -size version of the thing which bursts out of John Hurt 's chest in Alien – to realise that .
In fact , the 90s may well have been the golden era of fuming players .
Hristo Stoichkov , for example , was a Babel of bad - moodiness .
The Bulgarian forward had many talents , he was quick , a great finisher and had a matchless ability to knock opposition defenders over with any available part of his body ( his chest - butting skills were comparable to that of the male sea elephant ) .
Once he started to slow up , however , he confined himself more and more to strutting around the pitch smouldering like a tractor tyre on a farm bonfire .
Watching him at St James ' Park during Euro 96 and at the Stade de la Mosson , Montpellier , two years later as he stood , jaw jutting out , directing his team - mates from the centre circle with a series of sweeping hand gestures , I was convinced that if ever the opportunity arose he'd do a far better job of imitating Benito Mussolini than George C Scott .
Dunga of Brazil was another who was permanently set to a rolling boil .
Crew‑cut and apparently frustrated by his team - mates ' insistence on step - overs and other trickery , he had to be restrained from throttling his bird - like team - mate Bebeto .
Telê Santana used to advise his players to " make love to the ball " .
Dunga , you always sensed , would much prefer to give it a quick hump and then get on with attacking somebody with a chainsaw .
José Luis Chilavert had a number of run-ins with Dunga and his team - mates .
Nicknamed " The Bulldog " , the Paraguayan goalie was so adept at staring you could watch him for an entire match and still be unsure of whether he actually owned a pair of eyelids .
Chilavert was a genuinely world ‑class keeper , he found the net 62 times with free - kicks and penalties and had enough of a political conscience to withdraw from the 1999 Copa América in protest against his government 's failure to spend more on education ( Are you listening , Joe Hart ? ) .
But he will probably be best remembered for a brawl with Faustino Asprilla and gobbing on Roberto Carlos , an act for which The Bulldog offered a whole variety of excuses , not the least of which was that Brazil had taken land from Paraguay during the 1870 war of the triple alliance and never given it back .
When it came to wild - eyed fury between the sticks even Chilavert struggled to match Oliver Kahn , a sulphurous net - minder who spent so much time yelling it seemed that at some point he would turn himself inside out .
In 2000 I caught on TV the final moments of Bayern Munich winning the Bundesliga title , a scene that culminated with Kahn bounding toward the camera bellowing : " Ja! Ja! Ja ! "
As I watched his contorted face and gaping gob , the thought that popped into my head – and God I wish it had n't – was : " Jeez , this must be what he 's like when he 's having sex . "
Ten years later and I still have to drink a large scotch to get to sleep at night .
Life in the 21st century seems all about change .
Back in 1970 Alvin Toffler wrote the bestseller Future Shock predicting the rapid pace of change would overwhelm society and cause future shock .
This book sold six million copies and it seemed everyone knew about it , if not read it .
Toffler did n’t even come close to predicting the changes we went through , and oddly enough no one seems to be suffering from future shock .
It ’s almost as if everyone read the book and exclaimed , “ Bring it on baby , I ’m ready . ”
I would think almost the opposite of future shock is happening .
We ca n’t get enough change .
And we get jaded so easily .
The promise of the final frontier was over before we knew it .
We went to the Moon , been there , done that , checked it off the list .
No need to go further , space is all rocks and no air .
We turned the World Wide Web into Facebook .
Supersonic airlines turned out to be too noisy .
Cloning , ho -hum .
Robots , let them clean floors and gutters .
Artificial life , lost on the back pages .
Global warming which has impeccable science and Biblical size prophecies is easily ignored .
What ’s really going to shake us up and make us take notice ?
What can science discover that the public can’t fail to divert their lives .
Evolution is a mind blowing concept but most people find it easy enough to write off .
Our knowledge of cosmology and the size and shape of the universe is so stunningly magnificent you think everyone on Earth would be stoned on the idea for years , but no .
More attention is paid to Lady Gaga ’s showing off various parts of her skinny bod in outrageous costumes .
So what would knock us on the head with a mind blowing mallet ?
What if SETI started receiving HD video from outer space ?
What if AI singularities started popping up around the globe ?
What if we really did run out of oil and other vital resources ?
What if the oceans did start rising dramatically , or all the ice slid off Greenland ?
What if Sony and Samsung started selling robots smarter than people ?
A lot smarter .
The reason why global warming and evolution can be ignored is they are invisible concepts that require a good deal of knowledge to see .
But video from outer space on ABC World News Tonight is harder to ignore .
A one foot rise in oceans is hard to ignore .
Gasoline selling for $ 15 a gallon is hard to ignore .
Having robots take over all the university and K - 12 teaching jobs would be hard to ignore .
Or would it ?
The public got used to atomic bombs , cloned animals and space travel .
Space travel was quite real but not fun like Star Trek or Star Wars .
It was just boring .
I tend to think the change that will really slap humanity in the face is when we meet someone smarter than us .
Either aliens or AI minds .
When we take over the chimpanzee ’s role as second banana as the # 2 brain power , how will that change society ?
Science fiction is full of scary stories about AI brains and aliens exterminating humanity , but what happens if they do n’t ?
What if they treat us nice , nicer than we treat our fellow species now ?
What if they give us freedom to be whatever we want , and they do n’t try to rule us , but what if these great minds just coexist in the universe with us peacefully ?
With SETI , they would be out there , too far to meet .
With AI minds , they could go live on the Moon to stay out of our way .
But these minds are willing to communicate with us , and it ’s obvious they are so much smarter than us , that the mental distance between us and them is the distance between us and hamsters ?
How will that feel ?
Hamsters do n’t know we ’re smarter , but we ’re not hamsters , we will know .
It ’s not like humanity did n’t live under such conditions before , or assumed to .
When we believed in gods and angels , it was essentially the same relationship and we eventually tuned them out .
We love being # 1 .
I figure no matter how much change happens most people will still think about what ’s to eat , who can I connect genitals with , when can I get the new iPhone , what do I need to get to the next level in Farmville , how can I make more money , and so on .
We are selfish creatures with a narrow focus on our personal needs and desires .
I think it ’s a certainty that the oceans will rise within our lifetimes .
The odds are good we ’ll have artificial minds .
Robots will grow ever more sophisticated .
SETI is a very long shot , but astronomy might get good enough to detect artificial molecules in atmospheres on distant planets , so we will know other minds are out there .
But will people change ?
I do n’t think so .
We can absorb change .
We can change our opinions , but we do n’t seem to change our core personalities .
I know I ’ve tried hard enough .
JWH – 7/11/10
Allowing workers to get endorsements from reputable requesters ( to avoid scam rings like on eBay )
requesters ( to avoid scam rings like on eBay )
Allowing requesters to post machine readable feedback on the performance of the workers , disconnecting evaluation from the approval rate .
Certifications and qualification tests that indeed measure ability on different tasks ( e.g. , language abilities , reading comprehension tests , etc )
Publishing the reputation history of the workers , so that requesters can evaluate the quality of the worker .
Of course , similar measures can be adopted for requesters !
There is a symmetric market for lemons on that side !
Scam requesters post HITs , behave badly , and cause good workers to avoid any newcomer .
New requesters then get only low quality workers , get disappointed with the quality of the results and they leave the market .
In other words , Amazon can only gain by taking the time to build a more robust reputation system on top of Mechanical Turk .
Trust is at the very core of marketplaces .
If Mechanical Turk wants to " grow up " , then a good reputation system for both sides of the market is grossly overdue .
In HCOMP this year , one of the memorable and discussed presentations ( although highly unconventional ) was by M. Six Silberman who discussed the " Sellers ' problems in human computation markets " .
The basic question : can we protect the workers there from exploitation and from sweatshop salaries ?
Luis von
Ahn posted a similar post on his blog .
In the comments of the blog post , someone suggested that the low wages on Mechanical Turk is simply the result of high supply of workers and low demand for their work .
As there is more supply , the salaries drop .
And having minimum wages , would interfere with the free market .
I actually disagree with this interpretation .
First of all , there is no oversupply of labor on Mechanical Turk .
The distribution of completion times ( follows a power law ) , suggests that the market operates at maximum capacity .
My gut instinct actually tells me that , not vice versa .
I can hear the protests :
If there is not enough supply of workers , why do n't requesters simply increase the offered prices ?
My explanation :
The requesters already pay minimum wages for work that is worth minimum wage .
How is that possible given the effective hourly rate of \ $ 2 / hour ?
The basic problem : Spammers .
Given that many large tasks attract spammers , most requesters rely on redundancy to ensure quality .
So instead of having a single worker to do a task , they get 5 workers to work on it .
This increases the effective rate from \ $ 2/ hr to \ $ 10/hr .
Effectively , what Amazon Mechanical Turk is today is a market for lemons , following the terminology of Akerlof 's famous paper , for which he got the 2001 Nobel prize .
is a market where the sellers cannot evaluate beforehand the quality of the goods that they are buying .
So , if you have two types of products ( say good workers and low quality workers ) and cannot tell who is whom , the price that the buyer is willing to pay will be proportional to the average quality of the worker .
So the offered price will be between the price of a good worker and a low quality worker .
What a good worker would do ?
Given that good workers will not get enough payment for their true quality , they leave the market .
This leads the buyer to lower the price even more towards the price for low quality workers .
At the end , we only have low quality workers in the market ( or workers willing to work for similar wages ) and the offered price reflects that .
This is exactly what is happening on Mechanical Turk today .
Requesters pay everyone as if they are low quality workers , assuming that extra quality assurance techniques will be required on top of Mechanical Turk .
So , how can someone resolve such issues ?
The basic solution is the concept of signalling .
Good workers need a method to signal to the buyer their higher quality .
In this way , they can differentiate themselves from low quality workers .
Unfortunately , Amazon has not implemented a good reputation mechanism .
The " number of HITs worked " and the " acceptance percentage " are simply not sufficient signalling mechanisms .
Here are some ideas :
April 17 , 2003
Citizen Petition
The undersigned submit this petition under 21 CFR 10.30 of the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act to request Dr. Mark McClellan , the Commissioner of Food and Drugs , revoke the approval for the marketing of the devices categorized as menstrual cups ( 21CFR 884.5400 ) because there is a high likelihood that the use of these devices as directed will endanger a womans reproductive health by inducing endometriosis .
Action Requested
The FDA administrative record for the two menstrual cups currently marketed shows that neither was required to submit clinical data regarding their safety ( see FDA Freedom of Information ( FOI ) Files : The Keeper : Record K870803 , 1987 ; Instead , softcup : Record K971303 , 1997 ( abridged versions attached ( Addendum A ) ) .
Until the manufacturers of the menstrual cups can submit suitable animal and clinical data to support that these devices can be safely used as directed without increasing the risk or severity of endometriosis , we hereby request the approval for the sale of menstrual cups be revoked .
Statement of Grounds
Summary
Menstrual cups , when used as currently recommended , can be worn for 12 hour periods during menstruation .
They are designed to fit either over the cervix or within the vagina tightly enough so no menstrual debris is released from the body while a cup is in place .
Obstructions of the cervix and vagina are commonly recognized as important factors in inducing endometriosis .
The cervical outlet obstruction inherent in the use of menstrual cups is likely to increase the incidence and severity of endometriosis among women who use these products .
Detailed Statement of Grounds
Menstrual Cups and Endometriosis
A. Menstrual Cups : Approval History and Current Use
Currently there are two menstrual cups approved for sale by the FDA : 1 . The Keeper ( www.keeper.com), a flexible rubber cone , that sits intravaginally to occlude menstrual discharge , and 2 . Instead ( www.Softcup.com), a plastic diaphragm - shaped disc that covers the mouth of the cervix with an impermeable barrier .
The Keeper is a reusable product .
Instead is intended for one time use and disposal .
The package inserts for both products recommend they be used for periods of time not to exceed 12 hours .
The possible effect of these products on the risk of endometriosis is not mentioned in the package inserts .
The approval records for both products show that neither manufacturer was required to submit any clinical data to demonstrate their safety when used as directed ( FOI Files ( attached ) ) .
Thus the possible effects of these products on reproductive health have not been reviewed by the Food & Drug Administration .
Among the possible reproductive effects of the menstrual cups , there is a physiologically credible mechanism whereby their use would increase the incidence or severity of endometriosis .
B. Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a chronic condition that is typically diagnosed clinically because of severe dysmenorrhea .
Asymptomatic cases of endometriosis are often diagnosed during peritoneal surgery .
In rare cases , endometriotic growths are found outside the peritoneum and the reproductive tract .
Since endometriosis develops over an extended time period , the origins of this condition are subject to hypothetical explanations , and no one hypothesis appears to explain all manifestations of the disease ( Guarnaccia et al , 2000 ; Evers , 1996 ; Cramer & Missmer , 2002 ) .
However , a diverse assortment of clinical and animal data are consistent with the Sampson ( menstrual reflux ) hypothesis for explaining the origins of peritoneal endometriosis ( Sampson , 1927 ; Guarnaccia et al , 2000 ; Evers , 1996 ; Cramer & Missmer , 2002 ; DHooghe & Debrock , 2002 ) .
Sampson suggested that peritoneal endometriosis develops when fragments of functional endometrium are released from the surface of the uterus during menstruation and refluxed back through the Fallopian tubes to reach the peritoneal cavity .
Some endometrial fragments attach to peritoneal surfaces , growing and degenerating , cyclically , in conjunction with the menstrual cycle .
These ectopic endometrial growths sometimes cause inappropriate adhesions between peritoneal tissues and organs , producing debilitating pain .
When endometrial tissues occlude the fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes , endometriosis can cause infertility .
There are several sources of clinical and experimental data that support the Sampson hypothesis and the role that out flow obstruction can play in the induction of endometriosis . ( figure 1 )
First , the collected anatomical analyses of the distribution of endometriotic growths in the peritoneum are consistent with the fallopian tubes as a source for the seeding tissue ( Guarnaccia et al , 2000 ) .
Second , women born with congenital defects of their reproductive tract which prevent menstrual debris from being discharged through the cervix or vagina typically develop severe forms of endometriosis ( Pinsonneault O , Goldstein DP , 1985 ; Hanton et al , 1966 ; Olive & Henderson , 1987 ; Geary & Weed , 1973 ; Farber M , Marchant , 1975 ; Maciulla et al , 1978 ; Niver et al , 1980 ; Nunley & Kitchin , 1980 ; SanFilippo et al , 1986 ) .
Some clinicians have also analyzed this population sufficiently to report that women without functional endometrial tissues ( another aspect of their developmental abnormalities ) do not develop endometriosis ( Olive & Henderson , 1987 ) .
Third , several observations in the baboon model for endometriosis ( D'Hooghe et al , 1994 ; D'Hooghe et al , 1995 ; DHooghe et al. , 1996 ) appear to support the Sampson hypothesis , and the role of out flow obstruction in the induction of endometriosis .
These observations include a demonstration of the increased incidence of retrograde menstruation in baboons with spontaneous endometriosis ( DHooghe et al. , 1996 ) ; intrapelvic injection of menstrual endometrium causing experimental endometriosis similar to that observed in spontaneous disease ( D'Hooghe et al , 1995 ) ; and surgically induced cervical occlusion leading to retrograde menstruation and endometriosis ( D'Hooghe et al , 1994 ) .
Retrograde menstruation appears to occur in most women ( Halme & Hall , 1984 ) .
This has been demonstrated in a variety of ways , including the detection of endometrial cells in the dialysate of peritoneal dialysis patients ( Blumenkrantz et al. , 1981 ) .
Since retrograde menstruation is relatively common , but endometriosis appears to occur in a fraction of menstruating women , multiple factors apparently interact to produce symptomatic endometriosis .
In an animal model of endometriosis , one group of researchers has demonstrated that the successful survival and growth of endometrial cells correlated directly with the amount of tissue ( represented by its weight ) injected into the peritoneum ( D'Hooghe et al , 1995 ) .
Additional research is being focused on the possible role that immune factors may play on the elimination of menstrual debris .
In some women a defect in immunosurveillance may play a role in the clearing of menstrual debris , suggesting that women unable to clear menstrual debris go on to develop disease ( Cramer & Missmer , 2002 )
Epidemiological data has shown that women with early menarche , short menstrual cycles or longer periods of menstruation are more likely to suffer from endometriosis ( 7,8,20,22 - 24 ) .
These findings are consistent with the Sampson reflux hypothesis for the origin of peritoneal endometriosis .
On one hand , the more frequent the challenge ( i.e. in women with early onset of menstruation and those with shorter cycles ) or the larger the challenge ( i.e. in women with longer periods of menstruation ) , the more likely it is that a woman will develop endometriosis .
Some clinicians also have drawn attention to epidemiological data showing a lower incidence of endometriosis among women who have given birth and suggested that the enlargement of the cervical opening ( and corresponding reduction in resistance to menstrual outflow ) to explain this finding ( Cramer & Missmer , 2002 ) .
Dysmenorrhea is a strong risk factor for endometriosis , but it has generally been considered to represent a symptom of existing disease , since it is easy to imagine that monthly bleeding from pelvic lesions is painful .
However , some data suggest that dysmenorrhea may correlate with stronger uterine contractility ( Schulman et al. , 1983 ) , and one reviewer has suggested an alternate interpretation : dysmenorrhea may be associated with some degree of outflow obstruction , caused by stronger uterine cramping , and an increased propensity to retrograde menstruation ( Cramer & Missmer , 2002 ) .
Consistent with these observations , the mechanical occlusion of the cervix or vagina during menstruation would be expected to substantially increase the retrograde flow of menstrual discharge .
This mechanical occlusion would thereby increase the seeding of the peritoneal cavity with endometrial cells .
Menstrual cups are , in essence , removable cervical and vaginal occlusion devices .
Thus , the increased menstrual retention produced by the use of the menstrual cups is likely to have endometriosis - promoting effects .
C. Potential for Reflux With Menstrual Cups and Other Menstrual Products
A clear distinction can be made between the menstrual occlusion that results from the use of menstrual cups and the occlusive potential of absorbent menstrual products such as tampons .
Simply described , a menstrual absorbent product , such as a tampon , can retain the menstrual discharge within its structure until its absorbent capacity is exceeded .
When a tampon is saturated , it too can become an obstructive device that would increase the reflux of endometrial tissues .
However , the saturation of a tampon would also produce vaginal leakage , prompting its removal .
In contrast , menstrual cups are composed of impervious , non-absorptive materials .
Since fluids are non-compressible , any discharge being held in the cavity of a menstrual cup can be readily refluxed back into the uterine cavity , as well as the fallopian tubes and eventually into the peritoneum .
It should also be noted that clinical studies using menstrual cups have shown that the debris they collect does contain viable endometrial cells ( Koks et al , 1997 ) .
Although quantitative data on their effect on endometrial reflux has not yet been collected , it can be anticipated that a woman wearing a menstrual cup might inadvertently apply compressive forces and promote endometrial reflux when assuming a number of routine positions that compress the vaginal space or apply pressure to the cervical os .
One of the available products ( Softcup ) is recommended for use during sexual intercourse .
The mechanical effects on menstrual reflux in this situation also await evaluation .
In the research literature on endometriosis , one reviewer has suggested that larger fragments of endometrium may have higher invasive potential , once they enter the peritoneal cavity ( Evers , 1996 ) .
Therefore , future research also needs to address whether cervical or vaginal occlusion during menstruation generates increased fluid reflux through the uterus , altering the size distribution of dislodged endometrial tissue .
Available research techniques have monitored endometrial cells in peritoneal fluid during menstruation in women and in animal studies ( Bartosik et al , 1986 ; Kruitwagen et al , 1991 ; DHooghe et al.,2001 ) .
This approach could be used to evaluate the role played by menstrual cups .
D. Endometriosis Risk in Specialized Populations
Given the concerns expressed above about how the use of menstrual cups might increase the risk of endometriosis , this adverse effect would not be expected among women who had ligated fallopian tubes .
However , a review of the one adverse report involving the menstrual cups and endometriosis in the CEDER / MAUDE database ( Addendum B( attached ) ) shows that it involved problems apparently resulting from menstrual obstruction associated with the use of the Keeper , in a women with ligated fallopian tubes .
In this case the reporting physician described the patients uterus as completely endometrial and hysterectomy was recommended .
Endometriosis is a relatively common problem in teenage women .
The superficial convenience of the menstrual cups for young women active in athletic competitions would make them an attractive choice for use during menstruation .
However , as discussed above , until data is collected on effects of mechanical forces on the endometrial reflux associated with the use of menstrual cups , their use during strenuous activities , such as athletic competitions , is a prominent point of concern .
E. Epidemiological Monitoring
Since the onset of endometriosis is apparently influenced by a variety of factors , which include diverse elements such as individual anatomy and immune function , the epidemiology of endometriosis is not clearly defined ( Cramer & Missmer , 2002 ) .
This fact suggests that the clinical demonstration of an increase in the incidence of endometriosis in association with menstrual retention devices will be a complex task , making caution even more important in this matter , while research data is being collected .
Conclusion
Based on the theoretical concerns discussed above and the limited clinical reports in the FDA databases , current users of menstrual cups should be informed of the possible risk of endometriosis associated with these products , and the sale of menstrual cups as OTC devices should be discontinued until sufficient data on their safety has been collected and analyzed .
Environmental impact
The petitioners claim a categorical exclusion from this requirement under Secs. 25.30 - 25.34 of 21(1 ) CFR .

A few years ago scientists were surprised by the sight of two planes carving a hole through a cloud — which then began spewing snow .
A new study spawned by the accidental discovery solves the mystery behind so - called hole - punch clouds and explains how airplanes can change the weather , at least on an extremely local level .
Scientists have studied hole - punch clouds since the 1940s and have long suspected that planes play a role in their formation .
( See pictures of a potentially new type of cloud . )
Now , ice microphysicist Andrew Heymsfield and colleagues have found that aircraft really can create the odd clouds .
Their research also uncovered something totally new : that aircraft can unleash precipitation by carving the cloud tunnels , which had never before been observed .
How Planes Can Make It Rain
Clouds at a certain altitude and temperature — relatively common over western Europe and the U.S. Pacific Northwest , for example — are saturated with water droplets cooled to about 5 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 15 degrees Celsius ) .
Because the water in these clouds is so pure — with no particles around which vapor can condense and freeze — the droplets remain liquid down to minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 34 degrees C ) .
If the cloud gets much colder , though , they freeze into ice particles that can produce rain or snow .
When a plane 's propeller , for example , spins through a cloud , the propeller exerts a rearward force .
The force expands air , cooling by as much as 54 degrees Fahrenheit ( 30 degrees Celsius ) , said Heymsfield , of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colorado .
Jets do the same thing when air is forced over their wings , though jets cool air by only about 36 degrees Fahrenheit ( 20 degrees Celsius ) .
As planes push cloud temperatures past the tipping point at which supercooled water freezes , the aircraft " seed " the clouds with ice particles , the study says .
" If you introduce ice particles , water vapor will condense on them — like it does on a bathroom mirror that 's just a bit cooler than the room — and then snow out " or rain out , Heymsfield explained .
( Download our weather pictures . )
Hole - Punch Cloud Discovery a Surprise
Heymsfield and colleagues flew smack - dab into the hole - punch discovery after having conducted a cloud study from a heavily instrumented turboprop plane near Denver International Airport in 2007 .
A later look at ground - based radar showed an unexplained band of snowfall in the area .
" When we went back to our forward - and downward - looking video camera data , we could see a canal - like hole " in block of clouds , he said .
" And we could look down and see a snow shaft falling out of the hole to the ground . "
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration records show that another turboprop followed the same path in short order .
The snow squall began five minutes after the second plane had passed .
Snow fell for 45 minutes along a band 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) long and 2.5 miles ( 4 kilometers ) wide , dropping some two inches ( five centimeters ) on the ground under the band .
Because hole punching triggers dynamic events within the clouds , he added , the new research , published this month in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , could improve our understanding of cloud circulation .
On 1 June this year newspaper headlines were filled with angry outpourings after a flotilla of humanitarian aid for Gaza was attacked by the Israeli navy and nine Turkish citizens were killed .
This attack violated several fundamental principles of international law .
The first is freedom of navigation on the high seas ( UN convention on the law of the sea , article 87 ) ; the second is the protection of civilians during a state of armed conflict relating to the Gaza Strip ; and the third , most fundamental , is the continuing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories ( UN security council resolutions 242 and 338 , passed in 1967 and 1973 ) .
Despite universal condemnation , no legal redress has so far occurred .
But then it never has .
In these circumstances , where states and governments have failed to ensure compliance with the norms of international law and justice , it is absolutely vital that the private citizen should have the right to instigate the arrest of a transgressor .
This is why the justice secretary 's recent announcement that the coalition intends to circumscribe the doctrine of universal jurisdiction , so that it will be far more difficult to bring anyone accused of serious human rights violations before the courts , is such a retrograde step .
It sends entirely the wrong message and will be regarded by certain states as a reaffirmation of their de facto immunity .
Small wonder Israel campaigned for the change and welcomed it with outstretched arms .
The proposal has its origins under Gordon Brown 's Labour administration , and at the time Vince Cable and Chris Huhne , now coalition cabinet ministers , both opposed it .
In 2005 , an attempt was made to arrest a retired Israeli general , Doron Almog , who had arrived at Heathrow .
He had been tipped off , refused to leave the aircraft and returned to Israel .
In December 2009 , Tzipi Livni , Israel 's former foreign minister and a member of the war cabinet responsible for Operation Cast Lead , planned to visit London .
Lawyers representing innocent civilians who had suffered from indiscriminate bombardment obtained an arrest warrant for war crimes from Westminster magistrates court .
In fact Livni did not arrive , probably because she had been tipped off .
The warrant was withdrawn , and British politicians including Gordon Brown and David Milliband fell over themselves to apologise to the Israelis .
Patricia Scotland , then attorney general , characterised the episode as " law fare " .
William Hague , then shadow foreign secretary , described the affair as a disgrace and said : " We cannot have a position where Israeli politicians feel they cannot visit this country .
The situation is unsatisfactory and indefensible .
It is absolutely my intention to act speedily . "
If such enthusiasm had been shown for upholding the rule of law we might be in a very different place right now .
The justice secretary 's statement was based on the following reasoning :
" that universal jurisdiction cases should be proceeded within this country only on the basis of solid evidence that is likely to lead to a successful prosecution – otherwise there is a risk of damaging our ability to help in conflict resolution or to pursue a coherent foreign policy .
The Government has concluded after careful consideration that it would be appropriate to require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before an arrest warrant can be issued to a private prosecution in respect of an offence of universal jurisdiction " .
The idea that an arrest should only take place on the basis of evidence that might lead to a successful prosecution is novel and certainly does not apply to the UK domestic jurisdiction .
The Westminster magistrates court did not issue a warrant on a wing and a prayer , without proper prima facie evidence .
Our ability to help in conflict resolution , particularly in the Middle East , Iraq and Afghanistan , seems peculiarly deficient short of sending in troops .
Tony Blair only emerged from the woodwork once the debacle over the flotilla forced the Israelis to reconsider the nature of their blockade .
The idea of pursuing a coherent foreign policy is also not only novel but a first .
Over centuries we have earned the reputation of " Perfidious Albion " .
So what exactly are " the public interest " considerations that a non-political and independent director of public prosecutions has to take into account ?
I am less concerned about foreign politicians feeling able to visit this country than about foreign politicians feeling able to commit war crimes .
The first session of the Russell tribunal on Palestine in Barcelona in March 2010 , on which I served as a member of an international jury , unanimously concluded that EU member states should ensure that universal jurisdiction laws and procedures are made as effective as possible in practice and that they make no regressive changes that would blunt the effect of existing UJ laws so as to ensure that no EU member state becomes a safe haven for suspected war criminals .
None of this is just about Israel .
Is it really important in future that the Pinochets of this world are able to travel without let or hindrance and share a cup of tea with leaders like Margaret Thatcher ?
Good news for Henry Kissinger !
Better the words of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 : " Let us have faith that right makes might ; and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it . "

All robots are currently under maintenance for a major upgrade ...
Robostrike was built in 2001 .
That 's certainly a long time ago .
In these days , Flash was the best technology to build compeling player experience and therefore the technolgy we chose to build robostrike .
Since then , the web has evolved .
New standards have emerged and smart phones have become one of the primary means of access to the internet for an ever growing number of people .
Flash has endured but is no more in active maintenance and has been retired from all major browsers .
Good bye , Flash .
Now is time for a major rewrite of Robostrike based on today 's technology .
This is a huge work .
But with the help of few members of the Robostrike 's community , we believe this work can be done .
Robostrike will be back , please check here from time to time for updates

I had a friend tell me the other day that reality is 90 % perception .
This is a school of thought that I subscribe to myself , considering that we each approach any given thing from our own individual frame of reference .
Those references might include past experience , personal investment , assumptions made through association of others ' experiences , etc .
In regards to Internet Marketing , you hear a lot of talk of perceived value .
That talk is mostly from the sellers end , discussing the benefits of a higher perceived value on digital or information products that are sold online ...
The concept is that if you place a higher ticket price on your info product , the buyer will subconciously place a higher value on that product in regards to quality .
The pricing factor alone can also lend to the level of respect that visitor develops for the seller , or an assumption of expertise and / or authority status .
But there are two sides to this coin of perception , and the one I want to discuss today - in this post - is how that perceived value plays a part in the results you get from the info - products that you buy online .
For the record , I am not a big fan of high - ticket info products .
Particularly when the affiliate commission is set to 50 % and when that commission rate is public knowledge .
You can read my full rant on that here ( published in early 2005 ) .
Obviously there are points on this topic that can range from the stance of seller , to affiliate , to buyer .
But the point that I want to discuss here is how perceived value can play a part in the products that you buy .
" You " meaning you , me , and anyone else reading along .
It came up earlier this week in a conversation about Stompernet , due to the price point of membership - which is almost $ 800 / month .
I did not directly promote the membership given my stance on high - ticket affiliate promotions , but several people did ask my take on the pricing - and whether I thought it was worth every penny , or just plain ridiculous .
So here 's my official take on that :
When a person pays $ 800 / month to learn somethingâ€ ¦ they will match that dollar with their attention , and actually work harder to launch their successful venture - based on that one motivating factor alone ( their investment in it ) .
Take two people - Person A and Person B. Person
A chooses to join Stompernet to learn the ropes , and Person B chooses to learn Internet Marketing on their own - through a variety of free or inexpensive sources .
All other things being equal , Person A is more likely to succeed .
Spending $ 800 / month creates a sense of urgency within that person that is a driving force to actually complete Step 1 , Step 2 , Step 3 and so on .
Basically , it induces follow - through .
That 's not to downplay the value that Stompernet offers their members , not by any means .
Its not your typical membership site .
I 'm merely using it as an example since its been such a hot topic lately .
But stop for a second and consider the value of follow - through .
Try to put a price tag on the benefits of achieving the number goal in your life at this very moment .
That puts it in a whole new light , doesnt it ?
Consider this second comparison :
You talk to a close friend about once a week about your most personal thoughts and feelings .
They offer advice and together you come to some reasonable conclusions and possible solutions .
You talk to a coach or therapist each week , at a rate of $ 175 / hour .
Together you come to some reasonable conclusions and possible solutions .
Which scenario is more likely to induce action ?
The second , of course .
Even if both conversations are equal in all other elements , you are more likely to take forward action when you have a substantial investment involved .
Period .
For that reason , the price tag alone can be more of a positive than a negative .
Its simply a mentality , or a perception , but it holds true .
Ask yourself this :
How often are you going to spend more than $ 100 ... without making sure that you get value out of that investment ?
And so , it could be said that the value of a product is actually entirely up to you .
The perceived value is directly related to the results you get from that product - whether it be a service , an ebook , or even an event .
And those results are generally based on your investment in that product .
Let that one sink in .
If you look at the price on a product , specifically a product that involves an investment in self , and you choose to pass based on price point alone ... that may be more an indication that you are not ready to move forward than it is a perception about the value of the actual product .
There are a lot of psychological factors involved with pricing - on both ends .
Just consider the story from the popular One Minute Millionaire book 😉
Your thoughts are of course welcomed ...
Best ,
Fans hoping to experience the further adventures of Agent Michael Thornton will be sorely disappointed , as Sega West president Mike Hayes reveals that a sub -70 Metacritic average and slow sales rule out the chance for an Alpha Protocol sequel .

Alpha Protocol was a solid action role - playing game , but its more glaring flaws brought it to its knees , netting it a Metacritic review average in the mid-60's on consoles ( the PC version scores a little more than 70 . )
According to Mike Hayes , speaking to CVG , this is n't enough of a score to warrant a second look at Obsidian 's spy game .
After pointing out the game 's low sales , Hayes explains .
" The concept was brilliant , though , " he added .
" You know this whole thing with Metacritic where you have to be in the high 70s to mid-80s minimum [ to have any success ] - well , with RPGs you have got to be in the late 80s .
Whilst we had a good game , I do n't think we had a game that had enough to get us to that upper echelon and I think that was the issue . "

Why the difference between RPGs and other genres ?
Hayes says it 's because role - playing games are such large and involved projects , the investment needed to produce them is that much bigger .
Do n't cry too much for developer Obsidian Entertainment .
With Fallout : New Vegas and Dungeon Siege 3 in the works , there wo n't be time to mourn .

_ Heeb_ Web Exclusive : Extended Geddy Lee Interview
Rush bassist / lead singer Geddy Lee is a rock icon .
He is also Gary Lee Weinrib , born in Willowdale , Toronto , to Holocaust survivors Mary and Morris Weinrib .
Perhaps this provides a clue as to why so many confused suburban teenage boys — myself included — spent hours in their respective dimly lit basements air - guitaring along to Rush — because Lee himself was once a confused suburban teenage boy grappling with self - confidence , religion and identity .
These weighty themes of alienation and insecurity resurface time and time again throughout Rush ’s 19 - album catalogue — whether it ’s exemplified by the self - proclaimed cast - outs in “ Subdivisions , ” the pent - up , corporate slave in “ Working Man ” or the powerless puppet in “ Freewill . ”
Recently , I chatted with Lee during one of his rare breaks from a nearly 30 - year touring schedule , releasing Rush ’s new album , Retrospective III , and from racking up the praise for his cinematic turn in the new Paul Rudd / Jason Segel comedy , I Love You , Man .
( This is the extended Geddy Lee interview , continued from " A Show of Hands " in Heeb ‘s Spring Edition , the Music Issue . )
What was Gary Weinrib like as a teen ?
I was a quiet nerd .
I got into music when I was 12 and I was listening to the radio intensely .
[ I was ] listening to other bands and [ became ] a pretty fanatical rock fan .
I wanted to learn how to play so I started learning .
I was motivated .
One of my favorite rock memories as a kid … I remember seeing Cream when they came around — nobody wanted to go with me , so I bought a ticket and went on my own .
In a lot of ways , Cream inspired me to do what I do .
When I was a teen , I tried skipping out on the family Hanukah party to see Rush at Madison Square Garden .
I got grounded and missed your show .
Getting busted on Hanukah ?
Wow .
Your parents were strict .
I ’ll have to do another tour to make it up to you .
What about your parents ?
What did they think about their son ditching the traditional life for that of the rock star ?
It was very hard on my mother at first .
She wanted [ me to be ] a nice Jewish boy from the suburbs and did n’t understand what I was doing at first — [ she thought ] that maybe I had lost my mind to quit school and run away to join a rock band .
But when she first saw me on TV she understood my role as an entertainer .
The incredible thing about Rush is your collective organic dynamic .
You sing the lyrics that Neil [ Peart ] writes — is it important for you to make an emotional connection to his words when singing them ?
It ’s a good question .
Our relationship as a songwriting team has evolved over the years — his being the lyricist and my being the vocalist — there needs to be consideration on both sides .
As we ’ve grown up together , there ’s been a progressive increase of that consideration .
He ’ll put five or six song ideas together and leave it to me to choose the ones that hit me on a positive level and the ones that do n’t … they ’ll be put aside .
Neil gives me complete latitude over the lyrics like an editor , and if I ’m not feeling the chorus , he ’ll try to reconstruct , and we ’ll have a back - and - forth until it works or does n’t .
Other times , I wo n’t touch a song and I ’ll be blown away by it .
In the same way that he ’ll hear me sing the songs and give me feedback on how I ’m singing it .
Overall , though , we do n’t argue — we just discuss .
Which songs from your catalogue do you relate to the most ?
There are two specific songs on Roll The Bones ( 1991 ) that really get me — one of them is â€ ˜Dreamline . ’
I love the spirit of that song and the way Neil captures that feeling of wanderlust and invulnerability that comes in a particular trying time in your life .
The other song is â€ ˜Bravado , ’ a totally romantic song and also an encouraging song about not holding back and being brave .
I think going out on a limb and being contradictory to your inherent personality is a huge thing to do .
Maybe that ’s why I feel connected to that .
You ’ve been touring for what feels like forever .
The physical act of touring has its ups and downs , for sure .
But do I love to play ?
Yeah .
Do I love to play with the two other guys ?
Yeah .
Those three hours that we play together , I have a blast .
Everything else is a grind — schlepping all over the country , keeping myself in mental and physical health … those are the things I have to deal with during these 150 years of touring .
Do you think of yourself as a prog rock musician ?
Our history runs the gamut and we began as a prog rock band with long extended pieces — sword and sorcery piece — which is pure prog .
I ’d like to think that we ’ve evolved since then .
Rupert Hines once called us a â€˜post - progressive rock band , ’ or p-p-rock .
Everyone is in the band is an exceptional musician .
Neil , in particular , is a certifiable drum god …
I ’m constantly blown away by Neil ’s drumming and Alex [ Lifeson ’s ] ability to be a lead and rhythm guitarist at the same time .
You play both the bass and keyboards .
That ’s nothing to laugh at .
You know what they say : â€ ˜Jack of all trades , master of none . ’
Has Rush ever considered hiring a keyboard player to tour with you guys ?
Alleviate Geddy ’s workload ?
It ’s always a discussion , and every time we go on tour , we ’re like , â€ ˜Nah , we ca n’t have another guy on stage . ’
It would n’t ruin the chemistry .
But when we go into the studio to record , I realize all the extra crap I have to do on stage and I bring up the possibility again .
Have you ever felt that the songwriting well was drying up ?
After all these albums …
Yeah , there are lots of times when you feel dry and uninspired .
You have two choices : keep playing until something good comes out , or take the day off and read a book or something .
We can force ourselves to write something — to keep jamming under forced circumstances .
That ’s part of being a professional musician .
We like to spend a lot of time with songs to give ourselves some objectivity .
If the song ’s no good , we throw it out .
Okay , now for some nerd - boy questions .
I was watching a cameo that you did recently for a Broken Social Scene video , â€ ˜Fire Eye ’d Boy . ’
Do you still keep up with the bands emerging from the burgeoning Canadian music scene ?
My attention to those things definitely comes and goes .
I ’ve been on tour for the last two years , so I can tell you that right now I ’m completely out of touch with the scene .
I can go out and check out some new bands at a local venue , but I rarely want to .
But those guys are pretty popular around here .
I had fun doing that video .
I ’ve always wanted to know about this one : Do you know the Pavement song â€ ˜Stereo ’ ?
That one line — do you know it ?
( The lyrics read : â€ ˜What about the voice of Geddy Lee / How did it get so high ?
I wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy ?
I know him and he does ! ’)
Oh yeah .
People ask me about that song all the time .
I love it .
I get a chuckle out of it .
You have a really good sense of humor about yourself , recently appearing on The Colbert Report , the South Park movie …
I do n’t know .
People assume that I ’m a serious guy .
But I think its important not to take yourself too seriously .
An obscure piece of Rush trivia is that you guys performed with Aimee Mann on the song â€ ˜Time Stands Still . ’
How random is that ?
Yeah .
When we were recording the song , I heard a female voice singing that line .
We talked about Chrissie Hynde , but then our producer suggested Aimee Mann , who , at the time , was the singer of â€ ˜Til Tuesday .
She was very generous with her time and a terrific artist .
A lovely voice .
What are you reading now ?
I read a lot on the road .
The latest book by Paul Theroux — he ’s one of my favorite travel writers .
Also , I just finished a book by Neal Karlen called Slouching Toward Fargo .
No science fiction or fantasy books ?
[ Laughs ]
I have n’t read any sci- fi in quite some time actually .
My favorite book of the year is What Is the What .
An exceptional book .
Dave Eggers is totally cool — I like his writing a lot .
â€ ˜Nobody ’s Hero , ’ a song from the 1993 ’s Counterparts , felt out of left field for Rush , dealing with AIDS and homosexuality — â€ ˜I knew he was different in his sexuality / I went to his parties as a straight minority / It never seemed a threat to my masculinity . ’
It dealt with the loss of people from terrible circumstances , and that song hit people , I think , in a different way .
The kind of issues we dealt with in that song is not pop song stuff , granted .
But that ’s what makes it so distinct .
Why do your fans come to Rush shows ?
We have an incredibly diverse appeal — I ’d like to think .
Some fans are strictly technical fans geeking out on the drummer , or the weird chord formations .
There are other fans that have felt a connection to the spirit of our song — the way they resonate thematically , a more emotional appeal .
You can have two Rush fans sitting side - by - side listening to different aspects .
What ’s the secret behind maintaining a relationship with three guys for three decades ?
You have to be able to make fun of each other and do that ad nauseam .
Between the three of us , people ’s feelings rarely get hurt .
We ’ve been through so much together , so we have the comedy , and that keeps us going .
We ’re all for more comedy , less music .
That ’s a big part of the glue .
How much longer can you keep doing this ?
It ’s a question I asked myself all the time , but now I do n’t .
Now I go with the flow .
The day that we can no longer squeeze a new idea out of these old bones that ’s the day I pack it in .
Conventional traffic engineering assumes that given no increase in vehicles , more roads mean less congestion .
So when planners in Seoul tore down a six - lane highway a few years ago and replaced it with a five - mile - long park , many transportation professionals were surprised to learn that the city ’s traffic flow had actually improved , instead of worsening .
“ People were freaking out , ” recalls Anna Nagurney , a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst , who studies computer and transportation networks .
“ It was like an inverse of Braess ’s paradox . ”
The brainchild of mathematician Dietrich Braess of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany , the eponymous paradox unfolds as an abstraction : it states that in a network in which all the moving entities rationally seek the most efficient route , adding extra capacity can actually reduce the network ’s overall efficiency .
The Seoul project inverts this dynamic : closing a highway — that is , reducing network capacity — improves the system ’s effectiveness .
Although Braess ’s paradox was first identified in the 1960s and is rooted in 1920s economic theory , the concept never gained traction in the automobile - oriented U.S.
But in the 21st century , economic and environmental problems are bringing new scrutiny to the idea that limiting spaces for cars may move more people more efficiently .
A key to this counterintuitive approach to traffic design lies in manipulating the inherent self - interest of all drivers .
A case in point is “ The Price of Anarchy in Transportation Networks , ” published last September in Physical Review Letters by Michael Gastner , a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute , and his colleagues .
Using hypothetical and real - world road networks , they explain that drivers seeking the shortest route to a given destination eventually reach what is known as the Nash equilibrium , in which no single driver can do any better by changing his or her strategy unilaterally .
The problem is that the Nash equilibrium is less efficient than the equilibrium reached when drivers act unselfishly — that is , when they coordinate their movements to benefit the entire group .
The “ price of anarchy ” is a measure of the inefficiency caused by selfish drivers .
Analyzing a commute from Harvard Square to Boston Common , the researchers found that the price can be high — selfish drivers typically waste 30 percent more time than they would under “ socially optimal ” conditions .
The solution hinges on Braess ’s paradox , Gastner says .
“ Because selfish drivers optimize a wrong function , they can be led to a better solution if you remove some of the network links , ” he explains .
Why ?
In part because closing roads makes it more difficult for individual drivers to choose the best ( and most selfish ) route .
In the Boston example , Gastner ’s team found that six possible road closures , including parts of Charles and Main streets , would reduce the delay under the selfish - driving scenario .
( The street closures would not slow drivers if they were behaving unselfishly . )
Another kind of anarchy could actually speed travel as well — namely , a counterintuitive traffic design strategy known as shared streets .
The practice encourages driver anarchy by removing traffic lights , street markings , and boundaries between the street and sidewalk .
Studies conducted in northern Europe , where shared streets are common , point to improved safety and traffic flow .
The idea is that the absence of traffic regulation forces drivers to take more responsibility for their actions .
“ The more uncomfortable the driver feels , the more he is forced to make eye contact on the street with pedestrians , other drivers and to intuitively go slower , ” explains Chris Conway , a city engineer with Montgomery , Ala .
Last April the city converted a signalized downtown intersection into a European - style cobblestone plaza shared by cars , bikes and pedestrians — one of a handful of such projects that are springing up around the country .
Although encouraging vehicular chaos seems at odds with the ideas presented in the price of anarchy study , both strategies downplay the role of the individual driver in favor of improved outcomes for everyone .
They also suggest a larger transportation niche for bicycles and pedestrians .
As the Obama administration prepares to invest in the biggest public works project since the construction of the interstate highway system , the notion that fewer , more inclusive roads yield better results is especially timely .
Faster Streets with Less Parking
New strategies in parking management could also improve urban traffic flow , remarks Patrick Siegman , a principal with Nelson / Nygaard Consulting Associates in San Francisco , a transportation - planning firm .
In a misguided effort to reduce congestion , planners in the 1950s required developers to provide a minimum number of free parking spaces — a strategy that “ completely ignored ” basic economics , Siegman says , referring to how lower prices
increase demand .
Now limited urban space and concerns about global warming are inspiring city planners to eliminate these requirements .
In San Francisco , for example , developers must restrict parking to a maximum of 7 percent of a building ’s square footage , a negligible amount .
Although downtown employment has increased , traffic congestion is actually declining , Seigard says .
With fewer free spaces to park , drivers seem to be switching modes , relying more on mass transit , cycling and just plain walking .

Top 25 Greatest Medical Innovations in History
The hard - working health care professionals we have today get a lot of help from amazing medical devices .
The doctors , nurses and others from more than a century ago — and especially those from more than two centuries ago — would be amazed at the things that we can do in health care today .
No matter your health care specialty , you have probably benefited from medical innovations .
Here are 25 of the greatest medical innovations in history :
Devices
There are a number of interesting medical devices that contribute to our ability as a society to treat different conditions and diseases .
Here are some of the interesting medical devices and tools that we have access to :
Artificial heart :
One of the biggest accomplishments in medical history was the invention of the artificial heart .
For the most part , the artificial heart is used as a bridge for transplants .
Robotic catheter : A robotic catheter can be used in a number of systems , including for cardiac surgery and urology , in order to help where hands ca n’t go .
Handheld medical scanner :
This medical device can help health professionals to provide detection , as well as measure wounds .
A handheld medical scanner would be portable and powerful .
Bone injector dill :
If you need to have medicine or some other fluid injected into your bone , a bone injector drill is the way to have it done .
Antennas for medical devices : Skin antennas make use of RF communications to help medical devices work together .
The connections use little power , and send signals along the skin .
Dialysis machine :
The artificial kidney machine has helped many awaiting kidney transplant .
Dialysis helps remove toxins from the body , just as the kidneys are supposed to .
Lens implants :
The ability to improve vision through lens implants is one of the great medical innovations .
Artificial joints :
The ability to replace joints can be helpful in a number of years .
Artificial joints , such as for hips and knees , represent huge medical innovation and advancement .
It increases quality of life , as well as helps prevent falls that can be painful and debilitating .
Technology
Advances in medical technology allow us to have access to a number of advantages that help increase the ability to diagnose and treat conditions .
Electrocardiography :
The use of electricity to learn about the heart has led to a number of advancements in cardiac - related treatment .
Since the heart has electrical current , using this technology makes since when it comes to monitoring .
X -ray :
The ability to see inside the body is an amazing technology that makes it possible for increased diagnosis .
We have advanced from original x-ray technology to levels of increased accuracy and ability .
Nano healing : Nanotechnology offers a number of interesting opportunities .
And now , new nanomaterials can be used to stop bleeding .
Electronic health records :
Increasing patient access to medical history , electronic health records represent a great innovation in medical technology .
Less error , and the ability of doctors to access patient information , is a great help .
Laser surgery :
The use of lasers in surgery and for other procedures has reduced invasiveness as well as reducing healing time .
Eye surgery has especially benefited .
MRI : Magnetic Resonance Imaging makes use of different technology than x-rays to see inside the body .
Magnetism and radio waves are used , instead of harmful x-rays .
It ’s a way of seeing what ’s inside , without doing as much damage .
Ultrasound :
The use of ulstrasound technology has been very beneficial .
Not only can it be used to help assess fetal development , bu ultrasound can be used to diagnose and monitor a number of conditions .
Mammography : Improving the ability to detect cancer and other issues , a mammogram is technology that is helpful .
By taking pictures from different angles and creating a coherent image , it is possible to look for lumps in fatty tissue that could otherwise be difficult to distinguish .
Organ transplant :
The ability to transplant organs is one of the greatest medical innovations .
It allows people to get a new lease on life through the help of healthy organs .
Advances in preservation and transport have only added to the way that organs are transplanted .
Drugs
No matter how you feel about the pharmaceutical industry , it is important to note that some of the best medical innovations have been in the area of drug treatments and therapies .
This mural is painted on the side of an elementary school in Prescott , Arizona .
Recently completed , it features the faces of children who attend the school , but not everyone is pleased with the outcome .
Prescott City Councilman Steve Blair , who also has a daily radio show on Fox News - owned radio station KYCA - 1490 - AM wants the mural taken down completely .
He claims it depicts an agenda , an indoctrination of public school children .
Somehow I do not think this has much to do with indoctrination nor do I think he really cares much about public schools .
Especially public schools with brown children in them .
Instead of removing it , the school principal asked the artists to lighten the faces of the children in the picture .
This request follows harassment of those same artists by drive - by wingers flinging racial epithets at them while they were painting it .
Welcome to Arizona .
Lighten the skin tone on the faces of the children in the picture , because we cannot have brown children representing the children of Prescott .
Hear that , Arizona ?
That 's the sound of the term racist being slapped all over your state whether it 's deserved or not .
That 's the sound of Rupert Murdoch bringing his peculiar brand of thought - cleansing to your backyards .
Do not , under any circumstances , make brown children look beautiful without changing their skin color .
Via Wonkette :
And these children , for the past several months as this happy mural encouraging “ green transportation ” was being painted by local artists , have been treated to the city of Prescott ’s finest citizens driving by and yelling “ Nigger ” and “ Spic ” at this school wall painted with pictures of the children who attend the school .
And this has been encouraged by a city councilman , Steve Blair , who uses his local radio talk show to rile up these people and demand the mural be destroyed .
A few more gems from City Councilman Limbaugh wannabe Blair :
" I 'm not a racist by any stretch of the imagination , but whenever people start talking about diversity , it 's a word I can't stand . "
Daily Courier
" I will tell you depicting a black guy in the middle of that mural , based upon who 's President of the United States today ... "
Daily Courier
" To depict the biggest picture on the building as a Black person , I would have to ask the question : Why ? "
AZCentral.com
Of course , when Blair is directly accused of stirring up racial controversy , he cries innocence in the time - honored tradition of Rush Limbaugh and other right - wing loudmouths who immediately decry the accusation of racism while living it straight up for all to see .
" Personally , I think it 's pathetic , " he says .
" You have changed the ambience of that building to excite some kind of diversity power struggle that does n't exist in Prescott , Arizona .

It makes that " family values " part of the right - wing mantra seem so trite , does n't it ?
Conventional wisdom has always taught us that springing for a new car instead of a slightly used car was a financial mistake .
In fact , I ’ve written about what you need to know before buying your next car and buying used over new was one of my key points .
The reason is that cars are depreciating assets and it is n’t uncommon for a new car to lose anywhere from 10 - 20 percent of its value in the first year .
So , if a savvy consumer is shopping for a car it often makes sense to get a used model about a year old with low miles .
This way the original owner takes the greatest depreciation hit while they get an almost new car still covered under warranty .
Well , the economy has changed the game for many makes and models and in some cases you can actually buy a new car for less than the same car used .
New data from Comerica Bank ’s Auto Affordability
Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they ’ve been since records started being kept in 1979 .
In fact , the average new car is now $ 1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008 .
Simple Supply and Demand
Why are many new cars cheaper than their used counterparts today ?
It ’s all about supply and demand .
In this weak economy , people wised up and tried to save money wherever possible .
One big expense for most people comes in the form of a car payment so it only made sense they look toward used vehicles to save a few bucks .
If you recall your Economics 101 class you ’ll probably remember some time being spent on the law of supply and demand .
Basically , if the demand for something increases , prices generally rise .
And if businesses find themselves holding on to excessive supply the prices tend to fall in order to move the product .
That ’s what ’s happening in this recession .
The demand for used cars is greater than that of new , so dealers know they can mark up used car prices a bit to make more money and in turn have to lower new car prices if they want to move them .
There ’s also an issue with supply since new car inventories are high , but as more used cars are sold the used car inventory is lower , again driving up the prices of used cars and lowering the prices of new .
If you ’re in the market for a new car there could n’t be a better time .
More Than Just Prices
There ’s more to the car buying game than just the bottom line price .
Most people have to finance some or all of their car purchase .
This means there ’s usually going to be the issue of interest paid to consider .
Depending on the interest rate , amount financed , and length of the loan , you could be talking about thousands in additional costs .
Where new cars are also beginning to shine again is with attractive financing terms .
A lot of automakers and dealers are offering attractive zero percent financing , or very low financing rates of just a percentage point or two .
If you ’re going to be borrowing a large chunk of money and can do so without paying any interest to do so , that ’s a hard deal to pass up .
When you compare a new car that might cost $ 1,000 more than the same model that ’s a year old but can get 0 % financing on the new car and the best rate you could get to finance the used car is 6.5 % you need to do a little quick math .
If you are going to finance $ 15,000 either way , know that on a 48 - month loan you ’ll end up paying over $ 2,000 in interest .
So , even if the new model is $ 1,000 more , because you are n’t paying any interest you ’ll still save over $ 1,000 on your total purchase ( not including any possible differences in insurance premiums , gas mileage , maintenance , etc. ) .
If the new car is actually the same price or even cheaper than used the savings just climbs from there .
Guess what ?
They do n’t just hand out 0 % financing to anyone who walks in the door .
Read the fine print and you ’ll notice these deals are reserved for those who qualify and have good credit and it may even require a significant down payment .
Just one more reason why you need to improve your credit score if you ’ve had trouble in the past .
Looking at the Big Picture
Just because the trend right now is for new cars to be cheaper than slightly used , remember that it can still be much cheaper to buy used .
The data here talks about buying low mileage cars that are just one year old compared to their new counterparts .
But if you do n’t need something that new you can still save a lot of money by buying a car that is a few years old , has more miles , etc .
This is still typically the best course of action for those who do n’t drive very much , are n’t concerned about a warranty , and so on .
Even more important is that you should n’t let the idea of a new car being had for cheaper than used force you to buy more than you need or can afford .
Yes , it ’s a great feeling to know you can put yourself into a brand new vehicle with zero down , no interest , and still pay less than buying used , but that ’s no excuse to step up to something that you otherwise would n’t have bought .
Not only is stretching yourself thin just because it ’s a good deal a bad idea , but the higher up in price you go , typically the higher other costs go as well .
This means higher insurance premiums , higher maintenance costs , and maybe even fewer miles per gallon leading to more money being spent on gas .
Suddenly that money you saved on zero percent financing ends up costing you even more in the long run because you ’re spending the savings on other things .
In the end , cars are still depreciating assets and one of the biggest reasons people find themselves in a financial bind .
If you stick to thinking about your vehicle as simple a reliable way to get from point A to point B , find the best deal possible , and keep in mind all of the costs associated with owning a car you ’ll be better off .
If you are in the market for a vehicle and have been debating whether or not to buy new or slightly used , Edmunds has put together a comprehensive list showing you which new cars are the best deals over used , and which models are still a better bet to buy used .
Do n’t stop there .
Be sure to get auto insurance quotes and compare features to make sure you ’re getting a true apples to apples comparison .

It ’s hard to know exactly what to think after seeing the Argentine crime film El Secreto de Sus Ojos ( The Secret of Their Eyes ) , but it is clear that this is an outstanding film with profound ideas about how we should pursue our passions despite the inevitable tragedies of life .
It is storytelling at its most compelling and the pacing is just right .
With two charismatic leads , it ’s no wonder that this film won the 2010 Academy Award for best foreign picture .
The story begins in 1999 , when retired federal justice officer Benjamin Esposito ( Ricardo Darín ) decides to write a novel about the most memorable case of his career .
It concerns a young woman who was brutally raped and murdered 25 years earlier in her Buenos Aires home .
We quickly learn that the case was not resolved in a tidy manner , and we begin to view what happened through extended flashback sequences .
Intermittent breaks between these flashbacks take us back to present day , where Benjamin is not entirely confident about his ability to articulate what happened on paper .
He begins visiting his former boss , the beautiful and powerful Irene Menéndez - Hastings ( Soledad Villamil ) who worked with him on the case .
He seeks her advice on how to write his story .
Of course , we sense that Benjamin and Irene also have unfinished business .
Only through our gradual understanding of this important murder case do we begin to witness the smoldering under - the - surface romance that for mysterious reasons seems to have never been consummated between them .
There are not many movies that come to mind that are similar to this one , although the gritty , slow police work depicted in the terrific suspense film Zodiac bears a resemblance to what we see here .
What Zodiac did not possess , however , was a romance of such epic proportions .
There is even an archetypal sequence involving a farewell at a train station that seems utterly genuine , despite the enormous potential for failure with this kind of scene .
Perhaps that is because we know that when it comes to trains , art imitates life and vice - versa in an iterative cycle that makes them an endless source of drama fodder for movies .
There is a lot of credit to be spread around for this masterpiece of film - making , and much of it should go to director Juan José Campanella .
Campanella uses a large diversity of settings to tell his story , ranging from a lively soccer match , to small village streets , to a crowded office .
Each feels authentic and as if it was filmed with great care .
Beyond the expert direction , big credit should go to the principle actors .
As Irene , the gorgeous Soledad Villamil brings a strong confidence to a role that demands a woman who can be sexy , intelligent , intimidating , and approachable all at once .
Few women can pull this kind of role off and be convincing – mostly because we unfortunately see these kinds of characters so rarely in films .
But the intense , nuanced performance of Ricardo Darín defines the film .
We see Benjamin as a fearless pursuant of true justice , whose personal self doubt later catches up with him .
You can not help but root for the guy .
This kind of powerful acting is no doubt why Darín is such a huge movie star in Argentina and explains why Campanella had chosen to work with Darín on several other films .
It is a shame that we do n’t get more crime films like this one .
Usually directors choose more of what I would describe as “ an underbelly of life ” approach to crime films .
They use violence , perversion , and vile behavior to cheaply garner our interest .
It ’s only a matter of how stylishly they can do it or how well they can write a villain ’s monologue .
The crime we see in El Secreto de Sus Ojos is a vehicle for telling a larger story about how we should live our lives – and it ’s a story that I highly recommend .

If you only want to learn how I built the USB Bike Generator and not why the BikeGen system was n't the best , you can skip this step .
In order to set a bench mark for the efficiency of BikeGen system I decided to do some testing .
In my searching for switching regulators one of the best resources I found was this article http://www.dimensionengineering.com/switchingregulators.htm
It explains how switching regulators work and how you can calculate the power lost through heat generation .
The power lost to heat can be calculated using this equation :
Power lost = ( Input voltage – output voltage ) * load current
So in order to find the power lost you need to know the input and output voltages as well as the load current .
Luckily , I already had the tools for this job which required 3 digital multimeters and a small drill press .
The test setup was fairly simple , I tightened the drill press chuck onto the shaft of the stepper motor and loosely clamped the motor in a vice .
This was the same stepper motor that I have used for both the Bike Generator and and BikeGen Instructabes .
This actually works out really well for two reasons .
First the speeds that the drill press can spin are labeled and from these speeds I calculated how fast I would need to ride the bike based on how fast the generator is spinning .
So using the tire size , rim size and the diameter of the small wheel mounted on the stepper motor for the BikeGen instructable I calculated the following speeds :
Drill Press RPM Bike Speed ( MPH )
620 4.7
1100 8.3
1720 13.0
2340 17.7
3100 23.4
This range of bike speeds seems very reasonable .
The second reason that using the drill press is a good representation of a bike rider is the power rating of the drill press motor .
This drill press is rated at 1/3 horse power which is roughly 250 watts , this is attainable by an average person while riding a bicycle .
The next step was to connect 3 digital multimeters into the circuit .
I had cut some of the wires and use a few sets of alligator clips to make this happen .
Check out the picture or the Test Setup pdf to see how I connected the meters .
Basically the current meter was placed inline between the regulator and the charging circuit and the voltage meters connected after the diodes and after the regulator and were grounded at the same spot .
This measures the values I need to calculate the power lost .
Once everything was ready I plugged in the drill and turned it on .
I tested the generator at every speed the drill was capable of and found out that at the first 3 speeds ( 620,1100,1720 RPM ) there was not enough power to consistently charge the batteries .
This was confirmed by the blinking LED on the charger .
At 2340 RPM and 3100 RPM enough power was provided by the generator to charge the batteries .
The values I measured at these two speeds are listed below :
Motor RPM 2340 3100
Input Volts 15.2 20.2
Output Volts 13 12.68
Output Amps 0.29 0.28
Power Lost ( W ) 0.638 2.106
Output Power ( W ) 3.770 3.550
Total Power ( W ) 4.408 5.656
Efficiency 85.5 % 62.8 %
The power lost was calculated from the equation I showed earlier , the other values were calculated from the following equations :
output power = output voltage x output current
total power = output power + power lost
efficiency = output power / total power
RESULTS
So looking at these results I think there is something to be desired .
First there was not enough power to charge the batteries until 2340 RPM which is 17.7 mph on the bike .
This is a high speed and does n't seem reasonable for a casual bike ride .
Of course this speed is attainable but it would be a lot of effort to maintain the speed for an extended period of time .
The efficiency seems very good at 2340 RPM ( 85 % ) but it drops to 62 % at 3100 RPM .
This is because the input voltage goes up at higher speeds which means more power is lost to heat .
So unless I want to ride the bike at and average speed of 18 mph everywhere I ride I will not achieve the best efficiency possible .
It would be tempting to smile at such a wry observation if the situation it described was n't so depressing .
For what the US political establishment 's non-response to the credit crunch illustrates is this : such is the lobbying power of the big Wall Street institutions that they not only caused a global economic crisis and then forced the US government to pay for a massive bail - out , but then used a slice of that bail - out cash to bribe politicians with campaign donations in order to block rule changes that might prevent a repeat performance .
Practice will help you play piano better – but it 's not going to turn you into Liberace .
A new study looks at the role that working memory capacity plays in piano players ' ability to sight read a new piece of music , an important and complex skill for musicians .
Scientists have debated the role of practice in developing expertise for over a century .
Genius used to be thought of as coming from inherited ability .
Now many researchers think practice is the key .
In 2007 , researchers proposed that it takes a decade of intense practice to become an expert .
Elizabeth J. Meinz of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and David Z. Hambrick of Michigan State University wanted to look at working memory capacity , the ability to keep relevant pieces of information active in your mind .
Pianists use working memory when they read music .
They are n't reading the notes their fingers are currently playing ; they 're looking ahead to read the notes that are coming next .
All musicians do this , but Meinz and Hambrick study pianists partly because they 're convenient ; they 're easy to find and have a wide variety of levels of skill and experience .
For the new study , published in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , pianists were asked to sight read six pieces from a book of sight - reading tests .
The book was chosen because it 's rarely used in the United States .
Musicians have to do this kind of test routinely in auditions .
They were given pieces with various levels of difficulty .
Judges graded each pianist based on technical proficiency , musicality , and overall performance .
The pianists were also asked about their piano - playing history , including how many hours per week they had practiced in each year they 'd been playing , and took tasks that measured their working memory capacity .
Practice was definitely important .
The amount of time a person had spent practicing explained about 45 percent of the variance in sight - reading skill .
But working memory capacity was important , too ; when the researchers took out the effect of practice , another seven percent of variance in sight - reading skill was explained by working memory capacity .
" Practice is absolutely important to performance , " says Meinz .
" But our study does suggest that cognitive abilities , particularly working memory capacity , might limit the ultimate level of performance that could be attained . "
Nach viertägigen Beratungen im schweizerischen Luzern werden die Verhandlungspartner des Anti-Piraterie - Abkommens ACTA keine neue Fassung des umstrittenen multinationalen Abkommens veröffentlichen .
Diese Entscheidung dürfte die Debatten um das undurchsichtige Verhandlungsverfahren erneut anheizen – auch wenn sich die ACTA - Delegationen als Zeichen der geforderten Transparenz zum Auftakt der Verhandlungen mit Vertretern verschiedener Organisationen getroffen hatten .
Die Schweizer Gastgeber , die nach eigenen Aussagen sehr für eine Veröffentlichung geworben hatten , zeigten sich enttäuscht .
Man habe sich dem Konsensprinzip beugen müssen , erklärte Jürg Herren vom Schweizer Institut für Geistiges Eigentum ( IGE ) .
Eine einzelne Delegation habe die Veröffentlichung blockiert , sagte Luc Devigne , Verhandlungsführer für die EU - Kommission .
Die EU habe sich wie schon in der Runde im neuseeländischen Wellington für die Veröffentlichung des neuen Gesamttextes ins Zeug gelegt .
Erneut beließen es die Delegationen bei der Veröffentlichung einer mageren Pressemitteilung der US - Handelsbeauftragten zum Abschluss der Verhandlungsrunde .
Darin treten die ACTA - Partner insbesondere Vorwürfen entgegen , das Abkommen werde den Handel mit Generika - Medikamenten behindern und riskiere durch Bestimmungen im Internetkapitel die Einschränkungen der Meinungsfreiheit .
Einig sind sich die Verhandlungspartner nicht in allen Fragen .
Laut der nach der Verhandlung in Wellington auf internationalen Druck veröffentlichten ACTA - Fassung ist vorgesehen , dass Internetanbieter zur Bekämpfung von Urheberrechtsverstößen ihrer Kunden herangezogen werden sollen .
Wo Provider nach vernünftigem Ermessen Kenntnis von Rechtsverletzungen haben könnten , sollen sie den Zugang zu entsprechendem Material verhindern .
Das reiche weiter als die europäische Rechtslage , an der die EU - Kommission aber strikt festhalten wolle , wiederholten die EU - Verhandlungsführer gegenüber heise online .
Der Vorschlag steht zur Debatte , vom Tisch ist er aber nicht .
Shinpei Yamamoto vom japanischen Wirtschaftsministerium hält einen Abschluss des Verhandlungen bis zum Ende des Jahres trotz der offenen Punkte für möglich .
In Japan wird insbesondere das Thema Durchsetzung von Urheberrecht in der digitalen Welt debattiert .
Der Gesetzgeber habe sich gegen erweiterte Haftungsregeln für Provider entschieden .
Noch nicht abschließend entschieden seien mögliche neue Regeln , die das Umgehen von technischen Zugangskontrollen verbieten sollen .
Wie erwartet weitgehend einig waren sich die Verhandlungspartner in Luzern , dass Patentverletzungen nicht Bestandteil von Grenzkontrollmaßnahmen und des Strafrechtskapitels in ACTA sein sollen .
Es wäre sehr schwierig , Patentverletzungen an den Grenzen seines Landes zu überprüfen , sagte der mexikanische Verhandungsführer Jorge Amigo Castañeda .
Aus Sicht insbesondere der anglo - amerikanischen Staaten könne man Patente grundsätzlich aus dem ACTA - Rechtsrahmen streichen .
Geht es dagegen nach der EU , sollen Vorgaben zu Patentverletzungen in anderen Kapiteln – insbesondere dem über zivilrechtliche Maßnahmen – nicht angetastet werden .
Ein echter Stolperstein für ACTA scheinen die geografischen Herkunftsbezeichnungen zu sein .
Die Schweiz , die EU und auch Mexiko sind nach eigenen Angaben interessiert daran , den Schutz geografischer Herkunftsbezeichnungen wie " Tequila " , " Appenzeller " oder " Nürnberger " in den ACTA - Rechtsrahmen aufzunehmen .
In Mexiko wird laut Amigo Castañeda aktuell diskutiert , ob es vorteilhaft sei , das mexikanische Gesetz an die EU - Regelungen anzupassen .
Für die zehnte Verhandlungsrunde ziehen die ACTA - Verhandlungspartner nun nach Washington , was manche Insider als Beleg dafür werten , dass die USA an einem raschen Abschluss des mehr und mehr unter Beschuss geratenden Abkommens interessiert ist .
Fragen zur US - Einschätzung bezüglich des Fortschritts in Luzern mochte die US - Delegation aber nicht beantworten .

California welfare recipients have been able to get taxpayer cash — meant to feed and clothe their children — from ATMs at strip clubs across the state , including some well - known gentlemen ’s cabarets in Los Angeles .
More than $ 12,000 from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program was dispensed between the start of 2007 and the end of 2009 at clubs , including Sam ’s Hofbrau , Star Strip and Seventh Veil , according to officials at the state Department of Social Services .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has ordered the department to remove the clubs from the official list of businesses where welfare recipients can withdraw benefits using state - issued ATM cards .
The move came a day after The Times asked the administration how much welfare cash had been withdrawn at 17 adult clubs in recent years , and less than a week after The Times reported that more than half the casinos and state - licensed poker rooms in California appear on the state website showing welfare recipients where they can access cash benefits .
After that report , Schwarzenegger ordered the casinos struck from the state ’s ATM network and directed the Department of Social Services to produce a plan to reduce “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in the welfare program .
“ We ’ll take a wide - ranging look and apply some common sense to the list of outlets where cash assistance should not be withdrawn , ” Department of Social Services spokeswoman Lizelda Lopez wrote in an e-mail to The Times on Tuesday evening , announcing that her department had “ taken steps to deactivate ATMs in adult entertainment clubs . ”
Strip club managers seemed shocked that welfare benefits have been accessible through their ATMs .
In most cases the machines are provided by a third party , the managers said , and they have no way of knowing their ATMs are part of the state system .
The state contracts with the Quest ATM network .
“ If there ’s a way that the ATM can reject their card if they ’re on welfare , I ’m really and truly all for that , ” said Merle Matias , manager at Sam ’s Hofbrau in downtown Los Angeles , where $ 2,159 has been withdrawn , according to Department of Social Services officials .
“ I do n’t think it will affect us at all . ”
Star Strip manager Joey Mancini said state officials must be wrong about the $ 1,265 they said has been withdrawn from his club ’s ATM .
The Quest symbol is n’t on the machine , he said , adding that he thinks any system that allows access to welfare benefits at a strip club should be reformed .
“ This is not what that money is for , ” he said .
A manger at Seventh Veil declined to comment .
Nearly $ 4.8 million has been withdrawn from ATMs at casinos and poker rooms with welfare benefits cards from 2007 through last month , state officials said last week .
The vast majority of that , $ 4.4 million , was withdrawn at tribal casinos .
“ This is a huge amount of money when we ’re slashing programs right and left , ” said Assemblywoman Noreen Evans ( D - Santa Rosa ) , who added that the Schwarzenegger administration should have caught the problem years ago .
In May , Schwarzenegger proposed eliminating the CalWorks program , which provides the cash portion of welfare benefits , as part of his plan to close the state ’s $ 19 - billion budget deficit .
Advocates for the poor say that it would be unconscionable to cut any more from the state ’s already shrinking social safety net , arguing that there are good reasons to preserve access to cash benefits even at gambling establishments .
“ Casinos in some rural places have become like little hubs of the community , ” said Michael Herald , a lobbyist for the Western Center on Law and Poverty .
“ My guess is there ’s a small contingent of CalWorks recipients who work at , or live near , these casinos . ”

The Iran–Contra affair ( Persian : ماجرای ایران - کنترا‎ , Spanish : Caso Irán–Contra ) , popularized in Iran as the McFarlane affair , [ 1 ] the Iran–Contra scandal , or simply Iran–Contra , was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration .
Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to the Khomeini government of the Islamic Republic of Iran , which was the subject of an arms embargo .
[ 2 ]
The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua .
Under the Boland Amendment , further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress .
The official justification for the arms shipments was that they were part of an operation to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah , a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
The plan was for Israel to ship weapons to Iran , for the United States to resupply Israel , and for Israel to pay the United States .
The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the hostages . [ 3] [ 4 ]
The first arms sales authorized to Iran were in 1981 , prior to the American hostages having been taken in Lebanon . [ 5 ]
The plan was later complicated in late 1985 , when Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council diverted a portion of the proceeds from the Iranian weapon sales to fund the Contras , a group of anti-Sandinista rebels , in their insurgency against the socialist government of Nicaragua . [ 3 ]
While President Ronald Reagan was a vocal supporter of the Contra cause , [ 6 ] the evidence is disputed as to whether he personally authorized the diversion of funds to the Contras . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ]
Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on 7 December 1985 indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to " moderate elements " within that country . [ 8 ]
Weinberger wrote that Reagan said " he could answer to charges of illegality but could n't answer to the charge that ' big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages . ' " [ 8 ]
After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986 , Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred , but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages .
[ 9 ]
The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the affair were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials . [ 10 ]
On 4 March 1987 , Reagan made a further nationally televised address , taking full responsibility for the affair and stating that " what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated , in its implementation , into trading arms for hostages " . [ 11 ]
The affair was investigated by the U.S. Congress and by the three - person , Reagan - appointed Tower Commission .
Neither investigation found evidence that President Reagan himself knew of the extent of the multiple programs . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ]
In the end , fourteen administration officials were indicted , including then - Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger .
Eleven convictions resulted , some of which were vacated on appeal . [ 12 ]
The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned in the final days of the presidency of George H. W. Bush , who had been Vice President at the time of the affair . [ 13 ]
Background [ edit ]
The United States was the largest seller of arms to Iran under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , and the vast majority of the weapons that the Islamic Republic of Iran inherited in January 1979 were American - made . [ 14 ] :213
To maintain this arsenal , Iran required a steady supply of spare parts to replace those broken and worn out .
After Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage , U.S. President Jimmy Carter imposed an arms embargo on Iran . [ 14 ] :213 After Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 , Iran desperately needed weapons and spare parts for its current weapons .
After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981 , he vowed to continue Carter 's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran on the grounds that Iran supported terrorism .
[ 14 ]:213
A group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981 , and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere , while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not .
[ 14 ] :213 The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence . [ 14 ] :213
At the same time , the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and the other states around the Persian Gulf led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the United States .
[ 14 ]:213
In the spring of 1983 , the United States launched Operation Staunch , a wide - ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran . [ 14 ]:213
At least part of the reason the Iran–Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats , as part of Operation Staunch had , from the spring of 1983 on , been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent these arms sales to Iran . [ 14 ] :213
At the same time that the American government was considering their options on selling arms to Iran , Contra militants based in Honduras were waging a guerrilla war to topple the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) revolutionary government of Nicaragua .
Almost from the time he took office in 1981 , a major goal of the Reagan administration was the overthrow of the left - wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua and to support the Contra rebels .
[ 15]:965 The Reagan administration 's policy towards Nicaragua produced a major clash between the executive and legislative arms as Congress sought to limit , if not curb altogether , the ability of the White House to support the Contras . [ 15]:965 Direct U.S. funding of the Contras insurgency was made illegal through the Boland Amendment , [ 7 ] the name given to three U.S. legislative amendments between 1982 and 1984 aimed at limiting U.S. government assistance to Contra militants .
Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984 , and in October a total ban was placed in effect .
The second Boland Amendment , in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985 , stated :
During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency , the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation , organization , group , movement , or individual .
[ 15]:965
In violation of the Boland Amendment , senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran , an operation they called " the Enterprise " . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
As the Contras were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support , the second Boland amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 to order the National Security Council ( NSC ) to " keep the Contras together ' body and soul ' " , no matter what Congress voted for .
[ 15]:965
A major legal debate at the center of the Iran–Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the " any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities " covered by the Boland amendment .
The Reagan administration argued it was not , and many in Congress argued that it was .
[ 15]:965
The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment , though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name .
[ 15]:966
The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency .
The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive , its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments .
[ 15]:964
By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget , and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of .
[ 15]:964
As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment , the NSC established " the Enterprise " , an arms - smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer Richard Secord that supplied arms to the Contras .
It was ostensibly a private sector operation , but in fact was controlled by the NSC . [ 15 ]:966 To fund " the Enterprise " , the Reagan administration was constantly on the look - out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment , though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment .
[ 15]:966–967
Ironically , military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986 , a month before the scandal broke . [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Arms sales to Iran [ edit ]
As reported in The New York Times in 1991 , " continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980 " led to " limited investigations . "
However " limited , " those investigations established that " Soon after taking office in 1981 , the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy . "
Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year , even as , in public , " the Reagan Administration " presented a different face , and " aggressively promoted a public campaign ... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran . "
The New York Times explains : " Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American - made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq , which had attacked it in September 1980 , " while " Israel [ a U.S. ally ] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to ensure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other . "
Maj. Gen. Avraham Tamir , a high - ranking Israeli Defense Ministry in 1981 , said there was a " oral agreement " to allow the sale of " spare parts " to Iran .
This was based on an " understanding " with Secretary Alexander Haig ( which a Haig adviser denied ) .
This account was confirmed by a former senior American diplomat with a few modifications .
The diplomat claimed that " [ Ariel ]
Sharon violated it , and Haig backed away ... " .
A former " high - level " CIA official who saw the reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980 's estimated that the total was about 2 billion a year .
But also said that " The degree to which it was sanctioned I do n't know . " [ 5 ]
On 17 June 1985 , National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the United States Of America to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran . [ 14 ] :213
The paper read :
Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran .
Instability caused by the pressures of the Iraq - Iran war , economic deterioration and regime in - fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran .
The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime ...
The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance ...
This includes provision of selected military equipment .
[ 14 ] :213–214
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative , writing on his copy of McFarlane 's paper : " This is almost too absurd to comment on ... like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat . " [ 14 ] :214 Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed , stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984 , how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran ? [ 14 ] :214 Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane 's plan to start selling arms to Iran . [ 14 ]:214
In early July 1985 , the historian Michael Ledeen , a consultant of National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane , requested assistance from Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for help in the sale of arms to Iran . [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
Having talked to an Israeli diplomat David Kimche and Ledeen , McFarlane learned that the Iranians were prepared to have Hezbollah release American hostages in Lebanon in exchange for Israelis shipping Iran American weapons . [ 14 ] :214 Having been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism since January 1984 , [ 22 ]
Iran was in the midst of the Iran–Iraq War and could find few Western nations willing to supply it with weapons . [ 23 ]
The idea behind the plan was for Israel to ship weapons through an intermediary ( identified as Manucher Ghorbanifar ) [ 3 ] to the Islamic republic as a way of aiding a supposedly moderate , politically influential faction within the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini who was believed to be seeking a rapprochement with the United States ; after the transaction , the United States would reimburse Israel with the same weapons , while receiving monetary benefits . [ 24 ]
McFarlane in a memo to Shultz and Weinberger wrote :
The short term dimension concerns the seven hostages ; the long term dimension involves the establishment of a private dialogue with Iranian officials on the broader relations ...
They sought specifically the delivery from Israel of 100 TOW missiles ... [ 14 ] :214
The plan was discussed with President Reagan on 18 July 1985 and again on 6 August 1985 . [ 14 ] :214 Shultz at the latter meeting warned Reagan that " we were just falling into the arms - for - hostages business and we should n't do it . " [ 14 ] :214
The Americans believed that there was a moderate faction in the Islamic republic headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the powerful speaker of the Majlis who was seen as a leading potential successor to Khomeini and who was alleged to want a rapprochement with the United States . [ 25 ]
The Americans believed that Rafsanjani had the power to order Hezbollah to free the American hostages and establishing a relationship with him by selling Iran arms would ultimately place Iran back within the American sphere of influence . [ 25 ]
It remains unclear if Rafsanjani really wanted a rapprochement with the United States or was just deceiving Reagan administration officials who were willing to believe that he was a moderate who would effect a rapprochement . [ 25 ]
Rafsanjani , whose nickname is " the Shark " was described by the British journalist Patrick Brogan as a man of great charm and formidable intelligence known for his subtlety and ruthlessness whose motives in the Iran–Contra affair remain completely mysterious . [ 25 ]
The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high level approval from the United States government , and when McFarlane convinced them that the U.S. government approved the sale , Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms . [ 20 ]
In 1985 , President Reagan entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for colon cancer surgery .
While the President was recovering in the hospital , McFarlane met with him and told him that representatives from Israel had contacted the National Security Agency to pass on confidential information from what Reagan later described as the " moderate " Iranian faction headed by Rafsanjani opposed to the Ayatollah 's hardline anti-American policies . [ 24 ]
According to Reagan , these Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the United States , before establishing formal relationships upon the death of the aging Ayatollah . [ 24 ]
In Reagan 's account , McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians , to demonstrate their seriousness , offered to persuade the Hezbollah militants to release the seven U.S. hostages . [ 26 ]
McFarlane met with the Israeli intermediaries ; [ 27 ]
Reagan claimed that he allowed this because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country , and preventing the Soviet Union from doing the same , was a beneficial move . [ 24 ]
Although Reagan claims that the arms sales were to a " moderate " faction of Iranians , the Walsh Iran / Contra Report states that the arms sales were " to Iran " itself , [ 28 ] which was under the control of the Ayatollah .
Following the Israeli–U.S. meeting , Israel requested permission from the United States to sell a small number of BGM - 71 TOW antitank missiles to Iran , claiming that this would aid the " moderate " Iranian faction , [ 26 ] by demonstrating that the group actually had high - level connections to the U.S. government . [ 26 ]
Reagan initially rejected the plan , until Israel sent information to the United States showing that the " moderate " Iranians were opposed to terrorism and had fought against it . [ 29 ]
Now having a reason to trust the " moderates " , Reagan approved the transaction , which was meant to be between Israel and the " moderates " in Iran , with the United States reimbursing Israel . [ 26 ]
In his 1990 autobiography An American Life , Reagan claimed that he was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages ; it was this compassion that supposedly motivated his support for the arms initiatives .
[ 3 ]
The president requested that the " moderate " Iranians do everything in their capability to free the hostages held by Hezbollah . [ 30 ]
Reagan always insisted in public after the scandal broke in late 1986 that purpose behind the arms - for - hostages trade was to establish a working relationship with the " moderate " faction associated with Rafsanjani to facilitate the reestablishment of the American–Iranian alliance after the soon to be expected death of Khomeini , to end the Iran–Iraq war and end Iranian support for Islamic terrorism while downplaying the importance of freeing the hostages in Lebanon as a secondary issue .
[ 14 ] :214–215
By contrast , when testifying before the Tower Commission , Reagan declared that hostage issue was the main reason for selling arms to Iran . [ 14 ]:215
A BGM - 71 TOW anti-tank guided missile
The following arms were supplied to Iran : [ 31 ] [ 32 ]
First arms sales in 1981 ( see above )
20 August 1985 – 86 TOW anti-tank missiles
14 September 1985 – 408 more TOWs
24 November 1985 – 18 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles
17 February 1986 – 500 TOWs
27 February 1986 – 500 TOWs
24 May 1986 – 508 TOWs , 240 Hawk spare parts
4 August 1986 – More Hawk spares
28 October 1986 – 500 TOWs
First arms sale [ edit ]
The first arms sales to Iran began in 1981 , though the official paper trail has them beginning in 1985 ( see above ) .
On 20 August 1985 , Israel sent 96 American - made TOW missiles to Iran through an arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar . [ 33 ]
Subsequently , on 14 September 1985 , 408 more TOW missiles were delivered .
On 15 September 1985 , following the second delivery , Reverend Benjamin Weir was released by his captors , the Islamic Jihad Organization . [ 34 ]
On 24 November 1985 , 18 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles were delivered .
Modifications in plans [ edit ]
Robert McFarlane resigned on 4 December 1985 , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family , [ 37 ] and was replaced by Admiral John Poindexter . [ 38 ]
Two days later , Reagan met with his advisors at the White House , where a new plan was introduced .
This called for a slight change in the arms transactions : instead of the weapons going to the " moderate " Iranian group , they would go to " moderate " Iranian army leaders . [ 39 ]
As each weapons delivery was made from Israel by air , hostages held by Hezbollah would be released . [ 39 ]
Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the United States for the weapons .
Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , the plan was authorized by Reagan , who stated that , " We were not trading arms for hostages , nor were we negotiating with terrorists " . [ 40 ]
In his notes of a meeting held in the White House on 7 December 1985 , Weinberger wrote he told Reagan that this plan was illegal , writing :
I argued strongly that we have an embargo that makes arms sales to Iran illegal and President could n't violate it and that ' washing ' transactions through Israel would n't make it legal .
Shultz , Don Regan agreed .
[ 14 ] :216
Weinberger 's notes have Reagan saying he " could answer charges of illegality but he could n't answer charge that ' big strong President Reagan ' passed up a chance to free hostages . " [ 14 ] :216 Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred ; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar . [ 39 ]
On the day of McFarlane 's resignation , Oliver North , a military aide to the United States National Security Council ( NSC ) , proposed a new plan for selling arms to Iran , which included two major adjustments : instead of selling arms through Israel , the sale was to be direct at a markup ; and a portion of the proceeds would go to Contras , or Nicaraguan paramilitary fighters waging guerrilla warfare against the democratically elected Sandinista government .
The dealings with the Iranians were conducted via the NSC with Admiral Poindexter and his deputy Colonel North , with the American historians Malcolm Byrne and Peter Kornbluh writing that Poindexter granted much power to North " ... who made the most of the situation , often deciding important matters on his own , striking outlandish deals with the Iranians , and acting in the name of the president on issues that were far beyond his competence .
All of these activities continued to take place within the framework of the president 's broad authorization .
Until the press reported on the existence of the operation , nobody in the administration questioned the authority of Poindexter 's and North 's team to implement the president 's decisions " .
[ 14 ] :217 North proposed a $ 15 million markup , while contracted arms broker Ghorbanifar added a 41 % markup of his own . [ 41 ]
Other members of the NSC were in favor of North 's plan ; with large support , Poindexter authorized it without notifying President Reagan , and it went into effect . [ 42 ]
At first , the Iranians refused to buy the arms at the inflated price because of the excessive markup imposed by North and Ghorbanifar .
They eventually relented , and in February 1986 , 1,000 TOW missiles were shipped to the country . [ 42 ]
From May to November 1986 , there were additional shipments of miscellaneous weapons and parts . [ 42 ]
Both the sale of weapons to Iran and the funding of the Contras attempted to circumvent not only stated administration policy , but also the Boland Amendment . [ 7 ]
Administration officials argued that regardless of Congress restricting funds for the Contras , or any affair , the President ( or in this case the administration ) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments . [ 43 ]
Funding from one foreign country , Brunei , was botched when North 's secretary , Fawn Hall , transposed the numbers of North 's Swiss bank account number .
A Swiss businessman , suddenly $ 10 million richer , alerted the authorities of the mistake .
The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei , with interest . [ 44 ]
On 7 January 1986 , John Poindexter proposed to Reagan a modification of the approved plan : instead of negotiating with the " moderate " Iranian political group , the United States would negotiate with " moderate " members of the Iranian government . [ 45 ]
Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government , so with the hope of the release of the hostages , Reagan approved this plan as well . [ 45 ]
Throughout February 1986 , weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States ( as part of Oliver North 's plan ) , but none of the hostages were released .
Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage , this one to Tehran – bringing with him a gift of a bible with a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan [ 46 ] [ 47 ] and , according to George Cave , a cake baked in the shape of a key . [ 46 ]
Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar . [ 48 ]
McFarlane met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani , who sought to establish U.S. - Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages . [ 49 ]
The American delegation comprised McFarlane , North , Cave ( a retired CIA officer who worked in Iran in the 1960s –70s ) , Teicher , Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator .
They arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986 . [ 14 ] :249
This meeting also failed .
Much to McFarlane 's disgust , he did not meet ministers , and instead met in his words " third and fourth level officials " .
[ 14 ]:249
At one point , an angry McFarlane shouted : " As I am a Minister , I expect to meet with decision - makers .
Otherwise , you can work with my staff . " [ 14 ] :249 The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel 's withdrawal from the Golan Heights , which the United States rejected . [ 49 ]
More importantly , McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages , whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed .
[ 14 ] :249
The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane 's mission going home after four days . [ 14 ] :250 After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran , McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore , advice that was disregarded .
[ 14 ] :250
Subsequent dealings [ edit ]
On 26 July 1986 , Hezbollah freed the American hostage Father Lawrence Jenco , former head of Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon . [ 14 ] :250 Following this , William Casey , head of the CIA , requested that the United States authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces as a way of expressing gratitude . [ 50 ]
Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed , and hostages might be killed .
Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur . [ 50 ]
North used this release to persuade Reagan to switch over to a " sequential " policy of freeing the hostages one by one , instead of the " all or nothing " policy that the Americans had pursued until then .
[ 14]:250
By this point , the Americans had grown tired of Ghobanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage . [ 14 ] :250 In August 1986 , the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government , Ali Hashemi Bahramani , the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard . [ 14 ] :250
The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism seemed only to attract the Americans more to Bahramani , who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran 's policies .
[ 14 ] :250 Richard Secord , an American arms dealer , who was being used as a contact with Iran , wrote to North : " My judgment is that we have opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran " .
[ 14 ] :250 North was so impressed with Bahramani that he arranged for him to secretly visit Washington D.C and gave him a guided tour at midnight of the White House .
[ 14 ] :250
North frequently met with Bahramani in the summer and fall of 1986 in West Germany , discussing arms sales to Iran , the freeing of hostages held by Hezbollah and how best to overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the establishment of " a non-hostile regime in Baghdad " .
[ 14 ] :250 In September and October 1986 three more Americans – Frank Reed , Joseph Cicippio , and Edward Tracy – were abducted in Lebanon by a separate terrorist group , who referred to them simply as " G.I. Joe , " after the popular American toy .
The reasons for their abduction are unknown , although it is speculated that they were kidnapped to replace the freed Americans . [ 51 ]
One more original hostage , David Jacobsen , was later released .
The captors promised to release the remaining two , but the release never happened . [ 52 ]
During a secret meeting in Frankfurt in October 1986 , North told Bahramani that : " Saddam Hussein must go " . [ 14 ] :250 North also claimed that Reagan had told him to tell Bahramani that : " Saddam Hussein is an asshole . " [ 14 ] :250 Behramani during a secret meeting in Mainz informed North that Rafsanjani " for his own politics ... decided to get all the groups involved and give them a role to play . " [ 14 ] :251 Thus , all the factions in the Iranian government would be jointly responsible for the talks with the Americans and " there would not be an internal war " .
[ 14 ] :251 This demand of Behramani caused much dismay on the American side as it made clear to them that they would not be dealing solely with a " moderate " faction in the Islamic Republic , as the Americans liked to pretend to themselves , but rather with all the factions in the Iranian government – including those who were very much involved in terrorism . [ 14 ] :251 Despite this the talks were not broken off .
[ 14 ] :251
Discovery and scandal [ edit ]
After a leak by Mehdi Hashemi , a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , the Lebanese magazine Ash - Shiraa exposed the arrangement on 3 November 1986 . [ 53 ]
The leak may have been orchestrated by a covert team led by Arthur S. Moreau Jr. , assistant to the chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff , due to fears the scheme had grown out of control . [ 54 ]
This was the first public report of the weapons - for - hostages deal .
The operation was discovered only after an airlift of guns ( Corporate Air Services HPF821 ) was downed over Nicaragua .
Eugene Hasenfus , who was captured by Nicaraguan authorities after surviving the plane crash , initially alleged in a press conference on Nicaraguan soil that two of his coworkers , Max Gomez and Ramon Medina , worked for the Central Intelligence Agency . [ 55 ]
He later said he did not know whether they did or not . [ 56 ]
The Iranian government confirmed the Ash - Shiraa story , and ten days after the story was first published , President Reagan appeared on national television from the Oval Office on 13 November , stating :
My purpose was ... to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between [ the U.S. and Iran ] with a new relationship ...
At the same time we undertook this initiative , we made clear that Iran must oppose all forms of international terrorism as a condition of progress in our relationship .
The most significant step which Iran could take , we indicated , would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there . [ 9 ]
The scandal was compounded when Oliver North destroyed or hid pertinent documents between 21 November and 25 November 1986 .
During North 's trial in 1989 , his secretary , Fawn Hall , testified extensively about helping North alter , shred , and remove official United States National Security Council ( NSC ) documents from the White House .
According to The New York Times , enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it . [ 41 ]
North 's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations . [ 41 ]
It was not until 1993 , years after the trial , that North 's notebooks were made public , and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act . [ 41 ]
During the trial , North testified that on 21 , 22 or 24 November , he witnessed Poindexter destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert-action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran . [ 41 ] U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese admitted on 25 November that profits from weapons sales to Iran were made available to assist the Contra rebels in Nicaragua .
On the same day , John Poindexter resigned , and President Reagan fired Oliver North . [ 57 ]
Poindexter was replaced by Frank Carlucci on 2 December 1986 . [ 58 ]
When the story broke , many legal and constitutional scholars expressed dismay that the NSC , which was supposed to be just an advisory body to assist the President with formulating foreign policy had " gone operational " by becoming an executive body covertly executing foreign policy on its own .
[ 59 ] :623–624
The National Security
Act of 1947 , which created the NSC , gave it the vague right to perform " such other functions and duties related to the intelligence as the National Security Council may from time to time direct . " [ 59 ] :623 However , the NSC had usually , although not always , acted as an advisory agency until the Reagan administration when the NSC had " gone operational " , a situation that was condemned by both the Tower commission and by Congress as a departure from the norm . [ 59 ] :623 The American historian James Canham - Clyne asserted that Iran–Contra affair and the NSC " going operational " were not departures from the norm , but were the logical and natural consequence of existence of the " national security state " , the plethora of shadowy government agencies with multi-million dollar budgets operating with little oversight from Congress , the courts or the media , and for whom upholding national security justified almost everything .
[ 59 ] :623 Canham - Clyne argued that for the " national security state " , the law was an obstacle to be surmounted rather than something to uphold and that the Iran–Contra affair was just " business as usual " , something he asserted that the media missed by focusing on the NSC having " gone operational . " [ 59 ] :623
In Veil : The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981 –1987 , journalist Bob Woodward chronicled the role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North . [ 60 ]
According to Woodward , then - Director of the CIA William J. Casey admitted to him in February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds to the Contras . [ 60 ] :580
The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke , and , according to his wife , was unable to communicate .
On 6 May 1987 , William Casey died the day after Congress began public hearings on Iran–Contra .
Independent Counsel , Lawrence Walsh later wrote : " Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion .
The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [ Oliver ] North . " [ 61 ]
Gust Avrakodos , who was responsible for the arms supplies to the Afghans at this time , was aware of the operation as well and strongly opposed it , in particular the diversion of funds allotted to the Afghan operation .
According to his Middle Eastern experts the operation was pointless because the moderates in Iran were not in a position to challenge the fundamentalists .
However , he was overruled by Clair George . [ 62 ]
Tower Commission [ edit ]
On 25 November 1986 , President Reagan announced the creation of a Special Review Board to look into the matter ; the following day , he appointed former Senator John Tower , former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie , and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to serve as members .
This Presidential Commission took effect on 1 December and became known as the Tower Commission .
The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into " the circumstances surrounding the Iran–Contra matter , other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress , and the manner in which that system has served eight different presidents since its inception in 1947 " . [ 3 ]
The Tower Commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council . [ 63 ]
President Reagan ( center ) receives the Tower Commission Report in the White House Cabinet Room ; John Tower is at left and Edmund Muskie is at right , 1987 .
President Reagan appeared before the Tower Commission on 2 December 1986 , to answer questions regarding his involvement in the affair .
When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals , he first stated that he had ; later , he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so . [ 64 ]
In his 1990 autobiography , An American Life , Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel . [ 65 ]
The report published by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on 26 February 1987 .
The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme , [ 3 ] including Reagan , and two of the arms trade middlemen : Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi . [ 64 ]
The 200 - page report was the most comprehensive of any released , [ 64 ] criticizing the actions of Oliver North , John Poindexter , Caspar Weinberger , and others .
It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program , especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras , [ 3 ] although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff .
[ 3 ]
The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions . [ 3 ]
A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more , thereby placing more power in the hands of that chair . [ 3 ]
Congressional committees investigating the affair [ edit ]
In January 1987 , Congress announced it was opening an investigation into the Iran–Contra affair .
Depending upon one 's political perspective , the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out - of - control executive arm , a partisan " witch hunt " by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the " imperial presidency " that had run amok by breaking numerous laws .
[ 66 ] :701 The Democratic - controlled United States Congress issued its own report on 18 November 1987 , stating that " If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing , he should have . " [ 4 ]
The congressional report wrote that the president bore " ultimate responsibility " for wrongdoing by his aides , and his administration exhibited " secrecy , deception and disdain for the law " . [ 67 ]
It also read that " the central remaining question is the role of the President in the Iran–Contra affair .
On this critical point , the shredding of documents by Poindexter , North and others , and the death of Casey , leave the record incomplete " . [ 7 ]
Aftermath [ edit ]
Reagan expressed regret regarding the situation in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on 4 March 1987 , and in two other speeches . [ 68 ]
Reagan had not spoken to the American people directly for three months amidst the scandal , [ 69 ] and he offered the following explanation for his silence :
The reason I have n't spoken to you before now is this :
You deserve the truth .
And as frustrating as the waiting has been , I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports , or possibly even erroneous statements , which would then have to be corrected , creating even more doubt and confusion .
There 's been enough of that . [ 69 ]
Reagan then took full responsibility for the acts committed :
First , let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration .
As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge , I am still accountable for those activities .
As disappointed as I may be in some who served me , I 'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior . [ 69 ]
Finally , the president acknowledged that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect :
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages .
My heart and my best intentions still tell me that 's true , but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not .
As the Tower board reported , what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated , in its implementation , into trading arms for hostages .
This runs counter to my own beliefs , to administration policy , and to the original strategy we had in mind . [ 69 ]
To this day , Reagan 's role in these transactions is not definitively known .
It is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when , and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages .
Oliver North wrote that " Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular , detailed briefings on both ... I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras , and that he approved it .
Enthusiastically . " [ 70 ]
Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostage transfers [ clarification needed ] with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were " moderate elements " within Iran . [ 8 ]
Notes taken by Weinberger on 7 December 1985 record that Reagan said that " he could answer charges of illegality but he could n't answer charge [ sic ] that ' big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages ' " .
[ 8 ]
The Republican - written " Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran–Contra Affair " made the following conclusion :
There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details .
There is no doubt , however , ... [ that ] the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua , with few if any ambiguities , and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it . [ 71 ]
Domestically , the affair precipitated a drop in President Reagan 's popularity .
His approval ratings suffered " the largest single drop for any U.S. president in history " , from 67 % to 46 % in November 1986 , according to a The New York Times / CBS News poll . [ 72 ]
The " Teflon President " , as Reagan was nicknamed by critics , [ 73 ] survived the affair , however , and his approval rating recovered . [ 74 ]
Internationally , the damage was more severe .
Magnus Ranstorp wrote , " U.S. willingness to engage in concessions with Iran and the Hezbollah not only signaled to its adversaries that hostage - taking was an extremely useful instrument in extracting political and financial concessions for the West but also undermined any credibility of U.S. criticism of other states ' deviation from the principles of no-negotiation and no concession to terrorists and their demands . " [ 75 ]
In Iran , Mehdi Hashemi , the leaker of the scandal , was executed in 1987 , allegedly for activities unrelated to the scandal .
Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges , some observers find the coincidence of his leak and the subsequent prosecution highly suspicious . [ 76 ]
Indictments [ edit ]
The Independent Counsel , Lawrence E. Walsh , chose not to re-try North or Poindexter . [ 95 ]
In total , several dozen people were investigated by Walsh 's office . [ 96 ]
George H. W. Bush 's denial [ edit ]
During his election campaign in 1988 , Vice President Bush denied any knowledge of the Iran–Contra affair by saying he was " out of the loop " .
Though his diaries included that he was " one of the few people that know fully the details " , he repeatedly refused to discuss the incident and won the election . [ 97 ]
A book published in 2008 by Israeli journalist and terrorism expert Ronen Bergman asserts that Bush was also personally and secretly briefed on the affair by Amiram Nir , a counterterrorism adviser to the then Israeli prime minister , Yitzhak Shamir , when Bush was on a visit to Israel .
" Nir could have incriminated the incoming President .
That Nir was killed in a mysterious chartered airplane crash in Mexico in December 1988 has given rise to numerous conspiracy theories " , writes Bergman . [ 98 ]
Pardons [ edit ]
On 24 December 1992 , having been defeated for reelection , and nearing the end of his term in office , lame duck President George H. W. Bush pardoned [ 99 ] five administration officials who had been found guilty on charges relating to the affair .
They were :
Bush also pardoned Caspar Weinberger , who had not yet come to trial .
[ 100 ] Attorney General William P. Barr advised the President on these pardons , especially that of Caspar Weinberger . [ 101 ]
In response to these Bush pardons , Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh , who headed the investigation of Reagan Administration officials ' criminal conduct in the Iran–Contra scandal , stated that " the Iran–Contra cover - up , which has continued for more than six years , has now been completed . "
Walsh noted that in issuing the pardons Bush appears to have been preempting being implicated himself in the crimes of Iran–Contra by evidence that was to come to light during the Weinberger trial , and noted that there was a pattern of " deception and obstruction " by Bush , Weinberger and other senior Reagan administration officials .
[ 95 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ]
Modern interpretations [ edit ]
The Iran–Contra affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials ( including President Reagan ) was cast as an example of post - truth politics by Malcolm Byrne of George Washington University . [ 104 ]
Reports and documents [ edit ]
The 100th Congress formed a Joint Committee of the United States Congress ( Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran- Contra Affair ) and held hearings in mid-1987 .
Transcripts were published as : Iran–Contra Investigation : Joint Hearings Before the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition and the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran ( U.S. GPO 1987 – 88 ) .
A closed Executive Session heard classified testimony from North and Poindexter ; this transcript was published in a redacted format .
[ 105 ]
The joint committee 's final report was Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran–Contra Affair With Supplemental , Minority , and Additional Views ( U.S. GPO 17 November 1987 ) .
[ 106 ]
The records of the committee are at the National Archives , but many are still non-public . [ 107 ]
Testimony was also heard before the House Foreign Affairs Committee , House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and can be found in the Congressional Record for those bodies .
The Senate Intelligence Committee produced two reports : Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance ( 2 February 1987 ) and Were Relevant Documents Withheld from the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran–Contra Affair ? ( June 1989 ) . [ 108 ]
The Tower Commission Report was published as the Report of the President 's Special Review Board .
U.S. GPO 26 February 1987 .
It was also published as The Tower Commission Report , Bantam Books , 1987 , ISBN 0-553-26968-2 [ 109 ]
The Office of Independent Counsel / Walsh investigation produced four interim reports to Congress .
Its final report was published as the Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters . [ 110 ]
Walsh 's records are available at the National Archives . [ 111 ]

Wilder Marcano interviewed by Susan Spronk and Jeffery R. Webber
July 4 , 2010 -- The Bullet --
We caught up with Wilder Marcano , director of the network of comunas [ communes ] in Caracas , on the morning of June 18 , 2010 .
He talked with us just before addressing a crowd of a few hundred representatives of different comunas from around the capital who had gathered in the offices of the Ministry of Popular Power for the Communes and Social Welfare to discuss a whole series of issues related to building popular power from below in the poorest barrios .
What is the role of the comunas in the construction of socialism in Venezuela ?
In Venezuela we have a national political project for the country .
In relation to organisations of popular power we have the communal councils , and the commune is the principal organ of this political project .
This project has to have a strategic orientation , and at the heart of this is the stimulation and participation of the people .
We believe that building up from the starting point of the comuna is the way of realising and concretising the political project .
The comuna is a way of radically reorganising territory , a geographical radicalisation in which human beings are put at the centre , where the real needs of human beings are responded to , and from where a distinct form of economy can be constructed .
The new economy needs to replace the failed capitalistic economy , and the new economy needs to be based in the principles of socialism .
What are the most important challenges facing the comunas ?
The biggest challenge is that we have to break with the old way of doing politics here in Venezuela .
One example is the need to build a participatory rather than representative democracy .
In the Bolivarian constitution it stresses that our democracy has to be participatory and protagonistic .
This means that the people have to liberate themselves from their fears and anxieties and assume their role in the construction of this new reality .
Breaking with the old way of doing politics , having people become protagonists is one of the biggest challenges we face .
The second challenge has to do with the theme of the economy , which is a tremendously important issue .
We need to make the comunas centres of production for the people , and we need to improve their organisation .
Why ?
Because we ’re talking about breaking from a system with hundreds of years of history , which has left behind an ideology of capitalism that is deeply ingrained in people .
This ideology has many mechanisms through which it reproduces itself .
Our socialist project is not yet fully understood at the grassroots level .
There is still a great deal of learning and education that has to take place .
This is part of the role of the party [ the PSUV ] , and is necessary in order to build a new economy based in the values of socialism .
What is your vision of socialism in the long term ?
In the concrete case of Venezuela , we see socialism as a path of opportunity .
If we look around the world at all the tragedy , if we look at our own tragedies in the history of Venezuela , it ’s clear that the capitalist system does not function .
We see socialism as a way of making our independence that began with Simón Bolívar real and authentic .
We see it as the way in which we can build a new and distinct reality for Venezuela , in which the needs of human beings are placed at the centre , where the hateful inequalities of capitalism are overcome , where we have real freedom in all the sphere of social life , a society which is not run by the private owners of the means of production and the owners of the media .
In essence , a country in which children can pursue an enriching life , where they can study , be guaranteed education and health , where they have security , where they can have the possibility to be happy and free .
This is the vision that we have .
We can see that there are really two central facets to the struggle from below in this country .
The struggle for workers ’ control , on the one hand , and the struggle for popular power in the comunas , on the other .
What needs to be done to facilitate the union of these two sets of struggles ?
This is the fundamental task that the PSUV is taking up in its leading role in the struggle for liberation of society in its totality .
Workers ’ control has to do with controlling and managing the means of production , with the takeover of enterprises .
The comuna has to do with territorial control in the communities , with themes of production in these locales , with meeting the needs of the people in their neighbourhoods .
Their objectives in many ways are the same .
It ’s about people having control over every aspect of their lives .
The PSUV is one mechanism for uniting these aims , and it draws from these sources , because it has the long term vision of building socialism .

‘ Stinginess Is Cool ’
Judging from the recent comments of U.S. policymakers and commentators , it ’s not hard to pinpoint the greatest impediment to global economic recovery : the know - nothing , beggar - thy - neighbor policies of Germany .
Policymakers in Berlin are portrayed by everyone from President Barack Obama to New York Times columnist Paul Krugman as single - mindedly focused on increasing their country ’s exports and keeping down domestic demand , even at the expense of prolonging or deepening the global recession .
Why ca n’t the Germans just reach into their pockets and support global consumption at a time when the United States and other indebted countries have to exercise restraint ?
The problem is it ’s a lot harder than you ’d think to get Germans to spend their money .
Thrift is practically part of Germany ’s national identity .
A recent commercial ad campaign ran with the claim Geiz ist geil — " Stinginess is cool . "
And the statistics bear out the slogan .
In 2009 , the savings rate of the private sector stood at 22 percent of GDP , compared with 12 percent in the United States .
Private consumption expenditure rose 0.2 percent between 2002 and 2006 , while it increased 3 percent in the United States and 2.7 percent in Britain .
Polls show that Germans prefer having their taxes raised and public spending cut :
It is hard to imagine a government in any other country overstating the size of an austerity package for the sake of popularity .
In Germany , that ’s precisely what just happened .
Cultural factors play an important role :
Whereas the Anglo - Saxon world is characterized by what one could call pragmatic optimism , Germans instinctively think about the long term , and they are n’t disposed toward cheerfulness .
Whereas America ’s recent history teaches hope , Germans see in their history the need to be cautious :
In the last 100 years , Germans have experienced two currency reforms and the rise and demise of three regimes .
Political instability is n’t much of a concern anymore , but the mindset remains .
Germans today still think of credit as morally dubious , if not pernicious .
It ’s telling that the German words for debt and guilt are identical : Schuld .
And German consumers instinctively think of bad times as just around the corner , so they save money as a precautionary measure against the next crisis that ’s sure to come .
For instance , with the country ’s population now rapidly aging , many Germans are saving money in anticipation of the imminent demise of their pay - as - you - go public pension system .
In fact , Germany is likely the only country in the world where Ricardian equivalence — the theory that the government cannot stimulate private consumption by cutting taxes because rational actors know that taxes will eventually have to rise again and therefore put aside savings — actually holds true .
It ’s not only Germans ’ propensity to save that ’s at issue , but their easy assumption that economic activity consists primarily of foreign trade .
It ’s an economic model that traces back to the beginning of the postwar period , when booming exports were the backbone of the Wirtschaftswunder , or economic miracle — the period of strong growth in the 1950s that transformed the destroyed country into a major world economic power .
When Germans saw Volkswagens on roads all over the world , it was n’t only a source of income , but proof that the country was once again an accepted member of the international community .
Add Germany ’s traditional obsession with engineering and its distaste for the service sector , and it may become clearer why the country is prone to mercantilism .
Germans have embraced this outmoded economic formula , even though it has essentially imposed years of mild austerity measures on the country .
To boost exports , Germans have had to increase their competitiveness through stagnant labor wages .
Unit labor costs fell 0.1 percent between 2002 and 2006 in Germany , while they rose an average of 1.6 percent in the eurozone .
But Germans do n’t rebel against that lack of wage growth ; they join the country ’s economic establishment in interpreting it as a strength .
Indeed , the major trade unions were involved in negotiating the wage levels .
If German psychology is one reason for the country ’s surplus savings , the reluctance of the country ’s policymakers to use macroeconomic tools to change spending patterns is the other major contributor .
Germany simply does not have a tradition of macroeconomic policy , at least not in the American sense of managing aggregate demand .
Contemporary German economics has its roots in Ordnungspolitik , a unique school of thought that emerged in the 1940s and for which there is no English translation .
Ordnungspolitik accepts that government intervention is necessary for the economy to function properly , but the role it assigns to the state is fundamentally different than in the Anglo - Saxon tradition .
Whereas most American macroeconomists believe in discretionary intervention in the way of countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy , German economists encourage the government to only alter the framework within which economic agents interact .
The emergence of Ordnungspolitik — with its obsession with rules and skepticism toward discretionary action — was a reaction to the excessive abuse of governmental power experienced during the Nazi years , but it also reflects another fundamental German preoccupation :
The idea that it is better to design a system that works perfectly than to resort to permanent ad hoc troubleshooting .
From this perspective , swings in the business cycle are a natural phenomenon of a market economy , and given the complexity of economic processes , any attempt to smooth them out will lead to a misallocation of resources .
The very idea of stimulating the economy or producing domestic demand sounds strange to many German economists .
The solution to the problem of global imbalances advanced by their U.S. counterparts — expand demand in the surplus countries in order to compensate for the decline in deficit countries — is seen as the application of a blunt instrument that , however much it helps , will ultimately distort the global economy for the worse .
Even in the heyday of Keynesianism in the 1960s and 1970s , Germany ’s economic establishment regarded with skepticism the government ’s attempts to manage aggregate demand .
When Chancellor Helmut Schmidt gave in to pressure by then - U.S. President Jimmy Carter and launched a stimulus package amounting to 1 percent of GDP at the 1978 G - 7 summit in Bonn , Germany ’s central bank , the Bundesbank , reacted harshly .
For years afterward , bank officials said the stimulus had no positive effect , and the public believed them .
Economic historians have been benign in their assessment of that stimulus package , but German policymakers would probably still cite this episode as proof that countercyclical policies are bound to fail economically and politically .
Indeed , Germany ’s greatest struggle may be to overcome the legacy of its famously independent postwar central bank .
Germans have a well - known obsession with inflation , but what Americans do n’t often appreciate is how responsible the Bundesbank is for that affliction .
It ’s true that the 1920s period of hyperinflation , not the Great Depression of the 1930s , is the defining moment of recent history for German economists .
But that cultural memory of the effects of loose money is not as strong as some Americans sometimes suggest — after all , it was the downturn of the 1930s , not the loss of value of German currency in the 1920s , that brought Adolf Hitler to power in 1933 .
In point of fact , it was the postwar Bundesbank , with its almost theological focus on price stability as the prime goal of economic policy , that anchored inflation angst in the collective memory .
In pushing their anti-inflation line , Germany ’s central bankers were not only motivated by conviction , but also institutional self - interest :
By staking such a hard line , they managed to claim more influence for themselves in the West German political order .
Germany ’s contemporary fear of inflation is the product of an invented history — one that the mythmakers themselves came to believe .
Americans are welcome to put pressure on Germans to consume , but it ’s likely to be in vain .
As long as they find someone in the world to buy their products , Germans will choose to export and save .
They are all too eager to send off their Porsches to other countries , even if they do n’t know what to do with the money they get in return .
Germany will probably find itself again putting its excess cash into bad investments , just as it ended up holding much more than its share of worthless Lehman Brothers securities .
If that is n’t enough to change a country ’s economic habits , then nothing will be .

5 Eat Lead !
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You know already that lead is bad for you .
This is why we have such a thing as " unleaded " gasoline , and in general do n't allow lead near anything you 're about to breathe or eat .
So what does this have to do with chocolate ?
Well , it just so happens that the shells of cocoa beans , the chief ingredient in chocolate , have an almost supernatural ability to absorb lead from the air .
Of course , this is only a big deal if there 's a lot of lead in the air , right ?
Sure , which is why it 's unfortunate that Nigeria , where a shitload of our cocoa comes from , still has lead in their gasoline .
That 's why a Hershey bar tastes so damn good :
The secret ingredient is African exhaust .

The average candy bar ranks fourth for highest lead content in a food .
Do n't panic yet , though ; lead occurs naturally in everything , even wholesome vegetables and grains , and while there is no amount of lead that is n't harmful to the human body , a little bit of the stuff in our bloodstream is more or less unavoidable and probably wo n't do anything bad enough that we 'll ever notice .
Infants and children , on the other hand , are basically screwed .
Because they 're already stupid , kids absorb higher concentrations of lead into their system than the rest of us , just through their day to day activities of eating dirt and inhaling paint chips .
Also , they breathe faster than an adult , which further draws in whatever lead happens to be floating around and sends it toward their sensitive little brains .
Even before they start wailing on that candy , they have more lead in their bodies than Vito Corleone .
Then comes Halloween .

This interview was recorded in August 2002 .
It ran as the 41st “ I ’ll be Joffed ” article in the Galston Community News on 13 , July 2010 .
Ray Blisset Born 1908 “ The Blizzard ”
We came from Newcastle coalfields and settled in Pennant Hills where we had our own sawmill ... “ Blissert Mill . ”
Some of the ecologists would kill me if they knew the beautiful timber we cut in Blue Gum Creek ( Amaroo Speedway Annangrove area )
We had horses by then .
We used our old bullock wagon and 7 horses pulling it .
We hauled the Blackbutt and Blue Gum from Blue Gum Creek to our Pennant Hills sawmill ...
From Round Cnr. to Baileys Cnr. and along Castle Hill Rd to Pennant Hills West .
The bullocks became outmoded because of the metal roads ... their feet could n’t stand it and horses were faster .
I drove ‘em ( bullocks ) as a young bloke of 14 and 15 for Walter Alley a bullocky in Bullaroo .
Oh I could drive ‘em alright - 14 in a team .
But the metal roads buggered the bullocks teams .
Well I could see no future in the sawmills ... the depression was heading that way .
See the timber strike in 1929 started the depression locally .
The coal miners and timber workers were locked out .
Well I joined the coppers and I went to the Glebe right at the start of the timber strike 28 / 29 .
The razor gangs were very active in Sydney and Melbourne when I joined .
They used blade razors .
They carved people up .
They could really slash ‘ em .
See a copper then could be a copper .
I was known to be a copper .
You never walked around a hooligan .
You walked straight into em Bang !
We had a free hand .
Oh yes .
If they were real bad ya went out bang and picked him up .
If he complained ya went bang again !
Simple as that .
Effective ?
Was it ever !
I eventually got a QPM ( Queens Medal for Distinguished Police Service ) and became Chief of the CIB which no longer exists thanks to Neville Wran and a few boneheads .
The CIB ran the show - rough justice - it was good , very effective .
Gaols were full of people like Chow Hayes .
Billy Ollibone .
I pinched Clarrie Thomas , a gunman .
I locked Lenny McPherson up .
All the gangs .
You could lock ‘em away .
Find ‘em in the wine bars and brothels .
It broke ‘ em up ... buggered ‘em .
See they ’re all dead .
I can say what I like about ‘ em .
But I ’m getting a bit long in the tooth myself .
Nifty is still alive so I ’ve got to be careful what I say about him .
I had a lot to do with Darcey Dugan .
I knew him when he was a paper boy in the Glebe and a notorious gaol breaker .
Len McPherson led Dugan up to Ray Kelly and others to do jobs .
When Graham Thorne was kidnapped ( 1960 ) I was a uniform inspector in charge of Paddington and knew Basil Thorne cause I played golf with him and he won 100,000 pounds .
The fellow who took the ransom demand was Larry O’Shea .
‘ Cause in the meantime the boy died .
The man who really solved it with incredible brains and persistence was a detective named Ron Coleman ... another coalfields boy ( laughter ) ...
I first met Tilly Devine when I was a uniform constable at Regent St .
She was one of the first moles to get silk stockings .
Kate ( Leigh ... Queen of Sly Grog ) .
Of course Kate was an old bitch .
She married Shiner Ryan .
I knocked on the door at Devonshire St. Surry Hills when she had her Sly Grog shop .
Kate said , ‘ Yes Blizzard what do you want ? ’
I said Kate I ’d like you to meet detective Bill Neilsen from Perth .
She grabbed him and kissed him and said ‘ Bill you ol ’ bastard how are you ? ’
I said you know Bill ?
And she said ‘ Oh Blizz .
what ’s up with you ?
You know I know all the shit .
‘ These are the things I could sit here all night ...
In my opinion in Australia in my day we were lucky we only had the rubbish .
No big Al Capone types .
The gunmen and bludgers and urgers and standover men like McPherson used to bludge off the moles and they liked it .
SP betting was infested with low class bum crims .
There was never anything here like in Chicago .
When the Queen came out here I had to send experienced detectives to every country centre she was to visit .
You could n’t take your eye off her .
I had many a sleep on the staircase of the Australian Hotel .
When the Beatles came I was inspector in charge at Liverpool and they brought me into town to guard their hotel .
They always got onto me ‘ cause I used to flatten hooligans .
The Beatles passed right by me .
They had no effect on me .
I ’m tone deaf and I was 56 ( laughter ) .
In life pay the rent , look people in the eye and tell em what you think ... and never back away from a hooligan ( laughter ) .
It ’s alright what ya doing Mick but I would n’t say I ’m wrapped up in ya head gear , ha ha ha ha !

While it might look like a brain - bending puzzle , Mia Schmallenbach ’s Meeting Knives set actually features a brilliant design allowing four different kitchen knives : a paring knife , a carving knife , a chef ’s knife and a filleting knife to all stack inside each other on a single block of steel .
The proportions of each knife were apparently determined by the Fibonacci sequence , a term I have n’t heard since my high school computer science classes , but the results are far from looking like they were designed by a mathematician .
And thankfully , this is one of those times when a cool looking product is actually available for sale .
The Meeting Knives set is produced by Deglon out of France , and I managed to find an Australian website called Table Direct that is selling the set for about $ 920 .
I ’ve also found a slightly more affordable version that comes with a wooden base instead , available from Chef Studio Boutique for about $ 483 .

The family of a man who died seven years ago while being restrained by sheriff 's deputies in Moreno Valley will receive $ 3.5 million in a settlement announced Friday .
Last year , a Riverside County jury found that deputies used excessive force against Arthur Lewis Jr. , 33 , in the October 2003 incident and awarded the family $ 4.7 million .
The county appealed the verdict , however , and the settlement was reached in negotiations between the family and the county .
The victim ’s parents said they called 911 because Lewis was not eating , speaking or communicating .
When Riverside County sheriff 's deputies arrived , the family alleged that they assaulted Lewis without warning with pepper spray , placed him a deadly chokehold and then slammed him to the ground .
The parents testified they heard a “ gurgling sound ” from their son and saw him go limp .
Lewis was carried by deputies to the front lawn of the house , where he was pronounced dead .
The family sued Riverside County , which provides police services for Moreno Valley .
Bruce Disenhouse , who represented the county in the lawsuit , declined to comment .
Lewis was a Navy veteran , Loveland Church member and worked in the pharmaceutical industry before his death .
He had two sons .
“ The family is glad this tragic incident finally has some level of closure , ” said Jon Mitchell Jackson , the family ’s attorney .
“ They ’re hoping this settlement and verdict will help protect other families in their community from this kind of conduct . ”

People who remember the old comic strip “ Peanuts ” will recall an often - repeated situation where Lucy offers to hold a football for Charlie Brown to kick .
Then , as Charlie coming running up to kick it , Lucy snatches away the ball and Charlie Brown loses his balance and goes crashing on his backside .
The reason this same scene remained funny , despite how often it was repeated , is that in the later repetitions Charlie Brown would express suspicion at Lucy , recalling how she had tricked him before .
She would then come up with some claim that she was n’t going to do that any more — and of course she did .
There is a similar routine that has been repeated many times in Washington , over the years , with the Democrats playing Lucy and Republicans playing Charlie Brown .
It goes like this : Democrats start spending money wildly , handing out goodies to a wide range of people who they want to vote for them , while Republicans complain about deficits and the national debt .
Then , when the public becomes alarmed about the debts that are piling up , the Democrats get the Republicans to vote for higher taxes to deal with the debt crisis , in the name of “ fiscal responsibility . ”
Sometimes the deal is sweetened by the Democrats promising to make spending cuts if the Republicans vote for higher taxes , so that there can be one of those “ bipartisan ” solutions so beloved by the media .
But , after the Republicans vote for the tax increases , and come running up to find the spending cuts , the Democrats snatch away the spending cuts and the Republicans fall right on their backsides , just like Charlie Brown .
This old trick is now being unveiled by the Obama administration , like so many other old political tricks used in this “ change ” administration .
In one of President Obama ’s many prissy little sermonettes , complete with finger wagging , he has declared : “ Next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country , I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits step up .
Because I ’m calling their bluff . ”
There is already a bipartisan commission set to provide political cover for the Democrats ’ wild spending that has increased the national debt from 63 percent of the country ’s Gross Domestic Product in 2004 to 83 percent in 2009 — and official estimates of more than 90 percent this year , with more increases in sight .
Why Republicans join such transparent attempts to rescue the Democrats from the political consequences of their own actions is one of the many unsolved mysteries of human nature in general and the Republican Party in particular .
What this political game boils down to is that Democrats get all the political benefits of playing Santa Claus to all sorts of groups and special interests , while Republicans who vote to raise taxes to pay for all this are cast in the role of Frank Nitti , the enforcer for the mob .
Many elections have confirmed that Santa Claus is more popular than Frank Nitti , surprising as that may be to some people .
Republicans are not the only suckers in this game .
The voting public ’s willingness to believe fancy rhetoric and ignore hard facts is a crucial part of this scam .
When the Obama administration said that it could provide health insurance to millions of additional people without increasing the national debt , should n’t common sense have told you that somebody was just insulting your intelligence ?
When the 2,000 - page bill was rushed through Congress too fast for anybody to read it , should n’t that have made you realize that you were being played for a sucker ?
When this bill that was passed with lightning speed was scheduled to take effect only after the 2012 election , did n’t that suggest that they did n’t want you to find out how it works in practice in time to turn against Obama when he is up for reelection ?
Recent polls show that a lot of people are against Obamacare .
But there are still a lot of other people , though not as many , who are for it .
Even more amazingly , there are still Republicans lured by the siren song of “ bipartisanship ” and apparently unaware of the difference in popularity between Santa Claus and Frank Nitti .

Mars capsule : I guess it 's gonna be a long , long time Reuters
Its critics have suggested it amounts to little more than sitting inside a giant tin can in a Moscow hangar with no sun , no fresh water , no alcohol and ( one assumes ) no sex for 520 interminable days .
But as the six fearless volunteers this afternoon sealed themselves inside a simulated mission to Mars , grinning and waving goodbye to their families before " blast - off " , scientists insisted they were embarking on an unprecedented experiment that was no laughing matter .
The crewmen – three are Russian , one French , one Chinese and one a Colombian - born Italian – wo n't emerge from their isolation until November 2011 .
Their goal is to recreate a return journey to the red planet , spanning a year and a half , complete with simulated emergency situations and realistic psychological pressures .
It will , say scientists , provide invaluable data on how a crew would cope with the difficulties and inevitable tedium of long - duration space flight .
" This is n't a joke .
It will give a lot of useful information , not just about Mars but also for Earth , " said Dr Christer Fuglesang , a Swedish astronaut with the human spaceflight directorate of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
He rejected suggestions that the experiment , named Mars 500 , was more Red Dwarf than red planet .
" People are isolated in many places in the world , " he said .
" We have scientists in the south pole for a long time , or in submarines .
Then there are all those in jail . "
The astronauts would be free to leave the experiment at any point , Fuglesang said , adding that he was confident none of them would .
The crew will live and work in a chain of cramped metal capsules .
The highlight of their voyage will be a simulated spacewalk on Mars , which will take place in a large sandpit .
Today journalists toured the sandpit while wearing 3D glasses – the experience was similar to wandering inside a dark and disappointing Moscow nightclub .
Before bidding farewell to the world , the six men conceded their experience would be tough .
This is especially true for Alexey Sitev , the crew 's 38 - year - old Russian commander , who was recently married .
Asked what his bride Ekaterina thought of his spending the next 18 months away from her , he admitted : " It is difficult to answer this question . "
But , he said : " I am not the first traveller who has left his family for a long time to discover new frontiers .
When they got back , they found their families waiting for them . "
The fact that the crew is single - sex should prevent the dangerous sexual tensions that have affected previous mixed missions .
In 1999 , participants in a similar experiment were given vodka to celebrate New Year 's Eve : two members then brawled when one tried to kiss a Canadian female astronaut .
Chinese crewman Wang
Yue struck an exalted tone : " When people say this is a simulation , that it is n't a matter of life and death , I tell them it 's much more .
It 's the future of mankind . "
He added he would attempt to learn Russian during his odyssey .
The experiment is taking place in a sprawling hangar at Moscow 's Institute for Medical and Biological Problems , in a suburb of dingy tower blocks and poplar trees .
The institute began studying the likely effects of a Mars mission in the early 1960s .
Since the Apollo flights of the late 60s and early 70s , there have been no manned space flights beyond Earth 's orbit .
But Fuglesang said he hoped that a real manned space flight to Mars , with international collaboration , could take place in the next two decades or so , though not before 2025 .
Mars 500 is designed to recreate as closely as possible the conditions of a spacecraft hurtling through the solar system .
A return flight to Mars – 34 million miles from Earth – would take between 18 months and three years .
The six crew will spend 250 days performing flight tasks and experiments along the way – with half of them spending 30 days " on the planet " and the others remaining " in orbit " .
Getting home will take a further 240 days .
The 550 sq metre complex that will be their home includes four windowless modules for sleeping , working , storage and for medical and psychological experiments .
Each man has a tiny 6 sq metre room .
TV is banned but the crew can send emails and communicate with " ground control " via an authentically Martian time delay of 20 minutes .
They can also take books , DVDs and video games .
Italian member Diego Urbina said he would be reading the entire works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and French flight engineer Romain Charles said he was bringing his guitar " to annoy the other guys " .
Oliver Knickel , a German who took part in a 105 - day experiment in the same complex last year , said tensions between crewmates were inevitable .
During his mock flight , the crew almost came to blows over use of the treadmill in the module 's tiny gym .
Knickel , a German army officer , did not enjoy eating only space rations selected by others .
" You do n't realise what a privilege it is to choose your own food , " he said .
The challenges : battle against bugs and boredom
Eighteen months in isolation will take its toll on the physical and mental health of the Mars 500 crew and is likely to test their ability to work as a team .
The six have a storeroom full of rations and will eat the same meals as astronauts on the International Space Station , but these supplies must last the whole stay .
A small greenhouse in one of the modules will provide meagre helpings of fresh food including tomatoes , radishes and strawberries .
The facility is not an entirely " closed environment " , meaning water and air are piped in and waste is removed rather than recycled .
There are no windows though , so the crew will live under artificial lighting for the 520 days .
The lack of natural light is expected to trigger physiological changes affecting sleep , mood and metabolism .
The capsule will be lit for periods with a bluish light to see whether it counteracts any problems the crew experience .
A gym with treadmills and weights is provided but European Space Agency scientists still expect to see the crew 's physical health deteriorate through lack of activity .
The men will be given amino acids and omega 3 dietary supplements to see if they help to maintain their mood and keep their performance sharp .
Wherever you have humans , bacteria follow , and the mock - up space capsule has plenty of nooks and crannies where they can breed .
On previous simulated trips , pathogens have grown rapidly and at the expense of more benign bugs , posing a health danger .
The crew will swab themselves and the capsule to identify which bugs are taking hold .
The bugs in the crewmen 's mouths and guts are expected to change too , so some will take food supplements laced with bacteria to boost the " good " bacteria in their bodies .
The greatest problem by far will be coping with the stress of being locked in a small space , with limited company , for such a long time – and only an internet connection to the outside world .
Stress can weaken the immune system , disrupt sleep and hormones and make people irritable and even depressed .
The crew will monitor each other for signs of psychological problems , but they will also be regularly assessed through online tests .

Kosovo independence move not illegal , says UN court Published duration 22 July 2010
Kosovo 's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008 did not break international law , top UN judges have ruled in a non-binding decision .
The International Court of Justice rejected Serbian claims that the move had violated its territorial integrity .
Kosovo officials said all doubt about its status had now been removed , but Serbia 's president insisted Belgrade would never recognise the secession .
The US and many EU countries support independence ; Russia is opposed .
Addressing the court in The Hague , ICJ president Hisashi Owada said international law contained " no applicable prohibition " of Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
" Accordingly , [ the court ] concludes that the declaration of independence on 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law , " he said .
Ten of the ICJ 's judges supported the opinion ; four opposed it .
The judges said their ruling was restricted to the secession declaration itself and did not address the wider issue of Kosovo independence .
The US welcomed the ruling and urged European nations to unite behind it .
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu called for wider international recognition for his state .
" The decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognise the republic of Kosovo could have , " he said .
He also urged Serbian President Boris Tadic to change his attitude towards Kosovo .
But Mr Tadic told reporters : " Serbia will never recognise the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo . "
The BBC's Mark Lowen in Belgrade says it is unlikely that Serbia will soften its approach , but there will be increasing pressure from the international community for Serbia to drop its aim of fresh talks on Kosovo 's status .
Earlier , Nato commanders said the 10,000 - strong peacekeeping force in Kosovo was ready to deal with any violence sparked by the ruling .
Serbian troops were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of the province 's ethnic Albanians , who constituted 90 % of its two million population .
Kosovo was then administered by the UN until February 2008 , when its parliament voted to declare independence .
Damaging dispute
So far , 69 of the UN's 192 member countries have recognised Kosovo as independent - they include the US , UK , neighbouring Albania and Croatia .
Those opposed include Russia , China and Bosnia .
EU nations with separatist movements of their own - including Spain and Greece - have also not recognised Kosovo .
At the start of the deliberations last December , Serbia 's representatives argued that the declaration of independence both challenged its sovereignty and undermined international law .
Kosovo 's representatives warned that any attempt to reverse its independence might spark further conflict .
Although non-binding , the court 's ruling is likely to provide a framework for diplomats to try to establish a working relationship between Serbia and Kosovo .
One year since being sworn in as Minnesota 's junior senator , Al Franken reflects in his office of the long recount and legal battle .
MPR Photos / Mark Zdechlik
One year ago , Democrat Al Franken was finally sworn in as Minnesota 's newest U.S. Senator after a nine - month long recount and legal battle .
The Minnesota Supreme Court determined Franken defeated Republican Senator Norm Coleman by just 312 votes .
From entertainer to senator
At a public water park just east of St. Paul , all of the adults watching their kids play remember well Minnesota 's 2008 Senate election .
" Yeah , it was never ending , " said Melissa Starn of south Minneapolis , and who voted for Al Franken .
" You know just a lot of going back and forth and it was good to see that it got done .
So far , I think he 's done a good job . "
Starn can't point to anything specific Franken has done in Washington .
Neither can Michele Jennings who lives in Hugo .
Jennings did not vote for Franken largely because of concern over his entertainment background .
Franken was a cast member on Saturday Night Live , an author and a biting political commentator before deciding to run for office for the first time .
" I am kind of surprised that he 's doing as well as he is , " Jennings said .
" You kind of just waited for that moment for him to flop on his face and so far it has n't come yet . "

Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Al Franken , D - Minn. , left , listens to Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan , right , as she testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington , Wednesday , June 30 , 2010 , before the committee ' shearing on her nomination .
Susan Walsh / ASSOCIATED PRESS
In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio News at his St. Paul office , Franken confidently said he 's proven his critics wrong and that he knew he was n't going to flop .
" So to that extent , I 'm exceeding some low expectations I guess that were created by the other side , " Franken said .
The first test
Just a couple of weeks after becoming a senator on July 7 , 2009 , Al Franken found himself front and center in Washington as a member of the Judiciary committee questioning then Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor .
" Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Judge Sotomayor for sitting here so patiently and for all your thoughtful answers throughout the hearing ... , " Franken said at the hearing .
A year later , Franken sounded more at home questioning President Obama 's second Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan .

Franken 's first legislative success was the creation of a pilot program that pairs service dogs with veterans .
Since taking office , he 's introduced 23 pieces of legislation .
Six have become law and most of them with Republican support .
He also sponsored an amendment banning federal funding for defense contractors who force employees into arbitration in cases of rape and harassment allegations .
On health care reform , Franken won passage of a measure capping the percentage of health insurance premiums that can be spent on administrative costs and marketing .
The Senate also passed a Franken amendment that would establish an independent board to assign credit rating companies to evaluate securities to address conflict of interest issues between financial service companies and rating agencies .
Getting the job done

One year into his term , Franken said he 's accomplishing what he set out to do .
" My whole goal has been to be an effective member of the Senate for the people of Minnesota , " Franken said .
" That 's really been my goal , and to come up with commons sense solutions to problems and to fight for working people against corporate special interests and I have been successful in that . "
When Franken left for Washington , he noted that a majority of Minnesotans did not vote for him .
He received less than 42 percent of the vote , but he pledged to work on behalf of all Minnesotans .
He also promised to maintain a low profile despite his celebrity .
Franken has rarely granted interviews to media outside of Minnesota .
" I wanted my colleagues to know that I was n't there to be a show horse , " he said .
" I was there to be a work horse and I wanted the people of Minnesota to know that I was n't there to be on ' Meet the Press . ' "
Franken 's opponents often accuse him of being an angry partisan .
News outlets have reported he has lost his temper in Washington , once when he chastised one of President Obama 's top aides over how the White House was handling health care reform negotiations .

Franken 's office says several incidents have been blown out of proportion , but Franken acknowledges he 's made some mistakes .
One time during Senate floor remarks early on , Franken broke decorum when he relayed part of a private conversation he'd had with Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota .
" And you do n't do that , I learned that day .
So I just went up , I apologized to him immediately , " Franken said .
" Now he and I have a good relationship .
Whenever I vote against one of his bills , I always go up to him and I go , ' John I voted against you this time , but it 's the last time . '
And he laughs . "
Being the new senator
" I think for any Senator new to the chamber there is definitely an adjustment period and I think Franken experienced that just like everyone else , " said Jennifer Duffy , who follows the Senate for the Cook Political report .
Duffy said Franken has somewhat of a mixed reputation in the Senate .
" On the one hand , he 's really tried to work well with some Republicans , " she said .
" He 's focused on legislation that frankly has got some broad popular appeal , you know like service dogs for veterans .
But on the other hand , his sort of sarcastic sort of sense of humor has gotten him into a few tiffs with colleagues . "
Duffy said Franken has probably accomplished more than most freshmen senators .
Still , the official Republican line of attack on Franken in Minnesota has not changed since the campaign , and Minnesota Republicans can't wait until he 's up for reelection .
" The only upside about his being a one - year anniversary is that we only have a limited amount of time to go until the end of his only term , " said Minnesota GOP chairman Tony Sutton .
Sutton dismisses Franken 's claims of bipartisanship .
" He 's looking to try and build the case that he 's some kind of bipartisan senator , but if you look at his day - to - day actions he 's very liberal , from his rhetoric , for how he represents Minnesota , " Sutton said .
According to Minnesota Public Radio News / Humphrey Institute Polling in May , 48 percent of Minnesotans gave Franken a positive job performance rating .
Settling into the role
Senators often settle into a couple of areas of expertise .
Franken said his time on the Judiciary committee has revealed to him that although he's not a lawyer , he 's well suited to debate legal questions .
Take for example anti-trust issues surrounding the proposed Comcast / NBC merger .
" I was sitting next to Arlen Specter who 's been there forever , I mean not forever but he 's 82 years old and he goes , ' Well Al obviously knows more about this than any of us ...' and that felt good , " Franken said .
" So I 'm finding areas where I 'm beginning to be the go to guy on something . "
During his campaign , Franken talked a lot about so - called green energy .
Looking ahead , Franken said he would like to get spots on the energy and veteran 's affairs committees .
He said he plans to run for reelection in 2014 .

===============
There are many ' easy tasks ' suitable for new contributors .
AWN is primarily a C codebase that is currently slowly moving towards C++ ( C++11 included ) .
While we have n't switched to Gtkmm yet , there 's plenty of places where the code can be improved by using C++ APIs *.
For example :
* use std:: string instead of plain gchar * strings
* use boost : : filesystem instead of GLib file API
* use standard containers instead of GLib equivalents
* etc .
Most of such changes are comparatively local and have low risk .
Thus you do n't need to know the codebase well in order to contribute .
Nor you have to be a C++ guru .
Just open any *.cc file , search for a gchar *
C string being allocated and freed within the same function and change it to std :: string .
It 's just that easy :)
All similar contributions are welcome .
--
* while switching to C++ by itself has little benefit , practices such as RAII vastly reduce the chance of common bugs .

Angle flummoxes local press with " stimulus " non-sequitor
Here 's the latest out of Nevada : Sharron
Angle is getting attention for flubbing an answer involving job creation in a manner that raises questions about whether she grasps an enormously important local issue .
This is not going to get the sort of national coverage that attended her " slush fund " or " Second Amemdment Remedies " claims .
But in a sense this kind of thing can actually be more important , since it more directly concerns a major local issue directly afflicting Nevada residents .
What happened was this :
Angle , under fire for saying she disagreed with something Harry Reid did that saved a project involving thousands of local jobs , claimed that what she 'd really meant to say was that she opposed the stimulus .
The problem , as a flummoxed local reporter pointed out , is that the stimulus had nothing to do with the project in question .
The mess started last week when Angle was asked if she would have intervened in order to save MGM Resorts ' City Center complex .
The center suffered serious financial struggles last year during construction , and looked like it was about to go belly up .
But Reid called several banks and got them to extend loans , helping the project avert bankruptcy .
Angle subsequently said on the radio that she would n't have stepped in .
And later , she added that so doing would be " kind of like shifting the chairs on the Titanic . "
Given that Angle is already under fire for claiming that job creation is n't in a U.S. Senator 's job description , these comments were obviously less than helpful .
Now Angle has tried to clarify these comments in an interview with the local Fox affiliate .
She said :
" What I said on the radio is that I would not have voted for the stimulus for the City Center .
And the reason is because what happened there was Harry Reid rewarded some friends at the expense of other businesses in town .
Stimulus does not work and we 've seen that with the unemployment rate going up . "
But this project was n't collecting any stimulus dollars .
" There were no public dollars used for City Center , " the Fox reporter rejoined , adding that what Reid " actually did was just pick up the phone and ask the banks to go ahead and loan some money that was needed in order to finish the construction [ with ] 22,000 jobs on the line . "
Again , this kind of thing wo n't gain the national traction of her more lurid claims .
But this sort of stuff is likely to get more attention from Nevada voters who might fairly ask themselves whether Angle grasps the basics of this hugely important local issue .

There ’s a lot of information out there on how to lose weight , and it ’s often really hard to figure out what works .
Our staff has tried each of these tips , and we are happy to report they worked for us !
Listed below are five tips to help you reach your weight loss goals :
# 1 : Eat a Piece of Fruit a Few Minutes Before Your Main Meal
Did you know that people who eat an apple about fifteen minutes before their main meal end up consuming an average of 187 fewer calories than when they have nothing at all ?
By tricking your tummy into thinking you are partially full , you are able to take the edge off your appetite and end up consuming fewer calories at your main meal .
Wait about ten minutes before starting your meal .
By doing so , you will find that your appetite is markedly reduced and you wo n’t eat as much .
The fruit will also provide fiber and help your digestion and keep your colon cleaner .
# 2 : Use Salad Plates Instead of Dinner Plates for Meals
This is a very effective quick weight loss tip for women , as it forces you to practice portion control .
Because your plate is smaller , you wo n’t be able to put as much food on it , and you will discover that you actually eat less .
It ’s a great way to control your calorie intake , because we tend to eat all the food on our plates , regardless of the size .
Try it and see for yourself – it really does work !
# 3 : Do Not Eat After 9 p.m. at Night
One of the biggest causes of weight gain is eating too late at night and then going to sleep soon after .
If you absolutely have to eat something late , make sure it is low in calories .
The truth of the matter is that you are better off eating smaller , more frequent meals throughout the day instead of sticking with the standard three meals .
This is because when you do n’t eat often , your body goes into what is known as “ starvation mode , ” as it tries to preserve its fat stores .
Your body understands that you wo n’t be eating very often , so it compensates by storing fat as a source of energy .
Eating later in the evening or just before bed makes you gain weight because the calories you consume will be stored as fat , and when you ’re sleeping you wo n’t be able to burn any of them off .
Middle - aged men can get rid of a pot belly in just a few weeks by following this simple rule of not eating before bed .
As a matter of fact , when it comes to quick weight loss tips for men , this may be one of the best .
# 4 : Try Walking to Lose Weight
Going for short walks on a daily basis can be an easy and enjoyable way to take off extra pounds .
Try to walk at a brisk pace if you can , as you ’ll burn off more calories that way .
But be careful not to overdo it – the most important thing is to be consistent .
Ten minutes every day is better than thirty minutes twice a week !
If you are too busy to exercise , then use your imagination .
How about exercising at work ?
For example , if you can manage to walk a few flights of stairs every day , you ’ll burn more calories and the pounds will gradually come off .
# 5 : Drink Several Glasses of Pure Water a Day
Drinking two 8 - ounce glasses of water before breakfast , lunch , and dinner while also cutting back on portion sizes may help people lose weight and keep it off for at least one year , according to recent research .
“ As part of a prudent , low - calorie weight - loss diet , adding water may help with weight - loss success , ” said Brenda Davy , professor of nutrition at Virginia Tech University .
The main reason drinking water before meals appears to support weight loss is that it helps fill the stomach , making people less hungry and therefore less likely to overeat .
Water will also flush toxins from the body and allow it to function more efficiently .
Digestion is also improved when there is more moisture in the colon .
Most people do n’t drink enough water , and the benefits of increased hydration will be seen in many ways .
The Secret to Successful Weight Loss ?
The “ secret ” to successful weight loss is really no secret at all .
You just need to be consistent and set realistic goals .
Most people start off with a bang , but within a few weeks they lose their motivation to lose weight .
The fundamental reason for this is that they have set their goals too high .
It ’s much better to take a “ one day at a time ” approach to becoming slim .
While diet supplements like South African Hoodia Gordonii can help to suppress appetite , they will never take the place of discipline and willpower to take off pounds and stay slim .
Weight loss without dieting requires a lot of exercise , so be prepared to work hard .
Ask yourself , “ What must I do today ? ”
By dividing it up into very small and achievable daily goals , you will find that you are able to stick with your long - term diet and exercise plan .
When it comes to successful weight loss tips , this might be the best one of all !

Tuck Sleep How Sleep Works Health Benefits of Napping Health Benefits of Napping August 1 , 2020 Written by Jocelyn Zakri MPH , RRT , RPSGT , RST
What is a nap ?
We define a nap as mid-day sleeping of under an hour , during which the body experiences light sleep .
Longer sleep periods during the day are called siestas .
You might hear about microsleep periods and think these are naps .
They are not .
Microsleep is unintentional brief ( as little as a few seconds ) of sleep , often of only part of the brain , and usually unknown ( not consciously perceived ) by the person .
You do not want to have microsleep episodes .
Indeed , intentional naps are a preventative measure against microsleep .
The afternoon slump
Thankfully , short afternoon naps are good for us , so there ’s no need to feel guilty about the afternoon slump – the midday energy slump experienced by many adults .
But why does this phenomenon happen ?
The afternoon slump can be attributed to a variety of factors , from a heavy lunch to sheer boredom .
However , your body may also be signalling you to fall asleep .
Your body temperature changes throughout the day as part of your circadian rhythm .
Its lowest point is in the morning just before waking , and it rises during the day .
Between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. , however , your body naturally experiences a small dip in temperature , signaling the brain to produce the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin .
This is a normal part of your circadian rhythm , but it helps explain why you feel sleepy in the afternoon .
Benefits of afternoon napping
Is napping good for you ?
When done correctly , the benefits of napping are numerous .
Short naps ( of less than 1 hour ) are associated with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease , improved productivity , and increased mental performance and learning .
Naps reduce your risk of heart disease Afternoon naps can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease , especially for males , according to a report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine .
Naps reduced the risk of heart problems about as much as statin drugs do ( medication designed to lower cholesterol ) .
People who napped at least 30 minutes a day , three times a week , were 37 percent less likely to die from heart disease .
Occasional nappers had a 12 percent reduction .
Naps improve mental performance Research continues to show that daytime napping can improve mental performance in adults .
A study in 2006 concluded that regular naps of less than 30 minutes , and even a power nap as short as ten minutes , can improve productivity and mental performance .
Studies like these have led to enthusiasm behind the midday power nap as well as preparation naps for hurry - up - and - wait occupations such as surgeon and airline pilot .
National Geographic even compared the brain to an email system , “ sleep — and more specifically , naps — is how you clear out your inbox . ”
That ’s too simplistic , of course , but sleep in general makes us more receptive to learning .
So we know naps can help us remember things we just learned , but are they better than equivalent period of time awake relaxing or watching television ?
Yes , the time spent in napping is better for remembering than the time spent awake .
Naps help you remember Longer sleep durations such as nighttime sleep are even better for memory than daytime naps .
However , research has established that the gains in improved memory occur in the first half of the night .
A sleep period of 3.5 hours is pretty much as effective as a period of 7 hours .
Sleep plays an important , if not wholly understood , part in formation of long term memory .
Memories are consolidated during sleep .
Brain researchers have shown events they call “ spindles ” happen in Stages 1 and 2 of light sleep and these seem to be connected with memory formation and learning .
Short naps can be very effective in facilitating and consolidating learning since the body experiences light sleep .
Thus the “ power nap ” .
It is thought that power nap might accelerate memory consolidation by inducing NREM sleep , when light sleep occurs and spindles appear .
Why does light sleep help us learn ?
One theory is “ synaptic pruning ” takes place during sleep .
This holds that during waking period synapses grow stronger and the number of synapses increases , crowding out the brain ’s ability to absorb more information .
Sleep is a time when the brain eliminates the number of synapses and frees up resources for further learning .
Previous learning is sent to long - term memory .
This theory has some animal evidence to support it , but it is just a theory .
How napping affects sleep
All other things being equal , what is better : an afternoon nap or getting more sleep at night ?
There is no correct answer of course , but the addition of 30 - 45 minutes in nighttime sleep does not significantly affect measures of vigilance and daytime sleepiness the next afternoon .
Mid -day naps do improve performance on the psychomotor vigilance test and they make people less sleepy in the afternoon as measured by the MSLT .
Caffeinated beverages also help us over the mid-afternoon hump more than extra sleep at night , too .
The timing of the nap affects your sleep architecture .
Morning naps and afternoon naps differ , with people tending to drift off faster in the afternoon for longer naps with more slow - wave deep sleep than morning naps .
Naps over 30 minutes usually bring post - nap inertia , though .
If the sleeper goes into Stage 3 , slow - wave sleep , it will be harder to wake up .
The cognitive benefits of the longer naps last longer , too .
However , developing a habit of regularly taking long naps is associated with higher mortality rates , especially among the older population .
Long naps and siestas
The tradition of the siesta in some countries and cultures has posed a question for a long time : is taking a siesta on a regular basis good for you ?
Determining this type of thing is tough .
It has long been known that people in these countries generally have lower rates of fatal heart disease than their counterparts in siesta - less countries , but nobody ever knew if there was a cause and effect relationship .
Maybe other factors such as diet may have been responsible for fewer heart attacks .
A 2007 study conducted by epidemiologists at the University of Athens of over 23,000 participants found that siestas were correlated with lower rates in fatal heart attacks , especially in working men .
Meanwhile , a study conducted at Hadassah University Hospital in Israel in 2005 looked at a sample of 455 70 - year olds and found that those who practiced siestas had a higher death rate .
An earlier ( 2003 ) Israeli study found that long siestas ( over 2 hours ) were correlated with increased mortality among men , but that shorter naps and siestas for women had no major correlation with mortality .
And siestas appeared to be worse among men with chronic health problems .
A 2000 study by Harvard Medical School researchers of people in Costa Rica found that daily siestas in fact increased the effect of heart attacks .
The evidence remains inconclusive whether siestas leads to higher mortality rates from heart attacks .
Regardless , the Spanish government ( the country most known for its siesta ) recently launched a campaign to eliminate the tradition of siestas .
Spaniards reportedly sleep an average of 40 minutes less per night than other Europeans and have the highest rate of workplace accidents in the European Union .
Researchers tend to agree that resting in the afternoon without sleeping does not pose any health risk and is often very beneficial .
Napping can be taken as a sign of excessive daytime sleepiness , a symptom of many sleep disorders , but this is an example of how we look at sleep differs whether we are looking for pathologies or recreation .
Recreational and appositive naps are fun , and not a sign of a disorder .
Daytime napping : power naps and coffee naps
For many , sleeping is fun , and one of the most fun ways to sleep is daytime napping .
There are many ways of napping .
Different lengths , locations , and times of day .
Some people have a regular nap in the afternoon ( common in toddlers and retired people ) , while others have a catnap during their lunch breaks .
Opportunity and preferences play a big part in napping behavior .
Some investigators distinguish between appetitive nappers and replacement nappers .
Appetitive nappers can nap at almost any time , and do so often to “ tune out ” of their surroundings .
On the other hand , replacement nappers are trying to catch up on sleep .
Appetitive nappers can nap even when they ’re not sleepy , like an afternoon nap .
Replacement nappers are usually not in the mental state or habit that allows them to sleep at will .
Another way to classify napping is by saying some naps are prophylactic and some are recuperative , respectively before or after sleep loss .
Planned power naps before anticipated periods of busy work can raise performance and cut the risk of sleepiness during times when a person needs to be at the top of his or her game .
The power nap
What used to be called a catnap is now called a power nap .
The word “ power ” makes it socially acceptable for working adults who think of themselves as on the top of their game and helps sell napping to people who might otherwise think of it as an activity for small children and old people .
Usually the power nap is under 20 minutes , so the brain does n’t have time to go through all the phases of sleep .
Longer naps often leave the person groggy upon waking , but power naps can be refreshing without a sleepy hangover .
Some people take their power nap at their place of work – at their desk chair for instance .
More ambitious nappers have a cot near their office or even go out to their car for a nap .
Most do not use alarm clocks .
How to take the perfect power nap
If all this talk about naps has made you sleepy , embrace it .
If you want to take a power nap , follow these tips for success :
Take advantage of the afternoon slump , when your body is already primed to fall asleep .
Do n’t sleep at your desk .
It takes about twice as long to fall asleep sitting upright versus lying down .
Instead , find a dark and cool place .
Use earplugs or a sleep mask to block out extra light and noise .
Meditate and relax .
Take slow , deep breaths .
Clear your mind of all stress - related thoughts from work .
Do n’t sleep for longer than 20 minutes .
Set an alarm if you must .
The coffee nap
The coffee nap takes the power nap to the next level .
Sleep researchers at the Loughborough University did several tests on fatigued drivers to compare the effects of different methods for a driver can use to stay awake .
They put the volunteers in driving simulators while they were sleepy and let them drive .
Some of the tests included rolling down windows for cold exposure , blasting the radio and slapping oneself in the face to try to stay awake .
But what researchers found worked the best was a Caffeine Nap or Coffee Nap .
Most American adults drink coffee , and caffeine is possibly the most widely used and longest self - administered drug in mankind .
Caffeine is a stimulant and is often used when people want to stay awake .
The coffee nap is an example of the paradoxical effect of many substances in the body .
How to take a coffee nap The Coffee Nap is simple : you drink a cup of coffee and immediately take a 15 - 20 minute nap .
Researchers found coffee helps clear your system of adenosine , a chemical which makes you sleepy .
The combination of a cup of coffee with an immediate nap chaser provided the most alertness for the longest period of time in tests .
The recommendation for a coffee nap is a bit shorter than a power nap – 15 minutes vs 20 minutes .
Drink a cup of coffee right before you sleep , so the caffeine kicks in just as you wake up .

Best time of day to nap
While the afternoon slump is the ideal time to take a nap , when that slump occurs may depend on whether you ’re a lark or an owl .
Wake up Best time to nap Bedtime Morning larks 6 am 1 - 1:30 pm 9-10 pm
Night owls 9am 2:30 - 3 pm 12-1am
In 2012 , researchers at Stanford University found that caffeine during the day disrupts night sleep more in morning people ( larks ) than in evening people ( owls ) .
Morning larks may want to avoid coffee naps , and opt for regular power naps instead .
Can napping cause insomnia ?
Although there is always a risk that daytime naps lead to nighttime insomnia , individuals can learn the specific needs and response of their bodies .
Many people can nap in the daytime without nighttime problems .
Insomniacs , especially those attempting sleep restriction therapy , are discouraged from daytime napping because it could make it harder to sleep at night .
The link between insomnia and daytime napping is more prevalent among older adults , although the research is still conflicting on whether there is a cause - and - effect relationship .
Retired people take a lot of naps because they have less structured days than younger people , but those of all ages can take naps .
Napping as you age
One of the characteristics of embryonic stem cells is their ability to form unusual tumors called teratomas .
These tumors , which contain a mixture of cells from a variety of tissues and organs of the body , are typically benign .
But they present a major obstacle to the development of human embryonic stem cell therapies that seek to treat a variety of human ailments such as Parkinson's , diabetes , genetic blood disorders and spinal cord injuries .
Now a team of biologists at UC San Diego funded by a grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , the state 's stem - cell funding agency , has discovered a way to limit the formation of teratomas .
In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers report that they have identified a new signaling pathway critical for unlimited self propagation of embryonic stem cells .
Using small molecule compounds that inhibit this pathway , the scientists were able to dramatically reduce the potential of embryonic stem cells to form teratomas .
" Human stem cell therapy involves differentiating human embryonic stem cells into the kinds of cells needed for the treatment , " said Yang Xu , a professor of biology who headed the team that published the report .
" But this differentiation is never complete , meaning that the final product is a mixture of cells inevitably containing undifferentiated embryonic stem cells .
So by transplanting these cells into a patient , there 's clearly a risk of producing teratomas . "
If researchers could halt the propagation of human embryonic stem cells during lineage - specific differentiation before they are transplanted , they could avoid the risk of producing teratomas .
" This is a proof of concept to show how we can avoid teratomas in human embryonic stem cell therapies by studying the basic biology of these cells , " said Xu .
" At this point , we only see a significant but partial effect because we are targeting only one pathway .
Once we identify more pathways required for teratoma formation by embryonic stem cells , we might be able to completely suppress the formation of teratomas by targeting multiple pathways simultaneously . "
Other scientists involved in the discovery were Steven Briggs , a professor of biology at UCSD , and UCSD biologists Matteo Moretto - Zita , Hua Jin , Zhouxin Shen and Tongbiao Zhao .
Xu recently received a $ 1.2 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine for another research effort to explore a new strategy to induce immune tolerance to grafted cells derived from human embryonic stem cells .

there 's something wrong with the methodology itself if 90 % of the projects fail to use it properly
I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a religion out of it , as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved by a single trick , by a simple form of coding discipline !

Shipping software is not an emergant property of competent programming , nor is it a consequence of management technique .

Postscript : The difference between Sashimi and Nigiri
If we 're judging success or failure of a development methodology , we have to judge the results on whether the development itself was successful .
We can't judge whether the software made money , or whether the company 's stock soared .
Such things can be studied , however those are product management problems , not software development problems .
People have criticised Google , saying that althought it has a track record for shipping products , only one , AdWords , is financially successful .
If you want to compare product management methodologies , that 's fine , but you are n't talking about software development .
You have to compare similar kinds of projects , for example you can't compare an in - house IT project with a known ROI ( reduce the time spent entering a new Blort Ticket by 50 % , saving $ 47.32 per week per Fizbang team member ) to speculative product development like a new Web 2.0 calendar .
Who else is trying to create new products ?
Apple ?
Microsoft ?
Dan Bricklin ?
Compare them to Google , and if they are doing a better job of making money with their projects , post a critique of Google 's product management on your blog .

There is only one problem with development methodologies .
Just one .
It affectsmethodologies , agile and otherwise : No methodology can ' fix ' projects that are staffed with underperforming people .
People are more important than process , period .
This is the underlying issue with the language ' wars ' as well .
No magical combination of JSON , static typing , design patterns , IDE whizzies , and frameworks will somehow help a million monkeys produce any of Shakespeare 's works .
Steve Yegge has suggested that if 90 % of the projects adopting a methodology fail , you have to stop blaming the people .
You have to stop saying " you 're not doing it right . "
You have to saySounds reasonable .
But why would this be true for methodologies but not true for programming languages ?
99.999 % of the software written in almost any language ( including Lisp , Python , and Ruby ) is buggy .
Yet we readily say that the problem is the programmer .
We think that some languages are better than others , that some languages help eliminate certain classes of bugs , but we take as a given that good tools are not sufficient unto themselvesfor good results .
We know that the quality of the result is almost entirely driven by the quality of the programmer .
Home Depot might suggest that buying a new table saw will cause beautiful woodwork to appear in your home .
Yet just because a duffer with a table saw cannot make built - in closets all by himself , we do n't abandon table saws outright .
We assume that good woodworking iswith good tools .
And if we are blessed with the skill to make a built - in closet with a hand saw , we know that we can also make the closet with a table saw , and This is my criteria for judging a methodology .
Can it improve a team that is already fundamentally qualified to write software ?
If you want to stop reading here , my statement is that you can only judge a methodology on the basis of the results it delivers for a team that has already proven it can ship software .
You judge it on the basis of .
You do n't compare its results to the results some other team gets , or to your fantasy of what results the team ' ought ' to get .
What I 've written seems obvious .
Yet , billions of dollars are paid every year to people who are selling a different perspective .
What is it that causes companies to buy silver bullet after silver bullet ?
Why do companies lurch from consultant to methodology to programming language like infomercial junkies looking for something that will flatten their tummies without sweaty exercise or unpleasant diets ?
I bifurcate teams into those that are fundamentally qualified and those that are n't .
And I believe that to fix an unqualified team , you start with the people , not the process or the tools .
So what could the rest of the IT industry possibly believe ?
I have observed a belief in a marginal team .
A team that is somehow straddling the fence between incompetence and competence .
They can ship software , but only with help from their process and tools .
If ' marginal ' is too perjorative a term , you could think of them as having
In truth , I have worked with several such teams , so I believe they exist .
However , I believe that such teams are quite rare , while proponents of silver bullets make a living convincing customers that marginal teams are commonplace .
The primary example I have observed of a marginal team is a team composed of individuals who are not working together well , yet they have achieved success on other teams in prior roles .
Something like the Los Angeles Lakers before Phil Jackson arrived .
There is a lot of latent championship potential in the individuals , but the team is n't performing .
Why does the IT industry believe that perhaps most teams that fail are marginal teams ?
They have to believe this , otherwise they would n't waste time and money trying new silver bullets ( " everything should be a stored procedure , " " tests are the only documentation that matter " ) .
My broken - record assertion is that the industry as a whole embraces the above model of a marginal team : latent potential in the individuals .
The difference between the industry and I is that I have an objective measure of latent potential :
The industry does n't apply this test rigorously , if at all .
A typical interview with a developer focuses on patterns and archiecture , on talking about past achievements .
Developer 's do n't juggle .
Developer 's do n't design software .
And especially , managers do n't hire developers with super - strong references from strong employees that have worked with the candidate in the past .
Basically , managers ask developers if they can ship software and then take the candidate 's word for it .
If you take only one thing from this blog post , take this : .
Someone can demonstrate the ability to write software but lack the ability to actually ship software . : nothing in this post should be construed to suggest that people cannot become better developers through study , mentorships , or training .
However , training is to hiring as tools are to skill .
And they are not mutually exclusive , any more than good programmers and good tools are mutually exclusive . )
I believe that the reason why the IT industry believes that most failing teams are marginal rather than outright incompetent is that they believe that these teams are composed of individuals who can write software and managers who can direct work .
All they need are the right tools to write software " better " and better software will emerge .
All they need is a methodology to manage software development better and software will ship .
If you have a marginal team , a team composed of individuals with proven ability to ship working software , you might have something there .
But if a team is n't even marginal , no methodology will help .
And that 's why a useful methodology can still fail to help 90 % of the teams that try it .
For the same reason that Wasabi makes Sushi divine .
