Would n’t it be great if Ron Paul won the Republican primary ?
Well , I ’m not getting my hopes up , and neither should you .
Winning straw poles is one thing , but mass media is hell bent against acknowledging that Paul has any real chance winning an election .
So long as they repeat on - air that he can’t win , he ca n’t win .
This is how propaganda works .
Waiting until after another Republican wins the nomination to have a backup plan is foolish , and will certainly seal the fate of any real chance Paul has of getting elected .
The contingency plan should start now , and I humbly offer this :
On the day that another candidate is chosen to run for the republicans , all third parties should announce that they will be running Dr. Paul as their candidate .
Why would they do that , you ask ?
Good question .
Here is what ’s in it for them .
5 % . While Nader came close and Perot actually broke 5 % , there is enough traction in the Paul campaign that it is very likely he could break 5 % , if he was just on the ballot .
Running as a third party candidate is tough , especially trying to just get on the ballot in all 50 states to begin with .
Most third party candidates are not running in all 50 .
5 % means matching federal funds next time around .
Now while I am not intricately familiar with campaign finance law , I see no reason why two or more third parties could n’t collaborate and * both * ensure matching funds for the next election .
Today it ’s hard enough for one third party candidate to get 5 % , and then only have the funds for a single cycle .
Imagine what the field would look like in 2012 and 2016 if 5 or more third parties all had federal matching funds .
It could radically alter politics in this country .
What ’s in it for Paul and his supporters is an actual shot at office .
I believe that enough people are disillusioned with the two - party system that a real and viable candidate for office such as Paul has a shot .
If Paul were to become a third party candidate and land his name on the ballot in all 50 , I do n’t think people would be afraid they would be throwing their votes away .
Paul might even have a better shot as the third party underdog , considering just how fed up the nation is with the democratic congress and the republican president .
( both have record low approval ratings )
In a nutshell , when Paul is not given the republican nod it gives third parties an opportunity to band together for the greater good .
If you are active in any third parties , or know someone who is , please start talking to them regarding .
In order to navigate the minefield the two - party gatekeepers have left for third parties to get in the game , this collaboration will need to get off the ground asap .
Your comments and criticism are invited
When I wrote about some of the stories that are likely to be discussed over the next year , one of those that I mentioned is the delay before we see further increases in production from KSA .
In the piece I quoted from the Arab News about the latest projections of Aramco production increases over the next two years .
While there has not been much change in the total projected production over the last eighteen months , there have been some , as the Kingdom has moved toward a goal of 130 rigs operating there by May of this year .
Over the time we have posted here , we have quite often revisited the planned production increases from the Kingdom , and so I thought it worth having a quick look to see how things are going .
Current plans to reach a 12.5 mbd goal call for the following production numbers ( according to Cordesman and the CSIS )
Abqaiq - 400,000 bd
Ghawar - 5,500,000 bd
Berri - 400,000 bd
Safaniya - 1,500,000 bd
Abu Sa'fah - 300,000 bd
Zuluf - 800,000 bd
Marjan - 450,000 bd
Haradh - 170,000 bd
Shaybah - 500,000 bd
Munifa - 1,000,000 bd
Note that in a June 2005 post the the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) was quoted as suggesting the following for current and projected Saudi oil output by field .
This gives the 11 mbd that they claim to be able to currently produce - though it includes Munifa , of which we have commented negatively earlier .
To bring this up to 12.5 mbd they plan an additional
Haradh - 300,000 bd
Khursaniyah 500,000 bd
Shaybah - 500,000 bd
Khurais - 1,100,000 bd
when you include an anticipated 800,000 bd loss due to old fields declining , the sum comes in just over the required number .
Now of these Aramco has already brought Haradh on line , ahead of schedule last March .
In contrast Munifa is now ( as I mentioned in the post ) not going to be around until 2011 – so we need to scratch that from current availability .
Further if we look at the prediction in the Arab News we find that the list of fields where the production increase will come from has seen the addition of another field .
The Abu Hadriyah , Fadhili and Khursaniyah fields are being developed , with production of 500,000 bpd of Arabian Light crude oil , plus more than one billion standard cubic feet / day ( scfd ) of associated gas .
This is forecast to come online in December next year .
Located deep in the Rub Al - Khali , or Empty Quarter , the Shaybah field has been delivering 500,000 bpd of Arab Extra Light crude oil since its start - up in 1998 .
Plans call for increasing production capacity to one million bpd , with the first increment of 250,000 bpd under implementation and slated to come onstream by the end of 2008 .
Two other major field development projects on track to meet the maximum production capacity target are the Khurais and Nuayyim fields .
The Khurais project , which will also include production from the Abu Jifan and Mazalij fields , is projected to produce 1.2 million bpd of Arab Light crude oil in 2009 .
The Nuayyim project , a central Arabian field , is slated to add 100,000 bpd of Arabian Super Light crude oil by 2008 .
The three - field development that is scheduled to come on line at the end of this year has not changed .
Abu Hadriyah is not in itself new ( the following picture of a Saudi team drilling there was taken in 1960 ) .
Further when the CERA list on which it appears was reviewed here in Sept 05 , Interloafer quoted Matt Simmons in expressing some cynicism about Aramco ability to sustain the higher levels of production projected for these fields .
Peter Jackson , of CERA , disagrees ( pdf file )
The project currently appears to be on schedule .
Now it should be born in mind that the Saudi Strategic Energy Initiative is to have enough spare capacity to be able , by June of this year , to replace Iran ’s production , should there be a problem .
And , for this reason , it is perhaps a little presumptive to assume that they are currently producing at a maximum level .
However , it should be noted that this also assumes that the three - field increased production will be on line by that time .
As noted above , it now appears that it will be later in the year before this happens .
Musing about these numbers , what struck me was that we are now seeing increments in production coming from multiple fields rather than just further development of a single one .
After the first new increment for Shaybah comes on line , work for which is now underway , ( but which may now be only 200,000 bd by April of 2008 , with another 300,000 bd being added by 2010 ) the next development , Khurais , is also going to be a three - field project .
It will also include the Abu Jifan and Mazalij fields , and will need injection of an additional 4.5 mbd of treated water into those fields to achieve that production level .
And to achieve the target production Aramco has added another field , Nuayyim , which is anticipated to produce 100,000 bd by February 2009 .
This schedule has been accelerated over earlier projections .
The President of Aramco talked about the challenges in meeting these goals at a recent SPE meeting and said , among other things
Let me begin by first looking at hydrocarbon resources from the perspective of new petroleum technologies .
In fact , I think that viewing high - potential hydrocarbon resource opportunities around the world as “ technology targets ” is a very useful approach , and yields four major , distinct areas of activities or strategies for the future .
These are :
• First , expanding the size of the oil - in - place pie by finding new oil fields ;
• Second , increasing ultimate recovery from both the existing and yet - to - be discovered fields ;
• Third , giving special attention to areas which are hard to explore and produce , thereby reducing costs and making uneconomic plays feasible , and finally ;
• Exploiting the potential of unconventional oil resources .
From which he went on to say
at last summer ’s OPEC Seminar I challenged explorationists around the world to find no less than eight trillion barrels of oil - in - place — the higher end of the current range of estimates .
That should allow us to add roughly a trillion barrels of total proven oil reserves in the form of new discoveries : a massive target to which technological enhancements could be applied in order to achieve even higher recoveries .
I would like to renew that challenge tonight through the SPE , and to urge exploration specialists and technology developers to draw upon their skills , knowledge and experience to meet that challenge .
In regard to point two he said the following :
Just think : increasing recovery by just one percent could add about 80 billion barrels of oil to global reserves — equivalent to nearly a quarter - century ’s worth of Saudi Aramco ’s current production .
Once again , I look at past trends in recovery rates and the ingenuity of scientists , engineers and professionals like you , and I see no reason why we ca n’t increase the global average recovery rate to 50 percent in the next several decades .
Frankly , I ’m still not happy about leaving that other 50 percent to Mother Earth , but even hitting the halfway mark will allow us to add another trillion barrels to the world ’s reserves base .
I must add however that as Saudi Aramco , our target for recovery will be aimed at much higher recovery rates , in the range of 70 percent , and that is the grand challenge you will be engaged in for decades to come .
There is no more efficient way to grow future reserves than to go after the resources we already know exist , and by identifying , developing and implementing technologies which will minimize the amount of these already discovered resources left behind .
In that regard I agree with his point , though do not see the investment being made that will meet his challenge .
For those that have those answers , I was initially led to write the post by an e-mail we received from Pilgrim , who suggested that we look to see what sort of folks Aramco were looking to hire .
Their web site led me to the remarks I have quoted above .
As with any company that is producing at the level , and with the challenges that Aramco face , the ageing of their workforce ( which was recognized in the speech ) and the loss of company knowledge that it will entail , gives them a challenge in turn that they might find it very hard to meet .
Where to begin ?
First , in what universe is a guy who never served even close to being qualified to judge those who have worn the uniform ?
Rush Limbaugh has never worn a uniform in his life - not even one at Mickey D's - and somehow he's got the moral standing to pass judgment on the men and women who risked their lives for this nation , and his right to blather smears on the airwaves ?
Second , maybe Rush does n't much care , but the majority of troops on the ground in Iraq , and those who have returned , do not back the President 's failed policy .
If you go to our " Did You Get the Memo " page at VoteVets.org , there 's a good collection of stories , polls , and surveys , which all show American 's troops believe we are on the wrong track , not the right one , in Iraq .
Does Rush believe , then , that the majority of the US Armed Forces are " phony ? "
Third , the polls and stories do n't even take into account the former brass who commanded in Iraq , who are incredibly critical of the Bush Administration , and it 's steadfast refusal to listen to those commanders on the ground who have sent up warning after warning .
Major Generals John Batiste and Paul Eaton left the military and joined VoteVets.org for that very reason .
Does Rush believe that highly decorated Major Generals are " phony soldiers ? "
Finally , as Media Matters notes , just recently , members of the 82nd Airborne in Iraq wrote a New York Times op - ed , very critical of the course in Iraq , and suggesting it was time to figure out the exit strategy .
Two of them just died .
Will Rush call up their grieving parents and tell them that they should stop crying , because they were just " phony soldiers ? "
Get the point here , Rush ?
You were n't just flat out wrong , you offended a majority of those of us who actually had the courage to go to Iraq and serve , while you sat back in your nice studio , coming up with crap like this .
My challenge to you , then , is to have me on the show and say all of this again , right to the face of someone who served in Iraq .
I 'll come on any day , any time .
Not only will I once again explain why your comments were so wrong , but I will completely school you on why your refusal to seek a way out of Iraq is only aiding al Qaeda and crippling American security .
Ball 's in your court .
UPDATE : If you want to help me get on Rush 's show , please click here to send Rush a letter .
Wes Clark will send your message directly to Rush Limbaugh !

One of the biggest paradoxes in physics is the black hole information paradox , but new research from a team of physicists at Case Western Reserve University may have resolved it .
As I have mentioned in previous articles , physics is fractured .
It has produced two theories that are shining beacons of modern science : quantum mechanics and general relativity .
Both are accurate to the limits of our ability to measure them , and both have predicted results that were years ahead of their time and later experimentally verified .
However , the similarities end there .
At the heart of quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework of linear equations that describes the very small bits of the universe as probabilistic .
General relativity is described by an elegant set of highly nonlinear equations that detail the very big in a completely deterministic manner : polar opposites that stand in stark contrast with one another .
This discrepancy has reared its ugly head every now and again , but one place it is clearly demonstrated is the " information loss paradox . "
Black holes truly are the vacuums of the universe : once — or if , more on that later — you cross the event horizon , neither you nor anything that originates from you will ever come back .
As my general relativity professor quipped one day in class , " If you cross the event horizon , you wo n't know anything has happened .
You 'll still get the morning paper ; you just wo n't ever be able to tell anyone on the outside . "
The information contained in an object that falls into a black hole is lost to the universe forever .
However , this poses a problem , as quantum mechanics states that information cannot be destroyed .
The black hole information paradox began life , so to speak , in 1975 , when Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein proved that black holes were not really black , but that they emitted thermal radiation and eventually evaporated .
This leads to a problem ; other cosmological tenets ( the no-hair theorem ) suggest that the Hawking radiation that leaves a black hole should be independent of the material that goes in .
This is problematic , because if one could have an initial quantum state where everything is known with exact certainty and send it into a black hole , then as the black hole evaporates and evolves , the final state of the system cannot be predicted .
In this case , the best result is that a probable outcome can be computed .
Here information has been lost : you knew exactly what went in , but you do n't know exactly what may come out — quantum mechanics has been violated .
Here 's how it looks when stated in a different manner by an expert in the field , CalTech Professor John Preskill in a 1992 review paper on the information paradox :
This is the information loss paradox .
The paradox is that if we try to analyze the evolution of a black hole using the usual principles of relativity and quantum theory , we are led to a contradiction , for these principles forbid the evolution of a pure state to a mixed state .
Reconciling the contradictory
Over the course of the past 30 years , people have sought to reconcile these apparently contradictory predictions .
It has been suggested that the " lost " information actually ends up in parallel universes where no black holes exist , or that Hawking radiation is not entirely thermal but has some quantum effects as well .
In 2005 Prof .
Hawking published a paper that suggested quantum perturbations of the event horizon of a black hole would allow information to escape , hence resolving the paradox .
However , that theory has not yet been widely accepted by the scientific community .
New work released this week by a team of physicists at Case Western Reserve University offers a revolutionary new proposal to solving this paradox : information is not lost in black holes because nothing ever crosses the event horizon !
The Case Western Team approached the problem from a relatively uncommon perspective .
Instead of taking the view of an observer falling into a black hole , they took the more physically relevant viewpoint of the asymptotic observer : one who is so far away from all the action that s/he is not affected by it and cannot affect the process .
From this viewpoint , they work out the mathematics that describes what happens when one starts with non-singular matter and tries to collapse it .
In order to describe the system , the team used the Schwarzschild metric of spacetime .
As an aside , when working in curved space as described by general relativity , a metric gives one a way to measure distances in both space and time dimensions .
Initially this approach gave me cause for concern , since the Schwarzschild metric is such a ( relatively ) simplistic one .
It ignores charge and angular momentum and can lead to unphysical results depending on the coordinate system one works in .
The researchers here state that they did not encounter any of the difficulties typically seen when working in this metric , suggesting that their calculations are self - consistent .
The physical equivalent problem that the researchers address is that of a shell of collapsing matter , or more technically a vacuum domain wall .
Applying the equations of general relativity to this problem in the Schwarzschild metric , the team produced an expected result : the formation of the event horizon takes an infinite Schwarzschild time .
Given that this result is well known , the researchers expanded their field of inquiry to include quantum effects .
To see if this result still holds true in the quantum realm , the team made some assumptions and used what is known as the functional Schroedinger equation .
They found that even when accounting for quantum effects , the black hole still takes an infinite amount of ( Schwarzschild ) time to form .
Taking their results a step further , the physicists find that the collapsing shell will radiate away its energy in a finite amount of time .
They found that the amount time needed to radiate away all of the shell 's energy is shorter than the time needed for an object to fall through the event horizon .
This leads to one of their major conclusions : an observer sufficiently far away " will see the evaporation of the collapsing shell before he can see any objects disappear " .
According to Dejan Stojkovic , one of the paper 's authors , " An outside observer will never lose an object down a black hole .
If you are sitting outside and throwing something into the black hole , it will never pass over but will stay outside the event horizon even if one considers the effects of quantum mechanics .
In fact , since in quantum mechanics the observer plays an important role in measurement , the question of formation of an event horizon is much more subtle to consider . "
What does this have to do with the information paradox ?
Since the outside observer never sees the formation of the event horizon in a finite time , the radiation that they can measure is not fully thermal , and can still carry information about the object that was tossed towards the black hole .
Thus , information has not been lost , only changed ; which is fine by all physical laws .
This research , if correct , could be the solution to one of the biggest paradoxes encountered in modern physics .
The work is freely available as a pre-print on the arXiv.org servers ( must like mathematics to read ) , but has been accepted for publication in an upcoming edition of Physical Review D.
The authors make it very clear what assumptions have been made in their work and what effects those may have .
Although they feel that many of the assumptions will not significantly alter the final outcome , they admit that some could directly lead to the formation of an event horizon in a finite amount of time .
They also mention ongoing efforts to remove some of the assumptions that went into this work .
The researchers are also quick to point out that a theory is not complete without an experimental verification .
Since Earth - bound lab created black holes do n't exist yet — the Large Hadron Collider may change that — the authors suggest that a sonic equivalent of a black hole , a dumbhole , may provide a testing ground for their theory .
While it is not currently feasible to create such an event in a lab , the authors point out that one need not create a fully realized dumbhole .
They say that one only need to create the beginning stages of collapse towards a dumbhole to observes the equivalent acoustic radiation .
This acoustic " pre-Hawking " radiation would carry the sonic information of the sound that is falling into the dumbhole in a manner akin to losing quantum information to a black hole .
If they 're right , their theory should be experimentally verifiable .

LUCKNOW ( Reuters ) - Lawyers tied a young man to a tree and beat him outside a court in India for refusing to marry one of their relatives , an official said on Wednesday .
They rounded on the victim when he arrived at a court in the Taj Mahal town of Agra to settle a dispute over marrying the niece of one of the lawyers .
Indian TV channels showed the abusive lawyers tearing off the man ’s shirt , tying him to a tree trunk and cutting bald patches into his hair .
The 22 - year - old victim was then beaten up .
Local official K. Chandramauli said he ordered police to file a case against the lawyers .
The Agra Bar Association said it was investigating the attack .
CHARLESTON , W.Va . – A couple arrested at a rally after refusing to cover T - shirts that bore anti-President Bush slogans settled their lawsuit against the federal government for US $ 80,000 , the American Civil Liberties Union announced Thursday .
Nicole and Jeffery Rank of Corpus Christi , Texas , were handcuffed and removed from the July 4 , 2004 , rally at the state Capitol , where Bush gave a speech .
A judge dismissed trespassing charges against them , and an order closing the case was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Charleston .
" This settlement is a real victory not only for our clients but for the First Amendment , " said Andrew Schneider , executive director of the ACLU of West Virginia .
" As a result of the Ranks ' courageous stand , public officials will think twice before they eject peaceful protesters from public events for exercising their right to dissent . ''
A call to the White House seeking comment on the case was not immediately returned Thursday .
The front of the Ranks ' homemade T - shirts bore the international symbol for " no " superimposed over the word " Bush . "
The back of Nicole Rank 's T - shirt said " Love America , Hate Bush . "
On the back of Jeffery Rank 's T - shirt was the message " Regime Change Starts at Home . ''
The ACLU said in a statement that a presidential advance manual makes it clear that the government tries to exclude dissenters from the president 's appearances .
" As a last resort , " the manual says , ``security should remove the demonstrators from the event . ''
Atoms interfering with themselves .
After ultracold atoms are maneuvered into superpositions -- each one located in two places simultaneously -- they are released to allow interference of each atom's two " selves . "
They are then illuminated with light , which casts a shadow , revealing a characteristic interference pattern , with red representing higher atom density .
The variations in density are caused by the alternating constructive and destructive interference between the two " parts " of each atom , magnified by thousands of atoms acting in unison .
Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) have demonstrated a novel way of making atoms interfere with each other , recreating a famous experiment originally done with light while also making the atoms do things that light just wo n't do .
Their experiments showcase some of the extraordinary behavior taken for granted in the quantum world — atoms acting like waves and appearing in two places at once , for starters — and demonstrate a new technique that could be useful in quantum computing with neutral atoms and further studies of atomic hijinks .
The NIST experiments , described in Physical Review Letters [ 1 ] , recreate the historic " double - slit " experiment in which light is directed through two separate openings and the two resulting beams interfere with each other , creating a striped pattern .
That experiment is a classic demonstration of light behaving like a wave , and the general technique , called interferometry , is used as a measurement tool in many fields .
The NIST team used atoms , which , like light , can behave like particles or waves , and made the wave patterns interfere , or , in one curious situation , not .
Atom interferometers have been made before , but the NIST technique introduces some new twists .
The researchers trap about 20,000 ultracold rubidium atoms with optical lattices , a lacework of light formed by three pairs of infrared laser beams that sets up an array of energy " wells , " shaped like an egg carton , that trap the atoms .
The lasers are arranged to create two horizontal lattices overlapping like two mesh screens , one twice as fine as the other in one dimension .
If one atom is placed in each site of the wider lattice , and those lasers are turned off while the finer lattice is activated , then each site is split into two wells , about 400 nanometers apart .
Under the rules of the quantum world , the atom does n't choose between the two sites but rather assumes a " superposition , " located in both places simultaneously .
Images reveal a characteristic pattern as the two parts of the single superpositioned atom interfere with each other .
( The effect is strong enough to image because this is happening to thousands of atoms simultaneously — see image . )
Everything changes when two atoms are placed in each site of the wider lattice , and those sites are split in two .
The original atom pair is now in a superposition of three possible arrangements : both atoms on one site , both on the other , and one on each .
In the two cases when both atoms are on a single site , they interact with each other , altering the interference pattern — an effect that does not occur with light .
The imbalance among the three arrangements creates a strobe - like effect .
Depending on how long the atoms are held in the lattice before being released to interfere , the interference pattern flickers on ( with stripes ) and off ( no stripes ) .
A similar " collapse and revival " of an interference pattern was seen in similar experiments done earlier in Germany , but that work did not confine a pair of atoms to a single pair of sites .
The NIST experiments allowed researchers to measure the degree to which they had exactly one or exactly two atoms in a single site , and to controllably make exactly two atoms interact .
These are important capabilities for making a quantum computer that stores information in individual neutral atoms .

In commuting the sentence of I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , President Bush said that the former vice presidential aide had suffered enough and that the 30 - month prison term ordered up by a federal judge was “ excessive . ”
But records show that the Justice Department under the Bush administration frequently has sought sentences that are as long , or longer , in cases similar to Libby ’s .
Three - fourths of the 198 defendants sentenced in federal court last year for obstruction of justice -- one of four crimes Libby was found guilty of in March -- got some prison time .
According to federal data , the average sentence defendants received for that charge alone was 70 months .
Just last week , the Supreme Court upheld a 33 - month prison sentence for a decorated Army veteran who was convicted of lying to a federal agent about buying a machine gun .
The veteran had a record of public service -- fighting in Vietnam and the Gulf War -- and no criminal record .
But Justice Department lawyers argued his prison term should stand because it fit within the federal sentencing guidelines .
That Bush chose to make an exception for a political ally is galling to many career Justice Department prosecutors and other legal experts .
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday the action would make it harder for them to persuade judges to deliver appropriate sentences .

The critics included some Republicans who said Bush ’s decision did not square with an administration that had been ardently pro law - and - order .
“ It denigrates the significance of perjury prosecutions , ” John S. Martin Jr. , a former U.S. attorney and federal judge in New York , said of the commutation .
On Tuesday , Bush , speaking to reporters after visiting with wounded military personnel at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , refused to rule out the possibility that he might later grant Libby a full pardon .
That would wipe out the felony conviction and allow Libby to retain his law license .
“ As to the future , I rule nothing in or nothing out , ” Bush said -- his first public comments on the case since announcing the commutation late Monday .
Sentencing experts said Bush ’s action appeared to be without recent precedent .
They could not recall another case in which someone sentenced to prison had received a presidential commutation without having served any part of that sentence .
Presidents have customarily commuted sentences only when someone has served substantial time .

“ We ca n’t find any cases , certainly in the last half century , where the president commuted a sentence before it had even started to be served , ” said Margaret Colgate Love , a former pardon attorney at the Justice Department .
“ This is really , really unusual . ”
Said Ellen S. Podgor , a professor at Stetson University law school : “ This is a classic case of executive activism as opposed to judicial activism . ”
Bush said Tuesday that in reaching the decision on Libby , “ I considered his background , his service to the country , as well as the jury verdict . ”
While vacating the prison sentence , he did not disturb other portions of the sentence , including a $ 250,000 fine and two years of a form of probation known as supervised release .
“ But I felt like the 30 - month sentencing was severe ; made a judgment , a considered judgment that I believe is the right decision to make in this case , and I stand by it , ” the president said .

Whether Libby would have to serve probation was in some doubt Tuesday .
The sentencing judge in the case , U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton , said in court papers that it was unclear whether a defendant who had not done jail time could still be subject to supervisory release .
He asked the lawyers to advise him on the issue .
White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , speaking with reporters two hours before Bush made his comments , said the president spent “ weeks and weeks consulting with senior members of this White House about the proper way to proceed . ”
“ He spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to maintain the faith in the jury system , and he did that by keeping intact the conviction and some of the punishments , ” Snow said .
The spokesman took pains to emphasize the penalty still facing Libby , saying : “ This is hardly a slap on the wrist , in terms of penalty .
It is a very severe penalty . ”

Some observers took issue with that .
“ For Bush to jump in and make that argument ... is ludicrous in light of the arguments that his Justice Department makes on a daily basis in federal court , ” said Douglas A. Berman , a sentencing expert at Ohio State University law school .
“ Similar arguments are made by lots of other defendants who have a much lower profile and who have their lives destroyed and who are going to rot in prison for a very long time . ”
The decision to spare Libby also rekindled debate over the federal sentencing guidelines , first enacted in the mid-1980s to ensure that defendants who commit similar crimes receive similar punishment .
Critics of the system , including federal judges , say the rules do n’t allow for mitigating circumstances in individual cases and can result in overly harsh punishment .

But the Bush administration and the Justice Department have been tough enforcers of and advocates for the guidelines .
And they have frequently been critical of federal judges who give lighter sentences .
That made Bush ’s announcement Monday all the more puzzling .
The 30 - month sentence was within the range of the federal guidelines , and was issued by a judge whom Bush had appointed to the bench .
Martin , a retired federal judge who has long been a critic of the federal guidelines , said that Bush appeared to be having the same problems with the guidelines that judges have experienced .
“ The president felt the guidelines were wrong , and that is not an unreasonable determination , ” Martin said .
“ But that is the whole problem with the guidelines .
You can not make individualized decisions .
He is reacting to exactly what the guidelines take away from judges . ”

Several federal prosecutors interviewed by The Times also said they were concerned that Bush ’s decision would send the wrong message to judges , giving them reason to lighten sentences and undermining the goal of a more uniform justice system .
“ Consistency and fidelity to the law are extraordinarily important .
We have expended a lot of credibility to get judges to buy off on this , ” said one senior federal prosecutor who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue .
“ I do n’t know how I am going to advise my people , ” the prosecutor said .
“ I can not tell you how depressed and disgusted people are around here with this decision .
It really undercuts law enforcement . ”
Though Libby ’s sentence may have seemed overly harsh to the president , it comes at a time when courts are upholding stiff sentences .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court upheld by a 5 - 4 vote California ’s “ Three Strikes ” law and affirmed a life sentence for a petty thief whose third offense was stealing videotapes from a K - Mart .

Former members of the Bush administration have been sentenced to jail time in circumstances roughly analogous to those of Libby .
A former federal procurement official , David H. Safavian , was sentenced to 18 months in October for lying and concealing his dealings with GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Late last month , a federal judge sentenced J. Steven Griles , the former second - ranking official in the Interior Department , to 10 months in prison for obstructing a Senate investigation into his dealings with Abramoff .

Schumer : Roberts , Alito ' duped ' us at their confirmation hearings
" Were we too easily impressed by the charm of nominee Roberts , " asks New York Sen.
Charles Schumer at a recent speech to the American Constitution Society , " and the erudition of nominee Alito ? "
Given the recent 5 - 4 decisions on abortion rights , free speech and integration in schools , Sen .
Schumer feels as though the Senate Judiciary Committee was " duped " during confirmation hearings for the two most recent additions to the US Supreme Court : Bush nominees Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito .
Continues Schumer , " Did we mistakenly vote our hopes when our fears were more than justified by the ultraconservative records of these two men ? "
" Yes . "
#
EXCERPTS :
His comments came days after Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , a moderate Republican , said he intended to review the congressional testimony of Roberts and Alito .
The Politico , a Washington - based newspaper , quoted Specter as saying he wanted to see if Roberts and Alito had " lived up " to their promises to respect legal precedents .
A Republican leadership aide dismissed Schumer 's criticism , saying , " The only people that were duped were those that listened to Democrats tell us the sky would be falling once these jurists were on the bench . "

10 . Chocolate contains tryptophan , a chemical in the brain that is used to produce the neurotransmitter , serotonin .
High levels of serotonin stimulate the secretion of endorphins , and produce feelings of elation .
Serotonin is found in the antidepressant Prozac , and the designer drug “ ecstasy ” produces its effects by increasing serotonin levels in the brain .
So … antidepressants , illegal drugs , or a Hershey ’s bar .
You pick .
9. Chocolate also contains a chemical called phenylethylamine .
High levels of this neurotransmitter help promote feelings of attraction , excitement , and giddiness .
Phenylethylamine works by stimulating the brain 's pleasure centers and reaches peak levels during orgasm .
Guys , THIS is why you should always give a girl chocolates on a first date .
Ca n’t hurt , right ?
8. Chocolate might help fight heart disease .
Chocolate contains chemicals called flavinoids , which thin the blood , helping to prevent clotting .
All these wonderful pleasurable feelings , and good for your heart too ?
Man… this just gets better and better .
7. Chocolate is structurally sound .
The World ’s Tallest Chocolate Structure was unveiled in October 2006 at NYC ’s FAO Schwarz .
It was over 20 feet tall , and made of 2285 pounds of chocolate .
Try doing that with a potato chip , you salty - snack fans !
6 . A chocolate craving during pregnancy may indicate mild anemia .
Call it an early warning system .
Chocolate contains iron , and this may be the pregnant body ’s way of signaling that iron levels are low .
So eat that chocolate bar !
It ’s for the good of the baby .
5. Chocolate contains magnesium , which is known to ease symptoms of PMS .
Calcium does too , which of course can be found in milk .
So , if your girlfriend , or wife , or woman - in - your - life - that - you - are - close - enough - to - that - you - are - even - aware - of - such - things is having a bad time of it , bring her a piece of chocolate cake and a big glass of milk .
Not only will she think you ’re a sweetheart , but maybe her mood will improve enough that she ’ll relinquish the remote and let you turn off Lifetime and watch the game .
4. Chocolate contains sugar and caffeine .
Um , what else is there to say ?
Told you …
Perfect .
3. Chocolate may help people live longer .
In a Harvard University study conducted in 1999 , researchers tracked 8,000 men and found those who ate chocolate lived almost a year longer than those who did n't .
Although scientists do n't know why the men lived longer , they speculate it has to do with the antioxidants found in chocolate .
I speculate that it ’s because these same men had enough chocolate around their house that they had no shortage of woman willing to come around and cook them healthy meals and clean their bathroom once in a while .
But that ’s just a theory .
2. Chocolate is a viable alternative energy source .
Researchers at the UK’s University of Birmingham fed Escherichia coli bacteria a feast of waste caramel and nougat from a chocolate candy bar .
The bacteria subsequently burped out hydrogen gas , which was harnessed via a fuel cell to power an electric fan .
Holy cocoa , Robin !
The world ’s energy needs can be met with stale Snickers bars !
Someone call Al Gore .
He ’s going to be just tickled .
And the Top Scientific Reason that Chocolate is the World ’s Most Perfect Food …
1. Cocoa butter melts at 97 °F .
That ’s right , just below body temperature .
So it actually does melt in your mouth .
That also means if you put a Hershey ’s Kiss on your sweetie ’s stomach , it will slowly melt into a little pool of chocolate .
Uh oh ... you ’d better clean that up .
And who knows where things will go from there …
“ What school teaches computer science right ? ” , someone asked on programming .
reddit .
My university is one of the best here in Germany according to the CHE rating .
We ’re officially elite , yet , this does n’t guarantee a good education .
It is possible get a degree and have no clue about programming , math and science at the end .
The question was primarily about the programming languages used , i.e. do the lectures use languages other than Java / C++.
The right thing , as implied by the author and the community , would be to teach cool languages like Ruby , Haskell , Erlang and Scheme .
Does the choice of programming language influence the quality of education ?
No. Learning Java and C++ is a good thing , since most of the software is written with those , but a teacher , who uses Java / C++ for everything , even when it is inappropriate , shows a lack of wisdom for me .
Trying to explain Functional Programming with Java is funny at best .
Unfortunatelly it is unlikely that you learn any cool language in any school .
As with most things , you have to do that on your own .
A university can only give you resources and opportunities .
Everybody knows that lectures and pen&paper tests are the worst way to educate .
What you do with your time is your responsibility .
Here is my list ( mostly scooped from w - g ) , what you should do or learn :
Programming paradigms – imperative , object - oriented and functional programming .
Try to learn a language for every category .
Example : C ( procedural ) , Java ( object - oriented ) and Haskell ( functional ) .
If you know every style , you will program much better , especially when you use multi-paradigm languages , like Python , C++ or Scala .
Addons are Assembler , Prolog and Forth .
Algorithms and data structures – Complexity theory , optimizations , searching , sorting , cryptography , AI , graphics .
Dig deep to the hardware level and learn about instruction sets , caches and architectures .
Compilers and operating systems are the high end topics here .
Abstract background knowledge – quite theoretical .
Lots of math , formal verification aka model checking , Turing machines , lambda calculus and type theory .
The human side – project management , design patterns , UI design , psychology .
You will have to deal with people , who think very different than you .
Managers , customers and co-wokers may not be “ into computers ” like you are .
Practice – with the Open Source movement , you have a wealth of projects , who would like to get a hand or two .
You ’ll learn to deal with people and foreign source code .
You ’ll also gain familiarity with some tools like version control , IDEs and wikis .
Creativity – do n’t forget to do other things .
Music , design , drama or whatever you like .
Your brain has two sides and not both are for logic .
Creativity and outside the box thinking can be learned and nurtured .
Personality feats – university is a good place to develop yourself .
Learn to work with discipline , to stay healthy and fit and to be social !
Train good habits and starve the bad ones !
Read a lot !
The choice of the university is mostly important for the piece of paper you get at the end .
The education you get depends on you .
YANGON , Myanmar ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says he believes the death toll in the Myanmar crackdown to be " far greater " than has so far been reported , The Associated Press has said .
A still from a video released by Myanmarese opposition shows crowds fleeing gunshots in Yangon on Thursday .
more photos »
Shots were fired to clear crowds across the country Friday as authorities reportedly cut Internet connections , while graphic new video footage showed troops using deadly force .
Brown made his comments , AP said , after telephone discussions with President Bush and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao .
Brown 's office refused to supply any estimates , the agency added , as UK diplomatic staff in the country were not certain of events beyond Yangon .
Witnesses told CNN that police opened fire on crowds to disperse demonstrators , resulting in fatalities .
Other sources said they had spoken to a Western witness who had seen up to 35 bodies in the streets .
AP also reported some dissident groups putting the number killed as high as 200 .
CNN could not independently verify the claims .
A day earlier , troops with automatic rifles fired into crowds of anti-government demonstrators , reportedly killing at least nine people in the bloodiest day in more than a month of protests demanding an end to military rule .
The United Nations ' World Food Programme said Myanmarese authorities have placed restrictions on the movement of food because of the unrest , which could impede the U.N. program 's efforts to feed half a million people .
" We appeal to the authorities for access to all parts of the country , " World Food Programme Executive Director Josette Sheeran said .
" We have to protect the most vulnerable people in the country . "
Those being fed , she said , are primarily children , but also include people with HIV , AIDS and tuberculosis .
Meanwhile , the government 's reported block on Internet connections severed a vital information link that has been used to digitally smuggle images of the violent suppression out of the secretive state .
People who tried to log onto the Internet from within Myanmar saw the notice " Access Denied , " Mizzima News ( www.mizzima.com) said .
Many government
Web sites had either not been updated or were not working at all Friday .
CNN could not independently confirm that the government cut the link .
Despite the technical challenge , some news of renewed violence did get out Friday .
The opposition Web site The Irrawaddy ( irrawaddy.org ) , operating out of Thailand , reported at least two people were shot in central Yangon , citing a witness who said she escaped harm by hiding under a car .
The same witness said troops singled out people with cameras , beating them and demanding , " Is it you who sends those pictures out ? "
One diplomat told CNN that a Western witness had reported seeing about 35 bodies lying in rows on a street near Sule Pagoda , with civilians praying over them .
CNN could not independently confirm the report , and it was not known if the bodies were from Friday or the result of earlier violence .
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Shari Villarosa said crowds were not as large as on previous days , when thousands of red-robed Buddhist monks swarmed the streets of major cities .
A resident of Yangon , who did not wish to give his name , told CNN that police told people to remain indoors after midday .
Friday 's restrictions came after the government imposed a night curfew and banned gatherings of more than five people , the U.S. Embassy said , effectively clearing streets overnight , according to witnesses .
The Democratic Voice of Burma ( Myanmar ) reported that many privately owned weekly news journals in Myanmar had decided to stop publication in protest of official demands to publish pro-government propaganda .
According to the organization , authorities are ordering the publications to print articles written by state media and other stories blaming the All Burma Student 's Democratic Front and the National League for Democracy for the protests .
The opposition National League for Democracy party won general elections in 1990 , but the military refused to honor the results and has repeatedly placed party leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest .
The Democratic Voice of Burma also released video Friday that appeared to show someone being shot at close range in Yangon a day earlier .
Watch police open fire on crowds . »
According to state media , nine people were killed on Thursday .
The victims include a Japanese news photographer .
Witnesses ' reports of other deaths , including a university student shot in the head , could not be confirmed .
Gunfire broke out Thursday afternoon when troops confronted thousands of demonstrators who had marched from Yangon 's center to its eastern Tamwe township , Irrawaddy.org reported .
Troops sealed the huge crowds off and then opened fire , the report said .
Meanwhile , on its state - run Web site , the government offered its own account of its response to the protests , saying security officials were provoked into violence .
ASEAN , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , has taken the unusual step of openly condemning Myanmar , which has repeatedly embarrassed the trade bloc in the past .
In Malaysia on Friday , hundreds of Myanmarese exiles joined a rally outside their country 's embassy calling for an end to the crackdown .
Bush has urged Beijing , Myanmar 's main trading partner , to use its influence to persuade the military junta to end its crackdown .
China on Thursday issued a statement urging restraint .
The U.N. special envoy to Myanmar , Ibrahim Gambari , has made his way to southeast Asian neighbor Singapore , according to the city - state 's Foreign Ministry .
The Myanmar government has said it will issue him a visa on Saturday .
The Bush administration backed Gambari 's mission in a statement released Friday .
Russia 's Foreign Ministry also voiced support for Gambari , saying : " We are seriously concerned about the continuing deterioration of the domestic political situation in Myanmar .
The violent crackdown by the government of mass demonstrations in a number of towns was accompanied by bloodshed and has led to considerable human casualties . "

A reader sends a link to this curious article by Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi , head of the Israel Project , which we met this morning pressing presidential candidates to get hawkish on Iran .
Her key thesis -- " if I go to yet another synagogue that has a sign about Darfur and nothing about the threat of Iran , I think my heart will break . "
Not that she 's against worrying about Darfur per se : " Worry about Darfur ?
Yes .
But why ca n’t we worry about Iran — perhaps the greatest threat to Israel ever ? "
Once again , one is left to wonder why Israel went through all the trouble of building the most powerful conventional military in the region and acquiring a nuclear arsenal if all this actually leaves the country more vulnerable than it was in 1966 or 1948 .
And , again , we see the wearing pattern continue where failure to manifest dual loyalties makes one a bad Jew , but any suggestion of the existence of dual loyalties is anti-semitism .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats unveiled tonight that their vote on resolutions condemning MoveOn.org and lackluster efforts to end the Iraq war were part of a plan to lose the 2008 election .
" MoveOn.org has done much to help Democrats win so we had to attack them , " said one Democratic Hill staffer .
" They 're upsetting our best efforts to lose . "
Congressional Democrats fearful that polls and many prognosticators have predicted a major victory for Democrats in 2008 are doing their best to turn the possibility of a landslide for them into a crushing defeat .
" We hate the thought of winning , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
" I can't believe people have n't got that message yet .
We 've done everything but tattoo it on our foreheads .
What 's it going to take for people to realize we like being in the minority party ? "
Democratic bloggers said they 've known of the Congressional Democrats desire to throw what should be a favorable election year for Democrats into a loss .
" They could n't be showing so little regard to their own base by accident , " said one blogger , who asked not to be named .
" We know they 're trying their best to throw the election .
The flaw in their plan is we 're so pissed off at them we want to make sure they win just to spite them .
The bastards .
We see a Democratic victory in 2008 as a two - fer : a chance to foil the best efforts of Congressional Democrats and Republicans . "
In August 2002 , a bizarre looking asteroid made its closest approach to the Earth , skimming only 540,000 km above the Earth ’s surface .
That ’s only 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and Moon .
This gave astronomers an unprecedented opportunity to study the asteroid as it zipped past .
Perhaps its most unusual feature ?
It ’s shaped like a triangle .
Asteroid 2002 NY40 was first discovered as part of the automated LINEAR system in New Mexico on July 14 , 2002 .
And then , just a month later it made this closest approach , coming within 540,000 km of the Earth .
As it approached , it gained in brightness , reaching as high as 8th magnitude – not visible with the unaided eye , but easy to spot with binoculars or a backyard telescope ( if you knew where to look ) .
2002 NY40 ’s close approach was a rare event .
Near Earth asteroids only get this close once every 50 years or so .
The last asteroid to get this near was NEA 2001 CU11 which passed just outside the Moon ’s orbit on August 31 , 1925 .
And it was n’t discovered for 77 years after it made the flyby – astronomers had to go back and calculate when it passed us by .
On the evening of August 17 / 18 , 2002 NY40 was scheduled to make its closest approach .
During this night , astronomers around the world , including a team of researchers from Boeing and the US Air Force focused in on it .
The Boeing / Air Force team brought the 3.6 metre AEOS Adaptive Optics telescope in Hawaii to bear and studied the asteroid in unprecedented detail , revealing a tremendous amount of surface features .
With all this data , they were able to better understand the physical makeup of the asteroid , and get an idea of its structure .
Their results will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Icarus .
Oh yeah , and it looks like a triangle .
The first observations were made with the Raven telescope located at the Remote Maui Experiment site at the base of Haleakala in Kihei , Hawaii .
The telescope was configured so that it could track a fast moving object , like 2002 NY40 as it moved quickly through the telescope ’s field of view .
The researchers modified their exposure times dynamically – ranging from 15 seconds to 60 seconds – as the asteroid came and went .
This allowed them to get the same amount of light for every image ; it let them compare apples to apples .
Getting these high resolution images of the asteroid was actually pretty difficult .
At its very brightest , closest point , when Asteroid 2002 NY40 could be seen at the greatest resolution , it was moving very quickly across the sky – it covered the diameter of the Moon every 6 minutes , zipping across the sky at 65,000 km / hour .
The background stars changed with every image .
Instead of calibrating against a single set of background stars , the researchers had to calibrate each image against whatever images happened to be in the field of view at the time .
Asteroid 2002 NY40 is tumbling .
Its main rotation takes about 20 hours , and its secondary rotation takes about 18.5 hours .
Living on this asteroid would be disorienting , to say the least .
According to the best images , 2002 NY40 is about 800 metres across .
Once again , this was challenging to discern because the asteroid was casting shadows on itself for part of the flyby .
Only at the moment of its closest approach , were astronomers able to get a good image showing its size .
This team ’s estimates are actually much larger than previous estimates , which calculated it being 250 - 450 metres .
It turns out , astronomers were quite lucky with the flyby .
2002 NY40 was perfectly positioned during its closest approach to present its largest face to the Earth .
With this much data , the researchers were able to classify it as a Q - type asteroid ; an uncommon class of inner - belt asteroids that have some metal in them .
And of course , one of the most amazing observations is its strange triangular shape .
Getting these images out of the raw data was the hardest part .
Lewis Roberts , one of the researches that did the work remarked that , “ the imaging was the most challenging .
It was a difficult object to acquire good data on and the raw data did not look great .
The image processing was top notch and pulled out some good images . ”

The structure of a solar - like star ( left ) and a red giant ( right ) , not to scale .
In red giants , the convection zone is much larger than younger stars , encompassing more than 35 times more mass than in the Sun .
Astronomers think evidence of planets being swallowed by stars can be found in metallic streaks across the surface on one .
Debrisspots found on stars reveal planets that went splat like bugs on a windshield .
The result : metal smears on the surface of parent stars , said European Southern Observatory astronomer Luca Pasquini , who offered up another analogy :
" It isa little bit like a tiramisu or a cappuccino , " Pasquini said .
" Thereis cocoa powder only on the top . "
The findingcould help unravel mysteries of planetformation .
Asscientists began discovering exoplanets , or worlds orbiting distant stars , inthe past decade , they found these planets were most often found around starsrich in iron .
Stars that host planets are on average nearly twice as rich inmetals than counterparts without worlds .
But arethese stars rich in metals because planetarydebris polluted them ?
Or do metal - loaded stars naturally spawn worlds ?
It 'sa classic chicken - or - egg problem .
If thesemetals were planetary debris , they would only be found in the outer layers ofstars .
On the other hand , if these metals were inherently part of the stars , they would be found to their cores .
Unfortunately , the only light thatastronomers can see from stars comes just from their outermost layers , whichmeans there is no direct way to peer into their hearts .
Instead , scientists looked at stars whose innards churn far more than our sun does .
Theingredients of the interiors of these stars roil to their surfaces forastronomers to analyze .
Specifically , researchers focusedon red giants , stars that ?as will the sun in several billion years ?
havepuffed up and become much larger and cooler after they have exhausted thehydrogen in their cores .
Compared with sun-like stars , these giants have muchlarger convective zones , or regions where all the gas is completely mixed .
The sun 'sconvective zone comprises only 2 percent of the star 's mass , but in red giantsthe convective zone is 35 times more massive .
Afterinspecting 14 planet - hosting red giants , Pasquini and his colleagues foundthese were not rich in metals as is typically the case for planet - hosting sun-likestars .
The simplest explanation is that metals seen in planet - hosting starsare pollution from planetary debris , findings that will be detailed in thejournal Astronomy & Astrophysics .
The debrismight come from " planets themselves or smallplanetoids , " researcher Artie Hatzes , director of the Thuringia StateObservatory in Tautenburg , Germany , told SPACE.com .
Pasquinisaid their results might favor the controversial and relatively new " diskinstability " theory .
This concept states that large planets emergefrom clumps of dust and gas whose hearts coalesce into cores that growrelatively quickly .
MITplanetary scientist Sara Seager , who did not participate in this study , noted " the findings are an intriguing piece of the puzzle in trying tounderstand planet formation . "
Resolvingthe mysteries concerning how planets form will require a much larger study ofmetal - rich and metal - poor planet - hosting stars , she added .
Will the Real Osama Stand Up ?
It took a few minutes to sink in – the new tape of Osama Bin Laden that was shown and analyzed on MSNBC ’s Keith Oberman show on Friday , September 7 , 2007 .
Perhaps the most striking thing was his black beard .
From all accounts , what sets OBL apart from others , even his most devout followers , is his devotion to Islam * .
While Islam allows the trimming of the moustache , it calls for fully growing the beard without trimming it .
Coloring it , would be out of the question for OBL .
What was said was even more suspicious .
OBL was said to have been surprised that the democrats were not able to bring the troops home .
The intended message by ‘ OBL ’ was that Democrats may have House majority , but they are as impotent as they have always been and clearly the Cheney / Bush team are the emperors .
I also heard that he endorsed reading two books by American authors , one of them Noam Chomsky ’s American Imperialism [ “ Hegemony or Survival ; America ’s Quest for Global Dominance ” 2004 ] – I have to wonder how ‘ OBL ’ being on the run and being pursued by the world ’s greatest military , the only superpower , and while hiding in a cave with a bounty of $ 50 m on his head , got the chance to enjoy this marvelous and enlightening book ?
Or was this a smear campaign to make the Americans relate Chomsky to al - Qaeda ?
Here is a brilliant intellectual who speaks to the truth and spills the beans on American foreign policy , what better way to destroy his reputation than to have America ’s number one enemy , the leader of al - Qaeda , endorse his work ?
And finally , as judge slams down parts of the Patriot Act as unconstitutional , it would seem that Mr. Bush has found a way to remind the American public that they should remain petrified .
Nothing intimidates a nation better than fear , not even ignorance .
Fear will allow more liberties to be taken away , after all , Osama is coming back – full , trimmed black beard and all .
After a phased start - up , the city plans to bring private medical networks into the program next year , expanding the choice of doctors .
Until November , enrollment will be limited to those living below the federal poverty line ( $ 10,210 for a single person ; $ 20,650 for a family of four ) .
Then it will open to any resident who has been uninsured for at least 90 days , regardless of income or immigration status .
Only then will city officials learn whether the program appeals to middle - class workers , who comprise a growing share of the uninsured .
And only then can they test whether San Francisco has the medical infrastructure to handle the desired increase in demand , and to do so without raising taxes .
So far , enrollment has exceeded expectations .
The city projected that between 600 and 1,000 people would sign up by the end of August .
More than 1,300 did , even though officials have done little marketing .
They hope to enroll about 45,000 people — more than half of the city ’s uninsured — in the first year .
Some clinics are adding night hours and small numbers of staff .
“ We really did n’t know what the interest level would be so we ’ve very pleased , ” said Mayor Gavin Newsom .
“ At the same time , we do n’t want over - exuberance yet because we do n’t want to fall of our own weight . ”
At the two pilot clinics , efforts are first made to qualify patients for Medicaid or other state and federal insurance programs .
Those left over receive a Healthy San Francisco card that makes them eligible for primary care , dental exams , mental health and substance abuse services , hospitalization , radiology and prescription drugs .
Because the coverage is not portable , officials believe that those with private insurance will have little incentive to drop their policies to take advantage of the city ’s cut -rate services .
Like Ms. Ho , many of those enrolling were already using the city ’s health clinics — or the emergency room at San Francisco General Hospital — in times of acute need , like an asthma attack or stroke .
About 57,000 of the 82,000 uninsured San Franciscans have used the city ’s health system at some point .
But the new program hopes to persuade them to become regulars who regard their neighborhood clinic as a medical home .
Once enrolled , patients are assigned a physician and encouraged to get blood pressure checks , mammograms and other screenings .

SANGIN , Afghanistan —
A senior British commander in southern Afghanistan said in recent weeks that he had asked that American Special Forces leave his area of operations because the high level of civilian casualties they had caused was making it difficult to win over local people .
Other British officers here in Helmand Province , speaking on condition of anonymity , criticized American Special Forces for causing most of the civilian deaths and injuries in their area .
They also expressed concerns that the Americans ’ extensive use of air power was turning the people against the foreign presence as British forces were trying to solidify recent gains against the Taliban .
An American military spokesman denied that the request for American forces to leave was ever made , either formally or otherwise , or that they had caused most of the casualties .
But the episode underlines differences of opinion among NATO and American military forces in Afghanistan on tactics for fighting Taliban insurgents , and concerns among soldiers about the consequences of the high level of civilians being killed in fighting .
A precise tally of civilian deaths is difficult to pin down , but one reliable count puts the number killed in Helmand this year at close to 300 civilians , the vast majority of them caused by foreign and Afghan forces , rather than the Taliban .

Place the pieces you receive from your teammate in reserve , or use your turn to put it on the board .
You can place a piece anywhere on the board , unless it would put your opponent in check .
Also , pawns can not be placed on the first or last row .
You do n't have to place a piece immediately after you receive it ; you can place it on any turn , but it uses that turn .

These spectacular images are the most detailed true colour pictures of the Earth that we have ever seen .
The clear images , released by NASA , were pieced together from observations taken from a satellite of the land surface , oceans , sea ice and clouds .
Using a collection of these satellite - based observations , NASA scientists have stitched together months of observations of the earth 's surface and combined them to create a colourful mosaic of our living planet .
Scroll down for more ...
The result from using these collection of images is a complete and detailed glimpse of every square kilometre of Earth .
Most of the information contained in these image came from a single remote - sensing device known as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer , or MODIS .
Scroll down for more ...
The device , which takes the images from 700 kilometres above the Earth , provides an integrated tool for scientists to observe and study a variety of earth life .
The images are based on observations , or pictures , collected over a period of roughly three months and were combined every eight days to ensure clouds were not blocking the sensor 's view on any given day .
The Blue Marble images form part of NASA 's Visable Earth catalogue which also provides pictures of earth by night as well as showing the extent of deforestation in Brazil from space .
We talked about travel ideas in our previous post , and as you go visit various places , you are going to find one place you fall in love with and come back to work on the other love of your life .
There are beautiful wedding places all over the world and out of all the islands , Maui has been voted as the best island in the world in 2013 and in 2016 Huff post still thinks so .
Out of all the places , it ’s no wonder why Maui is one of the top destinations .
Because of all the people heading over to get married in Maui , also the wedding planners are very well accustomed to destination wedding planning for parties coming from far away places .
Hawaii is also a place where old meets new , you can find rustic places for your liking as well as the newest of the new resorts are gathered in one place .
Options vary great degrees from hotel planners like in Grand Wailea : https://www.grandwailea.com/gather/a-waldorf-wedding/
that will plan the wedding , but it will be at that resort only ,
to a small boutique and experienced wedding planner like http://youralohawedding.com/
that has exclusive access to some of the private estates that only allow a handful of wedding planners to plan a wedding there .
One thing for sure is to check the reviews .
Review , review , review .
This is one arena where prior experience counts more than the others because there is no second take .
Experienced wedding planners have dealt with a various situation that pops up , good and bad , and when a bad one needs to be handled , you want a veteran on your side .
Someone who can accommodate you , but also someone that can guide you as well .
Another reason why Maui is the perfect destination ?
Your guests will go out of their way to attend ( and in good spirit ) .
I was concerened that not many of our friends will be able to come to our wedding , because most of our friends were in the midwest .
To our surprise , we had dozens who were more than excited to come celebrate the occasion .
Also , you are already at your honeymoon spot .
Some do not like the idea of going on the honeymoon right where one got married .
Guess what ?
Other beautiful Hawaiian islands are just a quick 20 ~ 45 minutes flight away , so if you want to have a special honeymoon inside your honeymoon , you can do that very easily .
Most like the experience of the event taken in Maui .
Also , surprisingly , the cost of wedding planner actually is n’t that high .
It ’s comparable to most metro area , and some might find it actually cheaper than what they have expected .
The accomodations , food , general prices in Hawaii is higher , but not so much so when it comes to human capital side of things .
There are many more reasons , but these are some of the main reasons why I would pick Maui as the prime destination wedding location .
If you have a chance to find it out yourself , please do let me know .
I ’d like to hear about your experience and thoughts .
To your love .
Cheers !
These instructions will tell you how to construct a small to medium sized French counterweight trebuchet in your own backyard ; it should be roughly capable of slinging a baseball , tennis ball , full beer can , or similar such projectile 50 - 100 yards with ease !
Now , precisely what I ’m going to give you instructions on how to build is a working model of the famous French trebuchet and is based on the principles of the hinged counter - style weighted trebuchet .
It has an overall base of 34 in x 31 in .
The following information will give you complete instructions regarding the materials needed , other materials ( optional ) , joining procedures , line drawings with dimensions , making the pouch , and how to put it all together .
Below I ’ve got an excellent video explaining the science behind them and how they work :
Materials :
5 in x 1/8 in round strong steel rod
2 steel pipes , 1.58 in x ½ in diameter , with slip fit to go over the primary axle of 3/8 in
17 in x 3/8 in strong steel rod
3 screws , eye variety , ¼ x ¾ in
1 x 24.5 oz can ( baked bean can is okay )
1 ball of very strong brown twine , not packing variety
4 pieces wood 1 in x 1 in x 46 in
2 pieces wood 1 in x 1 in x 7 in
2 pieces wood ½ in x ¾ in
1 piece wood ½ in x ¾ in
2 pieces wood ½ in x ¾ in
¼ in round x 22 in x 1.17 in wooden molding
2 pieces 4 in Velcro
2 pieces wood ½ in x ¾ in
2 pieces wood ½ in x ¾ in
2 pieces wood ½ in x ¾ in
2 pieces wood 1 x ¾ in x 7 in
2 pieces pole style wood ¾ in diameter x 1.58in
1 x 6 in x 8ft x ¾ in wooden board without knots
Preparation :
Cut the first steel rod into 2 pieces , measuring 3 in and 2 in only .
Cut the second steel rod into 3 pieces , measuring 3.5 in , 6.5 in and 7 in .
Cut the first 4 pieces of wood to lengths of 34 in .
Cut the first 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 24.75 in .
Cut the second 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 10.5 in .
Cut the first 1 piece of wood to a length of 31 in .
Cut the third 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 34 in .
Cut the fourth 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 11 in .
Cut the fifth 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 4 in .
Cut the sixth 2 pieces of wood to lengths of 14 in .
Note :
The final lengths of the ½ in x ¾ in pieces should equal 30 ft 3.5 in .
Cut the board into ½ in pieces as follows :
1 of 1 in x 1 in x 46 in
2 of 1 in x 1 in x 7 in
Keep remaining wood for the base
Tools :
Electric drill , 3/8 in bit , 1/16 in bit
Strong scissors
Elastic bands
Table saw
Strong wire cutters
Regular hammer
Sharpened punch
Pliers
Vise grips
Strong wood stapler
Tooth file , fine
Sandpaper
Wood stain
Sealing lacquer
Knife ( optional )
Eye and ear guards
Strong working gloves
Method :
Each section is given a name , according to the original names designated to each piece historically .
Main Beam : Create a taper measuring 13.5 in from end 1 to 0.25 in at center , ending with a 0.5 in at other end .
The taper begins beyond the axle hole .
Drill two holes with the 3/8 in bit , perpendicular to the beam to carry the axles .
The first is located 1 in from the thickest end and the second is 10 in from that hole , heading towards the thinnest end .
Make two of these only .
Diagram 1 : adapted version of measurements for main beam .
The main beam should look like this :
Diagram 2 : main beam with drilled holes .
Corner Leg : Use one of the first 4 wooden pieces .
This is only one leg , but cuts are made on both sides .
Cut half laps ¼ in deep .
Mark a measurement of 64.2 , ¾ in from edges .
Do the same again at 24.48 in points .
Mark 1 line , ¾ in away to connect those marks .
Or , see the following diagrams :
Drawing 3 : examples of leg 1 , both sides .
Diagram 4 : measurements for cutting and angles for corner leg 1 .
Corner Leg 2 : Copy the procedures for corner leg 1 , creating a mirror image .
Create 2 using the remaining first 4 pieces of wood .
Long Beam :
Use the third set of 2 pieces of wood for this .
Follow the diagrams below to make the necessary cuts and measurements :
Diagram 5 : the long beam cuts as they should appear .
Diagram 6 : long beam measurements .
Trough :
Use the molding , and staple each piece of Velcro at each end , leaving half the Velcro pieces extending beyond the ends , lengthwise .
Diagram 7 : trough drawing .
Diagram 8 : trough measurements .
Outrigging Beam :
Use the only single wooden piece and create 2 notches , sloped , as follows :
Diagram 9 : outrigging beam with notches .
Diagram 10 : outrigging beam measurements .
Crossing Beams :
Use the second set of 2 pieces of wood , creating 2 x 9 ″ notches , angles , tilting inwards in the direction of the axle .
Diagram 11 : crossing beam drawing .
Diagram 12 : crossing beam measurements .
Outrigging : Use the first set of 2 wooden pieces , creating two notches at each end .
Diagram 13 : outrigging drawing with notches .
Diagram 14 : outrigging measurements .
Hangers :
Use the 6th set of two wooden pieces and drill two holes in each end of 3/8 in , 1 in from the ends .
Diagram 15 : hangers drawing .
Diagram 16 : hangers diagram .
Outrigging Brace and Frame Cap :
Use the 4th set of 2 pieces of wood for the outrigging braces and the 5th set of 2 pieces of wood for the frame caps .
Diagram 17 : frame cap and outrigging brace drawing .
Diagram 18 : frame cap and outrigging brace measurements
Beam Brace :
Use the 7th set of 2 pieces of wood to measure as follows :
Diagram 19 : beam brace drawing
Diagram 20 : beam brace diagram
Spacers :
Use the 9th set of 2 pieces of wood and find washers to fit on them to hold them in place when so they can properly center the throwing arm .
Diagram 21 : spacers drawing and measurements
Axles :
Use the 3 pieces of 3.5 in , 6.5 in and 7in steel rods .
If you can , cut threads into each end and find nuts to keep them in place .
Counterweight : Drill 2 x 3/8in holes into the can , on opposite sides , near the top .
For a firm fit , use washers .
Eye screw : Drill a small hole into the throwing arm beam and insert the screw .
Assembly :
Collect and lay out one piece of each part : leg 1 , leg 2 , long beam , and outrigging brace and frame cap .
Remember that the frame cap must not sit flush against the trebuchet legs .
From the bottom of the long beam to the bottom of the outrigging brace , it should measure 22in .
Glue or all the joints together , using elastic bands , counterweights or clamps to keep the joints in place whilst drying , and move onto the matching set .
Both sides should be the same and have the same measurements .
Diagram 22 : frame drawing
Frame , cross beam , outrigging and outrigger beam assembly :
Dry fit cross beams into position .
Secure them with elastic bands or clamps .
Put outrigging beam in place , centered between the frames .
Put the outrigging in position .
Move the outrigging beam backwards and forwards until both frames are at the same angle , facing inwards .
Mark the positions on the outrigging beams with an HB pencil .
Verify that the frame holes are correct by measuring from the holes to the ground .
Both heights should match .
If not , move the outrigging beam until they do .
When satisfied that all things are in position , glue everything in place and secure them with elastic bands and clamps until dried ( overnight ) .
Diagram 23 : assembled frames , counterweights and throwing arm drawing
Put the beam braces 6.5 in from the ends of the throwing arm .
Glue in place , one of the bottom and one on the top .
Wrap some twine around the joints to increase the strength .
These will protect the throwing arm from breaking near the axle .
You may also want to get a release style pin and put it at the top of the assembly or the bottom .
This will help you when you are firing , but either one will do .
Begin assembling the throwing arm section by pushing the axle pieces through the holes in the frame .
Put a spacer on each end , the throwing arm , and another spacer .
Continue this with all the axle sections until complete , adding the pouch on the end ( see instructions below diagram for making a pouch ) .
Diagram 24 : throwing arm assembly picture
A pouch is an essential ingredient , if you want to throw your dog a ball with a trebuchet .
It is easy to make , cheap and long lasting .
You need a diamond - shaped medium leather , measuring 5in width x 8in length , with a notch cut into each corner .
Sew the created edges together to make a cup or belly pouch .
Insert some holes in the longer ends , reinforcing them with grommets ( metal ) to stop tearing .
Diagram 25 : pouch with grommets drawing .
To prepare the trigger by putting the remaining two eye screws into the center of the back cross beam .
Bend a 1/8in x 2in piece of steel into a loop – this is the trigger pin .
Secure it with a five foot piece of twine that can be used to set it off from a safe distance .
Tie some more twine around the throwing arm section , 2 ½ in away from the tip and then secure it on the other end with a loop .
The loop must be able to fit easily over the trigger pin .
The trigger line must be short enough to keep the throwing arm in place on the base or ground until firing .
To prepare the sling , cut some twine into 2 very long pieces , measuring the length from the throwing arm ’s axle to the release pin ; tie each end ( 4 ) to one key ring each .
Attach 1 key ring to the throwing arm tip eye screw .
Attach another to the pouch ’s grommets .
Attach the other sling line to the final grommet and key ring .
This will for a slip ring that can slide easily over a release pin .
Check that the system is working by doing a test fire .
Use some small rocks , which you can put in the can .
Diagram 26 : Projectile in the sling , attached to the throwing arm
Congratulations !
You have successfully built a small scale trebuchet that will give you hours of fun for you and your neighbors ( you get to fire , they get to duck 😈 ) .
Do n’t use this to build a full scale one as the materials need to be much stronger .
Did you know that the firing range on a full sized trebuchet is around 500 yards ?
Have fun !

THE old - fashioned financial system was like Old Maid , a parlour game once beloved of small children .
The banks were like players , dealt hands from a pack of cards , which they swapped among each other .
At the end , one player was left holding a lonely queen — a bad debt , if you will — and lost .
Over the past few decades the game has changed .
Securitisation has snipped the old maid into pieces ; new faces , such as hedge funds , have joined the party , enabling the banks to distribute those pieces among a larger number of players .
When the game is over , lots of players are left holding small losses instead of one player holding a big one .
During two exceedingly prosperous decades , that theory seemed to work just fine .
But the swings in almost all financial markets this month have made dispersed risk suddenly morph into dispersed mistrust .
The uncertainty has been magnified by the way that bad risks have become so hard to value .
Investors have bought asset - backed securities that use shaky subprime mortgages in America as collateral , but as defaults have risen , the value of that collateral has tumbled .
Meanwhile , collateralised - debt obligations ( CDOs ) , made up of clumps of those securities and laced with leverage , have become almost impossible to trade .
So none of the players really knows how much he has lost .
While this uncertainty lasts , investors are taking it out on the banks that peddled the securities by dumping their shares ; and the banks are taking it out on those they sold them to by demanding more collateral on their loans .
The banks have even grown cagey about lending to each other .
The doubts burst into the open on August 9th when central banks were forced to inject liquidity into the overnight money markets because banks were charging punitive rates to lend to each other .
At first , the problems appeared more serious among European banks .
The pain in America was concentrated in the largest hedge funds , including those run by Wall Street 's biggest name , Goldman Sachs .
Increasingly , however , analysts worry about the exposure of American , Canadian and Asian banks .
On Wednesday August 15th shares in Countrywide Financial , a large American mortgage lender , fell 13 % after an analyst gave warning of possible funding difficulties .
Despite liquidity injections by the Federal Reserve on August 15th , the S&P 500 index fell 1.4 % .
The heavy selling spread to Asian and European stocks on August 16th .
Every crisis begets finger - pointing , and the blame now is falling on the rating agencies that helped structure these exotic instruments .
Currently , they are guided by a voluntary code that aims to tackle potential conflicts of interest .
The biggest is that the agencies are paid by the firms they rate .
Rating CDOs was a profitable business .
If these securities are now downgraded , banks could be forced to offload lots of illiquid instruments into a falling market — one of the fastest ways to lose money yet devised .
But if there are no buyers , banks may have to sell something else to shore up their balance sheets .
Something like this indiscriminate selling has been affecting hedge funds over the past couple of weeks .
Faced with more demanding standards from their banks and investors , some have been forced to unwind positions in order to realise cash .
That has led to unusual movements in debt and equity markets , which have only got some funds deeper into trouble .
Quantitative funds have been hardest hit , as investment models that had made money for ages briefly proved worse than useless .
Since banks lend to hedge funds , any problems there quickly become their concern .
On top of this , both Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs have found that when funds bearing their name get into trouble the desire to preserve their reputations soon leads to a rescue .
Sometimes risk is not as far away from the banks as it seems .
At the end of Old Maid as banks used to play it , the loser would take a big write - off and then everyone could start playing again .
In the new version , the use of leverage means the game is being played with hundreds of packs of cards and by thousands of different players .
Working out who has won and who has lost in this round will take a long time .
“ Second Life is about getting the better clothes and the bigger build and the reputation as a better builder , ” said Julian Dibbell , author of “ Play Money , ” which chronicles his year of trying to make a living by trading virtual goods in online games .
“ The basic activity is still the keeping up with the Joneses , or getting ahead of the Joneses , rat race game . ”
TO have a Second Life , one needs a computer , the Second Life software , and a high - speed Internet connection .
You use a credit card to buy Lindens , and Lindens earned during the game can be converted back into dollars via online currency exchanges .
Players start by choosing one of the standard characters , called an avatar , and can roam the world by flying or “ teleporting ” ( click and go ) .
Nobody can go hungry , there is no actual need for warmer clothes or shelter , and there is much to do without buying Lindens .
But walking around in a standard avatar , when there are so many ways to buy a better appearance , is like showing up for the first day of school dressed differently than all the other kids .
You stick out as different , as an SL “ newbie . ”
“ It ’s hard not to fall into that , ” Mr. Yee said .
“ There are shops everywhere , so it ’s easy to say , ‘ Oh , O.K. , I guess I ’ll get a better pair of jeans . ’ ”
Second Life was started in 2003 by a Silicon Valley techie inspired by a sci - fi novel , “ Snow Crash . ”
It is owned by a private company called Linden Lab .
The original idea of the game was to unleash creativity .
Residents do n’t have to wear the latest fashions ; they do n’t have to look — or act — human at all .
They can take any animal , robotic , or inanimate form they want .
And while there is a minority population of animal characters , and wearing butterfly wings is currently in vogue for humans , for the most part the population is young women bursting from their blouses and young men bulging with muscle .
( Underneath the clothes are cyber genitalia , sold separately .
Mark Wallace , a blogger who writes about Second Life , explained that the parts are not fashion accessories but rather “ a functional appliance ” for , ahem , entertainment purposes . )
While a frequent criticism of Second Life is that spaces are often empty and that there ’s “ nothing to do , ” a crowd can be found at the mall , just as it can in suburbia .
For example , the Xcite !
store , which sells body parts , is “ always crawling with avatars , ” said Mr. Wallace , co-author of a forthcoming book , “ The Second Life Herald . ”
Fashion is big business in Second Life , along with entertainment and land development .

Transcripts below the fold
AMY GOODMAN : We 're also joined in studio by Naomi Klein , author of the book The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism .
Your response to that , Naomi Klein ?
NAOMI KLEIN : Well , I 'm just wondering if it troubles Mr. Greenspan at all that wars over resources in other countries are actually illegal .
Mr. Greenspan has praised the rule of law , the importance of the rule of law , in his book .
But in his statements about the reasons why this has not been publicly discussed , he has said that it 's not politically expedient at this moment .
But it 's not just that it 's not politically expedient , Mr. Greenspan .
Are you aware that , according to the Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions , it is illegal for one country to invade another over its natural resources ?
ALAN GREENSPAN : No .
What I was saying is that the issue which , as you know , most people who were pressing for the war were concerned with were weapons of mass destruction .
I personally believed that Saddam was behaving in a way that he probably very well had , almost certainly had , weapons of mass destruction .
I was surprised , as most , that he did n't .
But what I was saying is that my reason for being pleased to see Saddam out of office had nothing to do with the weapons of mass destruction .
It had to do with the potential threat that he could create to the rest of the world .
NAOMI KLEIN : Yes , I realize that , but he was not simply deposed .
The US invaded Iraq , occupied it and took control over its resources .
And under international law , that it is illegal to wage wars to gain access to other countries ' , sovereign countries ' , natural resources .
ALAN GREENSPAN : Yes .
No , I 'm fully aware of the fact that that is a highly , terribly important issue .
And as I said in other commentaries , I have always thought the issue of what essentially amounts to what is often called pre-emptive , preventive action on the part of some countries to secure resources or something else like that , it 's an issue that goes back to the Cold War , when we had the very difficult moral dilemma of what do you do when you think a missile is coming in our direction and you 're not sure whether it's an accident or not an accident .
And that is a problem which I think is a deep moral problem in civilized society .
And the issue is one which I do n't think we 're going to resolve very easily .
And as you point out , yes , I am a believer in the rule of law , and I think it is a critical issue , not only for domestic economies , but for the world economy as a whole .
AMY GOODMAN : Naomi Klein ?
NAOMI KLEIN : You have also advocated economic shock therapy and supported IMF programs that have transformed economies very , very quickly .
And then , you say that you are in support of the rule of law .
But I 'm just wondering how , in a country like Russia , there could be rule of law when it 's being transformed in fast - forward in that way .
ALAN GREENSPAN : Well , remember that you do n't get a market economy merely by eliminating central planning .
And remember , when the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union disintegrated , you did n't have a market economy .
What you basically had was a black market economy .
And they tried to develop the institutions of the democratic society , and it's not something which they have had back for generations .
And as you can see now , there 's an increasing authoritarianism .
It 's a very -- it 's a society which has very different trends at different levels of that society .
And I do n't know exactly where they 're coming up , but I do n't like the direction it 's been going in in recent years .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to Iraq and ask you about , well , a piece by Jim Steele and Don Barlett that came out in Vanity Fair , where they 're talking about the billions lost in Iraq .
And they begin their piece by saying , " Between April 2003 and June 2004 , [ $ 12 billion ] in US currency -- much of it belonging to the Iraqi people -- was shipped from the Federal Reserve to Baghdad , where it was dispensed by the Coalition Provisional Authority .
Some of the cash went to pay for projects and keep ministries afloat , but , incredibly , at least $ 9 billion has gone missing , unaccounted for , in a frenzy of mismanagement and greed . "
Alan Greenspan , when you were head of the Federal Reserve , how much knowledge do you have of this ?
Did you investigate this ?
And did you investigate this ?
Were you aware of this at the time ?
ALAN GREENSPAN : Well , let me say that what we were involved in was essentially endeavoring to create a viable currency for the central bank of Iraq .
And what we did do was -- I think very successfully -- create what is a viable financial system , even under the circumstances that currently exist .
There was , as far as I can judge , a huge drain of the resources into areas which nobody to this day can understand or follow .
It had nothing to do with the central bank .
In our relationships with them , we were merely acting as an intermediary to assist them in creating a system , which they now have , which is working reasonably well , despite all of the problems that are going on .
The issue which you are referring to had nothing to do with the Federal Reserve in any of our relationships with the central bank .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , they are talking about , in one day , for example , the East Rutherford operation center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , 100 Orchard Street in East Rutherford , a tractor - trailer truck pulling up , and though accustomed to receiving and shipping large quantities of cash , the vault had never before processed a single order of this magnitude : $ 2.4 billion in $ 100 bills .
But ultimately , again , $ 9 billion of $ 12 billion gone missing in Iraq .
ALAN GREENSPAN : I am not familiar with any such evidence .
And it was certainly not brought to my attention .
I , frankly , find it very unlikely that those orders of magnitude were involved in any of the numbers that we were dealing with .
You have to make certain that -- there 's been a lot of confusion about losses , and people have used the dinar , the basic currency unit of Iraq , and assumed they were American dollars .
And , of course , that gives you a highly distorted view .
There 's been , I 've seen , several reports fairly recently in which that sort of mistake was being made .
But what I can tell you is that no such numbers of any order of magnitude of the type you are discussing came to the attention of the Federal Reserve .
AMY GOODMAN : This is based on that award - winning article in Vanity Fair , or the team who have won --
ALAN GREENSPAN : Let me put it this way , award - winning does n't necessarily --
AMY GOODMAN : Well , no , no .
I mean Don Barlett and Jim Steele , Pulitzer Prize - winning journalists .
I 'm sure you know their work .
But Naomi Klein ?
NAOMI KLEIN : Well , I would just add that it 's quite surprising , actually , that Mr. Greenspan is unaware of this scandal around Iraq 's missing billions , because Paul Bremer had to testify before Congress and was asked directly about those missing billions .
It 's been the subject of very high - level investigations .
There is a huge paper trail around it .
So this is hardly a secret , and it 's hardly just a matter that 's confined to Vanity Fair .
This is --
ALAN GREENSPAN : Oh , I 'm not saying that the losses are not real .
I think they are , because , obviously , we can't account for all the oil revenues .
I 'm just merely saying it's not something which was directly related to any of the actions which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , to which we were referring , was involved , as far as I know .

An Unusual Event Over South Wales
Credit & Copyright : Jon Burnett
Explanation : Jon Burnett , a teenager from South Wales , UK , was photographing some friends skateboarding last week when the sky did something very strange .
By diverting his camera , he was able to document this rare sky event and capture one of the more spectacular sky images yet recorded .
Roughly four minutes later , he took another picture of the dispersing trail .
What is it ?
Experts disagree .
The first guess was a sofa - sized rock that exploded as a daytime fireball , but perhaps a better hypothesis is an unusual airplane contrail reflecting the setting Sun .
Bright fireballs occur over someplace on Earth nearly every day .
A separate bolide , likely even more dramatic , struck India only a few days ago .
The Honorable Dale Kimball has now ruled : there will be no jury at the trial of SCO v. Novell .
He granted Novell 's motion on that .
He will hear it himself .

No , so there will be no immediate partial appeal .
-- No , so there will be no immediate partial appeal .
Novell 's Motion to Strike Jury Demand -- Yes .
No jury trial .
Novell is seeking only equitable relief .
-- Yes .
No jury trial .
Novell is seeking only equitable relief .
Novell 's Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its Third Claim for Relief - Granted , " with Novell having the right to renew such claim only in there event that there is any subsequent adjudication or trial in this action that retries its Fourth , Sixth , Seventh , or Eight Claims for Relief or there is any enlargement of the issues for trial beyond that contemplated by the August 17 , 2007 Joint Statement " .
You 'll recognize that as Novell 's language , not SCO's .

Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 2 to Preclude SCO from Contesting Licenses Conveying SVRX Rights are " SVRX Licenses " - Granted .
" Therefore , SCO cannot be and is not precluded from arguing that the SVRX component is de minimis .
SCO 's attempt , however , at making a distinction between the license as a whole being an SVRX License and only the SVRX component of the license being an SVRX License is contrary to the court 's finding that even an incidental license of SVRX is considered an SVRX License under the APA 's broad definition of SVRX License .
The court rejected SCO 's arguments that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements were not SVRX Licenses because they licensed SVRX only incidentally .

Disputes as to the court 's interpretation of the contract should be left for appeal . "
SCO 's Amended Motion in Limine Regarding Apportionment of Microsoft and Sun SCOsource Licenses - Mooted in part ; denied in part .
SCO had argued that there would be jury confusion , but there will be no jury , hence no confusion .
That 's the mooted part .
As for the parties ' dispute about who bears the burden of proof on the apportionment issue , the judge tells them they can submit trial briefs regarding legal issues such as burdens of proof .
- Mooted in part ; denied in part .
SCO had argued that there would be jury confusion , but there will be no jury , hence no confusion .
That 's the mooted part .
As for the parties ' dispute about who bears the burden of proof on the apportionment issue , the judge tells them they can submit trial briefs regarding legal issues such as burdens of proof .
Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 3 to Preclude SCO from Introducing New Evidence or Argument Regarding Apportionment of SCOsource Revenue - Denied .
" Novell 's motion is untenable given the court 's ruling that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements contain an SVRX component and that the revenue attributable to that component must be ascertained at trial .
SCO recognizes that it is bound by this ruling for purposes of the approaching trial .
While Novell is introducing evidence as to the appropriate allocation , SCO shall be permitted to offer evidence and argument against Novell 's position  whether that includes a different allocation , such as de minimis , or an argument that no apportionment is appropriate . "
Dr. Cargill can speak for SCO on the question of apportionment , but only to the extent already disclosed .
" SCO , however , asserts that it properly disclosed Dr. Cargill as an expert , and it does not intend to submit any testimony from Dr. Cargill other than what it has already disclosed .
Accordingly , the court concludes that Novell has no basis for precluding Dr. Cargill 's testimony .
Given SCO 's representation regarding the scope of Dr. Cargill 's testimony , the court finds that no limitation is necessary . "
Of course , SCO 's language limited it already .
The court found no prejudice to Novell in that case , and it will have the opportunity to rebut .
SCO has not won this judge over .
No amount of dazzle will do it for them now .
There will be no jury to be dazzled .
And all the media reports about how SCO had filed an appeal were , as you can see with your own eyes , 100 percent wrong .
There 's also at the end some housekeeping matters :
Both parties shall file trial briefs by the close of business on Friday , September 14 , 2007 .
On the morning of trial , Monday , September 17 , 2007 , the parties shall submit proposed finding of fact and conclusions of law , and a proposed form of judgment .
The parties will be allowed to supplement such materials at the close of trial if necessary .
The court notifies the parties that it will not hear argument at the Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 hearing on SCO 's Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification of the Court 's August 10 , 2007 Order .
As discussed in a telephone conference with the parties ' counsel , the court requests that Novell file its opposition to the motion at approximately the close of business on Monday , September 10 , 2007 .
The court requests that SCO file a reply memorandum by Wednesday , September 12 , 2007 .
The court will issue a ruling on the motion prior to trial .
I can't imagine what further clarity SCO requires , after this ruling on top of the August 10th decision :
This court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order found that SCO breached its fiduciary duty to Novell when it failed to remit royalties to Novell for licenses indisputably containing SVRX technology .
As a result , the court found that Novell was entitled to a constructive trust for those amounts because Novell retained a 100 % equitable interest in royalties from SVRX Licenses .
The only question of fact remaining for trial is the proper amount of the constructive trust ....
The court has already found that SCO is liable to Novell for its breach of fiduciary duty because it unjustly retains SVRX Royalties belonging to Novell .
Therefore , the trial is necessary only to determine the proper amount ....
The court 's order found that the Sun and Microsoft licenses are SVRX Licenses , even if the SVRX component of those leases are only incidental .
SCO claims that it has no intention of introducing evidence contrary to the court 's order .
In that regard , Novell 's motion could well be moot .
The court , however , cautions both parties that they are not to rehash issues that have already been decided .
The trial is to be entirely focused on facts relevant to the appropriate value of the SVRX component licensed in the Sun , Microsoft , and other similar SVRX Licenses .
The court has already found that those amounts constitute SVRX Royalties that should have been remitted to Novell .
What is left to be heard on September 11 at the scheduled hearing , then ?
Looking at number 400 on the Novell Timeline page , as best as I can make out , all that is left is SCO 's Motion to Strike Exhibits on Novell 's Revised Exhibit List Not Previously Disclosed [ PDF ; text ] .
What about the trial itself ?
What 's left there ?
Only three issues remain , according to this ruling : ( 1 ) Are additional SCOsource licenses , like the Sun and Microsoft licenses , " SVRX Licenses " within the meaning of the APA ? ; ( 2 ) What proportion of the payments received and retained by SCO from the Sun , Microsoft and additional SCOsource licenses should have been paid to Novell ? ; and ( 3 ) Did SCO have authority under the APA to enter into the Sun , Microsoft , and additional SCOsource licenses ?
Or as I like to think of it for simplicity 's sake , in light of the looming constructive trust , is SCO dead , only mostly dead , or just not long for this world ?
By the way , as you read this ruling , all those who kept imagining that the judge was worried about an appeal : please notice how he anticipates an " inevitable " appeal and does n't care .
Thanks to the amazingly fast Steve Martin , we have this ruling already as text : ****************************
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH
CENTRAL DIVISION THE SCO GROUP , INC . ,
Plaintiff ,
vs .
NOVELL , INC . ,
Defendant .
ORDER
Civil Case No. 2:04CV139DAK
This matter is before the court on several pretrial motions : ( 1 ) The SCO Group , Inc.'s ( " SCO " ) Motion for Entry of Final Judgment Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 ( b ) ; ( 2 ) Novell 's Motion to Strike Jury Demand ; ( 3 ) Novell 's Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its Third Claim for Relief ; ( 4 ) SCO 's Motion in Limine to Exclude All Evidence Related to Other Litigation and Commentary Thereon ; ( 5 ) Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 1 to Preclude SCO from Challenging Questions Already Decided as a Matter of Law ; ( 6 ) Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 2 to Preclude SCO from Contesting Licenses Conveying SVRX Rights are " SVRX Licenses " ; ( 7 ) SCO 's Amended Motion in Limine Regarding Apportionment of Microsoft and Sun SCOsource Licenses ; and ( 8 ) Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 3 to Preclude SCO from Introducing New Evidence or Argument Regarding Apportionment of SCOsource Revenue .
The court concludes that a hearing would not aid the court in its determination of these motions .
The court has carefully considered the law and facts relating to the motions .
Now being fully ( 1 ) advised , the court renders the following Order .
DISCUSSION I. SCO's Rule 54 ( b ) Motion for Entry of Final Judgment SCO requests that this court enter final judgment under Rule 54 ( b ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to those claims which are fully and completely resolved by the Court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order .
SCO asserts that the Order resolves the following : ( 1 ) SCO 's First Claim for Relief for Slander of Title ; ( 2 ) that portion of SCO 's Second Claim for Relief alleging that Novell breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its exercise of asserted rights under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the Asset Purchase Agreement ( " APA " ) ; ( 3 ) SCO 's Third Claim for Relief seeking specific performance ; and ( 4 ) that portion of Novell 's Fourth Claim for Relief relating to Novell 's request for a declaration of rights and duties under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA .
In a case involving multiple claims and counterclaims , Rule 54 ( b ) allows a court to " direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment . "
Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 ( b ) .
An analysis of whether Rule 54 ( b ) certification is appropriate requires the court : ( 1 ) to determine that the order to be certified is a final judgment ; and ( 2 ) to find there is no just reason to delay appellate review of the order until the conclusion of the entire case .
Id. at 7 - 8 ; see also Oklahoma Turnpike Auth .
v. Bruner , 259 F.3d 1236 , 1242 ( 10th Cir. 2001 ) ; McKibben v. Chubb , 840 F.2d 1525 , 1528 ( 10th Cir. 1988 ) .
In making these determinations , the district court should act as a " dispatcher " weighing Rule 54 ( b ) 's policy of preventing piecemeal appeals against the inequities that could result from ( 2 ) delaying an appeal .
Stockman 's Water Co. , LLC v. Vaca Partners , L.P. , 425 F.3d 1263 , 1265 ( 10th Cir. 2005 ) .
The court should consider " whether the claims under review [ are ] separable from the others remaining to be adjudicated and whether the nature of the claims already determined [ are ] such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals . "
Curtiss - Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Co. , 446 U.S. 1 , 8 ( 1980 ) .
The court has serious concerns over whether the policy considerations underlying Rule 54 ( b ) would be met by allowing a Rule 54 ( b ) certification in this case .
SCO contends that neither the approaching trial nor the stayed claims in this matter concern the question of the ownership of the UNIX or UnixWare copyrights or the scope of Novell 's rights under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA .
Novell , however , asserts that it seeks a declaration at trial that , under Section 4.16 ( b ) , SCO was without authority to enter into the Sun , Microsoft , and other SCOsource licenses .
The separability requirement must be satisfied in order for the judgment to be considered " final . "
Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Durango Air Serv. , Inc. , 283 F.3d 1222 , 1225 ( 10th Cir. 2002 ) ; see also Oklahoma Turnpike Auth. , 259 F.3d at 1243 .
" [ The judgment ] must be a ' judgment ' in the sense that it is a decision upon a cognizable claim for relief , and it must be ' final ' in the sense that it is 'an ultimate disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action . ' "
Curtiss - Wright Corp. , 466 U.S. at 7 ( quoting Sears , Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey , 351 U.S. 427 , 436 ( 1956 ) ) ; see also Old Republic Ins. , 283 F.3d at 1225 .
" For purposes of Rule 54 ( b ) , a claim comprises all factually or legally connected elements of a case , but there is no bright - line rule to distinguish multiple claims , which may be appealed separately , from multiple ( 3 ) legal grounds in a single claim , which may not . "
Jordan v. Pugh , 425 F.3d 820 , 827 ( 10th Cir. 2005 ) .
" This distinction is based largely on practical concerns , particularly the question whether a subsequent appeal of the claims before the district court will require the court of appeals to revisit the same issues decided in the first appeal . "
Id .
In this case , SCO seeks certification of portions of its Second Claim for Relief and portions of Novell 's Fourth Claim for Relief .
The court concludes that these portions of the parties ' claims for relief do not constitute individual claims for purposes of Rule 54 ( b ) .
Therefore , the finality requirement has not been met .
1
With respect to the remaining claims SCO seeks to have certified , the issue before the court is whether there should be any just reason for delay of entry of final judgment in light of the strong policy against piecemeal appeals .
See Curtis - Wright , 466 U.S. at 8 .
To aid in this inquiry , the Supreme Court directed district courts to exercise discretion " in the interest of sound judicial administration " to determine when each final decision in a multiple claims action is ready for appeal .
See Curtis - Wright , 466 U.S. at 8 ( quoting Sears , Roebuck & Co. , 351 U.S. at 437 ) . ( 4 ) The court finds no compelling reason to separate these remaining claims for an immediate appeal given that the remaining claims in the case will be ready for appeal in two to three months .
Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming trial , there will undoubtedly be an appeal at that time .
Thus , the first appeal would still be in the briefing stage when the second appeal was initiated .
The risk of piecemeal appeals presented in this case is not outweighed by inequities that could result from delaying an appeal .
The trial on the remaining portions of this case is set to begin in only ten days .
A potential two to three month delay in bringing an appeal presents little , if any , inequities .
For these reasons , the court concludes that the factors under Rule 54 ( b ) weigh in favor of denying SCO 's Rule 54 ( b ) Motion for Entry of Final Judgment .
Accordingly , SCO 's Motion for Entry of Final Judgment is denied .
II .
Motion to Strike Jury Demand Novell moves for this court to strike SCO 's jury demand , arguing that the remaining claims for trial seek only equitable remedies that should be decided by the court .
SCO opposes this motion , claiming that several of the remaining claims are historically legal in nature and seek legal damages .
The parties agree that the claims remaining for trial include Novell 's Third Claim for breach of contract , Fourth Claim for declaratory judgment , Sixth Claim for constructive trust / restitution / unjust enrichment , Seventh Claim for breach of fiduciary duty , and Eighth Claim for conversion .
Despite the number of claims for relief that remain , Novell states that in light of the court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order and the court 's directive to the parties to identify the remaining claims for trial , the parties have narrowed the issues for trial to three : ( 1 ) Are additional SCOsource licenses , like the Sun and Microsoft licenses , " SVRX ( 5 ) Licenses " within the meaning of the APA ? ; ( 2 ) What proportion of the payments received and retained by SCO from the Sun , Micorsoft and additional SCOsource licenses should have been paid to Novell ? ; and ( 3 ) Did SCO have authority under the APA to enter into the Sun , Microsoft , and additional SCOsource licenses ?
Novell argues that SCO is not entitled to a jury trial on these claims because they are inherently equitable claims that seek only equitable relief  restitution and declaratory relief .
Although Novell 's Seventh and Eighth Claims for Relief also seek special damages for Novell 's costs in attempting to make SCO comply with the APA , Novell is not seeking those damages at trial .
Novell has also dropped any claim for punitive damages .
SCO , however , contends that all of Novell 's claims seek damages resulting from its failure to remit royalties to Novell as required by the APA .
The right to a jury trial under federal law depends on whether the nature of the action is at law or in equity .
Manning v. United States , 146 F.3d 808 , 811-12 ( 10th Cir. 1998 ) .
The Supreme Court requires courts to conduct a two - part inquiry to determine the nature of an action .
Chauffeurs , Teamsters and Helpers , Local 391 v. Terry , 494 U.S. 558 , 565 ( 1990 ) .
First , the court should determine whether the action would have been brought in law or equity in 18th - century England .
Id .
Next , the court should " examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature . "
Id .
The right to a jury trial " depends on the nature of the issue to be tried rather than the character of the overall action . "
Id. at 565 .
In that regard , " [t ] he second inquiry is more important in [ the ] analysis . "
Id. at 565 , 569 .
The Supreme Court has recognized that a court need not rest its " conclusion on what has been called an ' abstruse historical ' search for the ( 6 ) nearest 18th - century analog . "
Tull v. United States , 481 U.S. 412 , 421 ( 1987 ) .
Rather " the relief sought is ' more important ' than finding a precisely analogous common - law cause of action in determining whether the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial . "
Id .
The parties do not appear to dispute the historic legal and equitable nature of the remaining claims .
Novell admits that a breach of contract claim and conversion were historically an action at law .
And , SCO admits that restitution and breach of fiduciary duty are historically equitable claims .
The name a complaint affixes to the claims , however , is not controlling .
Consequently , both parties argue that the court should not be tied to the historic categorization of the respective claims .
Although Novell admits that its breach of contract and conversion claims were historically actions at law , it asserts that the court must examine the remedy sought for those claims to determine whether each of the claims is legal or equitable in nature .
Similarly , while SCO admits that restitution and breach of fiduciary duty are historically equitable claims , it contends that these claims seek damages relating only to a breach of contract .
Legal damages compensate a plaintiff for its injuries such as lost profits , expenses incurred as a consequence of the harm , etc .
Equitable remedies such as restitution , unjust enrichment , disgorgement , accounting , constructive trust , etc. , require a defendant to turn over the benefits the defendant gained unjustly .
This court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order found that SCO breached its fiduciary duty to Novell when it failed to remit royalties to Novell for licenses indisputably containing SVRX technology .
As a result , the court found that Novell was entitled to a constructive trust for those amounts because Novell retained a 100 % equitable interest in royalties from SVRX Licenses .
The only question of fact remaining for trial is the proper amount of the constructive trust .
( 7 ) The fact that a contract established the fiduciary relationship does not convert the nature of the relief sought into traditional legal damages .
In C & K Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co. , 23 Cal. 3d 1 , 9 ( 1978 ) , the court acknowledged that a breach of contract claim was typically " an action at law in which a right to jury trial ordinarily would exist , " but the underlying remedy sought was enforcement of a promise through estoppel , which was equitable .
Because " the legal or equitable nature of a cause of action ordinarily is determined by the mode of relief to be afforded , " the court concluded that the plaintiff had no right to a jury trial .
Id. at 9 , 11 .
In In re Friedberg , 131 B.R. 6 , 12 ( S.D.N.Y. 1991 ) , the court found that there was no right to a jury trial on a breach of contract claim where the claim effectively sought specific performance of a clause requiring return of a deposit .
Also , in De Guere v. Universal City Studios , Inc. , 56 Cal. App. 4th 482 , 507-08 ( 1997 ) , the court held that where the focus of a breach of contract claim was an accounting of monies improperly withheld , the claim was equitable and the defendant had no right to a jury trial .
Furthermore , in Van De Kamp v. Bank of America , 204 Cal. App. 3d 819 , 864 ( 1988 ) , the court granted a motion to vacate a jury trial in favor of a bench trial " where the fiduciary [ was ] liable for various sums of money and plaintiffs [ did ] not know what money [ was ] due them . "
In that case , although the plaintiffs sought damages , the court found that the claim was equitable .
Id .
What remains for trial is this case is similar to Van De Kamp .
The court has already found that SCO is liable to Novell for its breach of fiduciary duty because it unjustly retains SVRX Royalties belonging to Novell .
Therefore , the trial is necessary only to determine the proper amount .
This case is also more analogous to an action for apportionment of monies held in trust than a breach of contract action .
In Kim v. Yi , 139 Cal. App. 4th 543 , 546 , 549-50 ( 2006 ) , ( 8 ) the court found that there was no right to a jury trial in an action for apportionment of settlement proceeds because apportionment of monies held in trust is " consistently characterized as equitable in nature . "
In this case , the court has found that Novell has an equitable interest in the SVRX Royalties and met the requirements for imposition of a constructive trust for the amount of SVRX Royalties improperly in SCO 's possession .
SCO relies heavily on Great - West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson , 534 U.S. 204 ( 2002 ) , in which the court observed that an action , by any name , which involves a contractual obligation to pay past due sums is " quintessentially an action at law . "
The Great - West Court noted , however , that where an action does not seek " to impose personal liability on the defendant , but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant 's possession , " the action is equitable .
Id. at 214 . " [ N ] ot all money claims are triable to a jury .
A historic equitable remedy was the grant of restitution by which defendant is made to disgorge ill - gotten gains or to restore the status quo , or to accomplish both objectives .
And when restitution is sought in the form and in the situations allowed in equity prior to the rules or authorized by valid statutes there is no right to a jury trial . "
SEC v. Commonwealth Chem. Sec. , Inc. , 574 F.2d 90 , 95 ( 2d Cir. 1978 ) .
Many of the cases cited by SCO are also distinguishable on the grounds that the plaintiff sought traditional legal damages .
For example , in Robine v. Ryan , 310 F.2d 797 , 798 ( 2d Cir. 1962 ) , the plaintiffs sought damages caused by the defendant 's misappropriation of plaintiffs ' invention , not a return of a res unjustly held .
And , in Pereira v. Farace , 413 F.3d 330 , 341 ( 2d Cir. 2005 ) , the trustee sought funds attributable to the company 's loss , " not the director 's unjust gain . "
The court in In re Lands End Leasing , Inc. , 193 B.R. 426 , 429-30 ( D. N.J. 1996 ) , granted ( 9 ) summary judgment on the equitable claims and allowed the claims for compensatory and punitive damages based on alleged fraudulent conduct to proceed .
Therefore , the court concludes that Novell 's breach of contract , breach of fiduciary duty , constructive trust / restitution / unjust enrichment , and conversion claims are equitable in nature given the nature of the relief sought under these claims and the limited issues remaining for trial .
Accordingly , none of these claims provide a right to a jury trial .
The parties separately address Novell 's claim for declaratory relief .
SCO alleges that Novell 's claim for declaratory relief actually seeks a declaration that SCO breached Section 4.16 ( b ) by entering into SCOsource agreements without Novell 's prior approval .
Novell admits that its Amended Counterclaims set broader contours for this claim , but asserts that it has the right to seek only a narrow form of declaratory relief at trial .
Novell asserts that at trial it seeks only a declaration that SCO had no authority to enter into the Sun and Microsoft Licenses , as well as the Intellectual Property Licenses with Linux end users and UNIX vendors .
Novell agrees to be bound by this limitation .
SCO further claims that it has a right to a jury trial on Novell 's declaratory judgment claim because , absent the procedural vehicle of declaratory relief , Novell 's claim would have sounded in contract .
See Fischer Imaging Corp. v. General Elec. Co. , 187 F.3d 1165 , 1169-71 ( 10th Cir. 1999 ) .
In Monroe Property , LLC v. Bachelor Gulch Resort , LLC , 374 F. Supp. 2d 914 , 923-24 ( D. Colo. 2005 ) , the court recognized that " to determine whether there is a right to jury trial in a declaratory judgment action , it is necessary to determine in what kind of an action the issue would have come to the court if there were no declaratory judgment procedure . "
SCO argues that , absent the declaratory judgment procedure , the only claim Novell could ( 10 ) have brought would have been a breach of contract of the prior - approval provision of the APA .
Novell contends that it could have brought claims for specific performance to enforce the APA 's approval requirement or rescission based on an agent exceeding its authority in entering into a contract .
Novell also claims that it could have sought an injunction preventing SCO from entering into new SVRX Licenses without Novell 's approval .
All of these claims would be equitable .
In any event , SCO 's position ignores the significance of the remedy sought under the claim .
Importantly , Novell does not seek legal damages from SCO for injuries to Novell on account of SCO exceeding its authority in entering into the licenses .
Novell is not seeking a determination of lost sales or lost profits arising from SCO 's actions .
Novell seeks only an interpretation of the parties ' rights .
A declaratory judgment claim that seeks construction of a contract and no relief akin to damages is an equitable claim .
Manning v. United States , 146 F.3d 808 , 813 ( 10th Cir. 1998 ) .
In Burlington N. R.R. Co v. Nebraska Public Power Dist. , 931 F. Supp. 1470 , 1484 ( D. Neb. 1996 ) , the court concluded that there was no right to a jury trial on declaratory judgment claims involving the construction of various contractual provisions .
The court reasoned that because judges in the late 18th century generally kept the construction of writings out of the jury 's hands and the United States Supreme Court has recognized that this practice was for good reason , it is " not necessary ( or proper ) for ' the jury [ to ] shoulder [ the ] responsibility " of construction of the contract . . . in order to " preserve the ' substance of the common - law right of trial by jury . ' "
Id. ( citations omitted ) .
The court concludes that because Novell 's declaratory relief claim seeks only a ( 11 ) declaration of the rights and duties under Section 4.16 ( b ) , it is equitable in nature .
Novell 's claim is not a substitute for an action for breach of contract .
Accordingly , SCO is not entitled to a jury trial based on this claim .
Therefore , the court grants Novell 's Motion to Strike Jury Demand and concludes that this matter should proceed as a bench trial .
III .
Novell 's Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its Third Claim for Relief Novell seeks dismissal of its Third Claim for Relief for breach of contract on the grounds that it is duplicative of its other remaining claims that seek the same relief .
Novell asserts that the court 's August 10 , 2007 Order resolves many of the issues arising under Novell 's Third Claim for Relief even though it concerns motions relating to other claims .
SCO contends that such dismissal is motivated by tactical maneuvers and aimed at preventing it from having a jury trial .
Novell replies that even if the case is tried to a jury , a dismissal of its breach of contract claim will streamline the trial by reducing the number of jury instructions and complexity of the special verdict .
Rule 41 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grants the court the authority to dismiss claims at the request of the claimant " upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper . "
Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 ( a ) ( 2 ) .
" The rule is designed primarily to prevent voluntary dismissals which unfairly affect the other side , and to permit the imposition of curative conditions . "
Brown v. Baeke , 413 F.3d 1121 , 1123 ( 10th Cir. 2005 ) .
" But , ' [ a ] bsent " legal prejudice " to the defendant , the district court normally should grant such a dismissal . ' "
Id . ( quoting Ohlander v. Larson , 114 F.3d 1531 , 1537 ( 10th Cir. 1997 ) ) .
Both parties agree that the issue before the court is whether SCO will be prejudiced by Novell 's dismissal of its Third Claim for Relief .
( 12 ) The Tenth Circuit has explained that prejudice can result from " practical factors " such as " ' the opposing party 's effort and expense in preparing for trial ; excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the movant ; insufficient explanation of the need for dismissal ; and the present stage of the litigation . "
Id. at 1124 .
Because these factors are " neither exhaustive nor conclusive , " the court " should be sensitive to other considerations unique to the circumstances of each case . "
Id .
The court 's ultimate goal is to consider the equities facing both parties in order " to insure substantial justice is accorded to both parties . "
Id .
The " practical factors " recognized by the Tenth Circuit weigh in favor of dismissing Novell 's Third Claim for Relief .
Because Novell 's breach of contract claim is duplicative of its fiduciary duty and conversion claims , the parties have not gone to additional effort or expense in preparing separately for the breach of contract claim .
In addition , Novell did not delay in bringing this motion .
Although the motion is filed close to trial , it was filed as a result of and timely after this court 's August 10 , 2007 Order .
The court 's August 10 , 2007 Order significantly altered the posture of the case and required the parties to examine the proper resolution of several claims that were not directly addressed but were affected by the Order .
Therefore , the court finds no prejudice to SCO based on the timing of Novell 's motion .
Furthermore , Novell 's explanation for dismissing a duplicative claim that seeks the same relief as other claims provides an adequate basis for dismissal .
It is a benefit to both the parties and the court to streamline the approaching trial .
SCO 's primary objection to Novell 's motion is a consideration unique to the circumstances of this case  namely , whether the dismissal of this claim affects its constitutional right to a jury trial .
SCO contends that Novell is manipulating Rule 41 ( a ) in order to obtain a ( 13 ) bench trial that it would not otherwise have had .
Whereas , Novell claims that even if the breach of contract claim is left in , SCO is not entitled to a jury trial .
In addition , Novell asserts that it seeks dismissal of the claim even if the case is tried to a jury .
The court has already determined that Novell 's breach of contract claim does not entitle SCO to a jury demand because it seeks only equitable relief .
Even if the court had not so ruled , the court would find that Novell is entitled to voluntarily dismiss its third counterclaim for breach of contract .
There is no evidence that Novell has brought this motion for improper tactical motives and SCO has not demonstrated prejudice .
SCO further asserts that Novell should be precluded from raising its Third Claim for Relief in a subsequent trial on the bifurcated issues .
The claims remaining on those bifurcated issues , however , are questionable and SCO has consented to dismissal of Novell 's First , Second , and Fifth claims for relief under the same conditions Novell seeks with respect to its Third Claim .
The court finds no prejudice in allowing Novell to renew its claim under the same conditions .
Therefore , the court grants Novell 's Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its Third Claim for Relief .
Novell 's Third Claim for Relief is dismissed , with Novell having the right to renew such claim only in the event that there is any subsequent adjudication or trial in this action that retries its Fourth , Sixth , Seventh , or Eight Claims for Relief or there is any enlargement of the issues for trial beyond that contemplated by the August 17 , 2007 Joint Statement .
IV .
SCO 's Motion in Limine to Exclude All Evidence Related to Other Litigation SCO 's motion seeking an order limiting evidence relating to its litigation with IBM is moot given the court 's ruling regarding SCO 's right to a jury trial .
While a jury may have been ( 14 ) prejudiced by certain remarks , the court is not .
Given the issues remaining for trial , however , the court would expect such references to be quite limited and only in relation to matters of testimony and exhibits that may overlap .
V. Novell 's Motion in Limine No.1 Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 1 seeks to preclude SCO from challenging questions already decided as a matter of law in the court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order .
Novell summarizes several of the court 's holdings and asks the court to prevent SCO from challenging such holdings at trial .
SCO opposes Novell 's motion on the grounds that it is moot , improperly summarizes the court 's order , and should apply to both parties equally .
There is no dispute that both parties are equally bound by the court 's order .
There is also no dispute that the parties are bound by the entirety of the order .
There is , however , a dispute as to whether Novell 's motion is moot .
Based on SCO 's opposition to the motion , the real crux of Novell 's motion appears to be preventing SCO from challenging the court 's conclusions that SCO never " validly converted " Sun and Microsoft to UnixWare , that the APA 's definition of SVRX Licenses appears to apply even to incidental licenses of SVRX , and that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements have some SVRX component .
The court 's order found that the Sun and Microsoft licenses are SVRX Licenses , even if the SVRX component of those leases are only incidental .
SCO claims that it has no intention of introducing evidence contrary to the court 's order .
In that regard , Novell 's motion could well be moot .
The court , however , cautions both parties that they are not to rehash issues that have already been decided .
The trial is to be entirely focused on facts relevant to the appropriate value of the SVRX component licensed in the Sun , ( 15 ) Microsoft , and other similar SVRX Licenses .
The court has already found that those amounts constitute SVRX Royalties that should have been remitted to Novell .
To the extent that SCO is continuing to argue positions contrary to the court 's order , Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 1 is granted .
VI .
Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 2
Novell also seeks an order precluding SCO from contesting that licenses conveying SVRX rights are SVRX Licenses according to the terms of the APA .
SCO argues that it will not dispute at trial that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements have an SVRX component and that this SVRX component constitutes an " SVRX License . "
SCO does intend to argue , however , that the SVRX component is an incidental portion of the larger agreement and its value is de minimis .
SCO is correct that one purpose of the trial is to determine what portions of the Sun and Microsoft Agreements license SVRX technology and what value is attributable to those portions .
Therefore , SCO cannot be and is not precluded from arguing that the SVRX component is de minimis .
SCO 's attempt , however , at making a distinction between the license as a whole being an SVRX License and only the SVRX component of the license being an SVRX License is contrary to the court 's finding that even an incidental license of SVRX is considered an SVRX License under the APA 's broad definition of SVRX License .
The court rejected SCO 's arguments that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements were not SVRX Licenses because they licensed SVRX only incidentally .
SCO 's distinction also appears to be irrelevant to the factual questions to be determined at trial -- what portion of the licenses are attributable to SVRX technology and what value is attributable to that portion .
There is no relevance to evidence relating to legal ( 16 ) determinations already made by the court .
Disputes as to the court 's interpretation of the contract should be left for appeal .
Novell 's motion does not seek a ruling from the court that the other SCOsource licenses are in fact SVRX Licenses .
Novell acknowledges that it must establish such facts at trial .
Accordingly , the court grants Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 2 to the extent that it seeks to prevent SCO from challenging the legal conclusions in the court 's prior order with respect to the definition of SVRX Licenses .
VII .
SCO 's Motion in Limine Re : Apportionment of Microsoft and Sun Licenses SCO moves for an order instructing Novell to refrain from stating to the jury that Novell is entitled to all of the revenue associated with the April 30 , 2003 agreement between SCO and Microsoft ; that Novell is entitled to any revenue from the rights granted in any section of the Microsoft Agreement other than possibly Section 4 ; that Novell is entitled to all of the revenue associated with the February 25 , 2003 agreement between SCO Sun Microsystems ; or that Novell is entitled to revenue from the rights granted in any section of the Sun Agreement other than Section 4 .
SCO asserts that such arguments would confuse the issues and be misleading to the jury .
The court 's determination that the trial will be to the bench , rather than a jury , moots SCO 's arguments with respect to confusion .
SCO 's motion , however , also improperly asks the court to make rulings as a matter of law regarding factual disputes that are left for trial .
The trial is intended to address what portions of the agreements license SVRX technology and the royalties attributable to those portions that should have been treated as SVRX Royalties .
The parties can dispute at trial from which portions of the agreements Novell is entitled to SVRX ( 17 ) Royalties .
Furthermore , the parties dispute which party has the burden of proof in the apportionment determination .
Given that the case is proceeding as a bench trial , the parties can submit trial briefs regarding legal issues such as burdens of proof .
Therefore , SCO 's motion in limine regarding apportionment of the Sun and Microsoft licenses is mooted in part and denied in part .
VIII .
Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 3
Novell 's third motion in limine seeks to preclude SCO from introducing new evidence and argument regarding an apportionment of SCOsource revenue .
Novell asserts that SCO has repeatedly claimed that Novell in not entitled to any allocation from the Sun and Microsoft licenses , and SCO should not be allowed to enter evidence regarding any other division of the SCOsource revenues .
Novell 's motion is untenable given the court 's ruling that the Sun and Microsoft Agreements contain an SVRX component and that the revenue attributable to that component must be ascertained at trial .
SCO recognizes that it is bound by this ruling for purposes of the approaching trial .
While Novell is introducing evidence as to the appropriate allocation , SCO shall be permitted to offer evidence and argument against Novell 's position  whether that includes a different allocation , such as de minimis , or an argument that no apportionment is appropriate .
SCO states that it does not intend to identify a specific number that should correspond with its positions that the value of the SVRX component is zero or de minimis .
The court finds that there is no basis for requiring SCO to take a position that the appropriate allocation is zero if the evidence that is introduced at trial suggests something different and SCO concludes that it is ( 18 ) more appropriate .
Novell also seeks to preclude SCO from presenting expert testimony from Dr. Thomas Cargill .
SCO , however , asserts that it properly disclosed Dr. Cargill as an expert , and it does not intend to submit any testimony from Dr. Cargill other than what it has already disclosed .
Accordingly , the court concludes that Novell has no basis for precluding Dr. Cargill 's testimony .
Given SCO 's representation regarding the scope of Dr. Cargill 's testimony , the court finds that no limitation is necessary .
Novell 's reply takes issue with SCO 's arguments in SCO 's separate motion in limine regarding apportionment because it parses the rights conveyed by the licenses and SCO did not provide this type of an analysis in response to discovery requests .
While the court finds that SCO should have provided such an analysis with respect to apportionment , especially in light of SCO 's fiduciary duties regarding the allocation of SVRX revenues , it finds no prejudice to Novell if SCO is allowed to proceed with that type of analysis at trial .
Novell will have an adequate opportunity to rebut such claims .
Accordingly , Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 3 seeking to preclude SCO from introducing new evidence and argument regarding apportionment of SCOsource Revenue is denied .
IX .
Bench Trial Procedures & Other Matters
Both parties shall file trial briefs by the close of business on Friday , September 14 , 2007 .
On the morning of trial , Monday , September 17 , 2007 , the parties shall submit proposed finding of fact and conclusions of law , and a proposed form of judgment .
The parties will be allowed to supplement such materials at the close of trial if necessary .
The court notifies the parties that it will not hear argument at the Tuesday , September 11 , ( 19 ) 2007 hearing on SCO 's Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification of the Court 's August 10 , 2007 Order .
As discussed in a telephone conference with the parties ' counsel , the court requests that Novell file its opposition to the motion at approximately the close of business on Monday , September 10 , 2007 .
The court requests that SCO file a reply memorandum by Wednesday , September 12 , 2007 .
The court will issue a ruling on the motion prior to trial .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above , SCO 's Motion for Entry of Final Judgment Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 ( b ) is DENIED ; Novell 's Motion to Strike Jury Demand is GRANTED ; Novell 's Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its Third Claim for Relief is GRANTED ; SCO 's Motion in Limine to Exclude All Evidence Related to Other Litigation and Commentary Thereon is MOOT ; Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 1 to Preclude SCO from Challenging Questions Already Decided as a Matter of Law is GRANTED ; Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 2 to Preclude SCO from Contesting Licenses Conveying SVRX Rights are " SVRX Licenses " is GRANTED ; SCO 's Amended Motion in Limine Regarding Apportionment of Microsoft and Sun SCOsource Licenses is MOOT IN PART and DENIED IN PART ; and Novell 's Motion in Limine No. 3 to Preclude SCO from Introducing New Evidence or Argument Regarding Apportionment of SCOsource Revenue is DENIED .
DATED this 7th day of September , 2007 .

DALE A. KIMBALL
United States District Judge ( 20 ) Even if this court were to conclude that the order on the claims SCO seeks to be certified was a final order for purposes of Rule 54 ( b ) , it is not conclusive for purposes of appellate jurisdiction .
See McKinney v. Gannett Co. , Inc. , 694 F.2d 1240 , 1247 ( 10th Cir. 1982 ) ( jurisdictional defect cannot be cured by Rule 54 ( b ) certification ) ( citation omitted ) ; see also Sussex Drug Products v. Kanasco , Ltd. , 920 F.2d 1150 , 1153 ( 3rd Cir. 1990 ) ( partial adjudication of single claim not appealable despite Rule 54 ( b ) certification ) .
If the order from which the appeal is taken is in fact interlocutory and does not adjudicate one or more but less than all claims in the action , Rule 54 ( b ) does not permit an immediate appeal notwithstanding the trial court 's decision to treat the order as final .

SOMERS , N.Y. —
It ’s every worker ’s dream : take as much vacation time as you want , on short notice , and do n’t worry about your boss calling you on it .
Cut out early , make it a long weekend , string two weeks together — as you like .
No need to call in sick on a Friday so you can disappear for a fishing trip .
Just go ; nobody ’s keeping track .
That is essentially what goes on at I.B.M. , one of the cornerstones of corporate America , where each of the 355,000 workers is entitled to three or more weeks of vacation .
The company does not keep track of who takes how much time or when , does not dole out choice vacation times by seniority and does not let people carry days off from year to year .
Instead , for the past few years , employees at all levels have made informal arrangements with their direct supervisors , guided mainly by their ability to get their work done on time .
Many people post their vacation plans on electronic calendars that colleagues can view online , and they leave word about how they can be reached in a pinch .
“ It ’s like when you went to college and you did n’t have high school teachers nagging you anymore , ” said Mark L. Hanny , I.B.M.’s vice president of independent software vendor alliances .
“ Employees like that we put more accountability on them . ”
Josh Wolf had recorded footage of a G - 8 summit protest
Joshua Wolf , 24 , reached a deal with prosecutors by posting online the videotape of a street rally he had refused to give to authorities .
The footage was of violent protests in San Francisco against a G - 8 summit .
On 7 February , Wolf passed the 168 days Houston freelancer Vanessa Leggett served in 2001 / 02 on similar charges .
Fractured skull
Wolf had refused a subpoena to hand over the whole of his tape to police .
You will see , as I do , that there is nothing of value in this unpublished footage
Josh Wolf
A police car was burned and an officer suffered a fractured skull in the violence against the summit which was being held in Scotland at the time .
The video footage Wolf posted on Tuesday did not feature any criminal acts .
Wolf 's lawyer Martin Garbus said : " Josh has released the videotape on his website and a copy has been sent to the district attorney .
He had refused to identify anyone in the videotape . "
On his website , Wolf says he repeatedly offered to allow a judge to view the unpublished footage but was refused .
" Today , you the public have the opportunity to be the judge and I am confident you will see , as I do , that there is nothing of value in this unpublished footage . "
Although Californian laws protect journalists from revealing material , prosecutors successfully argued federal money helped pay for the police car , thus making it a federal case .

SEATTLE --
In a ceremony tonight , the American Civil Liberties Union will present the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty awards to four Connecticut librarians and the president of a New York Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) who stood up against the Patriot Act and refused to violate the privacy of their patrons and clients .
Representatives of Library Connection in Connecticut — Barbara Bailey , Peter Chase , George Christian and Janet Nocek — and a " John Doe " ISP received National Security Letters ( NSLs ) from the FBI but were gagged from revealing that the FBI had sought information from them .
Instead of complying with the broad requests , which were issued without any judicial oversight , the librarians and John Doe joined the ACLU in separate legal challenges .
The FBI has since dropped its gag order on the librarians , but continues to prevent the New York " John Doe " from speaking publicly .
" The ACLU 's progress in fighting back against the Patriot Act and other repressive policies since 9/11 has been fueled and inspired by the individual acts of courage of ordinary Americans , " said ACLU President Nadine Strossen .
" We are proud to honor these brave individuals who stood up at a critical moment in history and truly made a difference . "
NSLs are used to compel libraries , universities , Internet providers and other organizations to disclose sensitive information about their customers and patrons .
Using NSLs the FBI can find out which web sites a person has visited , which books she has borrowed from the library , what her credit score is and to whom she 's been sending e-mails .
Businesses and organizations that are served with NSLs are prohibited by law from telling anyone else that the FBI demanded information from them .
Since the Patriot Act was authorized in 2001 , it has relaxed restrictions on the FBI 's use of the power to issue NSLs , and the number of NSLs issued has seen an astronomical increase .
While reports previously indicated a hundred - fold increase to 30,000 NSLs issued annually , an extraordinary March 2007 report from the Justice Department 's own Inspector General puts the actual number at over 143,000 NSLs issued between 2003 and 2005 .
The same investigation also found serious FBI abuses of regulations and numerous potential violations of the law .
The ACLU has challenged this Patriot Act statute in court in two separate cases .
In the Connecticut case , several weeks after the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2006 , the government gave up its legal battle over a gag order , and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit effectively lifted the gag .
In late June , the FBI abandoned its demand all together and the librarians can now disclose the NSL they received .
The New York case concerns an anonymous ISP that challenged the NSL statute after the FBI relied on the statute to demand some of its records .
District Court Judge Victor Marrero struck down the statute in September 2004 , saying that " democracy abhors undue secrecy . "
In that landmark ruling , Judge Marrero held that the unlimited gag imposed by the NSL law violates free speech rights protected by the First Amendment .
The appeals court ruled in May 2006 , that the district court should consider the constitutionality of the provision in light of recent amendments made by Congress
" These five individuals are all humble , everyday men and women who did something truly extraordinary , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" For a long time after the September 2001 attacks , the administration was able to scare many of its critics into silence .
Attorney General Ashcroft even suggested that those who disagreed with the administration 's policies were aiding the enemy .
So those who spoke out — especially those who spoke out despite an FBI gag order prohibiting them from doing so — displayed real courage . "
The awards will be presented by Jaffer and Strossen at a dinner ceremony Saturday evening .
The ceremony comes in the middle of the 2007 ACLU Biennial Conference , during which more than 250 ACLU delegates have come to Seattle to consider and vote on policy resolutions .
Previous recipients of the Roger N. Baldwin Medal of Liberty awards include Gordon Hirabayashi and the late Fred Korematsu , who fought against the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II ; journalist Anthony Lewis ; Dolores Huerta , a champion of the rights of women , workers and immigrants ; and the five Judge Advocate General ( JAG ) lawyers who represented the first round of defendants at Guantanamo Bay and challenged the flawed military commission process .
The member libraries of Library Connection include St. Joseph College and the public libraries of Avon , Berlin , Bloomfield , Bristol , Burlington , Canton , Cheshire , Cromwell , East Windsor , East Hartford , Enfield , Farmington , Glastonbury , Manchester , Marlborough , New Britain , Newington , Plainville , Portland , Rocky Hill , Simsbury , South Windsor , West Hartford , Wethersfield , Windsor Locks and Windsor .

Ben Franklin once said , “ The only things certain in life are death and taxes . ”
We spend a lot of time discussing taxes and how to pay the least amount as possible but why does n’t anyone discuss the other certainty in life ?
Let ’s face it , you are going to die , I ’m going to die and everyone else you know is going to die .
What most people do n’t consider is that dying is expensive and since when you ’re dead you do n’t have to pay for anything anymore so the costs get passed on .
It does n’t have to cost an arm and a leg when someone dies if you do a little planning .
Life Insurance
The best way to save money when someone dies is to make sure the person who is doing the dying has life insurance that can cover the costs .
The average funeral costs anywhere from $ 6,000 – $ 12,000 and that generally does n’t even include the price of the burial plot and headstone .
That is a lot of money , especially if the death is unexpected and no planning has been done .
It does n’t take much of an insurance policy to cover those types of expenses , so everyone should have a very basic policy .
Unfortunately this is n’t always the case and you still find yourself needing to fork out a few thousand dollars when someone dies .
Then it is up to you to try and save as much money as possible .
Skip Embalming
Embalming alone can run between $ 3,000 – $ 4,000 .
You can easily eliminate this cost by opting for a closed casket ( check your local state regulations first ) .
While it may be nice to be able to view the loved one for a last time this will also incur hidden costs .
First , the preparation of the body for the open casket .
They will need to apply makeup , adjust the hair , remove blemishes and generally dress them in decent clothing .
This can amount to a few hundred extra dollars on top of the embalming alone .
A Casket Without Bling
When you walk into a funeral home you are presented with beautiful caskets made out of solid mahogany with ivory inlay and gold trim , but do n’t be fooled .
Again these items alone can run upwards of $ 5,000 , and for what ?
To almost immediately be buried under six feet of soil never to be seen again ?
This does n’t mean you should ask uncle Harold who likes to build things with wood in his garage should head to Home Depot to put together a casket .
But you can skip the fancy trim and polish of an expensive casket and find one that is plain yet presentable for a fraction of the price .
Better yet , if you opt for cremation you can often rent a casket or even use a temporary box that is used to house the body before it is cremated .
Sales Pressure
A grieving individual is susceptible to making emotional purchases .
First , shop around .
Do n’t settle for the closest or first funeral service provider you find simply because you want to get the process over as quickly as possible .
While it can be a difficult time it can be costly to make quick decisions .
Also , do n’t let the funeral salesperson talk you into a package deal .
Yes , it can be easier to pick a pre-designed package and let someone else handle everything but you will end up spending a lot of extra money and probably receive items or services you really do n’t need .
Donate to Science
Did the deceased individual have an interest in science ?
What better way to honor them then by donating their body to science .
Whether it is for research or organ harvesting in many cases this would be completely free .
Of course there may be some religious conflicts with this method so it is n’t for everyone .
Conclusion
When you die , it costs other people money .
Do your family a favor and have a basic life insurance policy .
If you do n’t you are only bringing additional hardship to your loved ones in an already very difficult time .
If you are on the paying end of a death then keep in mind that while it may be an upsetting time , you still do n’t have to shell out thousands of dollars to deal with it .
There is nothing fun about death but it is a fact of life .
We all have to deal with it so it should be a topic of discussion .
Sometimes we get caught up in saving pennies on our electric bill , worry about correct tire inflation for gas mileage and even make a big issue about a fraction of a percent expense ratio on a mutual fund , yet we are completely unprepared when it comes to one thing that is absolutely certain in life .

After every Republican presidential debate , viewers must ask : are the candidates crazy ?
Not Rep. Tom Tancredo ( R - Colo. ) , who has proposed dropping a nuke on Mecca or Medina , but the others , who have tied themselves to the Bush administration ’s disastrous Iraq policy .
Only Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) has forthrightly criticized the administration .
In the latest presidential encounter , Sen . John McCain set the tone on Iraq , asserting that “ the surge is working .
The surge is working , sir .
It is working . ” McCain was responding to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who only said that “ the surge is apparently working ” and talked about reducing the number of U.S. troops and pulling them back to a support role .
In fact , even Romney ’s equivocation , let alone McCain ’s certitude , is n’t warranted by the evidence .
The best that can be said is that violence is down in some Baghdad neighborhoods and Anbar province to the west .
But violence is up elsewhere in the country , and depending on the figures offered , the number of civilian attacks is unchanged or only slightly reduced .
Moreover , contrary to administration assertions , civilian killings appear to be up .
Reports Reuters : “ Civilian deaths from violence in Iraq rose in August , with 1,773 people killed , government data showed on Saturday [ Sept. 1 ] , just days before the U.S. Congress gets a slew of reports on President George W. Bush ’s war strategy .
The civilian death toll was up 7 percent from 1,653 people killed in July , according to figures from various ministries . ”
The administration and Iraqi government often offer conflicting numbers , leading to even more confusion .
In releasing his agency ’s new report , Comptroller General David Walker explained : “ Let ’s just say there are several different sources within the administration on violence , and those sources do not agree . ”
Unfortunately , the administration appears ever ready to manipulate the numbers for political gain .
One intelligence official told the Washington Post , “ If a bullet went through the back of the head , it ’s sectarian .
If it went through the front , it ’s criminal . ”
No wonder Walker told Congress that “ We could not get comfortable with [ the military ’s ] methodology for determining what ’s sectarian versus nonsectarian violence . ”
Nor do anecdotal claims provide much reassurance .
U.S. politicians , well - guarded by soldiers , snipers , and helicopters , have proclaimed Baghdad ’s Dora market to be an example of surge success .
But Staff Sgt. Josh Campbell , assigned to guard the market , told a reporter , “ Personally , I think it ’s a false representation .
But what can I say ?
I ’m just doing my job and do n’t ask questions . ”
Moreover , where violence has indisputably fallen , it often has done so because continuing sectarian cleansing has eliminated more mixed neighborhoods .
Indeed , the number of people fleeing their homes has increased .
According to Damien Cave and Stephen Farrell of the New York Times , “ in some cases the good news is a consequence of bad news : people in neighborhoods have been ‘ takhalasu ’  an Iraqi word for purged , meaning killed or driven away .
More than 35,000 Iraqis have left their homes in Baghdad since the American troop buildup began , aid groups reported . ”
Iraq ’s capital grows ever more balkanized , the opposite objective once advanced by the administration .
No wonder 70 percent of Iraqis say that the Bush escalation has failed .
Worse , 60 percent of them say attacks on coalition forces are justified .
Even if there were more good news , it ’s not clear it would matter .
There ’s no evidence of permanent improvement .
Shi’ite politicians are not interested in sharing power with Sunnis .
The Maliki government is weak and ineffective .
Iraqi security forces are corrupt and unreliable .
Indeed , the Government Accountability Office figures that the Iraqis have fully met just three of 18 benchmarks .
A commission headed by retired Marine Corps Gen. James Jones recommended disbanding the security police and starting over  an admission of almost total failure .
Worse , where increased U.S. military action pushed insurgents into hiding , they are likely to reemerge when that action ceases .
Observes Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group :
“ The military offensive has temporarily suppressed , or in many cases , dislocated , armed groups .
Once the military surge peters out , which it will if there is no progress on the political front , these groups will pop right back up and start going at each other ’s , and civilians ’ , throats again . ”
And whatever the administration might wish , maintaining increased troop levels in Iraq will be almost impossible , absent longer tours , a large - scale reserve call - up , or reinstitution of conscription .
The worst evidence of good news is Anbar province , which President George W. Bush visited in order to extol Iraqi federalism .
Sunni tribes began shifting against al - Qaeda out of disgust for its brutality even before Washington added 4,000 troops there .
But America ’s new allies do not like Washington or Baghdad .
Arming the Sunni tribes could end up strengthening breakaway forces against the Shia - dominated national government or , even worse , insurgent forces against Washington  if we do n’t soon bring home our troops .
Of course , even if things are n’t going well the Republican candidates do n’t believe America can leave .
To the contrary , the supposedly clinching argument is that since we ’ve made such a mess , we ’ve got to stick around .
Warned McCain , “ I want our troops home with honor , otherwise we will face catastrophe and genocide in the region . ”
He sounds like the man who murdered his parents and then requested mercy because he was an orphan .
The only candidate willing to contest this illogic is Ron Paul .
When asked about leaving forces in Iraq to limit violence against Iraqis who supported Washington , Paul observed : “ The people who say there will be a bloodbath are the ones who said it would be a cakewalk , it would be slam dunk , and that it would be paid for by oil .
Why believe them ?
They ’ve been wrong on everything they ’ve said . ”
Thus , he insisted , “ I would leave .
I would leave completely .
Why leave the troops in the region ?
The fact that we had troops in Saudi Arabia was one of the three reasons given for the attack on 9/11 .
So why leave them in the region ?
They do n’t want our troops on the Arabian Peninsula .
We have no need for our national security to have troops on the Arabian Peninsula , and going into Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran is the worst thing we can do for our national security . ”
The bottom line ?
“ I am less safe , the American people are less safe for this , ” he said .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee responded that “ we bought it because we broke it ” so “ we ca n’t leave until we ’ve left with honor . ”
But Paul retorted : “ How many more [ lives ] do you want to lose ?
How long are we going to be there ?
How long  what do we have to pay to save face ? ”
After the debate Huckabee declared , “ He really lit my fuse when he continued to assert that it was our fault we were attacked on Sept. 11 . ”
Of course , Paul said no such thing .
But Huckabee was not alone in putting words in Paul ’s mouth .
In the previous debate , McCain again proved to be one of the war ’s chief cheerleaders , saying “ we must win . ”
In contrast , Paul bluntly stated : “ We should n’t be there .
We ought to just come home . ”
Romney then offered the demagogic non sequitur : “ Has he forgotten about 9/11 ? ”
Before that came the interchange with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
Paul asked : “ Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us ?
They attack us because we ’ve been over there ; we ’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
We ’ve been in the Middle East . ”
Giuliani dishonestly charged that Paul had blamed America , causing that latter to reply , “ They do n’t come here to attack us because we ’re rich and we ’re free .
They come and they attack us because we ’re over there . ”
As Huckabee , Romney , and Giuliani certainly know , Paul does not blame the U.S. for 9/11 , and Iraq has nothing to do with 9/11 .
However , the truth does not matter to them .
Having lost the intellectual case for going to war , and now losing the intellectual case for continuing the occupation , they prefer demagoguery to analysis .
Anyone criticizing the Iraq disaster is attacking the troops .
Anyone criticizing the occupation is forgetting 9/11 .
Anyone advocating withdrawal is giving in to al - Qaeda .
Thankfully , the politics of fear no longer appears to work on the American people .
A recent poll found that the majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake , the U.S. should bring home its troops , and the Bush administration cannot be trusted to tell the truth about events in Iraq .
People now recognize as nonsensical shrieking what passes as thinking for so many war supporters .
In contrast to his competitors , Paul has been consistently right in diagnosing the problem of terrorism .
First , it has long been evident that being “ over there , ” as Paul put it , generates opposition that can lead to terrorism .
This is a statement of fact , not of blame .
Had Washington not inserted troops in middle of the Lebanese civil war , for instance , there would have been no bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in 1983 .
Had American officials not sought to buttress the Saudi monarchy with U.S. forces , there would have been no Americans living in the Khobar Towers to be killed in the 1996 bombing .
One of the neoconservatives - in - chief , then - Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , said of America ’s presence in Saudi Arabia , “ It ’s been a huge recruiting device for al - Qaeda .
In fact if you look at bin Laden , one of his principle grievances was the presence of so - called crusader forces on the holy land , Mecca and Medina . ”
Recognizing that terrorists have reasons for killing means neither that their actions are justified nor that Americans are “ to blame ” for terrorism .
But the only way to make good policy is to recognize reality .
The Huckabee - Romney - Giuliani strategy of sticking their heads in the sand to win political points guarantees more American casualties in the future .
The problem is particularly acute with Iraq .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq have created more terrorists and more terrorism .
Daniel Benjamin of the Brookings Institution told Congress earlier this year that “ the invasion of Iraq gave the jihadists an unmistakable boost .
Terrorism is about advancing a narrative and persuading a targeted audience to believe it . ”
U.S. policies “ have too often lent inadvertent confirmation to the terrorists ’ narrative . ”
London ’s Chatham House has concluded that Iraq “ imposed particular difficulties for the UK , and for the wider coalition against terrorism .
It gave a boost to the al - Qaeda network ’s propaganda , recruitment and fundraising , caused a major split in the coalition , provided an ideal targeting and training area for al - Qaeda - linked terrorists . ”
In reviewing the July 2005 London bombings , Britain ’s Intelligence and Security Committee explained that “ Iraq continues to act as a motivation and focus for terrorist activity in the UK . ”
Many Islamic extremists make the same point .
Of course , some conservatives who cite the words of jihadists to prove that “ we are at war ” simultaneously deny that the same words explain why they attack Americans .
But many terrorists obviously believe that the Iraq war is another U.S. assault on Islam .
Lebanon ’s Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah says simply , “ The occupation of Iraq has increased acts of terrorism against the U.S. ”
America ’s occupation has spawned copycat killers in other nations , such as Britain , Indonesia , and Spain , as well as drawn foreign fighters to Iraq .
According to researchers Reuven Paz of Israel and Nawaf Obeid of Saudi Arabia , most of these recruits were new to the jihadist movement , radicalized by the conflict .
Equally worrisome , the war has pushed perhaps 15,000 or more Iraqis into al - Qaeda .
Explains Benjamin [ .pdf ] : “ The chaos in Iraq has allowed for extensive training and development in various terrorist tactics and urban warfare , including increasingly proficient use of improvised explosive devices . ”
Graduates of Terrorism U will likely circulate the globe , multiplying their bloody work .
In contrast , Iraq was not related to 9/11 or al - Qaeda before the conflict .
Even President George W. Bush , if not Vice President Richard Cheney , admits this fact .
Moreover , the 9/11 commission found no operational relationship between Hussein and Osama bin Laden ; future Iraqi al - Qaeda leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi was present , but only in the Kurdish zone beyond Hussein ’s control  because of Washington ’s “ no fly ” zone .
After occupying Iraq for four years , U.S. forces have found no evidence that Hussein engaged in terrorism against America .
Ironically , President Bush ’s Iraq war , which prematurely diverted U.S. troops from Afghanistan , actually helped bin Laden and other al - Qaeda leaders survive .
Obviously , it is n’t easy to simply “ come home ” from Iraq as Ron Paul proposes .
But that is the only strategy for real victory .
And not just a withdrawal from Iraq .
As Paul said in the last debate , “ We need a new foreign policy that said we ought to mind our own business , bring our troops home , defend this country , defend our borders . ”
So true .
Why are we defending South Korea , which has 40 times the GDP of its northern antagonist ?
Why are we defending Japan , which has the second largest economy on earth ?
Why do we have troops in Europe , which faces no military threat ?
Why do we insist on sprinkling garrisons and detachments around the world in an attempt to micro-manage other peoples in other lands ?
Yes , it ’s time for a new foreign policy .
President George W. Bush has led the country over the abyss into a needless and needlessly botched war .
But he never learns .
When visiting Australia earlier this month he declared , “ We ’re kicking ass , ” just as , more than four years before , he bellowed “ Bring ’em on . ”
However , now he is leading his party over an electoral abyss .
Instead of running from him , several of the Republican candidates are being advised by the very neoconservatives who concocted the current Iraq policy .
Yet the American people no longer fall for the deceptions and demagoguery of these faux warriors .
A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake , the troops should come home , and the Petraeus report is sugarcoating reality .
The bell is tolling for the GOP warmonger caucus .
Unless the leading Republican presidential contenders join Ron Paul  soon  in detaching themselves from the failed Bush policies , many more Americans are likely to conclude that the Republicans are crazy .
And to vote accordingly .
National Geographic ’s Genographic Project offers all of us an extraordinary opportunity : a method of tracing each of our family trees back to our African roots .
Yes , each of us is African .
An ever - growing collection of DNA studies unambiguously demonstrate that each of us had ancestors who lived in Africa more than 50,000 years ago .
Dr. Spencer Wells , a population geneticist , is in charge of a team of scientists responsible for tracing human migrations out of Africa , from which they populated the entire world .
The team is getting the job done by taking DNA samples from indigenous cultures around the world .
As you ’d imagine , time is of the essence , because the world ’s populations are in constant flux and , according to literature I received from the Genographic project , “ many genetic signals are being scrambled . ”
Dr. Wells and his team have utilized markers on to relatively stable genetic components ( mitochondrial DNA ) to determine that there is a genetic ancestor shared by every person alive today .
She has been dubbed “ Eve ” and it appears that she lived in Africa approximately 150,000 years ago .
One other stable genetic component is located on Y chromosomes , which are passed from fathers to sons .
This too indicates another coalescence point , indicating that we all share a male African ancestor scientists call “ Adam , ” who lived approximately 60,000 years ago .
The Genographic project literature indicates that Adam looked very much like a still existing yet relatively isolated group of African bushmen .
It is startling to consider that each of us is separated from “ Adam ” by no more than 2,000 generations .
In my mind , there is no better medicine to racism and political divisions than to consider that we are all cousins , no matter how different we appear to be from each other .
“ Adam ’s ” descendents traveled across Africa ’s savannas and forests in search of food and water ( over the years , climate change made it imperative to keep up with the moving livestock ) .
Some of these lines of biologically modern humans migrated all the way to Australia .
This Australian migration is substantiated by the existence of highly specific genetic markers found in the DNA of Australian aboriginal males .
50,000 years ago , sea levels were lower and there would have been a way to walk along the coasts of Saudi Arabia , India and Southeast Asia in order to get to Australia .
In fact , Lake Mungo in Australia contains a grave that could be as much as 60,000 years old , making it the earliest known site of human habitation outside of Africa .
Other migrations have been documented into Eurasia and through Siberia , across the Bering land Bridge ( this bridge existed when sea levels were low ) into North and South America .
According to more compelling genetic evidence , this migration into the Americas occurred no earlier than 20,000 years ago .
The genetic evidence also suggests that the people who originally populated the Americas sprung from a group of perhaps one - dozen people who crossed the Bering land Bridge .
The ability to analyze migratory patterns of humans based upon genetic information is truly inspiring .
“ The greatest history book ever written , ” Wells says , “ is the one hidden in our DNA . ”
The Genographic project is ambitious .
It is a five - year program to collect at least 100,000 DNA samples from the world ’s remaining indigenous in traditional people .
The work is being done by genetic laboratories around the world .
In addition to arriving at general conclusions regarding migratory patterns of humans , the Genographic project offers something for you too .
For $ 100 , the Genographic project will provide you with a kit with which you can collect your own cheek cells before submitting them for analysis .
My seven - year - old daughter quickly gathered her own cheek cells recently , without complaint , and we are now awaiting her test results .
The genetic testing done on your cheek cells
will indicate the maternal or paternal genetic markers those ancestors bequeathed you thousands of years ago , which chart your remote ancestors migratory wanderings and indicate from which branch you hang on the global family tree .
After being tested , you have the option of providing additional information to help National Geographic better understand the “ twigs and branches ” of human migratory patterns .
To arrange to be tested , go here and click on “ How to Participate . ”
The same site offers an overview of genetics , an analysis of the human journey , and educational videos regarding the project .

Text of a document found in Zarqawi 's safe house
Text of a document discovered in terror leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi 's hide - out .
The document was provided in English by Iraqi National Security Adviser Mouwafak al - Rubaie :
The situation and conditions of the resistance in Iraq have reached a point that requires a review of the events and of the work being done inside Iraq .
Such a study is needed in order to show the best means to accomplish the required goals , especially that the forces of the National Guard have succeeded in forming an enormous shield protecting the American forces and have reduced substantially the losses that were solely suffered by the American forces .
This is in addition to the role , played by the Shi'a ( the leadership and masses ) by supporting the occupation , working to defeat the resistance and by informing on its elements .
As an overall picture , time has been an element in affecting negatively the forces of the occupying countries , due to the losses they sustain economically in human lives , which are increasing with time .
However , here in Iraq , time is now beginning to be of service to the American forces and harmful to the resistance for the following reasons :
1 . By allowing the American forces to form the forces of the National Guard , to reinforce them and enable them to undertake military operations against the resistance .
2 . By undertaking massive arrest operations , invading regions that have an impact on the resistance , and hence causing the resistance to lose many of its elements .
3 . By undertaking a media campaign against the resistance resulting in weakening its influence inside the country and presenting its work as harmful to the population rather than being beneficial to the population .
4 . By tightening the resistance 's financial outlets , restricting its moral options and by confiscating its ammunition and weapons .
5 . By creating a big division among the ranks of the resistance and jeopardizing its attack operations , it has weakened its influence and internal support of its elements , thus resulting in a decline of the resistance 's assaults .
6 . By allowing an increase in the number of countries and elements supporting the occupation or at least allowing to become neutral in their stand toward us in contrast to their previous stand or refusal of the occupation .
7 . By taking advantage of the resistance 's mistakes and magnifying them in order to misinform .
Based on the above points , it became necessary that these matters should be treated one by one : 1 . To improve the image of the resistance in society , increase the number of supporters who are refusing occupation and show the clash of interest between society and the occupation and its collaborators .
To use the media for spreading an effective and creative image of the resistance .
2 . To assist some of the people of the resistance to infiltrate the ranks of the National Guard in order to spy on them for the purpose of weakening the ranks of the National Guard when necessary , and to be able to use their modern weapons .
3 . To reorganize for recruiting new elements for the resistance .
4 . To establish centers and factories to produce and manufacture and improve on weapons and to produce new ones .
5 . To unify the ranks of the resistance , to prevent controversies and prejudice and to adhere to piety and follow the leadership .
6 . To create division and strife between American and other countries and among the elements disagreeing with it .
7 . To avoid mistakes that will blemish the image of the resistance and show it as the enemy of the nation .
In general and despite the current bleak situation , we think that the best suggestions in order to get out of this crisis is to entangle the American forces into another war against another country or with another of our enemy force , that is to try and inflame the situation between American and Iran or between America and the Shi'a in general .
Specifically the Sistani Shi'a , since most of the support that the Americans are getting is from the Sistani Shi'a , then , there is a possibility to instill differences between them and to weaken the support line between them ; in addition to the losses we can inflict on both parties .
Consequently , to embroil America in another war against another enemy is the answer that we find to be the most appropriate , and to have a war through a delegate has the following benefits : 1 . To occupy the Americans by another front will allow the resistance freedom of movement and alleviate the pressure imposed on it .
2 . To dissolve the cohesion between the Americans and the Shi'a will weaken and close this front .
3 . To have a loss of trust between the Americans and the Shi'a will cause the Americans to lose many of their spies .
4 . To involve both parties , the Americans and the Shi'a , in a war that will result in both parties being losers .
5 . Thus , the Americans will be forced to ask the Sunni for help .
6 . To take advantage of some of the Shia elements that will allow the resistance to move among them .
7 . To weaken the media 's side which is presenting a tarnished image of the resistance , mainly conveyed by the Shi'a .
8 . To enlarge the geographical area of the resistance movement .
9 . To provide popular support and cooperation by the people .
The resistance fighters have learned from the result and the great benefits they reaped , when a struggle ensued between the Americans and the Army of Al - Mahdi .
However , we have to notice that this trouble or this delegated war that must be ignited can be accomplished through : 1 . A war between the Shi'a and the Americans .
2 . A war between the Shi'a and the secular population ( such as Ayad ' Alawi and al - Jalabi . )
3 . A war between the Shi'a and the Kurds .
4 . A war between Ahmad al - Halabi and his people and Ayad ' Alawi and his people .
5 . A war between the group of al - Hakim and the group of al - Sadr .
6 . A war between the Shi'a of Iraq and the Sunni of the Arab countries in the gulf .
7 . A war between the Americans and Iran .
We have noticed that the best of these wars to be ignited is the one between the Americans and Iran , because it will have many benefits in favor of the Sunni and the resistance , such as : 1 . Freeing the Sunni people in Iran , who are ( 30 percent ) of the population and under the Shi'a Rule .
2 . Drowning the Americans in another war that will engage many of their forces .
3 . The possibility of acquiring new weapons from the Iranian side , either after the fall of Iran or during the battles .
4 . To entice Iran towards helping the resistance because of its need for its help .
5 . Weakening the Shi'a supply line .
The question remains , how to draw the Americans into fighting a war against Iran ?
It is not known whether American is serious in its animosity towards Iran , because of the big support Iran is offering to America in its war in Afghanistan and in Iraq .
Hence , it is necessary first to exaggerate the Iranian danger and to convince America and the west in general , of the real danger coming from Iran , and this would be done by the following : 1 . By disseminating threatening messages against American interests and the American people and attribute them to a Shi'a Iranian side .
2 . By executing operations of kidnapping hostages and implicating the Shi'a Iranian side .
3 . By advertising that Iran has chemical and nuclear weapons and is threatening the west with these weapons .
4 . By executing exploding operations in the west and accusing Iran by planting Iranian Shi'a fingerprints and evidence .
5 . By declaring the existence of a relationship between Iran and terrorist groups ( as termed by the Americans ) .
6 . By disseminating bogus messages about confessions showing that Iran is in possession of weapons of mass destruction or that there are attempts by the Iranian intelligence to undertake terrorist operations in America and the west and against western interests .
Let us hope for success and for God 's help .

Why use VPN Taiwan ?
When someone thinks about the VPN service in Taiwan , they traditionally think of a business user who travels the world entering the VPN to gain secure access to the online office .
However , the concept of VPN service varies , wherever you look , there is a sign “ Free Wi-Fi here , ” cafes , supermarkets , restaurants , pubs , and the list is endless .
Logging into these networks can be a risk , as there is a possibility that people will steal your data .
Attackers hunt unsuspecting people in cafes , etc. , but the VPN provides security to stop them .
In addition to protecting against data exchange in public networks , the VPN service also encrypts your web session on your home computer , stopping blind eyes from writing and potentially stealing your daily activities .
If you ’re looking for a quality service for security features take a quick look at VPN Taiwan .
Using the VPN Taiwan service hides your real IP address , giving you true anonymity .
If someone finds out your IP address , they will not only know your location , but they will also be able to see the history of your site , access to search reports on the Internet , blog comments , torrent downloads , etc .
Using a VPN server connection , Your current IP address will be replaced by a secure server in your chosen country .
Using the VPN service allows you to circumvent censorship and unlock the Internet , you can easily bypass any Internet filter by tunneling their connection through a VPN server in the country of your choice .
Many countries around the world take great measures to filter and block certain websites , such as Facebook and Google .

These are also greatly useful for people living in Singapore , for more check VPN Singapore .
MONTEBELLO , Que .
–As hundreds of protesters clashed with police outside summit fences here , Prime Minister Stephen Harper served notice to U.S. President George W. Bush that Canadian troops will be pulled out of Afghanistan in February 2009 unless he 's able to get a political " endorsement " to extend their mission .
Harper delivered the message during a 90 - minute meeting with the U.S. leader yesterday afternoon at Château Montebello resort .
But even if there is no parliamentary consensus , senior Canadian government officials made it clear that Canada 's role in Afghanistan , which includes $ 1.1 billion in development and humanitarian assistance until 2011 , would continue in other ways .
" Seeking the endorsement of Parliament does not necessarily mean we 're leaving , " a senior Canadian official said after the meeting .
Dan Fisk , a U.S. national security council director , told reporters Bush " now has a better understanding of not only the dynamics here , but the need at some point to go back to Parliament " to decide what the mission will be beyond 2009 .
There is little chance that the opposition parties will allow a military mission to continue in Afghanistan beyond February 2009 .
The NDP wants Canada 's 2,500 troops home now and both the Liberals and the Bloc Québécois want the mission ended by 2009 .
Sixty - seven Canadian soldiers and one diplomat , Glyn Berry , have been killed in Afghanistan since the mission began .
The meeting happened as riot police used tear gas and pepper spray to hold back protesters trying to disrupt the summit with Bush and Mexican President Felipe Calderon .
A line of police jostled with demonstrators who had marched on the front gate of the summit compound shouting taunts .
Police clashed again with protesters later in the afternoon , firing off rounds of tear gas .
As he stood waiting for the president 's arrival , Harper was asked whether he had seen the protesters .
" I 've heard it 's nothing .
A couple hundred ?
It 's sad , " Harper told reporters .
Calderon is to cut short his Canadian visit and return home today because of worries of Hurricane Dean hitting Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
He moved up a one - on - one bilateral meeting with Harper to last night , and his schedule today has been cut back .
Yesterday , Ottawa announced $ 2 million in aid for the countries already hit hard by the hurricane , deployed extra consular staff to the region and said it was working with tour operators and airlines to expedite the evacuation of Canadians .
But the most attention was on Harper 's 90 - minute talk with the U.S. president .
During the meeting , which ran longer than scheduled , Harper raised the contentious issue of border hassles suffered by Canadians travelling to the U.S. for business and leisure .
The topic also came up in Washington yesterday , where U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff expressed strong support for using high - technology drivers ' licences as alternatives to passports when crossing the Canada - U.S. border , saying Vermont is developing them .
The statement will be welcomed by Canadian officials who have lobbied the U.S. to endorse the licences , saying the plan to require passports is already seriously denting tourism and could damage trade .
Fisk later said Bush reaffirmed to Harper his country 's intent to move ahead with passport requirements but " we are committed to implementing it in a reasonable way . "
Harper and Bush spoke about " how we can continue to meet very legitimate security concerns on the border but still continue to ensure that legitimate trade and human movement take place , " a senior Canadian official said later .
Harper also expressed disappointment that the U.S. pulled out from discussions of pilot projects to help speed truckers across the border .
Canada objected to American plans to use widespread fingerprinting , citing Charter of Rights concerns against unreasonable intrusions on privacy rights .

The U.S. has refused to give ground .
Despite a pledge to work toward an " efficient " border , Canadian officials stressed there were many areas the two leaders continue to disagree on .
" One of the important things about a relationship that 's as broad and comprehensive as ours with the United States is that it 's unrealistic to think that we 're going to agree on absolutely everything , " the official said .
" But what is really important is that we keep talking about even those things that we do n't necessarily agree on . "
Among those is the question of Canada 's claims of Arctic sovereignty .
Harper , officials said , noted his government 's recent pledges to invest in new patrol vessels and boost Canada 's military presence in the North .
" The president was very supportive of those , " the official said .
But Harper 's effort to flag comments by former U.S. ambassador Paul Cellucci endorsing Canada 's claims over the Northwest Passage appeared to be of no avail .
" We look at the Northwest Passage as an international waterway , and want the international transit rights to be respected there , " White House spokesperson Gordon Johndroe told reporters .
One issue not raised by Harper is the fate of terror suspect Omar Khadr , the young Canadian accused of killing an American soldier who is now stuck in a legal limbo military prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
" It did n't come up in the discussions , " the official said .

User interface tests are a bit tricky – it is easy to get carried away and waste quite a lot of time , without getting any real benefits .
However , if planned properly , automated UI tests can have a great effect on the project .
Here are a few tips on how to make the most of automated user - interface tests .
The Achilles ' heel of automated tests
The problem with user interface tests is not in how to execute them , but what to test .
Since human testers would often check the whole round - trip of information , from the GUI to the back - end report , the first instinct is to replicate that and try to verify business domain rules .
This is the Achilles ’ heel of UI tests , and it ultimately leads to enormous waste of time .
User interface often builds a thick layer around business domain code ( at least in properly designed applications ) , and it is often very hard to peel that onion in an automated test .
A lot of clicking , selecting and dragging may be required for a simple variable assignment .
Testing a business rule properly through the user interface may require a lot of very similar tests , with only minor workflow differences .
Maintaining such tests is a real pain when the business rule changes ( and it is when , not if ) .
If the project has more than one customer , especially when the front - end is a Web application , the user interface is often slightly different for each customer .
The differences can be just enough to make all those UI tests customer - specific , so that they have to be recorded or written for each specific client environment .
This makes test maintenance even harder .
But the business rules typically sit below the user interface , in a common back - end or middleware .
It is much better to test business rules below the UI , using an acceptance testing framework such as FIT .
Functional unit tests through the user interface are even harder to maintain and write properly .
For start , it is hard to isolate code units in the end - to - end calls , and user interface tests ( especially Web ) run at least an order of magnitude slower than direct code tests .
Proper unit tests have to run very quick , so that people can execute them after any significant change .
If the unit test suite takes a long time to run , it becomes more an obstacle than a helping tool .
Testing to save our face
There are , however , some things that make very much sense to test through the UI .
Workflow or session rules are a good example .
The UI layer often controls session rules , like which features are not accessible if the user is not logged in .
Presentation layer workflow , for example asking the user to register a credit card after the account is verified , is also defined at this level .
So the user interface tests are the only place such rules can be validated .
However , I do n’t believe that there is much benefit in having an extensive test suite for workflow or session rules in most applications .
A large suite of user - interface tests will just be a pain to maintain , and they will break every time the UI changes .
If your clients are like mine , this will be quite often .
The good thing is that mistakes in the workflow get discovered quickly , because clients are directly exposed to the user interface and will notice such problems .
On the other side , since the user interface is the only thing that customers really see in a typical application , a small problem in that part can render the whole system effectively unusable .
A minor CSS problem or a typo in the HTML login form can prevent users from actually logging in to the system .
These kind of problems are easy to fix after they are spotted , but they can be quite embarrassing .
And they sort of spoil the whole thing .
At that point , it does not really matter if all the business rules are properly implemented , and all acceptance and unit tests run successfully .
Customers cannot use the web site , so everything else is just irrelevant .
Users only see the user interface , and they can get “ blinded ” by it .
So , what can we do to prevent such problems ?
Automate key business scenarios end - to - end and test them once a day ( and before the release ) .
I do n’t think that any customer - facing web site will have more than ten such functions , so these tests can be done for each flavour or customer environment .
A typical online bookstore , for example , has only two key scenarios as far as I am concerned : one is the registration and the second consists of logging in and purchasing a book .
Making sure that those things work before the release is a must , so for me those verifications are really Face - saving tests .
Face saving tests often touch quite a big part of the system .
The purchasing example will quickly run through login , store browsing , shopping cart and order completion .
It will not check whether those processes are a 100 % correct , but it will make sure that the basic workflow completes correctly .
It is very important to focus on that , not on the validity of business rules , like calculating taxes and delivery time , or else the tests become too complicated .
Business rules should be covered and validated by unit and acceptance tests .
Since those tests also must pass before the release , face saving tests should only check whether the scenario was successful .
They should also check how long it takes to perform a key scenario , to make sure that a few changed optimisation plans in the database did not suddenly make the entire system appear too slow .
Since customers directly work with the user interface , it may be a very good idea to get them involved into writing and maintaining the UI tests .
This is especially good when multiple customers have the same back - end but slightly different web applications .
A remarkable new long - necked , gliding reptile discovered in 220 million - year old sediments of eastern north America has been discovered , scientists report .
Mecistotrachelos apeoros ( meaning " soaring , long - necked " ) is based on two fossils excavated at the Solite Quarry that straddles the Virginia - North Carolina state line .

Nick Fraser of the Virginia Museum of Natural History , who discovered the fossils , said said " one of the really neat things about the new glider is the feet .
They are preserved in a hooked posture which is unusual and strongly suggests a grasping habit , further emphasizing a life style in the trees . "
It probably fed on insects , scuttling up tree trunks and foraging on the way , before gliding onto neighboring trees .
Fraser said that while two other reptiles with similar gliding membranes are known from the Triassic Period , they have much shorter necks and therefore conform more to the modern gliding lizard , Draco .
The relationships of Mecistotrachelos are unclear , but Fraser considers that it is probably related to the protorosaurs .
Protorosaurs are a group of extinct reptiles characterized by a long - necked , including the bizarre Tanystropheus which had a neck longer than the length of the body and tail combined .
Because of the nature of the sediments , it was not possible to prepare the fossils by standard mechanical methods and the descriptions are based entirely on CT scans .
This technique has only been rarely used to describe new species .
Tim Ryan of the Center for Quantitative Imaging at Pennsylvania State University led the work on the CT scanning .

Longlines have hit tuna hard
The authors say the era of " heroic " fish - the truly huge swordfish , marlin and sharks that inspired legends and novels - is now well and truly over .
And other commercially important species , such as tuna , cod , halibut , skate and flounder are now generally far smaller in size compared with their ancestors .
The study has been written by Dr Ransom Myers and Dr Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia .
Local problem
The Canadian marine ecologists , who took 10 years to compile their report , say only dramatic cuts in catches , subsidies and the establishment of a network of " fish parks " will save species from oblivion .
They say fisheries managers have tended to consider only recent data on specific species in particular fishing grounds when deciding how to conserve stocks .
We are in massive denial and continue to bicker over the last shrinking numbers of survivors
Dr Ransom Myers , Dalhousie University
In reality , Myers and Worm argue , only global data taken from many decades show the true scale of the damage done to marine resources by large factory ships .
" Our analysis suggests that the global ocean has lost more than 90 % of large predatory fishes , " they write in Nature .
" Although it is now widely accepted that single populations can be fished to low levels , this is the first analysis to show general , pronounced declines of entire communities across widely varying ecosystems . "
Brazilian tuna
To compile their study , Myers and Worm assembled data sets representing all major fisheries in the world and then constructed trajectories showing the declines of large predatory fish communities from four continental shelves and nine oceanic systems .

Industrial techniques took as little as a decade or 15 years to reduce fish populations to 10 % of their previous number , the authors say .
Dr Myers told BBC News Online : " For example , there were 200,000 large bluefin tuna removed from off the coast of Brazil in the first 15 years of the Japanese longline fishery and in the last 15 years off Brazil , with similar effort , the Japanese fishery has caught exactly zero fish .
" We have eliminated these very valuable species from very large parts of the world 's oceans . "
All gone
He says the average size of top predators today is only one - fifth to one - half of what it used to be .
" The few blue marlin today reach one - fifth of the weight they once had .
In many cases , the fish caught today are under such intense fishing pressure , they never even have the chance to reproduce ... we have to understand how close to extinction some of these populations really are . "
People have forgotten how much fish used to be in the sea
Prof Callum Roberts , York University
" We are in massive denial and continue to bicker over the last shrinking numbers of survivors , employing satellites and sensors to catch the last fish left , " Dr Myers told the BBC .
" The last sharks are declining at a great pace and unless we reduce the number of hooks in the water by 50 - 60 % the large sharks will go extinct - we will have no more hammerheads , no more great whites , no more large threshers .
" These species will go the way of the dinosaurs unless we take worldwide action to preserve the diversity in the marine ecosystem . "
Fish reserves
Commenting on the study , Professor Callum Roberts , a marine conservation biologist at York University , UK , says the work underlines how people have become accustomed to the current , depleted state of the oceans .

" We 've now got 10 % of the animals left from the pristine state .
This study offers a new perspective for management .
We need to revise our targets for stocks upwards which will provide higher productivity over the longterm .
" And the only way we are going to achieve this is by creating largescale networks of areas that are entirely off - limits to fishing . "
That 's right , you can roll your own robot .
But why are you reading about it ?
Go to the TeRK web site and start building .
The Qwerk controller is available for sale from Charmed Labs .
These are sophisticated machines that wirelessly connect to the Internet but anyone can build them from off - the - shelf parts .
The robots can take many forms , from a three - wheeled model with a mounted camera to a flower loaded with infrared sensors .
A TeRK Flower is one example of a robot that can be assembled by non-roboticists using a Telepresence Robot Kit ( TeRK ) " recipe " .
The TeRK robots are based on a specially designed controller , commonly available parts and recipes developed by the CREATE Lab in Carnegie Mellon University 's Robotics Institute .

They can be easily customized and their ability to wirelessly link to the Internet allows users to control and monitor their robots ’ actions from any Internet - connected computer in the world .
The new tools that make this possible are a single piece of hardware and a set of " recipes " that people follow to build their ’ bots .
Both are part of the Telepresence Robot Kit ( TeRK ) developed by Associate Professor of Robotics Illah Nourbakhsh and members of his Community Robotics , Education and Technology Empowerment ( CREATE ) Lab .
Their goal is to make highly capable robots accessible and affordable for college and pre-college students , as well as anyone interested in robots .
Unlike other educational robot kits on the market , TeRK is not sold as a complete set of parts .
The CREATE Lab ’s recipes allow for a variety of robots to be built with parts commonly available through hardware and hobbyist outlets .
Qwerkbot , a three - wheeled robot that can send images over the Internet , is one of several robots that can be built with the Telepresence Robot Kit ( TeRK ) , a combination of a robot controller , commonly available parts and assembly instructions ( recipes ) developed by the CREATE Lab in Carnegie Mellon University 's Robotics Institute .

At the heart of each TeRK robot is a unique controller called Qwerk that combines a computer with the software and electronics necessary to control the robot ’s motors , cameras and other devices .
Qwerk , developed by the CREATE Lab and Charmed Labs of Austin , Texas , also connects the robot automatically and wirelessly to the Internet so it can be controlled by any Internet - connected computer .
" The Internet connection means the robots are much more global , " Nourbakhsh said .
Not only can the robot be operated remotely at any location with a wireless Internet connection , but it can also send photos or video , respond to RSS feeds , or access the Internet to find information .
That combination opens a wide range of possibilities .
" We ’re hoping people notice that the sky ’s the limit , " he added .
Among the TeRK recipes already available is a small , wheeled robot with a video camera that people might use to keep an eye on their home or pet while they are at work or school .
Another recipe under development includes environmental sensors for air quality and sound pollution .
A less conventional recipe will produce a robotic , six - petaled flower that can open and close based on moods or use its petals to play a game of catch .
" We want robots that do n’t just subscribe to geeky notions of what robots should be , " Nourbakhsh said .
One recipe under development , for instance , can control a stuffed teddy bear .
" Once people have followed a recipe and become acquainted with robots , they can build on their experience , " said Emily Hamner , a senior research associate in the CREATE Lab .
" Not only can they customize the recipes to their liking , they can also design new robot types using the Qwerk controller . "
Qwerk itself is a full - fledged computer with a Linux operating system that can use any computer language .
It features a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) to control motors , servos , cameras , amplifiers and other devices .
It also accepts USB peripheral devices , such as Web cameras and GPS receivers .
" We leveraged several low - cost , yet high - performance components that were originally developed for the consumer electronics industry when we designed Qwerk , " said Rich LeGrand , president of Charmed Labs .
" The result is a cost - effective robot controller with impressive capabilities . "
Building such a capable robot only five years ago would have been all but impossible , Nourbakhsh said .
Using the Internet to provide telepresence on a routine basis , he explained , is practical today because of widespread broadband Internet access and the ubiquity of wireless hotspots in both public and residential settings .

The Actors Model and Haskell September 8 , 2007
Recently I have been playing around with Scala , and in particular , the Actors library .
This encouraged me read the paper ‘ Actors : A Model Of Concurrent Computation In Distributed Systems ’ written by Gul A Agha .
This paper enabled to me to start thinking of Actors in more general terms , rather than as a Scala library .
To refine this knowledge I decided to experiment by implementing basic Actor functionality in Haskell .
Looking at the source of the Scala Actors library had discouraged me from this task , as it uses a lot Scala ’s Object Orientated features to maintain an Actor ’s state .
There was one paragraph in Agha ’s paper that stood out for me however :
Actors are computational agents which map each incoming communication to a 3 - tuple consisting of : a finite set of communications sent to other actors ;
a new behaviour ( which will govern the response to the next communication processed ) ; and
a finite set of new actors created .
This paragraph suggests to me that Actors are no more than a function of type ( in psuedo Haskell )
Communication -> ( [ Communication ] , Actor , [ Actor ] )
It is not necessary to store state , as once the actor has processed the current communication it is replaced by a returned behaviour .
This enabled me to see past the implementation details of the Scala library and focus on Actor concepts instead .
A second important point I took away from Agha ’s paper was that Actor ’s are a computation process that enables parallelism , but does not require it .
A corollary of this is that implementations of the Actor model may use whatever threading model they deem appropriate .
Scala developers have actually developed thread and event based version of actors , as well as allowing those two methods to be combined ( there are many resources here ) .
In my implementation I will take advantage of these loose requirements and choose the simplest method .
Terminology and Concepts
I thought it best if I give a brief overview of the terminology I use in my code and descriptions .
I provide this as it may not be standard , but a mish mash of terms from Agha ’s paper and Scala .
Tasks Could also be called communications or messages .
These are sent to the Mailbox of an Actor , where the Actor will execute a Behaviour based on this Task .
Mailbox A queue of Tasks sent to an Actor .
Behaviour A function or calculation that an actor performs upon receiving a communication .
Actor A combination of a Mailbox and Behaviour .
Tasks
Agha defines a Task as a 3 - tuple having a tag , mail address , and content .
Not all these details will be required in the implementation .
Keeping a mail address is unnecessary , as the Task will be placed in a Mailbox immediately .
The tag is used to uniquely identify the Task .
It is omitted also , and the responsibility of avoiding duplicate Tasks is placed on the programmer .
This leaves just the content .
To keep it flexible this can be left as any Haskell type , so no code is necessary .
Mailbox
Next is the Mailbox , where tasks will be sent .
Mailbox ’s act as FIFO queues .
It is important to note that these are likely to be written to by multiple threads .
Haskell ’s STM library provides us with a data structure that meets these requirements .
The semantics of TChan provide what I ’m after and ensure that Mailboxes can be safely accessed from multiple threads .
I can define the Mailbox type as equivalent to TChan .
I also write methods to create the mailbox , queue tasks , and receive tasks from the mailbox .
These are basically wrappers around the standard TChan methods .
type Mailbox a = TChan a new :: IO ( Mailbox a ) new = atomically ( newTChan ) pop :: Mailbox a ->
IO a pop = atomically .
readTChan push :: Mailbox a -> a -> IO ( ) push to = atomically .
writeTChan to
It ’s important to note the call to readTChan in the pop function .
If called on an empty TChan it will block its thread until a value becomes available .
Behaviours
Behaviours are executed by an Actor in response to a received Task .
They return the Behaviour that should be executed in response to the next Task received .
Behaviours are able to communicate with Actors they are sent , they create , or are a part of .
Any actors they are sent or they create are already in scope , but a reference to the containing Actor must also passed in .
I have used a Maybe type as the return value of a Behaviour .
A return value of Nothing , indicating no subsequent Behaviour , will be used to indicate to Actor threads that they may terminate .
An alternative would be to return a default , do nothing , Behaviour .
I would need to look more closely at how Haskell terminates threads in this case though .
data Behaviour a = Behaviour { runBehaviour :: Actor a -> a -> IO ( Maybe ( Behaviour a ) ) }
To aid in the common cases of executing the same Behaviour for all Tasks or a one off Behaviour I define a couple of helper methods .
once :: ( Actor a -> a -> IO ( ) ) ->
Behaviour a once f = Behaviour $ \a m -> f a m >> return Nothing loop :: ( Actor a -> a -> IO ( ) ) ->
Behaviour a loop f = Behaviour $ \a m -> f a m >> return ( Just ( loop f ) )
Actors
The previous concepts are brought together with the Actor type .
An Actor is defined by a Mailbox and a Behaviour and is responsible for passing Tasks in the Mailbox to the appropriate Behaviour .
A function that creates an Actor from a given Behaviour is written that creates an empty Mailbox for the Actor .
The send function for passing Tasks to an Actor is also given .
data Actor a = Actor { mbox :: Mailbox a , beh :: Behaviour a } createActor :: Behaviour a -> IO ( Actor a ) createActor b = new >>= return .
flip Actor b send :: Actor a -> a -> IO ( ) send to = push ( mbox to )
Actors are responsible for the execution of Behaviours in response to Tasks .
To perform this , I define three methods :
step takes the first Task ( waiting for one , if there is none ) and passes it to the Actor ’s current Behaviour .
On completion of the Behaviour it creates a new Actor with the same Mailbox and the returned Behaviour .
takes the first Task ( waiting for one , if there is none ) and passes it to the Actor ’s current Behaviour .
On completion of the Behaviour it creates a new Actor with the same Mailbox and the returned Behaviour .
run executes a series of these cycles , terminating when Nothing is returned by the Behaviour .
executes a series of these cycles , terminating when is returned by the Behaviour .
start executes this cycle on its own thread .
step :: Actor a -> IO ( Maybe ( Actor a ) ) step a = pop ( mbox a ) >>= runBehaviour ( beh a ) a >>= return .
maybe Nothing ( \b -> Just ( Actor ( mbox a ) b ) ) run :: Actor a -> IO ( ) run a = step a >>= maybe ( return ( ) ) run start :: Actor a -> IO ( ) start a = forkIO ( run a ) >> return ( ) .
This completes an implementation of basic Actor behaviour .
Example
I ’ll use an example from Agha ’s writing , calculating factorials , to demonstrate the use of the functions I ’ve just presented .
This example does not benefit from the Actors approach , as the algorithm is not well suited to parallelization .
Also , it does not handle erroneous input .
It does however , provide a quick demonstration of Actors executing in Haskell .
First I define the Tasks that will be passed around .
There is a Factorial task , which takes an Integer , being the factorial to calculate , and a destination Actor , where the result will be sent .
The second is a simple Task , that can be used to pass around single values .
data Factorial n dest = Factorial Integer ( Actor ( Value Integer ) ) data Value n = Value n deriving Show
The first actor defined is created with an Integer parameter and a destination Actor to which it will send its result .
This actor will wait for a Value message .
Once received it will multiply it by its Integer parameter and send the answer to the destination Actor .
multiply Actor dest n = createActor $ once $ multiply Behaviour dest n multiply Behaviour dest n _ ( Value k ) = send dest ( Value ( n * k ) )
The result actor receives a Value and displays it .
This will be used to display the final answer .
resultActor = createActor $ once $ \_ ( Value n ) -> putStrLn ( " Result : " ++ ( show n ) )
The factorial actor follows the algorithm displayed in Agha ’s work .
It will create and start a multiply Actor which will wait for a Value task .
It will then send a Factorial task instructing itself to calculate the factorial of n- 1 and send the result to the newly created multiply Actor .
factorialActor = createActor $ loop $ factorial Behaviour factorialBehaviour _ ( Factorial 0 r ) = send r ( Value 1 ) factorial Behaviour self ( Factorial n r ) = do m <- multiply Actor r n start m send self ( Factorial ( n - 1 ) m )
To begin the computation it is necessary to start up the Actors and send an initial message .
The factorial function below does this .
Note that the result Actor is started with the run method to execute it on the same thread that factorial is called from .
This means the function wo n’t terminate until resultActor recieves a Value task indicating the factorial calcuation has completed .
factorial n = do r <- resultActor a <- factorialActor start a send a ( Factorial n r ) run r
Testing in ghci
> factorial 6 Result:720 > factorial 20 Result:2432902008176640000
Summary
I have quite happy with what I have achieved in this experiment .
It has taken only a small amount of code to create s simple , but working , implementation of the Actors model .
I ’m sure it is not without flaws or short comings , but I look forward to testing it out on more problems and extending it .
Paul B. MacCready , an awesomely accomplished inventor who studied circling hawks and vultures to figure out how to realize the loftiest dream of Leonardo da Vinci — inventing a human - powered flying machine — died Tuesday in Pasadena , Calif .
He was 81 .
His death was announced by AeroVironment Inc. , the company Dr. MacCready founded and led .
No cause was given .
Dr. MacCready seemed a genuine free spirit — a friend noted his “ innocent sense of wonder ” in a Time magazine interview — empowered by a quirky , darting intellect .
His fascination with aerodynamics came from watching butterflies and moths as a boy , and his dreams for the future included animal - powered flight .

Welcome to the VegTruck Blog
This is an adventure based on one fundamental theme : the quest for sustainable transportation .
The last 2 years of my life have been dedicated to this end , what I find to be the most difficult task of personal sustainability .
Here you will find detailed information about biodiesel and converting a diesel vehicle to run on straight vegetable oil .
What do you do when your TV world ends ?
You go to dinner , then keep quiet .
Sunday night , " Sopranos " creator David Chase took his wife out for dinner in France , where he 's fled to avoid " all the Monday morning quarterbacking " about the show 's finale .
After this exclusive interview , agreed to well before the season began , he intends to go into radio silence , letting the work -- especially the controversial final scene -- speak for itself .
" I have no interest in explaining , defending , reinterpreting , or adding to what is there , " he says of the final scene .
" No one was trying to be audacious , honest to God , " he adds .
" We did what we thought we had to do .
No one was trying to blow people 's minds , or thinking , ' Wow , this 'll ( tick ) them off . '
People get the impression that you 're trying to ( mess ) with them and it 's not true .
You 're trying to entertain them . "
In that scene , mob boss Tony Soprano waited at a Bloomfield ice cream parlor for his family to arrive , one by one .
What was a seemingly benign family outing was shot and cut as the preamble to a tragedy , with Tony suspiciously eyeing one patron after another , the camera dwelling a little too long on Meadow 's parallel parking and a man in a Members
Only jacket 's walk to the men 's room .
Just as the tension had been ratched up to unbearable levels , the series cut to black in mid-scene ( and mid song ) with no resolution .
" Anybody who wants to watch it , it 's all there , " says Chase , 61 , who based the series in general ( and Tony 's relationship with mother Livia specifically ) on his North Caldwell childhood .
Some fans have already assumed that the ambiguous ending was Chase setting up the oft - rumored " Sopranos " movie , but that does n't seem to be in the cards .
" I do n't think about ( a movie ) much , " he says .
" I never say never .
An idea could pop into my head where I would go , ' Wow , that would make a great movie , ' but I doubt it .
" I 'm not being coy , " he adds .
" If something appeared that really made a good ' Sopranos ' movie and you could invest in it and everybody else wanted to do it , I would do it .
But I think we 've kind of said it and done it . "
Another problem : over the last season , Chase killed so many key characters .
He 's toyed with the idea of " going back to a day in 2006 that you did n't see , but then ( Tony 's children ) would be older than they were then and you would know that Tony does n't get killed .
It 's got problems . "
( Earlier in the interview , he notes that his favorite part of the show was often the characters telling stories about the good ol ' days of Tony 's parents .
Just a guess , but if Chase ever does a movie spin - off , it 'll be set in Newark in the ' 60s . )
Since Chase is declining to offer his interpretation of the final scene , let me present two more of my own , which came to me with a good night 's sleep and a lot of helpful reader e-mails :
Theory No. 1 ( and the one I prefer ) : Chase is using the final scene to place the viewer into Tony 's mindset .
This is how he sees the world : every open door , every person walking past him could be coming to kill him , or arrest him , or otherwise harm him or his family .
This is his life , even though the paranoia 's rarely justified .
We end without knowing what Tony 's looking at because he never knows what 's coming next .
Theory No. 2 : In the scene on the boat in " Soprano Home Movies , " repeated again last week , Bobby Bacala suggests that when you get killed , you do n't see it coming .
Certainly , our man in the Members
Only jacket could have gone to the men's room to prepare for killing Tony ( shades of the first " Godfather " ) , and the picture and sound cut out because Tony 's life just did .
( Or because we , as viewers , got whacked from our life with the show . )
Meanwhile , remember that 21 - month hiatus between Seasons Five and Six ?
That was Chase thinking up the ending .
HBO chairman Chris Albrecht came to him after Season Five and suggested thinking up a conclusion to the series ;
Chase agreed , on the condition that he get " a long break " to decide on an ending .
Originally , that ending was supposed to occur last year , but midway through production , the number of episodes was increased , and Chase stretched out certain plot elements while saving the major climaxes for this final batch of 9 .
" If this had been one season , the Vito storyline would not have been so important , " he says .
Much of this final season has featured Tony bullying , killing or otherwise alienating the members of his inner circle .
After all those years viewing him as " the sympathetic mob boss , " were we supposed to , like his therapist Dr. Melfi , finally wake up and smell the sociopath ?
" From my perspective , there 's nothing different about Tony in this season than there ever was , " insists Chase .
" To me , that 's Tony . "
Chase has had an ambivalent relationship with his fans , particularly the bloodthirsty whacking crowd who seemed to tune in only for the chance to see someone 's head get blown off ( or run over by an SUV ) .
So was he reluctant to fill last week 's penultimate episode , " The Blue Comet , " with so many vivid death scenes ?
" I'm the Number One fan of gangster movies , " he says .
" Martin Scorsese has no greater devotee than me .
Like everyone else , I get off partly on the betrayals , the retributions , the swift justice .
But what you come to realize when you do a series is you could be killing straw men all day long .
Those murders only have any meaning when you 've invested story in them .
Otherwise , you might as well watch ' Cleaver . ' "
One detail about the final scene that he 'll discuss , however tentatively : the selection of Journey 's " Do n't Stop Believin ' " as the song on the jukebox .
" It did n't take much time at all to pick it , but there was a lot of conversation after the fact .
I did something I 'd never done before : in the location van , with the crew , I was saying , ' What do you think ? '
When I said , ' Do n't Stop Believin ' , ' people went , ' What ?
Oh my god ! '
I said , ' I know , I know , just give a listen , ' and little by little , people started coming around . "
Whether viewers will have a similar time - delayed reaction to the finale as a whole , Chase does n't know .
( " I hear some people were very angry , and others were not , which is what I expected . " )
He 's relaxing in France , then he 'll try to make movies .
" It 's been the greatest career experience of my life , " he says .
" There 's nothing more in TV that I could say or would want to say . "
Here 's
Chase on some other points about the finale and the season :
- After all the speculation that Agent Harris might turn Tony , instead we saw that Harris had turned , passing along info on Phil 's whereabouts and cheering , " We 're going to win this thing ! " when learning of Phil 's demise .
" This is based on an actual case of an FBI agent who got a little bit too partisan and excited during the Colombo wars of the ' 70s , " says Chase of the story of Lindley DeVecchio , who supplied Harris ' line .
- Speaking of Harris , Chase had no problem with never revealing what -- if anything -- terror suspects Muhammed and Ahmed were up to .
" This , to me , feels very real , " he says .
" The majority of these suspects , it 's very hard for anybody to know what these people are doing .
I do n't even think Harris might know where they are .
That was sort of the point of it : who knows if they are terrorists or if they 're innocent pistachio salesmen ?
That 's the fear that we are living with now . "
Also , the apocryphal story -- repeated by me , unfortunately -- that Fox , when " Sopranos " was in development there , wanted Chase to have Tony help the FBI catch terrorists , was n't true .
" What I said was , if I had done it at Fox , Tony would have been a gangster by day and helping the FBI by night , but we were n't there long enough for anyone to make that suggestion . "
- I spent the last couple of weeks wrapping my brain around a theory supplied by reader Sam Lorber ( and his daughter Emily ) that the nine episodes of this season were each supposed to represent one of the nine circles of Hell from Dante 's " The Divine Comedy . "
Told of the theory , Chase laughed and said , " No . "
- Since Butchie was introduced as a guy who was pushing Phil to take out Tony , why did he turn on Phil and negotiate peace with Tony ?
" I think Butch was an intelligent guy , he began to see that there was no need for it , that Phil 's feelings were all caught up in what was esentially a convoluted personal grudge . "
- Not from Chase , but I feel the need to debunk the e-mail that 's making the rounds about all the Holsten 's patrons being characters from earlier in the series .
The actor playing Member 's
Only guy had never been on the show before , Tony killed at least , one if not both of his carjackers , and there are about 17 other things wrong with this popular but incorrect theory .
Alan Sepinwall may be reached at asepinwall@starledger.com
Fortunately , at 75 , Stark is not planning to seek higher office .
If he had been , he had just committed political suicide .
Being an atheist is the biggest handicap a person could have to being elected US president - worse than being gay or a woman , according to a Gallup poll in February .
More than 53 per cent of people surveyed said they would not vote for an atheist .
They would prefer a homosexual president - 43 per cent said they would not vote for a homosexual - or a woman president ( 11 per cent said they would not vote for a woman ) .
And it seems that these days being black or Catholic or Jewish is hardly a barrier at all , with each of these factors being named as a bar by fewer than 7 per cent of voters .
That the US remains so concerned that its leaders be people of faith is surprising .
In most industrial societies , the level of religiosity declines as the society becomes wealthier and more sophisticated , according to John Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , which regularly surveys attitudes towards religion in the US .
Yet the US remains a highly religious place .
Not the most religious place on the planet , but certainly more religious than Europe and Australia .
Green puts that down to America 's historical roots .
" Many people came to America precisely because they can practise their faith openly , " he says .
" Secondly , these extensive religious communities compete with each other for members .
It means more effort goes into recruiting and maintaining members . "
There is also a kind of counterintuitive argument about why religion has flourished , according to Green .
Because of the separation of church and state , churches have had to build extensive private organisational structures to push their interests and so have become strong within the society .
One such manifestation of that organisational power is the Southern Baptist Convention , a powerful wheel in the evangelical movement .
Dr Richard Land is president of its Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission and a close friend of President George Bush .
He is not surprised that Americans want a president of faith .
" Being elected president is more like a date than a job interview , " he says .
" I think that given that 91 per cent say they believe in God , most Americans are more comfortable with a person that acknowledges a higher authority other than themselves .
It would take a very charismatic atheist to convince people to vote for them . "
In 2000 and again in 2004 , Bush , a born - again evangelical , tapped into the Christian right movement and narrowly won .
According to Land , 78 per cent of white evangelicals voted for Bush , making up 26 per cent of all votes cast .
Whether the Republicans are successful in marshalling the conservative Christian right again will depend on who they select as the nominee , he says , warning that selecting a pro-choice candidate such as Rudy Giuliani will shatter that bloc of votes .
Pew 's work confirms that Republican voters are more religious than Democrats , but 62 per cent of Democrats say they have no doubt that God exists , and they pray regularly .
The Democrats are determined to ensure that faith is not the sole preserve of the Republicans next year - and the Republicans are equally determined not to lose the Christian vote .
In June the TV news network CNN staged a special forum co-hosted by the Sojourners , a liberal Christian organisation , between the three Democrat frontrunners .
Hillary Clinton was asked whether her faith had helped her get through Bill Clinton 's infidelity .
She said she felt a little uncomfortable talking of such matters , but noted people seemed to take these issues of faith more seriously than they did a decade ago .
In Republican debates , candidates have been quizzed about whether intelligent design should be taught in schools alongside Darwin 's theory .
Three candidates said they did not believe in evolution at all .
Mitt Romney , a Mormon , has faced questions on how the Book of Mormon would inform his decision - making as president , while the thrice - married former mayor of New York , Giuliani , has been asked - and refused to answer - whether he was a traditional practising Catholic .
Their respective baggage with Christian voters is continuing to fuel speculation that there is still room for a conservative candidate , such as the actor Fred Thompson or former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich .
At the organisational level , Democrat Speaker Nancy Pelosi has led the way in forging ties with the more progressive Christian groups .
As minority leader she initiated the Faith Working group of caucus , a largely behind - the - scenes endeavour that has been steadily building bridges with the progressive religious community as well as talking to lawmakers about how to communicate in a language that will appeal to the faithful - something Pelosi does well .
" The Democratic agenda is deeply rooted in faith , but we have been less effective than we could be in communicating how our moral values guide our policies , " says the group 's chairman , Jim Clyburn , an African Methodist Episcopalian from South Carolina .
In the Democrat national headquarters , work is also under way on a full - blown strategy to ensure Democrats do not cede the faithful to the Republicans .
In 2004 there was just one aide dedicated to mobilising religious voters .
Now there is a faith advisory council from a group of 60 clergy and faith community figures , who have been trained to talk to the media about the Democrats ' policies .
There 's also a team of consultants and a website that will soon be launched to help in the vote - gathering effort .
To Australians , the idea of asking a politician about their religious beliefs and practices would seem impertinent , at best irrelevant .
Being a non-believer is certainly not a bar to high office as Bob Hawke proved .
In 1980 , during a interview on ABC television , Hawke admitted : " Until I get some evidence one way or the other which is compelling to me , I 'm going to have to remain an agnostic … "
He was prime minister three years later .
In recent years , religion has made a few modest incursions into Australian political life .
Family First , established by the former national director of the Assemblies of God , achieved the election of Senator Steve Fielding on a platform of family - friendly policies that would appeal to church groups .
But Fielding and his party do not refer to religion as their moral guiding force , preferring to talk about the interests of families .
Furious debates over moral issues such as embryonic stem cell research and the morning - after pill RU486 have also inevitably swept religion into the parliamentary chambers .
But ironically it has been the leader of the Labor Party - a party that prides itself on its secular nature - who has pursued a strategy of courting the religious vote .
In 2005 Kevin Rudd , a committed Anglican , told ABC's Compass program it was the " right " time in political history .
" And that is to engage this debate about faith , values and politics and not to vacate the ground for the other mob .
For those on the political right who believe that faith is their natural preserve , I do n't intend to stand around or let that happen .
I 've got a responsibility for the tradition of Christian politics that I come from , " he said .
To date , personal beliefs are not put into the spotlight in the way they are in the US , but this federal election may break new ground .
There are , however , some lessons for politicians in the US experience .
Green says
Pew 's research consistently reveals an ambivalence that Americans feel towards the intrusion of religion into politics .
Americans are comfortable with religious organisations expressing views , but not so keen on them getting directly involved in politics by , say , endorsing candidates from the pulpit , Green says .
They are both uneasy with approaches offered by liberals and conservatives , Pew concluded in its 2006 survey .
Some 69 per cent of Americans say liberals have gone too far in keeping religion out of schools and government , but the proportion of people who express reservations about attempts by Christian conservatives to impose their religious views has edged up in the past year , with 49 per cent of respondents expressing wariness about this .
It seems that Americans want a Christian president , but they are not sure that he or she should let their religious supporters have open access to the Oval Office .

Sun Microsystems Demands University Study Retraction
Man Dies Waiting for Eclipse to Launch
Bill Gates Hacks Security System
MyTube Having Growth Difficulties
Fundamental Computer Science Discovery
Dyson Unveils the iSuck™ Personal Vacuum Assistant
The University of Washington , apparently hoping to capitalize on the recent hype around their controversial study on Baby Einstein™ - style videos , followed up yesterday with another , similar study .
In the new study , researchers found that Java programmers understand an average of seven fewer Computer Science concepts per hour spent with Java each day compared to similar programmers using other languages .
Sun calls the study " seriously flawed " , citing the fact that you can combine the names of Gang of Four Design Patterns to form new Computer Science concepts that all Java programmers understand , such as the ObserverFactory Bridge , the BridgeFactoryObserver , and the well - known FactoryObserverBridgeChainOfCommandSingletonProxy , beloved of Java programmers everywhere .
Java experts at Sun say they 're not sure how many combinations there are of the twenty - three pattern names , but there are " definitely a lot of them .
" A software engineer in San Jose , CA was found dead at his desk yesterday , apparently having died while waiting for his Java editing program , Eclipse , to finish its boot process .
Coworkers say the engineer came in that morning vowing to " get Eclipse working on his box or die trying . "
The last thing anyone heard him say aloud was the cryptic comment : " I see the splash screen is appropriately blue . "
Nobody knows what he meant .
The man was then thought to have fallen asleep , but hours later it was discovered that the engineer had died suddenly of apparent natural causes .
The forensics team 's investigation that evening was reportedly interrupted unexpectedly when the dead man 's Eclipse program suddenly finished launching .
The team tried to interact with it to see if they could find clues about the man 's death , but the program was unresponsive and the machine ultimately had to be rebooted .
At this time , the police commissioner says there is no evidence of foul play , and they currently believe the man simply died of either boredom or frustration .
This week 's issue of Time Magazine reports that Bill Gates hacked a security system at age 13 .
One of our staff investigators was intrigued enough to dig further into the story , and soon discovered that the security system in question was in fact one that Bill had written when he was 12 .
He managed to hack his way into his own system just under one year , a remarkable programming feat for the young Future Richest Man .
One apocryphal version of the story claims that Bill finally cracked the system by accidentally turning over his mouse pad and finding the password he'd forgotten the year before , but the reality is that nobody still alive today knows how he did it .
However , our investigative reporter did uncover one amazing twist to the story that should firmly cement Bill in programming legend , with concrete shoes of programming glory .
The surprise twist : the little security system that Bill wrote at age 12 and hacked into a year later is still in production today , in Windows Vista .
Ted Turner 's highly anticipated MyTube™ social network for men is having sizing problems , according to media analysts .
The new social networking site is Turner Broadcasting 's answer to Oprah Winfrey 's highly acclaimed and successful Oxygen television network aimed at young women .
Unfortunately , MyTube , which is implemented entirely in Ruby on Rails , is hitting a scaling barrier at peak usage hours , which are reportedly between midnight and 2 am PST .
An insider at MyTube tells us confidentially that they get up to 100 users before the system slows to a crawl , causing bored users to delete random files from their servers by requesting well - formed URLs like http://mytube.com/database/delete and http://mytube.com/debugger/start.
" It 's just so rude " , MyTube engineers were overheard saying in their Atlanta office .
" Some of our users are just plain wankers .
" Computer Scientists around the world have been reeling in shock , the stir caused by a quiet publication in the latest Communications of the ACM .
The ACM article that has everyone buzzing was submitted by an anonymous software engineer at an undisclosed Seattle - area software company .
The engineer has formulated a proof that invalidates one of the most fundamental results in Computer Science , specifically that " recursion " and " iteration " are formally equivalent .
The new proof by counterexample is simple , compelling , and undeniable , and theorists are said to be furiously scratching themselves over the proof 's implications , which are far - reaching enough to impact virtually all computer - automated industries , from aerospace technology through zooospace engineering .
The anonymous author of the paper has found that there is in fact one thing you can do using recursion that you can't do using iteration , namely : " You can use it to weed out stupid fugging interview candidates .
" Dyson Corporation announced today their latest innovation , a mobile handheld vacuum cleaner the size of a flashlight , dubbed the " iSuck " .
Dyson 's spokesperson was quoted as saying that although the device was originally targeted at the middle - aged housewife demographic , the iSuck has turned out to be unexpectedly popular with men of all ages and demographics .
Pundits speculate that the iSuck has finally achieved a form factor that entices men to do their own housecleaning .
Dyson claims that based on extensive early user feedback , new versions of the iSuck are planned for near - term release , including a unit that does n't dampen the motor vibrations ( we assume this is to increase battery life ) , a wet / dry vac , and a limited edition run titled " The Patriot " , which hums the U.S. National Anthem as it operates , expected to be popular aboard U.S. Navy ships for vacuuming those hard - to - reach nooks and crannies .
Dyson 's shares soared on the news , with analyists recommending that Dyson milk every drop from their innovative new product .
People are willing to dish out more dough to live in neighborhoods with others of the same race and education level , a new study finds .
Using 1990 U.S. Census data , researchers examined a quarter of a million households in the San Francisco Bay Area to look for statistical trends in where people preferred to live and found that they tend to self - segregate based on how these demographic factors apply to their choice of schools and neighbors .
College - educated people apparently were willing to pay $ 58 more per month on average for their property than those without a college education to live in a neighborhood where they would have more college - educated neighbors , according to the researchers ' model of people 's neighborhood choices .
That might not surprise you .
This might : People without college educations would want compensation to live in a neighborhood with more college - educated neighbors , the study showed .
The model , detailed in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Political Economy , held moreso for homeowners than renters .
Blacks were willing to pay $ 98 more per month to live in a neighborhood with more black households , while whites were willing to pay more to have fewer black neighbors .
And perhaps unsurprisingly , all households preferred to live in higher - income neighborhoods .
Those with higher income , as well as a higher education level , also were willing to pay more to live in a neighborhood served by better schools , a factor that could lead to exclusion eventually of lower - income families from " good " school districts , the researchers stated .
" Our estimates suggest that the improvement in a school 's quality would disproportionately attract more highly educated households to the neighborhood , in turn making the neighborhood even more attractive to higher - income , highly educated households , and raising prices further , " Patrick Bayer of Duke University and his co-authors said in a prepared statement .
The researchers looked at households on either side of a school zone boundary , with one school performing better than the other .
They found that households with higher incomes and a higher level of education were found on the side of the higher - ranked school ; housing prices were also higher on that side by an average of $ 18,000 .
Which Culture Most Controls Their Facial Emotions ?
According to some research it ’s Russians !
And the least control over facial emotions ?
Americans .
These are just two relatively new findings to emerge from studying cultural differences in nonverbal behaviour .
Perhaps the best known findings about differences between cultures relate to interpersonal space .
Arab males sit closer than American males .
Indonesians interact more closely than Australians .
Italians more closely than Americans or Germans , Columbians closer than Puerto Ricans .
Despite these differences , there are also surprising commonalities .
In fact some major aspects of nonverbal behaviour are stable across cultures ( Matsumoto , 2006 ) .
Facial expression of emotion is a good example .
Painstaking work by researchers like Paul Ekman has brought solid evidence for the universality of basic facial expressions .
But out of studying these commonalities has come a greater understanding of the subtle , and sometimes not so subtle , differences between cultures .
Cultural display rules
Differences in facial expressions between cultures have been termed cultural display rules .
We learn these types of rules as we grow up from those around us .
Different cultures have developed subtly different rules .
One useful distinction in these rules is made between cultures which are considered generally ‘ collectivist ’ such as the Japanese and cultures considered ‘ individualist ’ such as Americans .
Collectivist cultures tend to prize ‘ fitting in ’ and homogeneity and getting along with others , while individualist cultures tend to emphasise the importance of individual autonomy and power .
Studies have found that those from collectivist cultures are more likely to mask negative emotions with smiles – but only do this when in the presence of others , not when they are alone .
Controlling facial emotion
Recent work has looked at the levels of control exerted over different emotions across different cultures ( Matsumoto , 2006 ) .
This has found it is Russians who most tightly control the display of their emotions , closely followed by the Japanese and South Koreans .
On these measures , Americans displayed the least control over their facial expressions .
The same study also uncovered significant sex differences .
Men are more likely to hide surprise and fear while women control disgust , contempt and anger and many other emotions .
But it ’s not just the type of expression we display that differs across cultures , it ’s also the way these expressions are interpreted .
In the intensity of emotions , for example , it has been found that Asians tend to judge displayed emotions as less intense than non-Asians .
So , given these differences , what happens when we interpret the facial expressions of someone who is n’t from our culture ?
Are we more likely to hash it up ?
Recent , still relatively controversial findings , suggest people are actually better at understanding facial expressions of those from their own culture .
Overall , then , the basic nonverbal behaviours are surprisingly similar across cultures .
There are , however , many differences which research has only just begun to uncover .
Facial expression of emotion is just the tip of the iceberg .

A bonsai is not a genetically dwarfed plant .
It is any tree or shrub species actively growing but kept small through a combination of pot confinement , and crown and root pruning .
Any tree or shrub with the right training and care could become a Bonsai with time , but some plants are more sought - after for use as bonsai material because they have several characteristics that make them appropriate for the smaller design arrangements of bonsai .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Arab and other Islamic nations , targeting Israel ’s undeclared nuclear arsenal , pushed through a U.N. atomic watchdog resolution on Thursday calling on all Middle East nations to renounce atomic weapons .
A general view of the plenary hall during a session of the 51st General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in Vienna , Septemer 17 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Herwig Prammer
The unusual vote was 53 - 2 but with 47 abstentions by Western and developing states , highlighting reservations that the move politicized the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s work .
The decision was non-binding but symbolized tensions over Israel ’s presumed nuclear might and shunning of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , and it frayed the traditional consensus culture of the Vienna - based IAEA .
Israel is widely assumed to have the Middle East ’s only nuclear arsenal , though it has never confirmed or denied it .
A similar resolution urging all Middle East nations to adopt IAEA safeguards on nuclear work passed overwhelmingly at last year ’s IAEA general assembly , with only Israel and top ally the United States opposed , as they were again on Thursday .
Egypt reintroduced the resolution this year seeking full consensus but attached two new clauses that prompted Israel to demand a vote and European , other Western and non-aligned developing nations to abstain .
One clause urged all nations in the Middle East , pending creation of a nuclear weapons - free zone ( NWFZ ) there , not to make or test nuclear arms or let them be deployed on their soil .
The other urged big nuclear arms powers not to foil such a step .
“ The new language threatened to bring new political issues into the IAEA that would ultimately detract from the technical role the IAEA plays in safeguarding nuclear material , ” said a Western diplomat whose delegation abstained .
AVOID “ DOUBLE STANDARDS ” , EGYPT SAYS
Egyptian ambassador Ehab Fawzy said the U.N. General Assembly passed the same measure by consensus and IAEA members should follow suit to seek universal compliance with the NPT and “ avoid double standards ” in the Middle East .
Israel bemoaned the vote , saying that while a NWFZ was a commendable ideal , “ we can have no illusions ” as long as some Arab neighbors continue not to recognize the Jewish state , with Islamist Iran openly calling for its elimination .
Without peaceful relations in the region , “ any steps diminishing security margins should be mutual .
You aim high but start modestly with confidence - building , inevitably a long and enduring process , ” said Israeli envoy Israel Michaeli .
Iran , under U.N. sanctions for refusing to halt a nuclear energy program seen as a possible covert bid for atom bombs , told the assembly that whoever opposed the resolution betrayed a “ discriminatory ” approach to Middle East security .
Arab diplomats point to a chronic imbalance of power in the Middle East caused by Israeli might and say it breeds instability and spurs others to seek mass - destruction weaponry .
European diplomats said their missions abstained because , while they backed universal IAEA non-proliferation controls in the Middle East , the amended resolution flouted the agency ’s non-political ethos and sought to isolate a member state .
“ The IAEA is not the place to solve complex Middle East political problems .
This measure was not about finding rational solutions , or any consensus , but to score points and antagonize , ” said a senior European Union diplomat .
The issue was expected to split the assembly again on its last day on Friday when Arabs intended to revive a resolution declaring Israel a “ threat ” and demanding it use atomic energy only for peaceful ends and join the NPT .
A year ago , Western nations sponsored a “ no- action ” ballot that prevented a vote on the “ threat ” resolution .
The sole EU nation to vote for Thursday ’s resolution was staunchly anti-nuclear Ireland .
China , India , Russia , Japan , Latin American and some African nations also voted yes .
I Suppose That Depends On What the Definition of " the Law of the Land " Is
Marty Lederman
The story of the week has appeared practically everywhere : “ Atkins wins ! ”
Despite the glut of coverage the latest diet study has received — in mainstream media , medical literature and even the blog world — no one ’s gotten the secret yet .
The press release issued by the Journal of the American Medical Association has been the script followed by most reports , giving us headlining stories such as :
Study shows
Atkins diet helps women lose more weight ( San Jose Mercury News )
Atkins beats other diet plans in study ( Associated Press )
Atkins Diet Wins Kudos in a New Study ( U.S. News )
Briefly , this $ 2 million clinical trial , conducted by Stanford University researchers , enrolled 311 healthy women during 2003 - 2004 .
The women were about 40 years of age , college - educated , mostly caucasian , with an average weight of 187 pounds and BMI 32 ( “ obese ” ) .
The women were randomly assigned to either the Atkins ( very low - carbohydrate ) , Zone ( low - carbohydrate ) , LEARN ( low - fat , high - carbohydrate and based on national Dietary Guidelines ) or Ornish diets ( high - carbohydrate , low - fat vegetarian ) .
They attended weekly classes on their diet plan , taught by a dietitian , for the first two months .
To encourage maximum participation , throughout the study they received emails and telephone calls from staff members and incentive payments .
Their diets were monitored by unannounced 3 - day dietary recall telephone assessments using food amount books to help them report portion sizes more accurately and Stanford 7 - day physical activity recalls .
Their weights and other health measures were measured directly in the clinic by healthcare and laboratory professionals blinded so that they did n’t know what diet each participant had been assigned .
At the end of one year , what did they find ?
The story we ’ve heard reported is that the Atkins diet resulted in the greatest weight loss : an average of 10.4 pounds , as compared to 5.7 pounds on LEARN , 4.8 pounds on Ornish , and 3.5 pounds on the Zone .
While a 4 3/4 - pounds difference after a year of dieting is being heralded as significant , the undeniable fact is that all of the weight losses were modest at best and clinically insignificant .
And all were considerably less than the diets claim and certainly what most consumers believe will be their pay off after a year of effort .
The Zone , for example , says the average dieter may lose 8 to 10 pounds a month .
The U.S. government ’s Dietary Guidelines tell us that all we need to do to lose a pound is to eat 3,500 calories less or burn 3,500 calories more .
Given the calorie reductions made by all of the dieters in this study , they “ should ” have each lost about 36 pounds .
They did n’t , of course .
But the results were not surprising .
The actual findings
The impression given by the news reports this week is that all the dieters in this study were steadily losing weight and the Atkins dieters came out ahead of the pack .
Reporting just the weight loss differences at the end of a year is misleading , however , and paints a very different picture from what was actually seen .
It would be more accurate to say that the Atkins dieters experienced the biggest weight yo- yoing , and the fastest and most significant weight regain .
During the last 6 months of the trial , all of the dieters regardless of the diet plan , experienced weight regain .
At the end of the first year , they were already at or above the weight they lost during the first 2 months of the study .
The Atkins dieters lost weight fastest at the beginning , but the trajectory of their weight regain was also the most dramatic .
The study period simply ended before their skyrocketing weights jumped above the other diets .
While I ca n’t pull the weight loss graph from the study , I ’ll describe it :
It looks like a giant “ V . ”
This is consistent with other diet studies which have shown that the speed and magnitude of weight loss , regardless of the method , corresponds with the speed and magnitude of the weight regain .
The bigger and faster the loss , the bigger and faster the regain .
Had the diet study been continued for 5 years , which all obesity experts recognize is obligatory before making any conclusions about a weight loss intervention , the results would be no different than a century of diet studies .
All diets work ( wait for the punchline ) ...
The fact is , virtually all weight loss diets work — the specific diet plan is irrelevant .
They are merely whatever gimmick people will buy .
By cutting calories , most everyone will lose weight initially .
Just long enough for those before - and - after photos .
But , regardless of the diet or weight loss method , weight regain within five years is guaranteed for virtually everyone .
This was not lost on the researchers , either .
Buried in the discussion section they mentioned that “ weight - loss trajectories for each group had not stabilized ... suggest that longer follow - up would likely have resulted in progressively diminished group differences . ”
Only long - term results , after weights have stabilized , are relevant when evaluating any diet and , more importantly , any actual impact on health outcomes .
This short - term study was unable to credibly determine health outcomes — beneficial or harmful — so we ’re not even going to bother going there .
Does n’t it ever strike you odd that virtually no popular diet study ever lasts even five years ?
In a century of diets and weight loss programs , you would think more than one would have .
Yet , it is well - known and openly acknowledged among professionals that to demonstrate any degree of effectiveness for a weight loss intervention , people need to be followed for at least five years .
Popular diet studies commonly stop ... conveniently when the initial weight losses still look good and before the weight regain and health complications manifest themselves .
[ There is a notable recent exception : a careful , well - designed , long - term clinical diet trial .
We ’ll discuss it in an upcoming post .
Hint :
Not surprising in the least , it was a dismal failure on all counts , which is probably why you heard little about it . ]
A few other points clearly obvious in this JAMA study have not been even mentioned in the news or medical literature .
These startling insights are important to understanding this study and putting it into perspective with the body of evidence .
Calories in -Calories out myth of weight maintenance ( aka “ eat less and exercise more ” )
While the participants ’ adherence to the diets waned during the year , they were all still eating notably fewer calories than before they started dieting — even while they were regaining the weight lost during the first months of their diets .
The study states : “ There was a significant mean decrease in reported energy intake at all postrandomized time points : - 497 , - 387 and - 351 at 2 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively for all groups combined . ”
The dieters on every one of the plans who completed the study were eating fewer daily calories and at 12 months their daily calorie intakes were still : - 289 ( Atkins ) , - 381 ( Zone ) , - 271 ( LEARN ) , and - 345 ( Ornish ) .
Yet they all were steadily regaining their weight over the last 6 months of the first year .
All dieting groups had also maintained higher energy expenditures through increased physical activity , continuing to burn off around an additional 86 kcal / day at the one - year mark over their activity levels before they began dieting .
This concurs with the body of clinical evidence showing that due to biological processes outside of people ’s control , it becomes increasingly difficult to continue to lose weight , and especially to maintain any significant weight loss , as it requires increasingly extreme calorie restrictions and exercise .
Further weight loss much below one ’s natural weight range can become nearly impossible short of total fasting .
There are rare individuals who manage , with extraordinary and obsessive effort , to remake themselves by dieting .
There are others who can starve themselves to death by an act of will , and there have been saints who could sit for decades at the top of a pillar .
These examples have little to teach the majority of people , who have other things to do with their lives .
— Dr. William Bennett , M.D. and Joel Gurin ( Dieter ’s Dilemma : Eating Less and Weighing More )
So naturally thin people can lose ten pounds or so relatively easily and believe that fat people can just as easily repeat that ten times to be thin , but it does n’t work that way .
Compliance
Among the attempts to discredit or excuse this study ’s findings are claims that the dieters did n’t follow the diets exactly .
This overlooks the fact that the participants received 8 weeks of counseling from a dietitian on their prescribed diet plans ; followup calls , emails and office visits ; and incentives , which is much more than anyone else buying a diet book gets .
If anything , as these researchers reported , this study is about as good as it gets in the real world .
The researchers noted that “ we believe that the adherence levels obtained are a fair representation of the diets and variations in micronutrient intake under realistic conditions and , therefore , increase the external validity of the findings . ”
Attrition
Even though the dieters were paid increasingly more money the longer they stayed on in the study , about 20 % dropped out .
Attrition rates in most diet studies are considerably higher , despite the fact that clinical trial participants are typically highly motivated volunteers .
For instance , in another randomized trial comparing four popular diets conducted at Boston medical centers from the summer of 2000 to January , 2002 , the drop - out rate was 47 % for Atkins , 50 % for Ornish , and 35 % for the Zone and Weight Watchers .
This was despite the fact that all of the participants in the study had added motivation because of diagnosed health risks .
At the end of one year , by the way , the Atkins dieters in that study had lost the least amount of weight ( a mere 4 1/2 pounds ) versus roughly 7 pounds for the other plans .
But this was another study too short to derive any meaningful conclusions from .
It just keeps going and going ....
Los Angeles doctor , Lulu Hunt Peters , A.B. , M.D. published the first weight loss book based on the calorie theory in 1918 .
Her book , Diet and Health With Key to the Calories , recommended calorie reduction and increased exercise .
Her ’s became the first best - selling diet book .
The first bathroom scale , created by the Continental Scale Company , was introduced the following year and America was off and dieting .
There are some 7,500 diet books on the shelves today , each with it ’s own claims about how to lose weight and each claiming their plan works .
Atkins first introduced his approach in his book , Dr. Atkins ’ Diet Revolution , in 1972 .
Dr. Kelly Brownell wrote the first version of the LEARN Program in 1976 .
Dr. Barry Sears first published The Zone in 1995 .
And Dr. Dean Ornish ’s Eat More , Weigh Less first hit bookstores in 2000 .
According to the latest national survey conducted for the Partnership for Essential Nutrition ( a coalition of organizations promoting the government ’s programs , policies and research on healthy eating and weight loss ) , 45 % of Americans have dieted in the past five years , including 41 % of adults still actively trying to lose weight .
The weight loss secrets recommended by the government are to eat less in accordance with the Food Pyramid and exercise more ; not unlike those of Peters 90 years ago .
In the past century , the thousands of diets and weight loss prescriptions have had more than enough time to prove themselves or , at least , for one to show itself to actually work .
Not one has ever been able to .
It is not willpower alone that prevents long - term dieting success , although that ’s popularly believed .
It ’s condoned to disregard the biological realities that largely determine our size .
Additionally , thinner people do n’t fully grasp the intensity and unfathomable range of negative effects brought on by dieting .
Sadly , it ’s a rare fat woman in our culture who does n’t want to lose weight and has n’t exhibited heroic feats of willpower during countless years of dieting .
The multi-billion dollar diet industry has a remarkable business model , unlike any other industry .
Despite a century of proven failures and unsound premises behind it , it has managed to convince the public that its diets work and that it is the customer ’s fault when they fail .
Can you imagine this tactic working in the automobile industry ?
If consumers bought a car that failed within a year , let alone several more , they would refuse to buy more and not feel guilty .
We recently looked at what motivates healthcare professionals , who ( should ) know better , to continue to promote something that ’s has been shown to be ineffective after hundreds of the most careful , quality studies .
That post also looked at what differentiates science from junk science , and why true scientists often react with disinterest or distaste whenever the same junk science resurfaces .
They know it is either based on biophysiological implausabilities or has been disproven long ago and they ’ve moved on .
That ’s exactly how obesity researchers feel about this and other diet studies — those not selling their own diet books , that is ; and there are still a few such professionals .
It is unproductive to become mired in the mud-slinging resulting from this study , as various diet interests attack their competitors and promote their beliefs that their diet is the best .
The undeniable fact is that in nearly a century , despite billions of dollars behind them , no diet or weight loss measure has been demonstrated to work : to result in sustained weight loss or significant health improvements in people .
Short - term stunts are irrelevant and the scant 1 % exceptions to the rule do not make for an effective intervention .
Instead , the body of evidence is most significant that weight loss prescriptions increase risks for heart disease , strokes , arrhythmias , high blood pressure , osteoporosis , cancers , weight gain and weight cycling , poor self esteem , eating disorders , nutritional shortfalls , weight discrimination , and higher mortality .
Fat people continue to be blamed for the failure of diets , leading to negative attitudes towards fat people as lacking in willpower or being irresponsible , even from their own healthcare providers — attitudes which have been shown be significant barriers to seeking and getting quality medical care .
Whether healthcare professionals and consumers will ever take a lesson from alternative modalities and demand evidence - based health care and clinical practice guidelines is yet to be seen .
But how long will we continue to find entertaining and reward lucrative profits , let alone spend billions of dollars of our limited healthcare resources , for diet fads that lack credible scientific support to suggest they are helpful , safe or effective — or ever will be ?

THE ALBERTO GONZALES SHOW ….
One of the great discoveries of the Republican Party over the past decade or two is that an awful lot of the rules we take for granted are , in reality , just traditions .
Like redistricting only once a decade , for example , or keeping House votes open for 15 minutes .
And what Republicans have found out is that if you have the balls to do it , you can just ignore tradition and no one can stop you .
It ’s that simple .
Alberto Gonzales has learned this lesson well .
Normally , cabinet officers who have been caught in multiple obvious lies have to either resign or else seriously try to defend themselves .
But Gonzales realizes this is just tradition .
Unless House Democrats have the votes to impeach him , he does n’t have to do anything .
He can just mock them to their face and there ’s nothing much they can do about it .
Here ’s Dahlia Lithwick on his cavalier approach to his congressional testimony on Thursday :
The House Democrats are furious .
To them , there is only one plausible explanation for what happened to the eight ( now nine ? ) fired U.S. attorneys .
There is only one narrative that works with the facts .
The White House wanted party loyalists placed in either key battleground states , or in states where Republicans were being investigated or they thought Democrats should have been .
Gonzales rolled out the welcome mat at the Justice Department and told them to install whomever they wanted while he played hearts on his computer .
If Gonzales truly wants to rebut that narrative , he needs only to offer some plausible alternative .
Anything at all .
But he does n’t .
He offers only distractions .
Read the whole thing .
In Thursday ’s testimony , Gonzales made it clear that he just does n’t care what anyone thinks .
After all , if Democrats do n’t like it , what are they going to do ?
Roll their eyes at him ?
This would result in huge revenue losses and OPEC Member Countries , as developing countries with strong competing needs for financial resources , would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for education , healthcare and infrastructure .
If we look at the future , however , the issue of security of demand , which is intrinsically linked to the issue of security of supply , is of very real concern .
Without confidence that there will be demand for OPEC oil , the incentive to undertake investment will also be reduced because of concerns that this will lead to large levels of unused capacity and , in turn , to downward pressures on oil prices .
Presentation by Dr. Nimat B. Abu Al - Soof , Upstream Oil Industry Analyst , Secretariat , to the OPEC - organized session " The Petroleum Industry : New Realities Ahead ? " , at the Offshore Technology Conference 2007 , Houston , Texas , 30 April - 3 May .
( Throughout , all headlines in all caps are mine , to help structure the content of the remarks , extracted from the following speeches .
Links are provided so that the original remarks and slides can be viewed in entirety by the reader )
THE THREAT OF NON - OPEC GROWTH
To complete the picture , I will now turn to non-OPEC supply .
The impact of Engineering & Procurement capital expenditure increases on non-OPEC growth since 2002 has been positive .
In fact on average , production has increased at record rates .
Increased investment has also resulted in the stabilization of production in many mature fields by slowing the decline rate of many , enabled the development of marginal fields , allowed for more exploration and the application of more technology , and kicked off an expansion of projects under development and fields in production .
The one significant blip was 2005 , when the Gulf of Mexico witnessed its most intense storms in 100 years .
Other events , such as the sinking of the world ’s largest floating production platform in Brazil in 2001 and the collapse of Russia ’s largest oil company in 2004 had very little impact on non-OPEC supply .
In the six year period from 2000 non-OPEC oil production growth averaged 800,000 b/d per year , nearly five times higher than the period 1990 - 99 , and one of the highest growth rates in 20 years .
However , the fact that non-OPEC production growth fell behind that of world demand growth for the years 2003 - 06 – reversing earlier trends of exceeding or matching demand growth – combined with the frequency of accidents and of downward forecast revisions , led the analytical community to under appreciate non-OPEC ’s recent performance and to essentially write off its potential .
NON - OPEC GROWTH , FROM WHERE ?
Regionally , Russia and the Caspian region will lead non-OPEC growth , with the bulk of the increase expected to come from the Caspian .
Outside these areas , supply growth is driven primarily by increases in offshore West Africa , offshore Latin America , Gulf of Mexico and non-conventional in North America .
The Middle East , OECD Asia and other parts of Asia will show modest gains , while Western Europe is expected to decline driven by a fall in output from the North Sea .
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EXPENSIVE “ SPARE ” CAPACITY ?
But as a result of these uncertainties affecting security of demand , OPEC Member Countries will be reviewing their future capacity expansion plans .
It also begs question : with these investment uncertainties where does the onus of maintaining sufficient spare capacity lie ?
To conclude , there are challenges and uncertainties , but we believe the overall picture for the industry is positive .
During the next few years we expect to see a strong increase in non-OPEC supply and OPEC capacity .
OPEC spare capacity is expected to continue to rise in the medium term and the required OPEC crude is likely to drop or remain flat at best until 2009 .
In order to ensure market stability , however , players in OPEC and non-OPEC countries must collaborate strongly .
This is all the more important given the challenges that the industry is currently facing and the uncertainties driven by factors like the growth of the world economy , consuming country energy policies ( substantial downside risk to demand ) and technological developments .

-------------------------------
( Notes on above remarks )
Both speaker and several other OPEC speakers have repeatedly stressed over and over that “ Security of supply and security of demand are tightly related . ”
Dr Siala recently made news when he expressed concern that oil was being “ discriminate ” against oil : ( EUNN ) London - OPEC is growing uncomfortable with all of the global criticism toward oil and talk of alternative fuels , according to Fuad Siala , alternative energy sources analyst at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries who said in Brussels at a Hart energy conference , " We have great concerns about this ... about policies which discriminate against oil , "
http://moneynews.newsmax.com/money/archives/st/2007/5/9/120724.cfm
The OPEC speakers have made reference to concern about this regarding the “ biofuels ” .
However , it seems hard to believe that the biofuels along are able to create much concern in OPEC nations about lost market share , although in some of their slides they do show that only a 5 % percent penetration ( above what is used to replace MTBE as a fuel supplement ) could cost them billions , in particular in their big markets in Europe )
But let us consider another possibility :
Is it possible that it is not biofuels that have the OPEC ( i.e. , the Saudis ) nervous , but instead , developments such as this ...

Conclusion
What we are seeing is a confluence of technology that gives us a real view forward toward to a possible future in which the transportation sector consumes less oil per vehicle mile traveled , potentially much less .
Batteries are advancing , and nano - technology makes the possibility of even faster future advance obtainable .
If grid based hybrids can be made viable , the OPEC nations face a 4 fold decline in oil consumption per new car sold if it is an advanced plug hybrid .
What this means is that the grid based “ plug ” hybrid autos could have an impact out of all proportion to the numbers of them sold , with each one sold essentially wiping out the consumption of three or four vehicles .
If one considers the possibility of using CNG ( compressed natural gas ) or LPG ( Propane ) in even a small number of such cars , the decline in transportation fuel consumption could revolutionize the energy markets .
Using natural gas or propane becomes a real option in such advanced cars because the fuel carried on board is used in such small quantity , with 10 gallons providing the range that a 30 or 40 gallon tank of gasoline now provides .
The OPEC nations are being asked , sometimes very curtly , to make massive investments in oil producing and refining infrastructure based on increasing oil demand .
It is well known that many of the OPEC nations face a future of growing populations and increased need for Western capital to satisfy rising expectations in their home countries , rising home energy needs , and to service increasing debt loads .
What if the predicted increasing demand for oil does not materialize ?
What if unconventional oil , using advanced in situ extraction methods such as THAI in the Canadian Tar Sands , really begins to deliver big production ?
The Europeans have already made it a stated goal to reduce EU fossil fuel consumption by some 20 % by 2020 .
Many observers feel that goal may be far too optimistic , but the OPEC nations have to ask , could they do it , and if so , what are the implications for our revenue stream ?
The American and Japanese automakers are now beginning to look at competition from other auto manufacturers , and being pushed to actually deliver the “ clean ” and lean autos they have been long promising .
They in turn are pressing the battery makers for the product needed to do it , and creating innovative financing structures to be able to meet the market demand for affordability .
Can they do it ?
No one knows .
Ironically , the people who most doubt Western technology advance are the Westerners themselves .
The OPEC oil suppliers must shiver at the thought that once more , as in so many industries before , the technicians might just do the impossible .
The West and OPEC have one thing in common :
All of our futures could very well hang in the balance based on what happens in labs and shops around the world .
And the clock is moving very , very fast .

Every American who voted Republican shares responsibility for the great evil America has brought to the Middle East .
The evil that America brought to Iraq transcends the tens or hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who have been killed and maimed in the conflict .
The evil goes beyond the destruction of ancient historical artifacts and the civilian infrastructure of a secular state and the decimation of the lives , careers , and families of millions of Iraqis .
The violence and killing that Bush brought to Iraq has spread antagonism between Sunni and Shiite throughout the Middle East with potentially draconian consequences .
Bush ’s war has turned Muslim hearts and minds against America and made terrorism an acceptable means to resist American hegemony .
With his mindless war , Bush has created more terrorism than the world has ever seen .
The reasons given for the American invasion of Iraq have been exposed as lies , revealing America as either a country of fools and idiots or of war criminals .
Worldwide polls show that America is no longer regarded as a guiding light but is tied with Israel as the second greatest threat to world stability .
The nuclear - armed Russians , alarmed by America ’s gratuitous aggression and interference in Russian and Middle Eastern internal affairs and by Bush ’s aggressive withdrawal on June 13 , 2002 from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty , no longer see the US as a partner in peace but as a dangerous militaristic aggressor .
The chance for understanding and trust with Russia has been destroyed by the stupid Bush administration .
The White House Moron , who cannot successfully occupy Baghdad , believes he can run over Russia .
Former CIA director George " Slam - Dunk " Tenet writes in a new book , At the Center of the Storm :
My years at the CIA that Vice President Dick Cheney and the neoconservatives caused America to invade Iraq without ever holding a serious debate about whether Iraq was a threat .
Tenet writes : " There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat . "
The 2003 American invasion of Iraq is a war crime under international law .
The invasion caused sectarian violence far beyond anything Iraq had ever experienced under Saddam Hussein .
Tenet writes that " sectarian violence in Iraq has taken on a life of its own and that US forces are becoming more and more irrelevant to the management of that violence . "
Tenet says that Dick Cheney made him a scapegoat for the disastrous war by misrepresenting to media what he meant by " slam - dunk . "
Interviewed by " 60 Minutes , " Tenet said that the administration misrepresented his comment to mean that the case was air tight that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
Tenet states that the Bush administration ’s misrepresentation of what he said is " the most despicable thing that ever happened " to him .
The American people have never been told the real reasons that Bush - Cheney and the Republican Party rushed us to war in Iraq .
Americans have only been fed a pack of transparent lies .
The war has brought no honor , no glory , and no tangible benefit .
The war has brought shame upon America for routine torture of Iraqi detainees and for the routine slaughter of unarmed Iraqi civilians — mothers , fathers , children , grandparents — by trigger - happy American troops .
There are even reports of US mercenaries having fun riding around taking pot shots at Iraqi civilians .
Billions of dollars in " aid " are missing .
The stench of corruption is heavy in the air .
There are myriad investigations of Bush administration and contractor corruption .
Who can keep up with them all ?
Cheney ’s Halliburton , the greatest hog at the trough , has not been indicted .
The missing suitcases of cash have not been recovered .
The earnest efforts of Congress have taken on a pathetic , plodding life of their own .
In an article just published in the Armed Forces Journal , Lt. Col .
Paul Yingling , one of the commanders of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Iraq , condemns American generals as " mild - mannered team players " who " are not worthy of their soldiers " and who " underestimated the strength of the enemy , overestimated the capabilities of Iraq ’s government and security forces and failed to provide Congress with an accurate assessment of security conditions in Iraq . "
Captains , majors , and lieutenant colonels are frustrated with the political cowardice of their general officers and are leaving the service in droves .
The Army is trying to improve retention by offering $ 20,000 cash payments to the officers — another stupid Bush administration policy as any officer who sells his soul is demoralized .
Col .
Yingling writes that Congress must step in and break up the way administrations use promotions to acquire compliant generals as accomplices in deceiving the American people .
The most frightening fact about the Bush administration is that not a single office is held by a competent or qualified person .
Integrity is so rare among Bush appointees that integrity has been silenced .
That should concern all Americans .
Even Republicans .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for all sorts of tasks where it either was n’t previously collected , or for tasks that did not previously exist .
While this is great for Machine Learning , it has a downside — the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead to substantial privacy problems .
It ’s important to understand that this is a much harder problem than many people appreciate .
The AOL data release is a good example .
To those doing machine learning , the following strategies might be obvious :
Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable information .
The logic here seems to be “ if I ca n’t easily find the person then no one can ” .
That does n’t work as demonstrated by the people who were found circumstantially from the AOL data .
… then just hash all the search terms !
The logic here is “ if I ca n’t read it , then no one can ” .
It ’s also trivially broken by a dictionary attack — just hash all the strings that might be in the data and check to see if they are in the data .
… then encrypt all the search terms and throw away the key !
This prevents a dictionary analysis , but it is still entirely possible to do a frequency analysis .
If 10 terms appear with known relative frequencies in public data , then finding 10 terms encrypted terms with the same relative frequencies might give you very good evidence for what these terms are .
All of these strategies turn out to be broken .
For those not familiar with Machine Learning , other obvious strategies turn out to not work that well .
Just do n’t collect the data .
We are not too far off from a world where setting the “ please do n’t collect my information ” flag in your browser implies that you volunteer to have your searches return less relevant results , to not find friends , to not filter spam , etc …
If everyone effectively has that flag set by legislation the effect would be very substantial .
Many internet companies run off of advertising so eliminating the ability to do targeted advertising will eliminate the ability of these companies to exist .
… Then just keep aggregations of the data !
Aggregating data is very bad for machine learning in general .
When we are figuring out how to do machine learning it ’s even worse because we do n’t know in advance which aggregations would be most useful .
… Then keep just enough data around and throw out everything else !
Unfortunately , there is no such thing as “ enough data ” .
More data is always better .
This is a particularly relevant topic right now , because it ’s news and because CMU and NSF are organizing a workshop on the topic next month , which I ’m planning to attend .
However , this is not simply an interest burst — the long term trend of increasing data collection implies this problem will repeatedly come up over the indefinite future .
The privacy problem breaks into at least two parts .
Cultural Norms .
Historically , almost no monetary transactions were recorded and there was a reasonable expectation that people would forget a visitor .
This is rapidly changing with the rise of credit cards and cameras .
This change in what can be expected is profoundly uncomfortable .
Power Balance .
Data is power .
The ability to collect and analyze large quantities of data which many large organizations now have or are constructing increases their power relative to ordinary people .
This power can be used for good ( to improve services ) or for bad ( to maximize monopoly status or for spying ) .
The cultural norm privacy problem is sometimes solvable by creating an opt - in or opt - out protocol .
This is particularly helpful on the internet because a user could simply request “ please do n’t record my search ” or “ please do n’t record which news articles I read ” .
Needing to do this for every search or every news article would be annoying .
However , this is easily fixed by having a system wide setting — perhaps a special browser cookie which says “ please do n’t record me ” that any site could check .
None of this is helpful for cameras ( where no interface exists ) or monetary transactions ( where the transaction itself determines whether or not some item is shipped ) .
The power balance privacy problem is much more difficult .
Some solutions that people attempt are :
Accept the change in power balance .
This is the default action .
There are plenty of historical examples where large organizations have abused their power , so providing them more power to abuse may be unwise .
Legislate a halt .
Forbid cameras in public places .
Forbid the collection or retention of data by any organization .
The problem with this method is that technology simply is n’t moving in this direction .
At some point , we may end up with cameras and storage devices so small , cheap , and portable that forbidding their use is essentially absurd .
The other difficulty with this solution is that it keeps good things from happening .
For example , a reasonable argument can be made that the British were effective at tracking bomb planters because the cameras of London helped them source attacks .
Legislate an acceleration .
Instead of halting the collection of data , open it up to more general use .
One example of this is cameras in police cars in the US .
Recordings from these cameras can often settle disputes very definitively .
As technology improves , it ’s reasonable to expect cameras just about anywhere people are in public .
Some legislation and good engineering could make these cameras available to anyone .
This would involve a substantial shift in cultural norms — essentially people would always be in potential public view when not at home .
This directly collides with the “ privacy as a cultural norm ” privacy problem .
The hardness of the privacy problem mentioned at the post beginning implies difficult tradeoffs .
If you have cultural norm privacy concerns , then you really do n’t appreciate method ( 3 ) for power balance privacy concerns .
If you value privacy greatly and the default action is taken , then you prefer monopolistic marketplaces .
The advantages of a large amount of private data are prohibitive to new market entrance .
If you want the internet to work better , then there are limits on how little data can be collected .
All of the above is even murkier because what can be done with data is not fully known , nor is what can be done in a privacy sensitive way .

About 8 or 9 months ago , there was a thread on “ how to design a language ” .
I offered some thought , other people chipped in , and I volunteered to collate the results .
This is as good an excuse as any to post what 's there so far .
I never really finished it , so it 's unintentionally a bit folksy …
Here are some questions a prospective language designer should ask himself when starting the designing a programming language .
What need are you trying to fill ?
Do n't fall into the trap of “ a scripting language ” , because they always turn into general - purpose languages .
What 's the metaphor ?
Even though you might not be trying to build a “ pure ” language , it 's worth having a model for the core language , such as “ imperative , block - structured ” ( C ) , “ object oriented ” ( Smalltalk ) , “ generic object orientation ” ( Lisp ) , “ functional ” ( ML ) , “ lazy ” ( Haskell ) , “ logic ” ( Prolog ) , “ production system ” ( OPS5 ) , etc .
These different core models influence the “ natural ” styles of program development in different languages even if the set of available facilities is similar .
They also help define which late - arriving features will “ fit ” and which will be warts .
[ Jerry Jackson ]
How many programming paradigms does your language support ?
How tightly are they integrated ?
Which other paradigms can you integrate with the built - in facilities ?
How natural is the syntax of user - defined extensions ?
Many problems are much better suited to some non-standard programming model than to the usual object - oriented / functional approaches .
For example , constraint languages allow a very concise description ( and efficient solution ) of many optimization problems .
Dylan supports functional and object - oriented programming in a tightly integrated manner , but it offers no support for non-deterministic programming , constraint - solving , etc. , and not much support to add them to the language .
If you have first - class continuations in the language you can add one additional programming model that requires non-standard control flow , but , in general , different extensions based on call / cc do n't work together .
[ Matthias Holzl ]
Is high performance an issue ?
This says something about whether you want to implement an interpreted , a VM - based , or a natively compiled language .
Is high programmer productivity an issue ?
How important is this with respect to performance ?
This decision can affect how you store values and do function calling .
How portable across platforms do you want the language to be ?
This will relates to whether you want to compile to a VM or to machine code , and to how well you support native libraries .
It will also affect library design for such things as graphics and GUI tools .
[ Anton van Straaten ]
Do you want easily distributed executable code , i.e. , do you you want to allow code to be easily transmitted across networks and run elsewhere , as Java does ?
Do you want to provide built - in support for remote execution , like RPC / CORBA / RMI ?
If you are writing for a VM , this can simplify some of these issue considerably .
[ Anton van Straaten ]
What about debuggability ?
If you plan to compile it , you need to think about how to store debugging information .
How do you want to bootstrap it ?
This , too , says something about what kind of back - end you might build .
Perhaps you build a tiny VM in C , then compile to C .
This way , you avoid fun but time - consuming work on code generation for modern super - scalar hardware , register allocation , etc .
Do you want to be able to catch type errors early or late ?
That says something about your type system ( whether you require that all types be statically declared at compile - time , or allow them to be dynamic , or have a hybrid scheme like Dylan does ) .
In addition to the obvious effect on performance , this decision will affects your memory model in that completely static systems do not require tags or boxing .
Will variables be associated with explicit type declarations ? -
If yes , will these type declarations be required or optional ? -
If optional , will the language use inferencing to supply unspecified types , or simply use an all - purpose type ( like Object or ' any ' ) ?
[ Anton van Straaten ]
Will the language have any run-time type discrimination / checking at all , or will types be completely statically determined ?
Some languages considered statically typed still do some run-time checking , such as Java .
[ Anton van Straaten ]
Will any type checking happen at compile - time ?
Some languages with explicit type declarations do n't always check types at compile - time , such as old Visual Basic .
[ Anton van Straaten ]
If you allow type declarations , you will want to think about whether you want parameterized types .
If you go whole hog with , say , F - bounded polymorphism , you can get performance and type safety and ease of use , but it 's hard to get this exactly right .
What about namespaces ?
Do you want to have a simple scheme as in Java , where classes , namespaces , and files are roughly equivalent ?
Lisp - style packages ?
Dylan - style modules and libraries ?
Within a single first - class namespace , how many second - class namespaces are there ?
Java has 7 or 8 : class names , function names , local variable names , slot names , etc. Common Lisp has at least 3 ( function , variable , and class names ) .
Dylan and Scheme have one , which greatly simplifies things at a small loss of generality which can usually be worked around with name conventions .
What about encapsulation ?
Do you want to do information - hiding on a per-class basis as in C++ and Java , or on a “ module ” basis as in Dylan ?
Is your language a functional language ( that is , without side - effects ) ?
If so , is it an almost - functional language or a true pure functional language ?
Or is there a functional core with some sort of machinery for isolating side - effects , like monads do in Haskell ?
What kind of evaluation semantics does the language have ?
Eager as in most languages , or lazy as in Haskell ?
Is your language purely lexical or do you offer dynamic variables ( or , more generally , access to the dynamic environment ) as well ?
Dynamic binding allows you to introduce local state for the duration of a computation without side effects and without adding additional parameters .
[ Matthias Holzl ]
Are there different semantics for “ pointer -ish ” and “ non-pointer - ish ” values , like in C ?
Or is everything a first - class object reference , like in Lisp ?
Having multiple ways of referencing values can make the user mode much more complicated .
On the other hand , making everything be object references can require boxing and / or tagging schemes that make your compiler and FFI more complex .
How do you want to pass arguments to functions ?
By name as in Algol ?
By value or by reference as in C ?
By object reference like Lisp does ?
Is there more than one convention in the language ?
Do you want first - class functions ?
What about lexical closures ?
First - class continuations ?
The answer to those questions will tell you things about heap - and stack - allocation , and will also tell you how important it might be to do a continuation - based compiler .
It also tells you how hard your compiler has to work to avoid consing environments unnecessarily .
Lots of sophisticated language designers go with simple closures and avoid full continuations , because full - scale environment capture is hard to do well .
Does your language have an unwind - protect like facility ?
When you design a new language it is tempting to include call / cc because it allows you to do define many common ( and uncommon ) control structures .
On the other hand you want to have a facility that allows you to reliably relinquish resources after you are done .
If you simply try to combine call / cc and unwind - protect , you immediately get the “ impenetrable shield vs. unstoppable force ” problem in your language .
Possible solutions include : no call / cc , weakened unwind - protect , different semantics for call / cc. [ Matthias Holzl ]
How do you handle conditions / errors ?
Return codes or signalling ?
Do you have an unwinding - only model like C++/ Java or do you allow restarts like Dylan / CL ?
If you do the latter do you separate conditions and restarts like Common Lisp or do unify them like Dylan ?
These questions are important , because every programming language has to deal with error conditions , and in many cases the unwinding model is used simply because the language designer is not aware of any other possibilities .
[ Matthias Holzl ]
Do you want the language to be “ object - oriented ” at all , given a broad definition of OO that includes the spectrum from single inheritance single receiver languages as in Java to multiple inheritance multiple receiver languages as in CLOS ?
Do you want to provide genericity through some sort of template scheme ?
Here is how Jonathan Rees has characterized the very fuzzy term “ OO ” :
Encapsulation – the ability to hide the implementation of a type Protection – the inability of the client of a type to detect its implementation , guaranteeing that any changes to an implementation that preserve the behavior of the interface will not break any clients .
This also gives some measure of “ security ” , because things like passwords can't leak out . )
Ad hoc polymorphism – functions and data structures with parameters that can take on values of many different types .
Parametric polymorphism – functions and data structures that parameterize over arbitrary values , such as “ a list of anything ” ) .
ML and Lisp both have this .
Java does n't quite because of its non-Object primitive types .
Everything is an object – all values are objects .
True in Dylan , but not in Java because of its primitive types .
“ All you can do is send a message ” ( AYCDISAM ) =
Actors model – there is no direct manipulation of objects , only communication with ( or invocation of ) them .
The presence of fields in Java violates this .
Specification inheritance = subtyping – there are distinct types known to the language with the property that a value of one type is as good as a value of another for the purposes of type correctness .
An example is Java interface inheritance .
Implementation inheritance / reuse – having written one pile of code , a similar pile ( such as a superset ) can be generated in a controlled manner , that is the code does n't have to be copied and edited .
A limited and peculiar kind of abstraction .
( E.g. Java class inheritance . )
Sum - of - product - of - function pattern – objects are , in effect , restricted to be functions that take as first argument a distinguished method key argument that is drawn from a finite set of simple names .
Some people say Lisp is OO , meaning { 3,4,5,7} .
Some people say Java is OO , meaning { 1,2,3,7,8,9} .
E is supposed to be more OO than Java because it has { 1,2,3,4,5,7,9} and almost has 6 ; 8 ( subclassing ) is seen as antagonistic to E's goals and not necessary for OO .
The conventional Simula 67 - like pattern of class and instance will get you { 1,3,7,9} , which many people take as a definition for OO .
[ Jonathan Rees ]
If the language is object - oriented , do you want it to be class - based or prototype - based ?
[ Steve Dekorte ]
got an object system , do you want it to have first - class objects that exist in the run-time ?
Should the object system extend to include all the way to the primitive types , or do you want to special - case those like Java does ?
Do you want a Smalltalk / Java - style single receiver object orientation , or a CLOS - style multi-method generic function dispatch ?
If the former , do you need some sort of static overloading like C++ has ?
If the latter and performance is important , do you need some sort of Dylan - style “ sealing ” so that you can do some compile - time optimizations ?
Do you want single inheritance , single inheritance with interfaces , multiple inheritance , or a hybrid single inheritance with mixins ?
If you 've got a more static type system , you 'll need to deal with casts .
Do you additionally want auto -conversion ?
If you 've got an object system , how much of a meta - object system do you want to expose ?
Do you want it to be purely reflective , or more than that ?
In Dylan , we separated ' make ' from ' initialize ' , which was a good idea , but do you also want to separate out ' allocate ' , so that you have control over where an object is created , e.g. , in a “ persistent memory ” pool that might be back - ended by a database ?
Do you need hairy CLOS - style method combination , or is a simpler style like we did in Dylan enough ?
Do you care about what Gregor Kiczales calls “ aspects ” , which might change your decision ?
A more general question that relates to the object system , the meta - object system , and a different dimension of the bootstrapping question is : do you want to implement a language which provides a bunch of predefined and fixed constructs ( such as an object system ) or do you want to provide a layered language that implements such constructs in terms of lower - level features in the language ?
The former is probably easier , but the latter can allow very flexible customization , which tends to be traded off against standardization .
Note that even a language with a powerful built - in meta - object system wo n't necessarily allow you to replace that object system with something else , for example , unless the language supports that sort of thing .
[ Anton van Straaten ]
How do you want to do memory management , manual or automatic ( GC ) ?
Do you want to support threading ?
Do you want to roll your own threads or use OS threads ?
Do you want to support massive concurrency like Erlang does ?
The answers to those questions will tell you about aspects of the run-time , memory allocation / GC , and performance .
Oh yeah , it also tells you if you can actually take advantage of the multiple processors sitting in most of the machines we all have .
Do you want Java - style synchronization where it is built in to objects , or should that be handled orthogonally ?
If you have threads and continuations , how do they relate to each other ?
How well do you want to be able to integrate with native libraries ?
This decision affects your memory model , how you plan to represent run-time type info , how function call / return works , how signalling works , etc .
By “ memory model ” , I also mean to include what sorts of objects are boxed or tagged .
( Opinion : the Harlqn / FunO Dylan compiler got it wrong – I think we should have boxed everything , and then concentrated our efforts on box / unbox optimizations .
This would have hugely simplified FFI issues . )
Good integration with native code probably means that you will end up using a conservative collector , and that will effect the semantics of “ finalization ” ( if you have it ) .
Do you want to be able to return multiple values ?
How about &rest arguments ?
These affect function call / return , tail - call elimination , and stack vs. heap allocation optimizations .
What 's your order of evaluation in expressions ?
This affects what sort of optimizations can be safely done .
What compilation model do you want ?
Lots of include files like C [ ++ ] ?
Lots of “ packages ” like Java ?
Whole - worlds like Lisp ?
Separate libraries like Dylan ?
This affects a lot of things , not least of which is the ability to deliver small applications .
It also informs the design of your core run-time .
Is the core run -time tiny like Scheme's ?
Small like Dylan's ?
Huge like Common Lisp's ?
If you like the Common Lisp model , it 's worth looking at EuLisp to see how to re-package it in a more layered way .
Even in a small run-time , you need to get the basic types right .
Are your numeric types “ closed ” ( that is , do they include reals – rationals and irrationals – and complex numbers ) ?
Are your string and character types rich enough to model Unicode ?
Think hard about collections .
How do the following relate to each other : sets , tables , vectors , arrays , lists , sequences , ranges ?
In Dylan , we decided too late having the tail of a list be a “ cons ” was maybe not such a great idea ; what about that ?
How do your collections interact with your threading model ?
Think hard about iteration , especially over collections .
If all collections obey a uniform iteration protocol , it means that you can do things like ' for e in c …'.
Note that if iterators are done in a first - class way , this has performance implications that your compiler needs to worry about .
Do you want some sort of security model built into the language ?
What sort of model do you want to use ?
A simple “ checker ” like the Java VM uses , or a more sophisticated capability - based model .
What syntax do you want ?
Parentheses unaccountably give lots of people hives , but S - expressions make a lot of things much simpler .
Infix syntax is quite nice when it 's done well , but you 've got to get the “ kernel ” of that exactly right if you want your infix macro system ever to be usable .

Barry and Hatto had similar epistolary styles .
The e-mails and letters that emanated from Royston blended formality with faux diffidence .
( “ Dear Mr. Howell , I do not usually write to critics as this , I feel , is a barrier that should not be crossed too often .
However , your review of my Concert Artist set of Mazurkas . . . ” )
Hatto thanked reviewers for their insights , volunteered nuggets of philosophy ( “ So many pianists ruin a perfectly singable and beautiful melodic line by simply sticking on ornaments as if with elastoplast ” ) , and reminisced about decades - old recitals .
Her digressions had a music of their own , punctuated by the tintinnabulation of carefully dropped names ( “ I also became friendly with Annie Fischer ” ; “ I did have the opportunity of playing many of these sonatas to Clara Haskil ” ; “ Rachmaninov did pass on some of his ideas to Nicholas Medtner who allowed me to copy them into my own edition ” ) .
One of Hatto ’s preoccupations , shared by Barry , was the tyranny of the classical - music critical establishment : “ I have always played what I thought was right ( for me ? ) and have taken some censure in my life for so doing .
Mostly , I must say , from English critics ” ; “ Thank you for the kind things that you have said about my own playing and for defending me against some quite unwarranted criticism . ”
Fundamental to the burgeoning interest in Hatto was awe that she could be so tirelessly productive during what should have been her retirement .
Her exploits seemed even more remarkable after Richard Dyer , then the chief music critic of the Boston Globe , interviewed her in the summer of 2005 and wrote an article that began , “ Joyce Hatto must be the greatest living pianist that almost no one has ever heard of . ”
The next paragraph contained a surprising revelation : “ Hatto , now 76 , has not played in public in more than 25 years because of an ongoing battle with cancer .
She was once told that it is ‘ impolite to look ill , ’ and after a critic commented adversely on her appearance , she resolved to stop playing concerts . ”
Dyer described having come upon the Concert Artist Web site more or less inadvertently and finding the Hatto listings ( which had grown to more than a hundred CDs ) .
He contacted Barrington - Coupe and asked , “ Who is she ? ” Barry sent him a sample Hatto CD , “ and I was hooked . ”
By the time Dyer wrote his article , he ’d listened to about a third of her CDs .
“ All of them are excellent , and the best of them document the art of a major musician , ” he wrote .
“ The records are well engineered , and she uses wonderful instruments ; still , her beautiful sound is her own . ”
Boston was far enough from Royston that Dyer settled for a telephone interview .
“ The pianist has a high - pitched , girlish voice , and she speaks with the velocity of one of her Liszt etudes , ” he said of Hatto .
“ She will quote a Shakespeare sonnet and a remark of Muhammad Ali ’s ( ‘ Knock me down , and I will get up immediately ’ ) in the same spoken paragraph . ”
Barry told Dyer , “ She does n’t want to play in public because she never knows when the pain will start , or when it will stop , and she refuses to take drugs .
. . .
I believe the illness has added a third dimension to her playing ; she gets at what is inside the music , what lies behind it . ”
So Hatto ’s illness , ovarian cancer , provided an explanation of sorts for where she had been all those years and burnished the myth of her remarkable renaissance .
On the other hand , its sentimental gloss encouraged a mild backlash , in Yahoo and Usenet postings , from pianophiles who were vaguely suspicious because no major critics had written about her .
In an online review of her recording of Debussy ’s Preludes , Christopher Howell acknowledged this problem : “ I realize that it ’s getting a little embarrassing that this site continues to churn out glowing review after glowing review ( not only from me ) of Joyce Hatto ’s records .
. . .
I almost wish she would make a really bad disk just so I can show I know how to listen .
But so far she has n’t .
. . .
If any reader who buys this or other Hatto disks on the strength of our reviews feels he has been duped , remember we have a bulletin board .
I should very much like to know why only we are pushing these recordings . ”
The first insistent questions about Hatto came in the summer and fall of 2005 , in Internet postings by Peter Lemken , a German conservatory graduate turned artist - manager turned business consultant .
How was it that anyone , much less an infirm septuagenarian , could record such a splendid and voluminous body of work ?
Also , Lemken asked pointedly , who was René Köhler and what was the National Philharmonic - Symphony Orchestra — the conductor and ensemble featured on several Hatto concertos ( Brahms , Rachmaninoff , Prokofiev ) ?
A colorful capsule biography of Köhler ( source : Barry ) eventually appeared online — a Polish - French - German Jew , a survivor of Treblinka with the bad luck to wind up for twenty - five years in the Soviet Gulag — but there was no mention of him or the orchestra in any reference book .
If Köhler and the National Philharmonic - Symphony Orchestra were phantoms , then what about Hatto ?
That nebulous query became the topic of more than one online discussion .
It was n’t so much an expression of disbelief in Hatto ’s existence as it was obstinacy from live - performance purists , who argue that recordings are an unreliable measure of any musician ’s true qualities , given the manipulations permitted by studio technology .
Still , the over - all discourse remained resolutely pro-Hatto .
In light of her health crisis , her adherents found Lemken ’s contrariness offensively callous .
Such skepticism seemed even more impertinent after a pair of reputable witnesses vouched for the fact that , literally and figuratively , Joyce Hatto was the real thing .
Ates Orga , a music critic and historian , had written program notes for some of her London recitals during the seventies .
“ Her playing struck me as big - hearted and truthful , adventurous yet with time for finesse , ” he later recalled .
He interviewed her at a hotel in Cambridge in February , 2005 , and in early 2006 MusicWeb published his seven - thousand - word profile , along with an even lengthier account of her recording career , including critiques of selected works .
Orga depicted , as had Burnett James and Richard Dyer , a charismatic woman with vivid memories of her experiences among music - world luminaries and a keen attentiveness to the stylistic distinctions of various pianists .
Orga essentially sidestepped the René Köhler enigma , implying that he was n’t sure what to believe .
( “ A survivor of the Holocaust gone missing in the murky wastelands and unspoken history of Cold War Europe , René Köhler . . . ” )
About Hatto ’s musicianship Orga expressed no equivocation : “ Even when some of her decisions , her occasional urgencies , are not to my taste , there ’s a rightness , an honesty , to her recorded playing .
. . .
I feel in safe hands .
. . .
Tone , phrasing , projection .
Articulation , pedalling , dynamics .
Style , short - term shaping , long - term architecture .
The ability to speak in music — eloquently , rhetorically , passionately , murmuringly . ”
In the summer of 2005 , Jeremy Nicholas , an actor and critic , had interviewed Hatto and Barry in the same Cambridge hotel and come away with impressions almost identical to Orga’s .
He felt “ an instant rapport ” with the couple ; Barry , he thought , had a “ fantastic knowledge of pianists , fantastic taste . ”
As they spoke , however , with a tape recorder running , Nicholas knew that writing about Hatto would be problematic , because she had no aptitude for linear conversation .
“ She was kind of daffy , endearingly scatterbrained , with this butterfly mind , ” he told me .
“ I had a list of prepared questions .
Like ‘ What did your father do ?
Were your parents musical , did they have money ?
When did you actually make your début ? ’
Pretty simple , direct questions , but after a couple of sentences she ’d go off reminiscing .
Very hard to pin down .
Very good on her playing in the nineteen - fifties but not very good on the later part of her life .
Talked very fast .
Tremendous energy in her voice .
Terribly enthusiastic . ”
Nicholas , a biographer of the pianist and composer Leopold Godowsky ( 1870 - 1938 ) — whose Studies on Chopin ’s Études are among the most difficult piano music ever written — had been astonished to learn that Joyce Hatto had recorded all fifty - three of the Studies .
Only three other artists , all men , had done the same .
Before meeting Hatto , Nicholas listened to her recordings of Chopin ’s Études , the foundation of the Godowsky variations , and thought that they were “ just about the best I ’ve ever heard . ”
He had a comparable reaction to her interpretation of the Godowsky .
Nicholas ’s encounter with Hatto resulted in two articles — one in International Piano , in January , 2006 , and one in Gramophone , two months later .
A feature in Gramophone ( “ the world ’s unrivaled authority on classical music since 1923 ” ) was bound to draw attention , especially given that Nicholas declared , “ I have no hesitation in saying that Joyce Hatto is one of the greatest pianists I have ever heard . ”
He not only introduced Hatto to a wider audience ; he effectively put on notice the editors of Gramophone , who in subsequent issues published consistently favorable , at times elated , reviews of her CDs .
Because , as Nicholas noted , she had “ another 20 (! ) in preparation , ” fascination with Hatto seemed destined to increase , and endure , well into the future .
Hatto died , of cancer , on June 29 , 2006 , at the age of seventy - seven .
Obituaries and tributes recycled the most striking superlatives and offered up a few new ones ( “ as completely satisfying a pianist as anyone in the history of recorded music , ” “ a national treasure ” ) .
Her funeral took place eleven days later , at a crematory in Cambridge , a secular ceremony orchestrated , in every sense , by Barrington - Coupe .
Twenty or so mourners listened to music — Bach , Brahms , Chopin , Debussy — from a Hatto sampler CD issued by Concert Artist a few months earlier .
Humility was the theme of Barry ’s prepared remarks , beginning with a rhetorical apology to his wife that a service was being held in the first place , contrary to her wish to avoid showy valedictory gestures at “ your final public appearance . ”
To those who had sent condolences , whether they had met her or not , she was “ simply ‘ Joyce . ’ ” As an artist and a teacher , he said , “ she would say . . . there is God , the composer , and then you .
Nothing comes between composer and the listener .
With Joyce you will seek vainly for ostentation , no grand ‘ Hatto ’ moments , simply the music .
. . .
For her , ‘ Hatto ’ was simply not the important one . ”
Yet , even as Hatto was being eulogized , fresh suspicions were being voiced by Gramophone readers .
In the July issue , Nicholas responded indignantly to unspecified “ letters , phone calls , and a plethora of blogs from people who a ) think I am in the pay of her record label , b ) doubt that the recordings are the work of just one pianist , c ) are sure that the recordings are edited performances of her pupils , d ) suspect that Miss Hatto has never been ill and could not possibly have survived cancer for 25 years , e ) that the whole thing is a scam . ”
He invited “ anyone who has any evidence whatsoever of fraud , deception , or similar activity related to Miss Hatto and her record company ” to come forward , with the proviso that such evidence “ must stand up in a court of law . ”
The day before Hatto ’s funeral , the usually even - tempered Ernst Lumpe confronted Peter Lemken during an exchange in the newsgroup rec.music.classical.recordings .
The general topic was live performance versus studio recording , and Lemken , ever the skeptic , asked whether anyone had ever recorded a Hatto live performance .
The gist of Lumpe ’s reply , written in German , was that Lemken had some nerve .
Amateur recordings of Hatto in concert , he said , circulated privately , and he personally owned a performance of “ Elgar ’s First Symphony in the two - handed piano transcription by Sigfrid Karg - Elert , recorded in Cambridge in 1989 ” — the unreleased tape that Barry had sent him after his visit to Royston .
Did this information satisfy Lemken ?
Nein .
If it had n’t been published , it did n’t count .
Then , on January 22nd of this year , a participant in the newsgroup who identified himself as Seth Horus — a pseudonym that referred to ancient Egyptian mythology — posted this : “ After hearing so much about Joyce Hatto , I started purchasing some of her recordings .
While nothing I have heard is bad ( in fact , I am glad I bought these CDs ) , I have noticed something eerie : that the pianist playing the Mozart sonatas cannot be the pianist playing Prokofiev or the pianist playing Albéniz .
I have the distinct feeling of being the victim of some sort of hoax .
Does anyone else share these feelings ?
What is actually known about the artist and the circumstances ?
I looked on the Web and all I can find is some sort of official story , nothing independent . ”
Much of the ensuing discussion was the highbrow equivalent of trash talk , a volleying of erudite insults between Hatto ’s most ardent boosters and Lemken and various agnostics .
The vituperation lasted for days , and the eavesdroppers included not only the usual hobbyists ( as well as , presumably , Barrington - Coupe ) but also a group of scholars at the Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music ( CHARM ) , at the University of London .
For more than a year , a musicologist named Nicholas Cook and a postdoctoral fellow , Craig Sapp , had been immersed in a comparative study of performances of selected Chopin mazurkas , using software that depicted the similarities between recordings with bright - colored geometric shapes .
Although Cook and Sapp knew nothing about Hatto , they included her in the study because she , along with about thirty other pianists , had recorded the complete mazurkas .
They entered into their database two tracks from her CD “ Chopin : The Mazurkas , ” which , according to an accompanying booklet from Concert Artist , had been recorded in April , 1997 , and March , 2004 .
On the CD slipcase , the latter date was changed to December , 2005 , but that discrepancy was trivial in light of what a digital analysis revealed : the Hatto version and a 1988 recording by Eugen Indjic , a Belgrade - born soloist , were identical .
As Cook later told the BBC , his initial reaction was “ prima facie , one of these people does n’t exist . ”
A Google search confirmed that both pianists were demonstrably real — Hatto had existed , and Indjic had recently played in Poland — which left the unavoidable implication that one was a plagiarist .
The culprit seemed obvious , but Cook and Sapp were n’t eager to broadcast the news .
For one thing , British libel laws would have placed on them the burden of proof that a fraud had been perpetrated .
Despite their caution , Cook and Sapp underestimated the potential repercussions .
During a CHARM staff seminar on January 26th , when they discreetly reported on their research , a stunned colleague who had been monitoring the online debate proclaimed , “ You ’re sitting on a volcano . ”
Cook and Sapp considered getting in touch with an editor at Gramophone .
Instead , they spent a couple of weeks writing and circulating a draft article titled “ Purely Coincidental ?
Joyce Hatto and Chopin ’s Mazurkas . ”
They were still deciding how to proceed when , in mid-February , corroboration materialized an ocean away .
On February 12th , in Mount Vernon , New York , Brian Ventura received a package that he had been anticipating for a long time .
An avocational pianist , Ventura worked on Wall Street and had a fifty - minute commute , which he usually spent listening to an iPod .
He had learned of Hatto not long before she died , and in the months that followed he closely read reviews of her recordings until he knew which ones he wanted to own .
Placing an order turned out to be more of a chore than he expected , but he eventually established a friendly correspondence with Barrington - Coupe .
Weeks passed , nothing came in the mail , and he wrote to Barry , who explained that the shipment had been delayed because one selection was unavailable .
So Ventura asked Barry to substitute Liszt ’s “ Transcendental Studies . ”
Ventura unwrapped the “ Studies ” disk first .
He placed it in his computer ’s disk drive and , through Apple ’s iTunes software , connected to Gracenote , an Internet database of CDs .
According to Gracenote , which identifies a CD by the durations of its individual tracks , Ventura had loaded the “ Transcendental Studies , ” but the pianist was a Hungarian named László Simon .
László Simon ?
Ventura weighed the possibilities : Gracenote might be mistaken ( mislabellings had been known to occur ) , or someone named László Simon had recorded the same music with precisely the same track timings .
When he listened during his commute the next morning , he felt “ from the very first piece , it was a remarkable recording . ”
On his office computer , he went to Amazon.com and found a listing for Simon ’s record , including one - minute clips for most of the tracks .
“ I started listening , ” he recalled .
“ Going back and forth between the iPod and the Amazon clips for individualistic things — sudden changes in dynamics or ornaments , or a cadenzalike passage where the performer has more leeway in the interpretation .
In slower pieces , it ’s easier to hear subtleties .
I was ninety - five per cent certain that most of the tracks were the same .
So I did n’t know what to do .
If she was the one that was copying , part of me did n’t want it to come out .
The whole Joyce Hatto story seemed so terrific you just wanted it to be true .
I did n’t want to bring down the story . ”
Within seventy - two hours , the truth had not so much come out as exploded .
Ventura had sent an e-mail to Jed Distler , a composer and reviewer who contributed to Gramophone and had published positive Hatto reviews in the online publication ClassicsToday .
Distler later wrote , “ After careful comparison of the actual Simon performances to the Hatto , it appeared to me that 10 out of 12 tracks showed remarkable similarity in terms of tempi , accents , dynamics , balances , etc . ”
When Distler next tested a CD of Rachmaninoff ’s Second and Third Piano Concertos — ostensibly Hatto playing with the elusive René Köhler and his equally elusive National Philharmonic - Symphony Orchestra — Gracenote identified the soloist as Yefim Bronfman , accompanied by the Philharmonia Orchestra , conducted by Esa - Pekka Salonen .
Distler reported his findings to Ventura via e-mail , and sent copies to the editors of Gramophone and ClassicsToday and to Jeremy Nicholas and two other Gramophone critics who had championed Hatto .
He also wrote to Barrington - Coupe — whom he had met in London the previous fall — and Barry “ quickly replied , claiming not to know what had happened , and to be as puzzled as I was . ”
James Inverne , the editor of Gramophone , enlisted an audio expert , Andrew Rose , who examined the waveforms of the Simon and the Hatto recordings .
The visual match was exact , and Rose knew the result even before listening .
Ten of the twelve tracks of the Concert Artist “ Transcendental Studies ” were “ without a shadow of a doubt ” performed by Simon , though the timing of one track had been subtly altered — sped up by 0.02 per cent .
Distler had sensed that another track was n’t lifted from the Simon recording , and Rose confirmed this : it had been appropriated from a 1993 release by the Japanese pianist Minoru Nojima .
Again , the timing had been tweaked , but the waveform revealed the truth .
“ No pianist who ’s ever lived could replicate a performance to anything like the degree of accuracy heard here , ” Rose wrote .
“ It ’s simply not humanly possible , whatever the degree of Ms. Hatto ’s claimed virtuosity . ”
On the evening of February 15th , Gramophone published the story online , appending a report from Rose that rendered the evidence unassailable .
When Cook and Sapp heard the news the next morning , they knew that CHARM could freely disclose its discovery of the larceny of Indjic ’s Chopin mazurkas .
In the days that followed , Rose continued to analyze recordings and post updates : The Rachmaninoff concertos were not Hatto but Bronfman .
And had Hatto , Köhler , and the National Philharmonic - Symphony Orchestra collaborated on the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 ?
No , but Vladimir Ashkenazy , Bernard Haitink , and the Vienna Philharmonic had .
Each new revelation increased the suspicion that every Concert Artist release credited to Joyce Hatto within the past decade was the creation of “ Joyce Hatto . ”
In the Usenet and Yahoo groups , critics who had been most enamored of Hatto found themselves , predictably , objects of opprobrium .
( Tantalizingly , shortly before Gramophone ’s public disclosure someone calling himself Simon Lasso — in hindsight , an obvious play on László Simon — had warned participants on rec.music.classical .recordings ,
“ Some of you are going to be looking very silly indeed over the coming weeks . ” )
Among shell - shocked Hattophiles , collective healing took the form of a debunking blitz , a competitive quest to unlock the mysteries of the ersatz oeuvre .
Within ten days , twenty - three identifications had been made .
( By last week , the tally was up to sixty - eight . )
As with the Liszt “ Transcendental Studies ” and the Godowsky Chopin Studies , many CDs had been cobbled together from multiple sources , which meant that , unless Barrington - Coupe ( or a co-conspirator , if any existed ) came clean , the effort to unearth the genuine provenances could take years , and was still bound to fall short .
For instance , no one has yet identified the pianist in the glorious recording of the “ Mephisto Waltz ” — assuming ( the default assumption ) that it was n’t Hatto herself .
There has been an understandable public outcry against the RIAA ’s attempts to more than triple the sound recording copyright royalties on Internet radio .
( See Save Internet Radio from Corporate Money Grab )
One solution proposed by Webcasters is to just not play RIAA - member songs under the assumption that then they do n’t have to pay the royalty to the RIAA ’s collection body , SoundExchange ; Webcasters would then just pay the independent artist the royalty .
This sounds just and fair because it is .
However , the RIAA is not about being just and fair .
The game is rigged and the RIAA has rigged it in their favor .
The strategy of playing only non-RIAA songs wo n't work though because the RIAA has secured the right to collect royalties on all songs regardless of who controls the copyright .
RIAA operates under the assumption that they will collect the royalties for the " sound recording copyright " and that the artists who own their own copyright will go to SoundExchange to collect at a later date .
Look at the information on SoundExchange.com ( RIAA created SoundExchange ) and see how it works .
The RIAA has secured legal authority to administer a compulsory license that covers all recorded music .
" The recent U.S. Copyright Office ruling regarding webcasting designated SoundExchange to collect and distribute to all nonmembers as well as its members .
The Librarian of Congress issued his decision with rates and terms to govern the compulsory license for webcasters ( Internet - only radio ) and simulcastors ( retransmissions ) . " ( http://soundexchange.com/faq.html#b4)
" SRCOs ( sound recording copyright owners ) are subject to a compulsory license for the use of their music ... SoundExchange was established to administer the collection and distribution of royalties from such compulsory licenses taken by noninteractive streaming services that use satellite , cable or Internet methods of distribution . "
( http://soundexchange.com/faq.html#a4)
SoundExchange ( the RIAA ) considers any digital performance of a song as falling under their compulsory license .
If any artist records a song , SoundExchange has the right to collect royalties for its performance on Internet radio .
Artists can offer to download their music for free , but they cannot offer their songs to Internet radio for free .
( http://soundexchange.com/faq.html#a7)
So how it works is that SoundExchange collects money through compulsory royalties from Webcasters and holds onto the money .
If a label or artist wants their share of the money , they must become a member of SoundExchange and pay a fee to collect their royalties ( http://soundexchange.com/faq.html#b6).
But , and this is a big " but , " you only get royalties if you own the sound recording copyright .
If you are signed to a major label , chances are you do n’t .
Even if you do own the copyright to your own recording of your own song , SoundExchange will collect Internet radio royalties for your song even if you do n’t want them to do so .
Go to the SoundExchange site : http://plays.soundexchange.com/... and take a look at the hundreds of indie labels for whom SoundExchange claims they have collected royalties .
Enter some of those label names on http://www.riaaradar.com/... and notice how few are actually members of the RIAA .
Contact the label and ask if they are a member of RIAA and they almost certainly are n’t and may not even be aware that SoundExchange is collecting royalty fees on their music .
And what exactly is SoundExchange doing with the money they have collected for those hundreds of labels that must have thousands of songs ???

Folks , there ’s nothing that annoys me more than when something I agree with was researched in what looks to me to be just a touch on the shoddy side .
I found an article ( popular on Reddit as well as at least one person sending it to me ) , that shows a British research group , ORB , calculating 1.2 million deaths in Iraq .
When those responsible for the American war in Iraq face a public reckoning for their colossal crimes , the weekend of September 15 - 16 , 2007 will be an important piece of evidence against them .
On Friday , September 14 there were brief press reports of a scientific survey by the British polling organization ORB , which resulted in an estimate of 1.2 million violent deaths in Iraq since the US invasion .
That is a baffling number .
That ’s simply violent deaths , which would mean that roughly 5 % or more of the country has died violently since March of 2003 .
To put it in perspective , imagine if 15 million Americans had died in the same time period , or roughly 9710 people killed violently per day .
Bloodshed on that level is simply staggering .
However , the methodology of this is a bit… questionable .
Looking over on ORB ’s website , we see how this number was tabulated .
In conjunction with their Iraqi fieldwork agency a representative sample of 1,499 adults aged 18 + answered the following question :- QHow many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age ) ?
Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof .
None 78 %
One 16 %
Two 5 %
Three 1 %
Four or more 0.002 % Given that from the 2005 census there are a total of 4,050,597 households this data suggests a total of 1,220,580 deaths since the invasion in 2003 .
So then .
The ORB did n’t check with the Iraqi morgues or have on hand records of actual documented deaths .
Like the 600,000 estimate from a year ago , this figure was made by polling a handful of people and then extrapolating the data across the entire population .
I ’m not saying the number is wrong , I ’m simply saying that to look at this as evidence that the American media is hiding a report that “ shows ” over a million Iraqis have been killed is a bit misleading .
Take it in contrast to the IBC Project , which deals solely with provable , documented violent deaths and pegs the number at just under 80,000 .
Given that there are slews of hidden graves littered about Iraq as well as the fallibility of morgues releasing figures when so many have admitted to being backed up and unable to deal with the bodies coming in , I have no doubts that the IBC ’s estimate is far on the low side .
However I ’d also wager that the ORB ’s is on the high , indeed the earlier estimate had a margin of error of nearly 30 % so imagine what this one is .
As with so much in life , the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle .
I do n’t even suggest forming conclusions based on polls of pure opinion unless they ’re put within context of others ( i.e. Bush ’s approval rating being so dismal is only believable because the dozens of polls are so consistent ) .
Taking one poll that extrapolates body counts of all things is not a good idea .
It definitely lets you say “ hey , the official count of less than a hundred thousand is probably WAY low , ” but suddenly claiming the massacre is on level with Rwanda and Sudan is jumping the gun just a tad .
So please , I ’m beggin ’ you guys , if you find something like this , find out where it came from .
Do n’t take something like this and say “ Over a million Iraqis have been killed so far !
Why is no one outraged ?? ” unless you ’ve seen how the number was tabulated and have concluded it to be accurate .
Star this if you like it !
Star this if you like it !
Star this if you like it !
No wonder we saw so many trucks rolled over on the side of the road !
Daily
Show takes on the Bush administration : ' This is just too easy '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday June 6 , 2007 Print This Email This
When Jon Stewart opened Tuesday 's Daily Show by announcing that " Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby ... is going to the hoosegow , " cheers broke out .
" Libby received his sentence in spite of character reference letters from names like John Bolton , Paul Wolfowitz , Donald Rumsfeld , and Henry Kissinger , " said Stewart , " or , as they 're known , Those Four Assholes .
John , Paul , Don , and Henry .
Like a boy band but without the credibility . "
Stewart then turned to the indictment of Rep. Willian Jefferson ( D - LA ) , saying , " On the downside , Jefferson faces 235 years in prison .
On the upside , now we know what it takes for the federal government to pay some attention to a black man from New Orleans . "
Stewart also mentioned Fox News ' presentation of the Jefferson story accompanied by footage of " House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , who is , and this is fascinating , a completely different person . "
Finally , Stewart ran clips of prominent conservatives bashing the Bush administration 's immigration proposals and Bush criticizing them in return for " empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our fellow citizens . "
" This is too easy , " grinned Stewart , before playing a collage of statements from Bush and other administration figures trying to frighten their fellow citizens .
Whispers of War – The British World War II rumour campaign
By Lee Richards
The humiliating defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France in the summer of 1940 was perhaps Britain 's darkest hour of the Second World War .
But the defeat was quickly and successfully spun into a heroic retreat after the miraculous evacuation of the greater part of the BEF from the beaches of Dunkirk .
Britain was now fighting alone and facing a Nazi invasion .
The new government under Churchill 's inspiring and resolute leadership brought fresh impetus and resolve to fight to the bitter end .
During a speech to the German Reichstag on 19 July 1940 , Hitler gave Britain one last chance to make peace .
Sefton Delmer , the future head and mastermind of British black propaganda , was just about to make his debut broadcast to Germany on the BBC when he heard the Führer 's " last appeal to reason " .
Spontaneously , without governmental approval , Delmer tersely rejected any notion of a compromise peace .
" Herr Hitler , " Delmer announced , " you have on occasion in the past consulted me as to the mood of the British public .
So permit me to render your Excellency this little service once again tonight .
Let me tell you what we here in Britain think of this appeal of yours to what you are pleased to call our reason and common sense .
Herr Führer and Reichskanzler , we hurl it right back at you , right in your evil smelling teeth … "
The unofficial rejection upset a few Members of Parliament but Delmer 's attitude was indicative of the new mindset in the country .
Britain's main priority now was preparation for the expected invasion .
All and every means were explored to defend the country .
Psychological warfare had an important role to play in exaggerating Britain 's defence capabilities and to persuade the German invading force that they were undertaking an impossible and perilous task which would only result in their annihilation .
The spreading of " inspired rumours " would be one method utilised to deceive and depress the enemy .
Rumours are a perfect medium for unacknowledgeable clandestine propaganda and deception .
They are incredibly hard to trace and near impossible to prove their origin ; they can spread like the proverbial wildfire .
There is no one in the world who does not relish passing on gossip or a titbit of " inside " information .
Even in today 's news saturated world the populations of the Western democracies , who believe they are more enlightened and less gullible than ever before , still fall for the most ridiculous and often abhorrent conspiracy theories .
Just examine those who sincerely believe JFK was assassinated by the CIA or , perhaps , the Mafia , that an Alien flying saucer crashed at Roswell in 1947 , that the US moon landing was an elaborate hoax , and even more far - fetched and absurd stories like the CIA orchestrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and that Princess Diana 's death in a car wreck in Paris was not the result of a speeding drunk driver but an MI6 murder plot on Prince Charles ' orders !
Are these conspiracy theories just self - generating stories from the imaginative minds of a cynical public or are they propagated or assisted by hostile intelligence services ?
Who can ever know ?
But what it does illustrate is that when there is huge public interest in an event with strong emotional appeal and a lack of verifiable facts , the most fanciful stories can flourish and be given credence .
In the wartime world of 1940 with strictly controlled and curtailed news media , the rumour potentially was a very valuable and potent weapon in influencing public opinion .
All warring nations impressed upon their own people not to pass on gossip and hearsay .
Across Britain posters reinforced the message with such famous phrases as " Tittle - tattle lost the battle " , " Keep mum , she 's not so dumb " , and " Careless talk costs lives " .
In Germany a poster illustrated how a " latrine rumour " passed onto one person at 2 p.m. would rapidly spread , so by 3:30 p.m. thousands of people had heard the scandalous story .
The artist , Paul Weber 's famous illustration , " the Rumour " showing an inquisitive snake smashing its way through an office block was also used to persuade the German Volk not to spread tales .
In the summer of 1940 , as the remnants of the BEF regrouped in England and began intensive construction of anti-invasion defences , Department EH established the Underground Propaganda Committee ( UPC ) to formulate , under the tightest secrecy , an anti-invasion whispering campaign .
The rumours they generated were codenamed " Sibs " – taken from the Latin word sibilare , meaning to hiss – partly for security reasons and partly for amusement .
Before Dunkirk only a few sibs had been developed and on an entirely ad - hoc basis .
The first rumour devised suggested that U - boat losses were much larger than the German government was prepared to admit with only two out of every three boats returning .
The rumour was passed by Electra House to Colonel Vivian at Bletchley Park , aka Station X , for dissemination by undisclosed means on 10 December 1939 .
This was followed up in the following February with the story that there had been serious mishaps to U - boats undergoing trials at Wilhelmshaven , owing to sabotage in the Deschimag shipyard .
The U - boat service would be a major recurrent target for British black propaganda throughout the rest of the war .
Another early rumour claimed that due to the ration situation in Germany , doctors had orders to do away with hospitalised old and permanently disabled patients .
In the spring , three more fabricated stories were spread by Bletchley Park and by agents of SIS 's Section D. The first was an economic warfare rumour which asserted that certain Germans who had made a habit of noting the serial numbers of banknotes had discovered two notes with the same numbers .
The implication being that the Reichsbank was disguising massive economic inflation by printing twice as many banknotes and was attempting to hide the fact by repeating serial numbers .
Another rumour suggested that the receipt of large food parcels from abroad by Germans was being taken by the Gestapo as proof that the recipients had money in a foreign country .
As the Battle of Britain got underway the UPC 's work became more organised and more urgent .
Their brief was to mislead the German General Staff into thinking they have to take precautions against nonexistent weapons and to circulate news to the detriment of the morale of the German invasion force .
The first anti-invasion rumours were prepared in mid-July , several of which claimed that Britain had new and decisive weapons waiting to be unleashed .
One alleged weapon was a high - capacity light machine gun with a rapid rate of fire and special sights to give it great accuracy .
It was particularly effective at shooting down dive - bombers , was the claim .
When tested in France in one day it brought down twelve dive - bombers and the next day two more before breakfast .
To help the story spread photographs of a modified BREN gun with mocked - up sights would be accidentally released to the press without comment .
A new deadly mine of terrific power specially designed for destroying several landing - craft at once was another of Britain 's imaginary secret weapons .
The UPC recommended that more flavour could be given to the story if photographs were released of soldiers lowering disguised manhole covers on ropes into the sea from small boats .
This could be continually repeated along the coastline under Luftwaffe aerial observation .
If any enemy troops were lucky enough to actually get ashore then other special mines on the beaches controlled by " secret rays " should finish them off .
But if not , the trip wires armed with all sorts of lethal devices would .
The " ultimate rumour " suggested that Britain had an immense number of armoured vehicles capable of charging down transport planes on the ground .
The truth , however , was that there were practically no armoured vehicles of any kind .
In the countryside a number of post boxes on the corner of road junctions were sealed off by the Post Office .
A rumour to explain this was circulated .
The post boxes have been filled with explosives and would be detonated if German troops were ever to pass through the junction .
To deter parachutists , another sib contended that , overhead telegraph wires included a high - tension cable designed to electrocute any descending paratroopers unlucky enough to get caught up in them .
One of the more realistic tales revealed that huge imports of Thompson submachine guns were arriving at British ports and were being despatched rapidly across the country .
What these anti-invasion rumours painfully illustrate is how under - equipped and ill prepared for war the British army was in the summer of 1940 .
At the Underground Propaganda Committee meeting on Friday , 27 September 1940 probably the most famous and wide reaching rumour of the war was submitted .
The essence of the rumour was that Britain had a secret weapon which could set the sea on fire , engulfing enemy invading barges on their cross Channel trip .
The text of the actual rumour is more explicit :
The British have a new weapon .
It is a mine to be dropped from aircraft .
In distinction from other mines , however , it does not explode , but spreads a very thin film of highly inflammable and volatile liquid over the surface of the water for an enormous area .
The mine 's further action then ignites this liquid provoking a terrible flame .
According to John Baker
White in his autobiography of his wartime career , The Big Lie , he submitted this rumour to the UPC after a visit to St. Margaret 's Bay , near Dover , on the southeast coast of England .
He witnessed a demonstration of a genuine anti-invasion weapon installed across the beaches .
Pipes had been buried under the beach down to the low water mark and where designed like a wheat field irrigation system but instead of spraying water onto crops their purpose was to shower invading enemy troops with burning gasoline .
The demonstration was highly impressive with enormous flames shooting out across the beaches with masses of billowing black acrid smoke .
In reality the under - the - beach flame - thrower may have been a lame duck being easily put out of action with a few mortar rounds .
But Baker
White noticed the psychological effect upon the under - strength troops defending the area ; it certainly boosted their morale .
What if there was a weapon capable of actually igniting a wide expanse of sea , he conjectured .
There was no such weapon but if the Germans could be persuaded to believe there was , it could have a real adverse effect on the morale of the invasion force and additionally sustain the morale of the defending British troops and civilians on the home front .
The rumour he submitted to the UPC was sent for clearance to the Inter - Services Security Board ( ISSB ) .
This board was responsible for clearing rumours and had power of veto over any of a military nature which might inadvertently be a real security risk .
The rumours would then be scrutinised by the Joint Intelligence Committee ( JIC ) .
Rumours of a purely propaganda nature had to be submitted to the Foreign Office instead .
This long - winded vetting procedure was a constant headache for the UPC and they unsuccessfully requested on several occasions for it to be dropped .
Very many of the rumours suggested by the UPC were blocked either by the ISSB or Foreign Office and probably , considering their often outlandish nature , quite rightly so .
But Baker
White 's " setting the sea on fire " rumour was given the go - ahead albeit with the unenthusiastic comment , " No objection , but we think it a pretty poor effort . "
At first the story did not make much of an impact .
Then , according to Baker White , came " two wonderful strokes of luck " .
The RAF was bombing the German invasion barges in Calais with incendiaries and on one occasion was " fortunate " to hit a battalion of soldiers conducting a practice invasion exercise .
The incendiaries inflicted terrible burns on many of the soldiers .
The second piece of good luck was that the wounded soldiers were sent to Paris for specialised medical treatment .
The rumour had already been disseminated in Paris .
The arrival of the badly burnt soldiers fuelled the flames , so to speak !
Burnt corpses also washed ashore in Northern France .
Afterwards , Baker
White says , the French resistance would amuse themselves by pretending to warm their hands on German soldiers sitting next to them in cafes and restaurants .
In Britain as well there were numerous stories circulating of burnt bodies in German Army uniforms being washed up along the English southeast coast .
These stories were almost certainly triggered by a UPC supporting rumour which claimed that the Germans had attempted several small - scale invasions , all of which had been beaten off with devastating losses to them .
" In fact none are alive to tell .
Thousands of floating German corpses have been washed ashore , " the rumour concluded .
Rumours of abortive German invasions became so pervasive that several concerned members of the British public enquired of the Ministry of Information what they were intending to do to counter such dangerous gossip .
For example , the Ministry received the following letter as late as January 1942 :
Throughout England and Wales there is a story being told of how Germany tried to invade us nearly two years ago .
They were defeated by the RAF and the Fleet .
Oil was thrown on the briny , and was set alight and the barges were all burnt .
Thousands of scorched bodies of the enemy drifted ashore and were buried on the South coast .
When it is pointed out that your Ministry could use this defeat for propaganda purposes , it is then pointed out that its announcement would increase the complacency of the British public .
I suggest that an authoritative denial should be made of the story .
The Ministry of Information replied that they did not think the rumour was very widespread and that an authoritative denial would have the undesirable effect of increasing its prevalence .
Perhaps that was the wrong decision as the story of burnt German soldiers washing ashore after an abortive invasion attempt of England is a rumour that is still believed by some to this very day .
The first evidence obtained that stories of Britain 's new fiery secret weapon were circulating amongst German troops came from a shot - down Luftwaffe pilot .
During interrogation he admitted that it was common knowledge amongst his squadron that the English had burning sea defences .
Delmer claims the rumour was also planted on Admiral Canaris , the head of the Abwehr , the German military intelligence organisation .
It seems the German High Command were taken - in as experiments were conducted to flameproof their invasion fleet using sheets of asbestos .
When a flame - proofed barge , laden with troops , was tested by sailing it into a burning pool of gasoline , all on board were incinerated .
This further added to the credibility of the rumour and gave additional supporting evidence as more charred bodies washed ashore .
The CBS correspondent William L Shirer comments on rumours of Britain 's burning sea defences in his book , Berlin Diary : The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent , 1934 - 1941 .
His diary entry for 18th September 1940 records a story circulating in Geneva saying that Britain has a new type of wireless - directed torpedo capable of spreading flaming oil across water .
The intriguing part is this variation of the rumour was supposedly in circulation over a week before the rumour was actually concocted by the UPC .
Nonetheless , it is not inconceivable that the UPC later supplied certain rumours to Shirer as filler for his book .
To give the burning sea story further publicity more open forms of propaganda were also utilised .
Baker
White mentions that fake German leave passes were parodied offering a one - way trip to England and dropped over France .
He is probably referring to propaganda leaflet EH.453 , Gutschein berechtigt zur einmaligen Fahrt nach Engelland ( " Voucher – good for a single journey to England " ) .
This was produced in the style of a travel ticket .
All German troops were invited to make use of the ticket for a single trip to England and were promised " a most cordial reception , with music .
Fireworks , free swims , steam baths , and many other entirely novel forms of entertainment are provided .
Visitors will find their welcome so overwhelming that few are expected ever to return home . "
It was stamped in red , " Valid for next Summer ! "
The ticket was disseminated by the RAF's ' M ' Balloon Unit between 16 to 31 December 1940 with the intended targets being Holland , Dijon , and the coastlines of North - western France and Belgium .
In a famous BBC broadcast by Sefton Delmer , made before he joined the Government 's black propaganda department , he mocked the Germans about their chances of launching a successful invasion .
He recounts the broadcast in Black Boomerang :
" We English , as you know , are notoriously bad at languages , " said I , talking my most impeccable German , " and so it will be best , meine Herren Engellandfahrer , 11 if you learn a few useful English phrases before visiting us .
" For your first lesson we will take :
" Die Kanalüberfahrt … the Channel crossing , the Chan - nel cros-sing . "
" Now just repeat after me :
" Das Boot sinkt ... the boat is sinking , the boat is sin-king ;
" Das Wasser ist kalt … the water is cold .
Sehr kalt … very cold . "
" Now , I will give you a verb that should come in useful .
Again please repeat after me :
" Ich brenne … I burn ;
" Du brennst … you burn ;
" Er brennt … he burns ;
" Wir brennen … we burn ;
" Ihr brennt … you are burning . "
" Yes , meine Herren , in English , a rather practical language , we use the same word ' you ' for both the singular and the plural :
" Ihr brennt ... you are burning ;
" Sie brennen … they burn . "
" And if I may be allowed to suggest a phrase : ' Der SS - Sturmführer brennt auch ganz schön ...'
The SS Captain is also burning quite nicely , the SS Captain is al - so bur - ning quite nice - ly ! "
This amusing dialogue was later adapted for use as an aerial propaganda leaflet , ( EH.473 ) , titled Wir fahren gegen Engelland , taken from the popular Nazi war song " We Journey against England " .
The leaflet was subtitled " the little invasion phrasebook " and listed phrases , translated into French and Dutch , which the German invasion fleet might find useful .
The leaflet also promises an English pocket phrasebook , handed out free of charge to every German traveller to England on his arrival in an English prison camp .
The first list gives phrases helpful before the invasion , including such demoralising sentences as :
The sea is big , cold , stormy .
Can you lend me a safety - jacket – a life belt ?
What do you charge for swimming lessons ?
How many invasion trips do I need to win the Iron Cross 1st Class ?
Next useful phrases for the actual invasion are given and include :
We are seasick .
Where is the basin ?
Is that a bomb , a torpedo , a shell , a mine ?
Our ship is capsizing , sinking , burning , exploding !
Our section , platoon , company , battalion , regiment , is drowning !
… and to further the burning sea rumour :
The sea here has such a smell of oil .
Here even the water is burning !
See how beautiful the Captain is burning .
Charles – Willie – Fred – John – Abraham is burnt to ashes – drowned , minced - up by the ship 's propeller .
We must turn back !
We journey against England !
The leaflet finishes with phrases suitable for after the abortive invasion , ending with :
We journeyed against England .
We want to go home !
Nearly a million copies of the leaflet were dropped by RAF aircraft and balloons across the French and Belgian coastlines , across Northern Holland , in Paris , the port of Brest , and in several German cities as well .
In the end the expected invasion never materialised , the Battle of Britain was fought out in the skies over Kent and Sussex and not in the English Channel .
The Luftwaffe could not gain air superiority over the RAF 's Fighter Command and resorted to area bombing of Britain 's big cities .
The Blitz had begun and the morale of the British people was now the target .
Hitler postponed Operation Sealion permanently .
Once the threat of invasion had passed the UPC concentrated more on propaganda rather than deception rumours .
High - level deception operations and rumours would come under the control of the prosaically named London Controlling Section ( LCS ) .
Many of the UPC 's sibs were directed towards influencing attitudes in the occupied countries .
In France , for instance , their aims were to discredit the Vichy government , to stir up resistance to Germany , and to increase the impression of Britain 's own strength .
As an example , in November 1940 a rumour was disseminated in France to create hostility towards the Germans , it claimed that the Germans were about to requisition copper and rubber including tyres from automobiles .
Another was spread saying the Eiffel Tower was going to be disassembled so that the metal could be used for munitions .
In Belgium it was put about that , " the Germans have a British bomber on Nivelles aerodrome which flies .
They have used it to bomb Brussels in an attempt to cause ill - feeling among the Belgians against England . "
Another aim was to cause friction between the Axis partners .
Italy was constantly portrayed as weak and militarily inadequate .
One rumour targeted for the British press said , " there is evidence that some of the Italian planes in Greece and Palestine are piloted by Germans .
This is because the Italian raids were so ineffective that the Germans complained . "
Another claimed , " three German transport aircraft carrying troops and supplies for Africa were shot down by Italian flak near Naples when Italian spotters reported them as British planes . "
But the main attack of the whispering campaign was the morale of the German Armed Forces and civilians .
The corruption of Nazi bosses , the immorality of the SS , collapse of the German economy , the spread of disease from the East , poor diet , fear of air raids , the increasing inferiority of military equipment , the failure of the U - boat war , and the new , unlimited weaponry of the Allies were themes constantly expressed and exaggerated through rumour .
Some of the rumours were of a technical nature , a few brilliant , others amusing , some highly pornographic or ghoulish , and many more were " feeble and often childish " .
A number of the rumours were actually true , others contained a lie wrapped within the truth , and the rest were downright fabrications .
Churchill is reputed to have said , " There are a terrible lot of lies going around the world , and the worst of it is half of them are true " , perhaps he was thinking of the sib war ?
Typical directives for the UPC included such things as :
Give widest publicity to all stories emphasising the horror of the winter campaign in Russia .
Themes should be wolves [ preying on dead and wounded soldiers ] , impossibility of treating wounded , disease , intense cold , and fresh armies training for the spring offensive in Eastern Russia …
Increase in Germany the fear of epidemics spreading from the east .
Fleck typhus should be main theme with some emphasis on trichina and bronchial pneumonia .
Germans should be urged to boil or bake all pork in order to avoid trichina , Breslau should be hinted as the worst hit centre …
Suggest that the efficiency and morale of the U - boat service is deteriorating rapidly owing to inexperienced crews , new British depth charge , new American detecting device , efficiency of Atlantic Patrol , Communist elements among crews …
Foreign workers should not go to Germany because they are transferred to occupied Poland or blitzed districts , gassed if unfit , sterilised , cheated of their wages , or liable to be treated as hostages .
( For all occupied countries but do not use hostage theme for France ) .
David Garnett , a former member of the Political Warfare Executive and its official historian , described the key to a successful rumour .
The really good sib is a poisoned sweetmeat – it is sugar - coated and the deadly dose is not immediately evident .
It will be remembered that early in the war , the Ark Royal was bombed and a German Air Force pilot was later decorated for sinking the ship which had , however , only been damaged .
Considerably later the Ark Royal was actually sunk .
This placed the German Propaganda Ministry in the dilemma of having to repeat its claim or ignore a success .
A perfect example of the ideal poisoned sweetmeat sib was then put out by PWE to the effect that both the first and second claims to have sunk the Ark Royal were true , the explanation being that Britain had broken the Anglo - German Naval convention by building a duplicate of the Ark Royal before the war .
The chocolate offered to the enemy was that he had won two victories and that all his claims were trustworthy in spite of appearances .
The poison was the reflection that if there were two Ark Royals there might be two of each of Britain 's other capital ships still afloat .
An example of one of the really bad rumours concocted by the UPC and which was severely ridiculed by the Air Ministry said that in a Messerschmitt fighter brought down recently , some of the rivets were found to be made of wood !
It seems the UPC had a preoccupation with wooden planes , suggested in January 1941 , another of their rumours joked :
The Germans built a dummy aerodrome in Normandy with wooden planes .
Next night the RAF bombed it – with wooden bombs !
The sib was not approved for dissemination , since the ISSB considered it liable to compromise intelligence sources .
The joke , however , did appear in print a few months later in Shirer 's Berlin Diary .
Under the entry for 27 November 1940 , Shirer claims he heard it from a mysterious source referred to only as " X " but this time the location of the dummy aerodrome was near Amsterdam .
Since the war the rumour has become an urban legend in various guises .
What must be one of the most ridiculous sibs ended up being scathingly criticised by the Daily Mail journalist Wilson Broadbent , he wrote :
I am told that some of the broadcasts designed to convert Germans to the well - meaning intentions of Britain must make even a German laugh .
Are the Germans being told of Britain 's determination to fight to the end , or are they being soothed by Socialism sent out in the name of the Government ?
One perfect example of propaganda for German consumption on another plane … was to this effect : ' The British Government have ordered 26 sharks from the Australian Government for immediate delivery in the English Channel , and woe betide any German soldier who tries to cross that stretch of water ' .
Actually the real sib specified 200 sharks but that is not important .
This was not the type of publicity the UPC was hoping for .
In January 1941 the UPC comprised of Ralph Murray ( later Sir ) , John Rayner , Leslie Sheridan or his representative , and Sir Hanns Vischer .
To bring better organisation for the production of sibs Rayner , a former features editor with the Daily Express , was appointed the rumour rapporteur , or the " Sibster " as he would become known .
He was responsible for formulating rumours and obtaining ideas from PWE 's regional heads which he then submitted to the Committee for consideration .
Once the rumour had been successfully vetted it could then be disseminated .
Initially SIS was the primary disseminator of rumours but because of their lack of available agents operating in occupied Europe they happily passed the responsibility onto Department D/Q of SOE for the duration of the war .
Department D/Q was originally established under Section D . To this day its official title is a state secret and redacted in official documents .
Later , however , it was known as the " Press Propaganda Department " .
Despite the bulk of SOE 's surviving archives being released for public inspection the major part of Department D/Q's work remains classified .
As well as having an integral role in the development of black propaganda campaigns , it was also responsible for the dissemination of rumours .
The rumour - mongering went as far as telling anti-Axis jokes and amusing stories .
One joke mocking the Italian 's military performance which D/Q arranged to be told in various neutral countries went :
The Italians have invented a new tank with one forward gear and three reverse gears .
But the section 's main function was " secret journalism " to manipulate the world 's press .
The department founded a number of international news agencies .
D/Q's main agency was named Britanova and operated in Eastern Europe , the Americas and the Middle East .
An early SOE progress report from April 1941 described Britanova 's origins and activities :
This is an undertaking formed by the old organisation [ Section D of SIS ] , which has , however , been allowed to continue to function .
Ostensibly it is a commercial company operating a news agency similar to , though of course on a very much smaller scale than , Reuters or the Exchange Telegraph , with branches in Budapest , Bucharest , Belgrade , Istanbul , Ankara , Cairo , and Lisbon .
In fact , however , the company is controlled by S.O.2 .
The concern has been the means of getting many thousands of pro-Ally news items into the local newspapers , which would otherwise never have been published in the local press .
Incidentally , it has provided cover for S.O.2 agents , and for the printing of subversive propaganda , and has been used frequently as a channel for the distribution of rumours .
Its activities have , however , been seriously curtailed since the German occupation of Hungary , Roumania and Jugoslavia .
Other SOE news agencies included the Arab News Agency ( ANA ) in Cairo and the Globe News Agency in Calcutta .
Britanova would continue operating until 1965 .
When faced with a hostile press in Turkey , the department even created and financed its own newspaper , the French language La Turquie .
The department also had a hand in Britain 's legendary strategic deception operations .
D/Q was mainly staffed with journalists and originally headed by Colonel Leslie Sheridan .
Prior to the war he was the night editor of the Daily Mirror newspaper .
The Communist spy and former Times correspondent Kim Philby reflects in his autobiography My Silent War that he received a telephone call from Sheridan inviting him for the interview which led to his employment with SOE .
Philby taught propaganda at an SOE agent training school before joining Section V of SIS .
Possibly this explains why Sheridan was the person recruiting him .
Sheridan 's first wife Doris , a fellow Mirror journalist , spent most of the war in New York working for his Britanova news agency .
Sheridan , or " Sherry " to his friends , later moved up the chain of command and his position as head of Department D/Q was taken over by Lionel Hale in July 1942 .
Lionel Hale was a dramatist , broadcaster and journalist .
He wrote a number of plays including the comedy Gilt and Gingerbread and was a presenter on BBC radio and later television .
He was the first host of the long - running Radio 4 Round Britain Quiz which is currently hosted by his godson .
His SOE personal file records that he was ,
… altogether a most efficient and attractive man whose sense of fun and humour enhances and is partially responsible for his exceptional capability in many branches of journalism .
Hale 's deputy was Major Colin Wintle .
Wintle was the liaison officer between PWE and SOE .
He often acted as head of D/Q and was one of SOE 's representatives on the strategic deception committee .
He worked closely with Delmer 's staff and was essentially a surrogate member of the German section of SOE .
He played an important role in the formulation and dissemination of black propaganda literature and sibs .
The son of a Bristol GP , Wintle had a passion for the outdoors life and for British history .
After graduating from Clifton College he eventually found himself working as a hack on a local Bristol newspaper .
He then went on to Fleet Street as a correspondent on the Daily Mirror and the News Chronicle .
After the war , in partnership with Sheridan , he set up a London - based public relations firm .
Sheridan also remained in the psychological warfare business as a leading member of the Foreign Office 's new secret Information Research Department ( IRD ) , headed by Sir Ralph Murray .
IRD acted as a foil to counter Soviet Communist propaganda throughout the Cold War .
Alec Peterson was another influential member of D/Q. Although a schoolmaster and not a journalist , he was recruited by Hale in December 1940 .
Initially he was principally concerned with sib work but was also earmarked for a special role in case of an invasion .
If Germany ever succeeded in crossing the English Channel , Peterson was expected to operate an underground radio news service .
Hiding out in the loft of a remote country house near Cirencester , his news bulletins would be broadcast by a nearby military transmitting station .
He had no idea how he was supposed to gather news and expected to last no longer than twelve hours before being discovered .
" Quite the maddest thing I ever got involved in , " he later recalled .
In February 1942 , Peterson was posted to SOE India .
There he set up rumour networks , stay - behind parties in event of a Japanese invasion and , with George Steer , formed the Indian Field Broadcasting Units ( IFBUs ) .
Department D/Q remained a small but seemly effective section of SOE .
The full history of its spin doctoring would make compelling , if a little unnerving , reading .
They were certainly imaginative in their means of rumour dissemination .
They set - up various whispering networks around the world and carefully selected which were to be used for any particular rumour .
Using all networks at once to spread the same rumour would obviously be disastrous and would reveal the deception .
SOE agents in the field in both occupied and neutral countries were utilised as well as agents in Britain who perhaps operated at a port or airport and could talk to passengers and seamen about to embark for a foreign country .
The ports particularly targeted included Avonmouth , Glasgow , Liverpool , and Fleetwood and the airports of Poole and Whitchurch .
The pilots employed on the Whitchurch to Lisbon air route were Dutchmen and suspected of communicating with their home country .
Other agents made contact with neutral seamen at their hostels and clubs , particularly the Norwegian Seamen 's Hostel in London and the Danish Pool in Newcastle .
Communists and others suspected of being in communication with the enemy were planted with sibs .
Indiscrete letters written by people in England to friends abroad were allowed by special arrangement to pass unedited through the censorship .
Neutral journalists and diplomatic missions in London were fed stories and reports were introduced into the British and American press .
UPC rumours regularly appeared in the bulletins of the Overseas News Agency which were then swallowed up willingly by newspapers like the New York Post .
There was also a separate whispering organisation in New York but it ceased operations when America entered the war and Donovan 's new Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) began handling sibbing in America .
British Embassy and Legation staff abroad had their whisper officers who received their sib lists , called " Venom " telegrams , via Foreign Office ciphers .
SOE 's whispering network in Turkey was a typical example of how the machinery for spreading rumours worked .
A Chief Whisperer was appointed who then recruited ten Sub - whisperers , each of whom was chosen because they had specially good contact with certain classes of people from politicians and Army officers to waiters and barbers , for example .
Each Sub - whisperer was conscious of the fact that he , or she , was working for SOE , but although they knew the Chief Whisperer , they did not know the identities of any of the other Sub - whisperers .
Each Sub - whisperer then recruited ten to twenty unconscious agents to whom they passed on rumours .
In Tangier rumours were spread amongst the small French bourgeoisie and Jewish trading community there , amongst the lower class of Arabs through story - tellers and the Arab trading class , as well as general dissemination in cafes , bars , dancing halls , and brothels .
SOE were also in contact in Casablanca with a Jew and a French insurance agent who both regularly travelled to and from Vichy France and would take back rumours for passing into Occupied France .
The UPC scored another small propaganda victory when it put out a brief rumour that simply said , " Udet has committed suicide " .
Luftwaffe General Ernst Udet was one of Germany 's greatest First World War fighter pilots ; he flew in the same squadron as the famous Red Baron , Manfred von Richthofen and with the future commander of the Third Reich 's Luftwaffe , Hermann Goering .
Udet scored 62 victories , second only to Richthofen himself , and was awarded the distinguished Pour le Mérite order .
Between the wars Udet had a successful career as an aerobatic stunt pilot travelling the world giving impressive flying displays dressed up in the costume of a top hat , long beard , and frock coat .
He flew stunts in a number of movies , most notably The White Hell of Pitz Palu .
According to the Udet legend he was very reluctantly persuaded by his old WWI flying comrade Goering to join the new Luftwaffe and soon became the Chief of Armaments Procurement , a position he was sorely inappropriate for .
As war approached , Udet was instrumental in the development of the Ju.87 Stuka dive - bomber .
The UPC in July 1941 wanted to create the appearance of disharmony and confusion over direction of the war in the German High Command .
The rumour that Udet had taken his own life was part of this scheme .
No doubt assisted by the Britanova news agency the story appeared in the US press and was front - page news in Britain in both the Daily Telegraph and Daily Sketch newspapers on 30 July .
The Daily Telegraph reported from their New York correspondent that , " Ernst Udet , General of the Nazi Luftwaffe , and one of Marshal Goering 's closest associates , has committed suicide while under protective arrest by Himmler 's Black Guards .
He was detained after making vehement protests against Hitler 's folly in invading Russia . "
The newspaper claims the report had been smuggled out of Germany via Holland by opponents of Hitler 's regime .
" The greatest importance and credence is attached to it by Allied official circles " , the newspaper believed .
To quash this rumour , the next day Goebbels arranged for foreign correspondents to interview Udet , to prove he was very much alive .
Udet joked about his apparent premature death .
Encouraged by the controversy caused , the UPC followed - up with another rumour which said Udet 's life had been saved at the last minute by the direct intervention of Goering , but only after the reports of his suicide had been put out .
In what must be one of the most extraordinary coincidences of the war , three months later it seems Udet really did kill himself .
According to eyewitness testimony , Udet melodramatically shot himself with a Colt revolver whilst talking to his mistress , Inge Bleyle , on the telephone .
Because of the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain , controversy over the Russian campaign , the intriguing of fellow officers , and not being able to cope with his high position , so the story goes , Udet had become increasingly depressed and drank heavily .
On 17 November 1941 , this hero of WWI and reluctant Nazi , had had enough and took his own life .
Especially because of the previous rumours of Udet 's suicide , it was impossible for Goebbels to announce that Udet had killed himself .
The official German communiqué claimed that he had been killed in a flying accident testing a new aircraft , he was to be given a full state funeral , and Jagdgeschwader 3 squadron would be named in his honour .
On his journey to attend Udet 's funeral the Luftwaffe 's current top fighter ace and newly appointed General of Fighters , Werner Mölders was killed in a plane crash .
The circumstances of Mölder 's death were also manipulated for psychological warfare purposes .
Sefton Delmer , in what must have been one of his first black leaflet operations since joining the Political Warfare Executive , concocted a fake letter apparently written by Mölders , a practising Roman Catholic , to a non-existent Probst Johst of Stettin which denounced the anti-religious attitudes of the Nazis .
The letter , which Delmer says was printed on forged pages of a Luftwaffe signals pad , was dropped by aircraft over Germany .
The implication was that Mölders ' pilot comrades had reproduced and distributed the letter , as they believed his death had not been an accident .
The letter circulated quickly in Germany causing some controversy .
In June 1943 the UPC also sibbed that Field Marshal Erwin Rommel , the Desert Fox , had committed suicide .
If they had put out the rumour a year later they would have been right again , when Rommel also took his own life .
As the war progressed new opportunities arose for successful covert anti-Nazi propaganda with the German setbacks in Russia , America 's entry into the war , Rommel 's defeat in North Africa , the increasing failure of the U - boat blockade , and Italy 's surrender .
But as time went on the Underground Propaganda Committee 's role declined .
The UPC was a pale reflection of the work being done by Delmer 's clandestine radio stations .
Delmer was never a member of the Committee but was on the distribution list for the Committee 's weekly minutes , to make sure they were not contradicting his own psychological warfare and to supply extra rumours which could be broadcast via his stations .
Radio was far more effective at circulating rumours than the UPC 's mechanism but the oral rumour had the advantage of being practically untraceable , so allowing greater latitude for spreading more contentious and outlandish stories .
The last recorded meeting of the Committee was on 13 April 1945 and included the sib that , " the gold found by the Allies in the salt mine near Eisenach was not the Reich 's bank gold ( which has already been deposited abroad ) but gold looted by the Party bigwigs . "
By the end of the war the UPC had concocted almost 8,000 different rumours , not including those formulated for a short time in New York and others in Cairo .
Its work was always controversial and some of the myths it perpetrated persist to this very day , which shows they must have been successful to a certain extent .

NOTES
Most days lately I feel like a losing boxer in the 12th round of 15 - round match .
Each morning I stagger out of my corner fully expecting another beating , and rarely am I wrong .
How did this happen ?
Less than seven years ago I danced like butterfly and stung like a bee .
How did I ( we ) fall so far , so fast ?
In a word -- " Bullshit . "
That 's right , bullshit .
I , and the rest of us , allowed ourselves to be bullshitted into weakness , hopelessness , fear and despair .
I 'm not kidding .
It really is that simple - and just that depressing .
And it 's just that embarrassing .
For some months now I 've had a link on my own site to a remarkable address given 38 - years ago to a convention of English teachers .
It was delivered by author and scholar , Neil Postman way back in 1969 .
The speech was quite long , and some of it dealt with teaching .
Which is why I suspect many folks never cut through the whole thing .
So I 've edited out the extraneous matter leaving intact Postman 's core message , which I would summarize as , " Citizens living in a democracy , if they hope to keep that democracy , need to learn how to tell the difference between facts and bullshit . "
Clearly , too many of us did n't , and as a direct result tens of thousands have died in Iraq and now our own democracy is threatened .
All because critical thinking took a vacation , and the price we 've paid for that lapse is staggering -- and growing .
Which is why I figured it was time to bring this piece up front for further attention , in the hopes it will prompt everyone to dust off their crap - detectors .
Postman saw the danger nearly 40 years ago , tried to warn us , we did n't listen , and the rest is history .
( PS : While this speech was given to teachers in 1969 it would be even more relevant if given to journalists today !)

" Bullshit and the Art of Crap - Detection "
by Neil Postman
( Delivered at the National Convention for the Teachers of English [ NCTE ] , November 28 , 1969 , Washington , D.C. )
With a title like this , I think I ought to dispense with the rhetorical amenities and come straight to the point .
For those of you who do not know , it may be worth saying that the phrase , " crap - detecting , " originated with Ernest Hemingway who when asked if there were one quality needed , above all others , to be a good writer , replied , " Yes , a built - in , shock - proof , crap detector . "
As I see it , the best things schools can do for kids is to help them learn how to distinguish useful talk from bullshit .
I will ask only that you agree that every day in almost every way people are exposed to more bullshit than it is healthy for them to endure , and that if we can help them to recognize this fact , they might turn away from it and toward language that might do them some earthly good .
There are so many varieties of bullshit I could n't hope to mention but a few , and elaborate on even fewer .
I will , therefore , select those varieties that have some transcendent significance .
Now , that last sentence is a perfectly good example of bullshit , since I have no idea what the words " transcendent significance " might mean and neither do you .
I needed something to end that sentence with and since I did not have any clear criteria by which to select my examples , I figured this was the place for some big - time words .
Pomposity :
Pomposity is not an especially venal form of bullshit , although it is by no means harmless .
There are plenty of people who are daily victimized by pomposity in that they are made to feel less worthy than they have a right to feel by people who use fancy titles , words , phrases , and sentences to obscure their own insufficiencies .
Fanaticism :
A much more malignant form of bullshit than pomposity is what some people call fanaticism .
Now , there is one type of fanaticism of which I will say very little , because it is so vulgar and obvious -- bigotry .
But there are other forms of fanaticism that are not so obvious , and therefore perhaps more dangerous than bigotry
Eichmannism is a relatively new form of fanaticism , and perhaps it should be given its own special place among the great and near - great varieties of bullshit .
The essence of fanaticism is that it has almost no tolerance for any data that do not confirm its own point of view .
Eichmannism is especially dangerous because it is so utterly banal .
Some of the nicest people turn out to be mini-Eichmanns .
When Eichmann was in the dock in Jerusalem , he actually said that some of his best friends were Jews .
And the horror of it is that he was probably telling the truth , for there is nothing personal about Eichmannism .
It is the language of regulations , and includes such logical sentences as , " If we do it for one , we have to do it for all . "
Can you imagine some wretched Jew pleading to have his children spared from the gas chamber ?
What could be more fair , more neutral , than for some administrator to reply , " If we do it for one , we have to do it for all . "
Inanity :
This is a form of talk which pays a large but , I would think , relatively harmless role in our personal lives .
But with the development of the mass media , inanity has suddenly emerged as a major form of language in public matters .
The invention of new and various kinds of communication has given a voice and an audience to many people whose opinions would otherwise not be solicited , and who , in fact , have little else but verbal excrement to contribute to public issues .
Many of these people are entertainers .
The press and air waves are filled with the featured and prime - time statements from people who are in no position to render informed judgments on what they are talking about and yet render them with elan and , above all , sincerity .
Inanity , then , is ignorance presented in the cloak of sincerity .
Superstition :
Superstition is ignorance presented in the cloak of authority .
A superstition is a belief , usually expressed in authoritative terms for which there is no factual or scientific basis .
Like , for instance , that the country in which you live is a finer place , all things considered , than other countries .
Or that the religion into which you were born confers upon you some special standing with the cosmos that is denied other people .
I will refrain from commenting further on that , except to say that when I hear such talk by own crap - detector achieves unparalleled spasms of activity .
If teachers were to take an enthusiastic interest in what language is about , each teacher would have fairly serious problems to resolve .
For instance , you can't identify bullshit the way you identify phonemes .
That is why I have called crap - detecting an art .
Although subjects like semantics , rhetoric , or logic seem to provide techniques for crap - detecting , we are not dealing here , for the most part , with a technical problem .
Each person 's crap - detector is embedded in their value system ; if you want to teach the art of crap - detecting , you must help students become aware of their values .
After all , Vice President , Spiro Agnew , or his writers , know as much about semantics as anyone in this room .
What he is lacking has very little to do with technique , and almost everything to do with values .
Now , I realize that what I just said sounds fairly pompous in itself , if not arrogant , but there is no escaping from saying what attitudes you value if you want to talk about crap - detecting .
In other words , bullshit is what you call language that treats people in ways you do not approve of .
So any teacher who is interested in crap - detecting must acknowledge that one man 's bullshit is another man 's catechism .
Students should be taught to learn how to recognize bullshit , including their own .
It seems to me one needs , first and foremost , to have a keen sense of the ridiculous .
Maybe I mean to say , a sense of our impending death .
About the only advantage that comes from our knowledge of the inevitability of death is that we know that whatever is happening is going to go away .
Most of us try to put this thought out of our minds , but I am saying that it ought to be kept firmly there , so that we can fully appreciate how ridiculous most of our enthusiasms and even depressions are .
Reflections on one 's mortality curiously makes one come alive to the incredible amounts of inanity and fanaticism that surround us , much of which is inflicted on us by ourselves .
Which brings me to the next point , best stated as Postman 's Third Law :
" At any given time , the chief source of bullshit with which you have to contend is yourself . "
The reason for this is explained in Postman 's Fourth Law , which is ;
" Almost nothing is about what you think it is about -- including you . "
With the possible exception of those human encounters that Fritz Peris calls " intimacy , " all human communications have deeply embedded and profound hidden agendas .
Most of the conversation at the top can be assumed to be bullshit of one variety or another .
An idealist usually cannot acknowledge his own bullshit , because it is in the nature of his " ism " that he must pretend it does not exist .
In fact , I should say that anyone who is devoted to an " ism " -- Fascism , Communism , Capital - ism -- probably has a seriously defective crap - detector .
This is especially true of those devoted to " patriotism . "
Santha Rama Rau has called patriotism a squalid emotion .
I agree .
Mainly because I find it hard to escape the conclusion that those most enmeshed in it hear no bullshit whatever in its rhetoric , and as a consequence are extremely dangerous to other people .
If you doubt this , I want to remind you that murder for murder , General Westmoreland makes Vito Genovese look like a Flower Child .
Another way of saying this is that all ideologies are saturated with bullshit , and a wise man will observe Herbert Read 's advice : " Never trust any group larger than a squad . "
So you see , when it comes right down to it , crap - detection is something one does when he starts to become a certain type of person .
Sensitivity to the phony uses of language requires , to some extent , knowledge of how to ask questions , how to validate answers , and certainly , how to assess meanings .
I said at the beginning that I thought there is nothing more important than for kids to learn how to identify fake communication .
You , therefore , probably assume that I know something about now to achieve this .
Well , I do n't .
At least not very much .
I know that our present curricula do not even touch on the matter .
Neither do our present methods of training teachers .
I am not even sure that classrooms and schools can be reformed enough so that critical and lively people can be nurtured there .
Nonetheless , I persist in believing that it is not beyond your profession to invent ways to educate youth along these lines .
( Because ) there is no more precious environment than our language environment .
And even if you know you will be dead soon , that 's worth protecting .
To return from the United States to Europe is to travel from a country that thinks it is on the front line of the struggle against jihadist terrorism but is not , to a continent that is on the front line but still has not fully awoken to the fact .
Only a fool would rule out the possibility of another terrorist assault on what is now styled the American homeland , but the fact is that in the six years since 9/11 , there have been several major attacks ( Madrid , London ) and foiled plots in Europe .
In the United States , there have been no major attacks and , as far as we know , just a few averted conspiracies .
All the evidence suggests that American Muslims are better integrated than those in Western Europe .
Last week ’s arrest of a group apparently planning a 9/11 anniversary attack in Germany suggests that the threat to the heimat is greater than that to the U.S. homeland .
An invisible front line runs through the quiet streets of many a European city or town where there is a significant Muslim population .
Whether you live in London or Oxford , Berlin or Neu - Ulm , Madrid or Rotterdam , you are on that front line -- much more than you ever were during the Cold War .
This struggle is partly about intelligence and police work to prevent those who have already become fanatical , violent jihadists from blowing us up at St. Pancras or the Gare du Nord .
Ordinary non-Muslim Europeans can only do a little to help this work , as well as worrying about the curtailment of civil liberties .
Ordinary , peaceful , law - abiding Muslim Europeans can do a little more .
The larger part of this struggle , and the more important in the longer term , is the battle for the hearts and minds of young European Muslims -- usually men -- who are not yet violent jihadists but could become so .
All over the Continent , and around its edges , there are hundreds of thousands of young Muslim men who could be tomorrow ’s bombers -- or tomorrow ’s good citizens .
The chemistry in Europe can be understood a little better by thinking back to the last wave of youth terrorism , in the “ German autumn ” of 30 years ago and Italy ’s Red Brigades .
When I lived in Berlin in the late 1970s , I met quite a few people who told me , “ You know , there was a moment when I could have gone either way . ”
They could have slunk away to join the Red Army Faction , like those acquaintances of their acquaintances .
Instead , they became journalists , academics or lawyers and are now pillars of a society under attack from a potentially more destructive wave of terrorism .
Of course , we cannot take the comparison too far , but one basic feature is the same :
Beside the hard core of fanatics is a penumbra of people who couldchoose the wrong path .
In Germany , they are called the sympathisanten -- the sympathizers .
Among European Muslims , they might very roughly be correlated with those who , in surveys , refuse to condemn suicide bombings .
One analyst estimates that while the hard core may make up 1 % of British Muslims , the sympathisanten make up perhaps 10 % of German Muslims .
If you look at the biographies of the jihadist assassins over the last six years , from the 9/11 bomber Mohamed Atta , radicalized in Hamburg , to Mohammed Bouyeri , murderer of Theo van Gogh , you find again and again the same story : young men who were first attracted to a modern , Western way of life , quite different from that of their parents , but who then angrily rejected it in favor of a violent , extremist version of political Islam .
Fortunately , there are also people who travel the other way .
So much now depends on whether the 10 % veer toward the barbaric 1 % or rejoin the civilized majority .
Iraq is a sideshow in this larger struggle .
President Bush may claim that Iraq is the front line in the war on terror , but even some of his senior commanders do n’t believe that .
To be sure , the Iraq war has become an added grievance for disaffected Muslims everywhere , although note that Germany ’s nonparticipation in the Iraq war did not keep it safe .
Nor should we avert our eyes from the further uncomfortable truth that a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq will be celebrated by violent jihadists as a victory .
But the larger truth is that a British soldier returning from Basra to Bradford ( a city with a large Muslim population ) will be coming from one front line to another .
This invisible front line is not a military but a cultural / political one .
The returning soldier may do more to reduce the threat of terrorism in Britain by his off - duty attitude toward British Muslims in his hometown than by anything he did , gun in hand , in Basra .
Afghanistan is a different matter .
Rooting out the original Al Qaeda and beating back the renascent Taliban is an integral part of combating jihadist terrorism .
So is trying to change the poisonous mixture of radical religion and politics in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
The man who seems to have been a ringleader of the German group , a convert to Islam called Fritz Gelowicz , was radicalized in an Islamic center , the Multi- Kultur - Haus ( another blow to the good name of multiculturalism ) , in Neu - Ulm by instructors from the toxic Wahhabi sect of Islam , based in and funded by that great American ally , Saudi Arabia .
He then reportedly went for Arabic - language training in Syria and terrorist training in the border regions of Pakistan .
According to German sources , the instruction to launch the anniversary attack came by e-mail from Pakistan .
So death can come out of Neu - Ulm by way of Waziristan .
If we are calm , clear - sighted and resolute , we will eventually win this struggle and remain free .
A continent that has rid itself of the horrors of imperialism , fascism and communism will see off this lesser menace too .
But it will take many years , and we had better shape up to it .

The Real Suicide Bomb
This cartoon was inspired by a line from Mark Steyn in A victory for multiculti over common sense :
It has been sobering this past week watching some of my " woollier " colleagues ( in Vicki Woods 's self - designation ) gradually awake to the realisation that the real suicide bomb is " multiculturalism " .
Its remorseless tick - tock , suddenly louder than the ethnic drumming at an anti-globalisation demo , drove poor old Boris Johnson into rampaging around this page last Thursday like some demented late - night karaoke one - man Fiddler on the Roof , stamping his feet and bellowing , " Tradition ! Tradition ! "
Boris 's plea for more Britishness was heartfelt and valiant , but I 'm not sure I 'd bet on it .
The London bombers were , to the naked eye , assimilated - they ate fish ' n ' chips , played cricket , sported appalling leisurewear .
They 'd adopted so many trees we could n't see they lacked the big overarching forest - the essence of identity , of allegiance .
As I 've said before , you can't assimilate with a nullity - which is what multiculturalism is .
....
One of the striking features of the post - 9/11 world is the minimal degree of separation between the so - called " extremists " and the establishment : Princess Haifa , wife of the Saudi ambassador to Washington , gives $ 130,000 to accomplices of the 9/11 terrorists ; the head of the group that certifies Muslim chaplains for the US military turns out to be a bagman for terrorists ; one of the London bombers gets given a tour of the House of Commons by a Labour MP .
The Guardian hires as a " trainee journalist " a member of Hizb ut Tahir , " Britain 's most radical Islamic group " ( as his own newspaper described them ) and in his first column post - 7/ 7 he mocks the idea that anyone could be " shocked " at a group of Yorkshiremen blowing up London : " Second - and third - generation Muslims are without the don't - rock - the - boat attitude that restricted our forefathers .
We 're much sassier with our opinions , not caring if the boat rocks " - or the bus blows , or the Tube vaporises .
Fellow Guardian employee David Foulkes , who was killed in the Edgware Road blast , would no doubt be heartened to know he'd died for the cause of Muslim " sassiness " .
In referencing the above editorial , TIA Daily 's Robert Tracinski further noted what is needed to combat multiculturalism :
[ Steyn's ] most profound point is that " you ca n't assimilate with a nullity . "
" Britishness " has to be about more than superficial details of lifestyle .
Britain has to decide what * ideas * it stands for -- and as with the rest of Europe , this is a task for which British culture is unprepared .
This is the great advantage that America has : we do n't have to search for a non-racial identity , because we are a nation explicitly founded on an idea .
America can provide a model from which Europe needs to learn .
Or , in the case of Britain , they can look back to the models from which America learned , from the Magna Carta to the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Enlightenment ideas that inspired it .
I disagree with Diana West 's implication that it's not useful to distinguish the fundamentalist , theocratic , and terrorist Muslims ( Islamists ) from muslims who are n't .
But she makes a number of good points about the danger of multiculturalism in Burnt offerings on the altar of multiculturalism ( via Little Green Footballs ) :
Without it -- without its fanatics who believe all civilizations are the same -- the engine that projects Islam into the unprotected heart of Western civilization would stall and fail .
It 's as simple as that .
To live among the believers -- the multiculturalists -- is to watch the assault , the jihad , take place un - repulsed by our suicidal societies .
These societies are not doomed to submit ; rather , they are eager to do so in the name of a masochistic brand of tolerance that , short of drastic measures , is surely terminal .
I 'm not talking about our soldiers , policemen , rescue workers and , now , even train conductors , who bravely and steadfastly risk their lives for civilization abroad and at home .
Instead , I 'm thinking about who we are as a society at this somewhat advanced stage of war .
It is a strange , tentative civilization we have become , with leaders who strut their promises of " no surrender " even as they flinch at identifying the foe .
Four years past 9/11 , we continue to shadow - box " terror , " even as we go on about " an ideology of hate . " ...
This is the lesson of the atrocities in London .
It 's unlikely that the 21st century will remember that this new Western crossroads for global jihad was once the home of Churchill , Piccadilly and Sherlock Holmes .
Then again , who will notice ?
The BBC has retroactively purged its online bombing coverage of the word " terrorist " ; the spokesman for the London police commissioner has declared that " Islam and terrorism simply do n't go together " ; and within sight of a forensics team sifting through rubble , an Anglican priest urged his flock , as The Guardian reported , to " rejoice in the capital 's rich diversity of cultures , traditions , ethnic groups and faiths . "
Just do n't , he said , " name them as Muslims . "
Their faith renewed , Londoners soldier on .

( via InstaPundit ) :
Bomb us , and we agonise over the " root causes " ( that is , what we did wrong ) .
Decapitate us , and our politicians rush to the nearest mosque to declare that " Islam is a religion of peace " .
Issue bloodcurdling calls at Friday prayers to kill all the Jews and infidels , and we fret that it may cause a backlash against Muslims .
Behead sodomites and mutilate female genitalia , and gay groups and feminist groups can't wait to march alongside you denouncing Bush , Blair and Howard .
Murder a schoolful of children , and our scholars explain that to the " vast majority " of Muslims " jihad " is a harmless concept meaning " decaf latte with skimmed milk and cinnamon sprinkles " .

While Massachusetts ( liberal land of forward thinking ) led by Ted Kennedy ( liberal leader of forward thinking ) has done everything in its power to stop Cape Wind ( forward thinking provider of clean renewable energy )
Texas ( land of cowboys and oil tycoons ) is actually the biggest supplier of wind energy in the country and is placing large tracts of its coast up for bid for offshore wind production .
As the kids would say “ what the fuck ? ! ”
Seriously what is wrong with this picture .
Ted Kennedy does n’t want offshore wind because he might get drunk and run his yacht into it , or god forbid him and bobby might have to look at them from their giant sea side mansion .
Meanwhile the land of the oil derrick is busy putting up wind turbines as fast as they can .
Jerry Patterson , Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office , is seeking bidders for the nationâ€™s first - ever competitive lease sale for the rights to develop offshore wind power in the Gulf of Mexico .
â€œThe future of our nationâ€™s offshore wind industry is off the Texas Gulf Coast , â€ Patterson said .
â€ œThereâ€™s international interest in these tracts and this will be the first time the market will be able to place a value on what I think is a very valuable asset.â€ 
Four offshore tracts will be leased for the development of wind energy as part of the regular oil and gas lease sale to be held on October 2 .
The offshore wind energy tracts up for bid are near Jefferson , Calhoun , Brazoria and Cameron counties .
The four tracts total 73,098 acres in size .
Detailed bidding instructions , a wind power lease bid application form and detailed maps of the offshore tracts of land can be found here .
Hello Massachusetts ( Teddy and Bill Delahunt you especially should be listening ) , are you missing anything here ?
You could be making mad bank and providing your citizens with clean renewable energy all while creating a vibrant and job producing industry in your state .
I hate to say it but you should be following Texas ’ lead on this one .
Supporting families and communities is key to tackling antisocial behaviour among young people , not raising the drinking age , the Conservative party leader , David Cameron , said today .
A " culture change " that " celebrates marriage " is needed to help combat problems with unruly youths , he said in an interview , and that family breakdown was key because too many youngsters were growing up without male role models .
His comments came as a survey revealed that half of British people felt more frightened on the streets than a decade ago .
" We are not going to deal with anarchy in the UK unless we actually strengthen families and communities in the UK , " Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme .
About 70 % of inmates in young offender institutions were from broken homes , he said .
" Many single mums do a fantastic job bringing up children , but I think we have got to be frank with ourselves and say ' Children do best if mum and dad are there to help bring them up ' so there are male role models for them .
" In too many of our communities , there are n't those male role models and so we need to do more to strengthen families .
" I think all of us know that tough penalties on their own are not enough .
You have got to get behind the crime figures and ask yourself , why is it there so much social disorder and breakdown in Britain ?
Why is it that there is so much concern about young people running out of control ?
" I believe it 's because of social breakdown , it 's because of family breakdown , it 's because of a lack of discipline in schools , it 's a lack of proper values being taught in the home .
We are not really going to solve the crime problem unless we solve the family problem . "
A YouGov poll for GMTV and the Mirror published today showed that half of British people felt more frightened on the streets than a decade ago .
The survey was carried out in the wake of the murder of father - of - three Garry Newlove , 47 , who was attacked after challenging a gang of youths outside his Warrington home .
After the killing , Peter Fahy , the chief constable of Cheshire police , said parents who refused to take responsibility for their children 's under - age drinking should be forced into accepting police offers of support .
The poll found that 65 % believe under - 16 s should not be allowed out unsupervised after dark ; 42 % said they would rather not go out at night because of gangs and muggers ( rising to 50 % of women ) ; 62 % felt parents shouldered most of the blame for antisocial youngsters ; and 89 % thought parents should be held responsible for how their children behaved .
More than a third - 36 % - said they had called police about antisocial behaviour and a third claimed they had been forced to confront thuggish youths .
Although Mr Fahy is calling for the legal age for buying alcohol to be raised from 18 to 21 , only 5 % of the 1,382 people questioned by YouGov believed the easy availability of cheap alcohol was to blame for yobbish behaviour .
Mr Cameron also disagreed with Mr Fahy : " I 'm not persuaded that raising the age from 18 to 21 is the right answer , " he said .
But he called for more prosecutions of shops caught selling alcohol to children .
Home Office minister Tony McNulty said : " The government is committed to tackling crime and the fear of crime , which is why we have put record numbers of police on our streets and have provided them with an armoury of tools to crack down on antisocial behaviour and those who spread misery in our communities .
" We are redoubling our efforts to stamp out antisocial behaviour , including alcohol - fuelled disorder , through a twin approach of effective policing and supporting the vital role played by our communities .
This work includes promoting individual responsibility and support for parents . "
No one was more outraged than Helen Pidd when a South African scientist announced that dolphins are stupid .
Would a day with Puck , Flo and Roxanne settle things one way or the other ?
How many elderly goldfish do you know who could moonwalk on water to Kylie ?
This is the question with which I am wrestling as a 41 - year - old bottlenose dolphin called Puck slides backwards across her 6 m - deep pool , her body upright , tail smoothly making waves to the rhythm of Ca n't Get You Out Of My Head .
There is clearly something special about Puck and not just because in dolphin terms she ought really to have been pensioned off long ago .
Yet according to controversial remarks made last month by a South African neuroscientist , Puck and her peers are less advanced than goldfish .
For anyone who grew up glued to Flipper on television ( " No one you see / is smarter than he " ran the jaunty theme tune ) , it 's a hard claim to swallow .
But sometimes in life you have to accept that the dogmas you have long held dear - be it belief in Father Christmas , anti-ageing formulas , eternal love or anything else - might have been a great fat lie .
So I have come to the dolphinarium at Boudewijn Seapark in Bruges to investigate .
With the help of Puck , Roxanne , Flo , Yolta and Milo and the other supposedly dimwitted mammals , I am determined to find out the truth .
( Why Belgium rather than Britain ?
Since 1993 it has been illegal to keep dolphins in captivity in this country . )
The trainers at Boudewijn , along with much of the dolphin - loving world , are deeply unimpressed with claims made by Paul Manger , a 40 - year - old professor of neuroscience from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg .
In a weighty scientific paper published earlier this year in the Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society , Manger hypothesised that " there is no neural basis for the often - asserted high intellectual abilities of cetaceans . "
In other words , despite their supersized brains , cetaceans ( whales , dolphins and porpoises ) , are profoundly thick .
This claim flew in the face of almost everything else published about the mammals recently and , indeed , ever .
Which is why people are so touchy about it .
" No one I have talked to in the scientific field takes the claims Manger makes in this paper seriously , " snaps dolphin expert Lori Marino , senior lecturer in neuroscience and behavioural biology at Emory University , Atlanta .
The dolphin partly owes its reputation as a brainbox to something that scientists like to complicate by calling the encephalisation quotient , which says that the relative amount of brain per unit of body size can be used as a direct estimate of the intelligence of a species .
In English , this means : big brain + not too big body = clever animal .
Modern humans possess the highest level of encephalisation of mammals , as our brains are seven times the size you would expect for our body size , but dolphins are not far behind .
The earliest anecdote supporting cetaceans ' supposed super - intelligence is probably the tale of Arion , the finest lyre - player of his day ( c600 BC ) .
When turfed off his ship by villains , this chap , so goes the tale , was rescued by a dolphin who was attracted by his singularly high - pitched singing .
But there is more recent evidence .
In May , for example , researchers from St Andrews University reported that bottlenose dolphins adopt " signature whistles " to identify each other , just as humans use names .
Another group studying dolphins in western Australia in 2005 noted that some of the dolphins used tools - bits of marine sponge foraged and attached to their snouts , to stop their noses scraping painfully against coral as they fished .
Then there are the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Ayeyarwady river in Myanmar ( formerly Burma ) , which help local fisherman by corralling fish into their nets .
Perhaps best of all , a group of researchers allegedly recently taught dolphins to " sing " the Batman theme tune .
I was pretty sceptical about that one , until I came to Belgium .
In one of the highlights of Boudewijn 's twice daily live spectacle , a lucky girl is plucked from the audience and shown how to " conduct " the dolphins in a rather delightful round .
She does this by wringing both hands as if opening jars , which seems to keep the dolphins time as they " sing " ( OK , yelp ) along .
This hand - wringing is n't the only sign language the mammals appear to understand .
With the requisite flick of the trainers ' wrists , they can open their mouths as if to laugh , nod their heads from side to side and ( my personal favourite , along with the bit when they play football with their tails ) blow air bubbles like smoke rings in the water .
Manger would say that this is indicative of stimulus - response conditioning - ie , it can be taught by a good trainer and is not in any way a sign of a high - level of intelligent behaviour .
Though this may be true - the dolphins are certainly encouraged by the promise of mackerel and pilchards from brightly coloured buckets , as well as high - pitched toots on the dog whistles worn round the trainers ' necks - there is no denying one thing : it 's really very , very cool .
But back to the new claims .
On the off - chance you do n't fancy wading through Manger 's 46 pages , here is a dummies ' synopsis of the key points .
Dolphins have bigger than average brains - some weighing in excess of 8 kg - but this has nothing to do with Stephen Hawkingesque neurological brilliance .
On the contrary , the dolphin brain is not built for complex information processing , but rather is designed to counter the thermal challenges of being a warm - blooded mammal in a cold - water world .
And finally , the comment that really riled the dolphin lobby : while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support the theory that dolphins are exceptionally intelligent , no one has ever conclusively proved that they are .
" You put an animal in a box , even a lab rat or gerbil , and the first thing it wants to do is climb out of it , " said Manger in interviews to publicise his paper .
" If you do n't put a lid on top of the bowl , a goldfish will eventually jump out to enlarge the environment it is living in .
But a dolphin will never do that . "
I muse on this as I sit in the empty seats of the Belgian dolphinarium after the live spectacle , and two dolphins swim diligently in a tiny holding pool while their pals in the main tank practice double somersaults with the trainer .
I know that the sidelined pair can jump the necessary distance : I saw them doing it in their show earlier .
But , like obedient children , they only enter the main pool when their underwater trapdoors are opened .
So Manger 's observation may be correct , but does this actually tell us anything useful ?
Not according to Lori Marino , senior lecturer in neuroscience and behavioural biology at Emory University .
She has studied dolphins for 15 years and is one of Manger 's biggest critics .
" That study with the goldfish he is talking about was never published , " she says .
" It was presented at a meeting in 2000 and was never peer - reviewed , and I was there , and there are so many flaws in it I really do n't know where to begin . "
Marino claims that while it is true that dolphins have problems jumping over tuna nets , for example , this says nothing about their lack of intelligence .
" It 's just like if humans get trapped in a burning building , they panic .
Dolphins , like humans , get stressed very easily - in fact , they can die of stress - and when they panic , they can't think straight . "
But according to Manger , Marino and her doubting colleagues are too blinkered to even consider a brave new claim such as his .
" People just do n't want to believe it , " says Manger in an interview with the Guardian .
" It 's a knee - jerk reaction .
I think it 's kinda cute that people are so upset about it . "
Not everyone can see the cute side .
Dolphins , with their happy , toothy " grins " and impressive repertoire of tricks and emotions , are universally loved - some 77,000 people apparently belong to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society worldwide - and slagging them off is heresy .
Manger has even been accused of leading dolphins to an early grave .
One South African amateur dolphin expert , Nan Rice , who has worked for 35 years with the Dolphin Action and Protection Group in Cape Town , says Manger 's research could lead to the animals ' exploitation - and possible extinction .
" If you tell people that dolphins are not intelligent , they will start exploiting them and at the end we wo n't have many of them left . "
Leaving aside whether Manger 's comments are dangerous or not , one big problem when discussing dolphin neurology is the fact that , because of laws protecting marine mammals , no invasive experiments of the cetacean brain have been carried out .
Unlike , say rats , you can't simply catch yourself a dolphin and dig around in their brain and generally experiment on them while they are still alive .
Similarly , for reasons of practicality as well as ethics , the vast majority of dolphin experiments have been conducted on dolphins born in captivity .
And who knows how representative these animals , which have never seen open water , can really be of the species as a whole .
The other major stumbling block is defining what we mean by intelligence .
There is no reliable , universally accepted method to measure it in humans .
A Mensa test ?
A - levels ?
Those multiple - choice quizzes in women 's magazines ?
Nevertheless , contrary to Manger 's claim , there have actually been a great number of experiments that seem to indicate that dolphins are n't just pretty creatures .
One of the most interesting regards self - recognition and comes from Diana Reiss of Colombia University , along with Marino .
In a 2001 paper , they showed that dolphins can recognise themselves in the mirror - a skill previously thought to be unique to humans and apes .
The scientists exposed two bottlenose dolphins to reflective surfaces after marking the dolphins with black ink , applying a water - filled marker ( sham - marking ) or not marking them at all .
The team predicted that if the dolphins - which had prior experience with mirrors - recognised their reflections , they would not show social responses ; they would spend more time in front of the mirror when marked ; and they would make their way over to the mirror more quickly to inspect themselves when marked or sham - marked .
The experiments bore out all three predictions in both dolphin subjects .
Moreover , the animals even selected the best reflective surface available to view their markings .
" I 've seen it done , " says Johan Cottyn , head trainer at Boudewijn .
His colleague , vet Piet de Laender , nods enthusiastically .
" Dolphins realise that they are looking at themselves .
It does n't work with dogs .
Say if you put a spot on a dog's head and put them in front of a mirror , they will think oh , there 's a dog with a spot on its head , I 'll go and say hello .
A dolphin would stay and inspect its new look . "
This does n't just tell us that dolphins are vain : it shows that they are aware of themselves as individuals , which takes a high level of cognitive skill .
As well as pointing out dolphins ' ability to learn fast and understand complicated language - like commands ( which is also true of the great apes ) , Cottyn is most impressed by the way he and his team have been able to train their dolphins to accept medical interventions without a fuss .
" One of them had a kidney problem , which meant she had to have an injection daily .
Even though it really hurt her , because the needle had to cut through the layer of blubber , she seemed to understand that in order to survive , she had to take the jab , and would automatically come for it every day . "
Cottyn talks of how the Boudewijn dolphins can communicate to humans beyond what they have been explicitly taught .
" Once , when one of the dolphins was giving birth the baby got stuck halfway out .
We came to see what was going on and the mother rubbed her tummy to show us where the problem was , " he says .
Numerous studies have also shed light on dolphins ' rationality , high degree of sociability , social awareness and cognitive functioning .
But de Laender has no time for this whole debate , and especially not for anyone who tries to anthropomorphise dolphins .
" They 're not humans , and trying to judge them by human standards of intelligence is pointless , " he says .
" So at the end of the day , it 's a waste of time trying to say definitively whether dolphins are clever or not , and anyone who tells you they have the answer is bullshitting " .

Never before , in the history of our world , has there been a threat so grave or imminent as that which is now posed by the United States of America and the sociopaths that rule it .
There are only two exceptions to the ban on armed force stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations : self - defense against an armed attack and a definite decision on the part of the Security Council .
Neither of these provisions applies to the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq by the United States of America .
Such an attack , without a clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council , constitutes a flagrant violation of the prohibition of the use of force .
The U.S.A. has further abused its position as a permanent member of the Security Council by disregarding Resolution 1441 , which does not authorize force .
Without express allowance through a new resolution , the invasion of Iraq was an illegal act of aggression .
America has also violated numerous Articles of the Geneva Conventions as well as many treaties that , under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution , Article VI , Clause 2 , are the supreme law of the land .
The breaking of these treaties constitutes further violation of international law .
The goals and intentions plainly stated in The Project for the New American Century combined with blatant disregard of international law and utter contempt for the United Nations , its Bodies and Resolutions are ample cause to identify the United States of America as a clear and present danger to every sovereign nation on Earth .
The push to Fascism in America funded by the rampant , global privatization of Free Market Capitalism is the direct cause of millions of deaths and threatens virtually the entire human race .
Whereas the United States of America has with full knowledge and intent grossly violated the Charter of the United Nations and international law you are herein petitioned to declare it a rogue state and to impose such mandatory sanctions as deemed necessary to curtail its stated intent of subjugating all the nations of the world by military force .
A Sanctions Committee of the United Nations Security Council will determine the number and nature of these sanctions .
The conditions for the lifting of the sanctions will be as follows :
George W. Bush , Richard Cheney , all members of the current United States Administration and Congress found to be complicit must appear before the World Court to stand trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Further , the United States must :
1 . Not be a permanent member of the Security Council until meeting these conditions .
2 . End all efforts , using eugenics , sterilization , genocide , forced abortion or any other method , at attempting to reduce the population of Earth to a single ethnic group , which the ruling elite imagines is superior .
3. Install and maintain a fair and honest voting system with all candidates funded by public campaign financing .
Elections will be subject to international monitoring .
4. Decommission and destroy its nuclear arsenal in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty under monitoring of United Nations Weapons Inspectors .
5 . Immediately cease deployment and use of all depleted uranium munitions .
6 . Halt all acts of direct aggression or the support and furtherance thereof and reduce its military to a size appropriate to defensive purposes only .
7 . Stop conducting covert operations for the purpose of destabilization or overthrow of duly elected governments .
8. Cease manipulation of the global economy and adopt a policy of Fair Trade with the other sovereign nations of the world .
9 . Overturn all court rulings and opinions granting rights to corporations as persons .
10 .
Take immediate action to mitigate global climate change by converting to non-combustible , renewable energy sources .
11 . Decommission and dismantle all existing nuclear power plants and drop all plans for any further construction .
12 . Immediately establish and utilize a single payer health care system funded from reductions in military spending and corporate welfare .
The United States of America must meet these conditions or be isolated and contained through these sanctions imposed and upheld by the combined effort and cooperation of every sovereign nation on Earth .
America has squandered its opportunity as world leader and assumed the mantle of world tyrant .
Failure to bring this rogue , fascist state under control will ultimately mean death to unthinkable numbers and unimaginable , irreparable destruction .

FOG contains anywhere from 0.05 gram to as much as 3 grams of water per cubic meter .
Collecting those droplets can provide clean drinking wateroften in suprisingly large amounts .
To most people , fog is a bad thing .
It delays flights , endangers drivers , runs ships aground , ruins the view from mountaintops and generally makes for gray , damp weather .
But to some communities in the developing world , fog could mean getting enough clean water to drink .
Indeed , a small group of scientists and researchers is creating techniques for wringing the water from fog .
And their success suggests that fog collection may be among the simplest , cheapest and most environmentally friendly solutions to the water supply problems in certain remote regions .
Collecting fog may sound a bit like trying to grab actual fistfuls of air .
But the task is far less daunting when you consider that fog is hardly different from rain .
What differentiates the two is the size of the water droplets and the speed at which they fall .
Raindrops range from five millimeters to 0.5 millimeter in diameter and shoot toward the ground at speeds between two to nine meters per second .
Fog droplets , on the other hand , are a mere 40 to one micron in diameter ( 1,000 microns are 1 millimeter ) ; they fall at only about one to five centimeters per second .
Because they are so light and drop slowly , fog droplets travel almost horizontally , even in the lightest breeze .
Consequently , you can't catch fog in a bucket .
Instead a good fog collector is typically a vertical or almost vertical surface that fog droplets can drift onto and then run down .
Following this basic design , trees , in fact , make great natural fog collectors .
" There is a history in the southeastern part of the Arabian peninsula , where some people had built sort of mud walls around the trunk of a tree so that the fog that was collected by the tree would be restrained around the trunk when it dripped down in bigger drops , " explains Robert Schemenauer , a fog collection consultant in Canada .
" You would expect that in any arid part of the world .
Trees were collecting fog water and as it was dripping down , people would look at it and say , ' Hey , I need water , ' and they would stick a skin underneath or a gourd or a piece of cloth to get the water . "
Image : KEITH MAC QUARRIE MESH collects fog when water droplets land on it and run down to a container .
Scientists in Chile have experimented with man-made fog collectors for several decades .
The northern coastal areas of the country are extremely dry but get a lot of fog at the same time .
One such place is the fishing village Chungungo , home of one of the first fog water projects and still the largest project to date .
" There are extensive layers of low clouds over the ocean , so if you 're standing in Chungungo , you look up and there is the bottom of a cloud and it's a few hundred meters above your head , " Schemenauer says , describing the site .
" The wind pushes that cloud against these coastal hills .
So where the cloud is touching the hill , you have fog .
And that fog will flow through passes in the hills , it may cover the hilltops or it may just push against the hillside . "
Despite all that fog , the land gets virtually no precipitation .
The water droplets in the fog are carried over the slope by the wind , and eventually evaporate farther inland .
" You loose the droplets unless you have something sticking up from the ground that 's an efficient collector of the fog droplets , " Schemenauer explains .
" That could be vegetation , but the problem is that there is no vegetation to start with , so you can't get enough water on the ground to irrigate whatever seeds might be there . "
Enter artificial fog collectors .
Taking the fog - gathering technique of trees a step further , the artificial kind use large , vertical mesh panels .
As the fog drifts through the mesh , some of the droplets hit the weave , run down the panel and are collected .
This water can then be used for human consumption or agriculture or to reforest the area .
In that last case , the resulting vegetation can then function as natural fog collectors , eventually passing part of the gathered water on to the soil , feeding other plants , wildlife and small streams that humans can use .
Image : JANA OLIVIER SIMPLE DESIGN .
Because local materials are used to build the device , construction costs are kept low .
In the mid-1980s , Chilean researchers submitted a proposal to build fog collectors to a Canadian government agency .
The agency turned to Schemenauer , who was working on unrelated fog research at the time , for an evaluation .
" I met with the Chileans and looked at the situation and decided that this really was a realistic possibility for the deserts of the north , " he says .
Schemenauer and Pilar Cereceda of the Catholic University of Chile , along with other Chilean scientists , began to assess sites and eventually built an array of big , functional collectors on the coastal ridgeline above Chungungo .
It turned out that they could build the collectors from basic , cheap materials andif built in the right locationthese collectors yielded impressive amounts of high - quality drinking water .
How much water a fog collector can net varies , depending on the frequency of fog and its thickness .
The amount of water in a cubic meter of fog ranges from 0.05 gram to as much as 3 grams .
In the case of Chungungo , the fog collectors gathered an average of 3 liters of water per square meter of collecting surface per day .
In the initial configuration , 50 large collectors of 48 square meters each produced a daily average of about 11,000 liters of water .
This provided 33 liters of drinking water per day to each of the 330 villagers .
The number of collectors has since doubled .
Before the fog collectors were built in Chungungo , water had to be brought to the town by truck at considerable cost to both the residents and the municipality , which had subsidized the water price .
The villagers had less than half as much water .

FEASIBILITY STUDIES .
Scientists first use small fog collectors to assess whether or not a site has potential .
The success of this project and others in South America sparked interest in other parts of the world , and projects are now in various stages of development in many countries , including South Africa , the Dominican Republic , Israel , the Cape Verde and Canary Islands , and Nepal .
Fog collectors can be useful not only in arid climates but also in areas where water shortage becomes a problem during a certain time of year .
They have even proved valuable in some areas where water is abundant : " It has a big advantage in that the water that 's collected is not contaminated with bacteria , " Schemenauer points out .
" So in some places where there might be a lot of ground water , if it 's contaminated with bacteria , you might still look at this as an alternative way to provide water . "
Still , fog collection is not feasible everywhere , and possibly the most difficult part of establishing a new collection system is evaluating what sites are suitable .
" The science goes into choosing the right location , " Schemenauer says .
" You ca n't do this just anywhere . "
One person familiar with investigating potential sites is Francois Vitez , who worked on a fog collection project in Nepal for the Canadian Center for International Studies and Cooperation ( CECI ) : " I set up a series of small collectors in various places around Nepal to see what the potential was there . "
Vitez set up sampling meters that measured the fog collection over extensive periods of time .
" You have to monitor twice a day how much water you get from the fog collector . "
This job is usually taken over by a local person , who measures and records the resultsand then sends them to the scientist for evaluation .
" The main difference between Nepal and South America is that in South America you have more large - scale phenomena , " Vitez explains .
" In Nepal in the Himalayas , what you get is a bit different .
There are microclimates , microenvironment conditions , so depending on where you are in a valley and where the valley is from east to west makes a difference whether you get fog or not , so the technique of evaluating a site really needed to be developed there . "
In all , he sees potential in Nepal : " There are a lot of communities perched up high in the mountains and there is n't always a stream that can supply them with water . "
The alternative would be to pump the water up the mountain , which would require electricitywhich often just is n't available .

Part of what makes this technology very appealing is the fact that only simple materials are needed .
Thus , most or all components can be made in the countries where they are used , and construction costs remain low .
" Wooden poles , three of them , and then we 've got this shed cloth screen attached to these poles with a gutter on the bottom , so it 's very sort of third world , you know , very simple , cheap , and it works fantastically , " Jana Olivier says , laughing .
Olivier , a professor at the University of South Africa , has started two successful fog collection projects in South Africa .
" Basically , I collect water and I give it to communities that do n't have water , " she explains .
" One of them is a school communitythere are about 200 kids at school and there is no water at all , so they have had enough water now for two years for the first time . "
Some suggest that fog collecting takes water out of delicate ecosystems , but Shemenauer disagrees .
" We take such a tiny amount of fog water out that it has no effect , " he says .
" The fog is maybe 200 meters thick going over the ridgeline , and we work in the bottom four or five meters , so 196 meters of fog goes by above our collectors . "
Of the part that actually passes through the collectors , only half is retained , so he estimates that less than 1 percent of the total fog water passing over the hill is caught .
He also points out that the fog water is used close to where it is collected and thus does n't really leave the ecosystem .
" In places like California I do n't think it 's going to be the way to go , " Schemenauer adds about the future potential of fog water .
" I think it 's going to be more and more widely used in developing countries because there is just going to be tremendous need for it with growing populations and more demand for ground water . "

The problem is to write a set of functions to manage a variable number of byte queues , each with variable length , in a small , fixed amount of memory .
You should provide implementations of the following four functions : Q * createQ ( ) ; // Creates a FIFO byte queue , returning a handle to it .
void destroyQ ( Q * q ) ; //Destroy an earlier created byte queue .
void enQ ( Q * q , unsigned char b ) ; // Adds a new byte to a queue .
unsigned char deQ ( Q * q ) ; // Pops the next byte off the FIFO queue .
So , the output from the following set of calls : Q * q0 = createQ ( ) ; enQ ( q0 , 0 ) ; enQ ( q0 , 1 ) ; Q * q1 = createQ ( ) ; enQ ( q1 , 3 ) ; enQ ( q0 , 2 ) ; enQ ( q1 , 4 ) ; printf ( " %d " , deQ ( q0 ) ) ; printf ( " %d
" , deQ ( q0 ) ) ; enQ ( q0 , 5 ) ; enQ ( q1 , 6 ) ; printf ( " %d " , deQ ( q0 ) ) ; printf ( " %d
" , deQ ( q0 ) ) ; destroyQ ( q0 ) ; printf ( " %d " , deQ ( q1 ) ) ; printf ( " %d " , deQ ( q1 ) ) ; printf ( " %d
" , deQ ( q1 ) ) ; destroyQ ( q1 ) ; should be : 0 1 2 5 3 4 6 You can define the type Q to be whatever you want .
Your code is not allowed to call malloc ( ) or other heap management routines .
Instead , all storage ( other than local variables in your functions ) should be done in a provided array : unsigned char data [ 2048 ] ; Memory efficiency is important .
On average while your system is running , there will be a dozen or so queues with an average of 80 or so bytes in each queue .
Your functions may be asked to create a larger number of queues with less bytes in each .
Your functions may be asked to create a smaller number of queues with more bytes in each .
If you are unable to satisfy a request due to lack of memory , your code should call a provided failure function , which will not return : void onOutOfMemory ( ) ;
If the caller makes an illegal request , like attempting to deQ a byte from an empty queue , your code should call a provided failure function , which will not return : void onIllegalOperation ( ) ;
Worst - case performance when adding and removing bytes is more important than average - case performance .
There may be spikes in the number of queues allocated , or in the size of an individual queue .
Your code should not assume a maximum number of bytes in a queue ( other than that imposed by the total amount of memory available , of course ! )
You can assume that no more than 64 queues will be created at once .
WASHINGTON , March 18 — Almost two years before the Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly admitted this month that it had ignored its own rules when demanding telephone and financial records about private citizens , a top official in that program warned the bureau about widespread lapses , his lawyer said on Sunday .
The official , Bassem Youssef , who is in charge of the bureau ’s Communications Analysis Unit , said he discovered frequent legal lapses and raised concerns with superiors soon after he was assigned to the unit in early 2005 .
Stephen M. Kohn , the lawyer for Mr. Youssef , said his client told his superiors that the bureau had frequently failed to document an urgent national security need — proving “ exigent circumstances , ” in the bureau ’s language — when obtaining personal information without a court order through the use of “ national security letters . ”
Mr. Youssef said his superiors had initially minimized the scope of the problem and the likely violation of laws intended to protect privacy , Mr. Kohn said .

The Shipping Forecast can be heard four times a day on BBC Radio 4 , giving details of conditions in the seas around the UK , Ireland and beyond .
Each broadcast attracts hundreds of thousands of listeners , many of them with no connection to coastal waters - so what is its enduring appeal ?
Photographer Mark Power took images of all 31 marine areas The Shipping Forecast
Rivals talk of toppling Radio 4
There is a certain mystical quality to the names of the 31 marine areas included in the Shipping Forecast .
The sea is divided up into sections with names such as Viking , North Utsire , Humber , German Bight , Lundy and Fastnet .
And although references to " north veering north - east , three or less " and " smooth or slight " might mean nothing to land - based listeners , they are hugely significant to sailors who tune in to Radio 4 .
" What we 're interested in is the wind force direction and how quickly it 's going to change , " says Captain Paul Wood , who regularly sails cross -Channel ferries for P&O .
" The forecast will tell us what we 're getting , but we can also find out what 's causing that problem for us .
Shipping forecast areas in detail
Enlarge Map
" If it says ' low Finistere ' , I know where that is .
And if it says ' moving deep and north - east to Forties ' , I can immediately get a mental picture of where it 's going and what the weather will do .
" I know the sea areas like the back of my hand and they make perfect sense to us . "
Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer describes the forecast as " baffling " .
" It scans poetically .
It 's got a rhythm of its own .
It 's eccentric , it 's unique , it 's English .
" It 's slightly mysterious because nobody really knows where these places are .
It takes you into a faraway place that you can't really comprehend unless you 're one of these people bobbing up and down in the Channel . "
The forecast appears daily on Radio 4 at 0048 , 0520 , 1201 and 1754
The broadcast was already part of the Home Service when it was rebranded as Radio 4 , 40 years ago this week .
The schedule for the first day of Radio 4 , on 30 September 1967 , has an entry from 2345 to 2348 , describing a " forecast for coastal waters " .
Produced by the Met Office in Aberdeen and scripted for the BBC 's weather presenters , it is now nine minutes in length .
" It 's about the only bit of blurb that we read without having any input .
Everything else is ad libbed , and this is scripted , " says weather presenter Rob McElwee .
If I 'd actually sat down and thought about the logistics , I would never have started
Mark Power , who photographed the UK 's coastal waters
He prefers to read the bulletin " cold " , rather than rehearsing it , and uses his thumb or a pen to keep his place on the page .
" The art of the writer is to try to make it fit into the artificial sea areas , even though the weather may not fit there , " Mr McElwee adds .
" Sometimes you get some pretty bizarre occurrences - the south of North Utsire , west Cromarty and east Forth all combined in one area , which sort of defeats the object of having the areas in the first place .
But sometimes it happens . "
Photography
The 31 areas were brought to life a decade ago when Magnum photographer Mark Power took a picture of each and turned them into a book .
McElwee often reads the forecast at the end of a 12 - hour reporting shift
" These are quite common now but I 'd never seen one before .
It did spark off certain pictures in my mind of these imaginary landscapes that I had built up in my head over all of these years . "
He spent four years travelling around the coast , using his own savings when his applications for grants were turned down .
" If I 'd actually sat down and thought about the logistics , I would never have started .
But I guess , in the end , I just did n't , and I thought I would see how it went . "
He put a caption on each image , giving the 0600 forecast for the day when that photograph was taken .
A " book - of - the - week " recommendation in The Observer led to a first print run of 2,000 being snapped up " in about three weeks " , Mr Power says , with two subsequent editions also selling out .
" Ten thousand copies does n't sound very much , but I 'm not David Bailey - I was n't anybody , in fact .
I am slightly worried about anybody who is bobbing up and down in the Channel whose sole way of keeping from sinking is by listening to us on long wave
Mark Damazer , Radio 4 controller
" I 'm very proud that there 's a serious photography book on the shelves of 9,500 people who would n't normally buy a book like that . "
But he admits many people did write to him , expressing disappointment that he had gone ahead with the project .
" I suppose it was like making a movie of a book and realising the characters are not supposed to look like that . "
So does the forecast have a future on Radio 4 in these days of satellites , mobile phones and computers ?
Mr Damazer admits to being " slightly worried about anybody who is bobbing up and down in the Channel whose sole way of keeping from sinking is by listening to us on long wave " .
" My advice would be to invest in a GPS system , " he jokes .
" But I still wo n't take it off because it 's a glory of its own . "
Americans are accustomed to Vice President Dick Cheney ’s waiting out a terrorist threat in a “ secure undisclosed location . ”
Now it seems that Mr. Cheney wears the cloak of invisibility in secure disclosed locations .
The Associated Press reported that Mr. Cheney ’s office ordered the Secret Service last September to destroy all records of visitors to the official vice presidential mansion — right after The Washington Post sued for access to the logs .
That move was made in secret , naturally .
It came out only because of another lawsuit , filed by a private group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , seeking the names of conservative religious figures who visited the vice president ’s residence .
This disdain for accountability is distressing , but not surprising .
Mr. Cheney has had it on display from his first days in office , when he refused to name the energy - industry executives who met with him behind closed doors to draft an energy policy .
In a similar way , Mr. Cheney seems unconcerned about little things like checks and balances and traditional American notions of judicial process .
At one point , he gave himself the power to selectively declassify documents and selectively leak them to reporters .
In a recent commencement address , he declaimed against prisoners who had the gall to “ demand the protections of the Geneva Convention and the Constitution of the United States . ”

I cannot find any other information on this video link ,
It does n’t look fake and I want to know if you can find out if these people were ever arrested and what happened to the child .
It appears that a small child , approx 4 years or so old , was given ecstacy by teenage parents or caregivers while being driven around in a car unbuckled .
Also an infant appears to be in the car too .
Please let me know anymore information on this .
It is truly disturbing and makes me sick to my stomach that someone did this and they should be prosecuted .

The Road to Curitiba
By ARTHUR LUBOW
Published : May 20 , 2007
The Wire Opera House ( 1992 ) , completed in about two months under the guidance of Curitiba ’s visionary architect - mayor , Jaime Lerner .
On Saturday mornings , children gather to paint and draw in the main downtown shopping street of Curitiba , in southern Brazil .
More than just a charming tradition , the child ’s play commemorates a key victory in a hard - fought , ongoing war .
Back in 1972 , the new mayor of the city , an architect and urban planner named Jaime Lerner , ordered a lightning transformation of six blocks of the street into a pedestrian zone .
The change was recommended in a master plan for the city that was approved six years earlier , but fierce objections from the downtown merchants blocked its implementation .
Lerner instructed his secretary of public works to institute the change quickly and asked how long it would take .
“ He said he needed four months , ” Lerner recalled recently .
“ I said , ‘ Forty - eight hours . ’
He said , ‘ You ’re crazy . ’
I said , ‘ Yes , I ’m crazy , but do it in 48 hours . ’ ” The municipal authorities were able to accomplish it in three days , beginning on a Friday night and installing paving , lighting , planters and furniture by the end of the day on Monday .
“ Being a very weak mayor , if I start to do it and take too long , everyone could stop it through a juridical demand , ” Lerner went on to explain .
“ If they stop the work , it ’s finished .
I had to do it very fast , at least in part .
Because we had discussed it a great deal .
Sometimes they have to have a demonstration effect . ”
The demonstration worked .
Within days , impressed by the increase in their business , the once - recalcitrant shop owners were demanding an extension of the traffic - free district .
Some diehard motorists , however , sulked .
Lerner heard that a group of them were planning to disregard the prohibition and drive their cars into the street on a Saturday morning .
So he contrived an unbreachable defense .
With the cooperation of the city ’s teachers and a donation of rolls of newsprint and boxes of paint , on that morning he assembled several hundred children in the street , where they sat and drew pictures .
“ It was to say , ‘ This is being done for children and their parents — do n’t even think of putting cars there , ’ ” he told me .
The sputtered - out protest was the last resistance to the pedestrianization of the shopping area , which has since expanded from the original 6 blocks to encompass about 15 today .
“ Of course , this was very emblematic , ” Lerner recounted .
“ We were trying to say , ‘ This city is not for cars . ’
When many mayors at the time were planning for individual cars , we were countervailing . ”
He observed that it was emblematic in another way also : “ From that point , they said , ‘ If he could do this in 72 hours , he can do anything . ’
It was a good strategy . ”
An opening salvo , the creation of the pedestrian zone inaugurated a series of programs by Lerner and his colleagues that made Curitiba a famous model of late - 20th - century urban planning .
In the early 1970s , when Brazil was welcoming any industry , no matter how toxic its byproducts , Curitiba decided to admit only nonpolluters ; to accommodate them , it constructed an industrial district that reserved so much land for green space that it was derided as a “ golf course ” until it succeeded in filling up with major businesses while its counterparts in other Latin American cities were flagging .
Through the creation of two dozen recreational parks , many with lakes to catch runoff in low - lying areas that flood periodically , Curitiba managed , at a time of explosive population growth , to increase its green areas from 5 square feet per inhabitant to an astounding 560 square feet .
The city promoted “ green ” policies before they were fashionable and called itself “ the ecological capital of Brazil ” in the 1980s , when there were no rivals for such a title .
Today , Curitiba remains a pilgrimage destination for urbanists fascinated by its bus system , garbage - recycling program and network of parks .
It is the answer to what might otherwise be a hypothetical question :
How would cities look if urban planners , not politicians , took control ?
Although the children who paint on Saturday mornings are no longer needed to protect the downtown shopping street from cars , the battle to keep Curitiba green is never - ending .
Indeed , some say it is going badly these days .
The rivers , once crystalline , reek of untreated sewage .
The bus system that has won admirers throughout the world appears to be nearing capacity ; what ’s more , Curitiba , by some measures , has a higher per capita ownership of private cars than any city in Brazil — even exceeding BrasÃlia , a city that was designed for cars .
Curitiba ’s garbage - recycling rate has been declining over the last six or seven years , and the only landfill in the municipal region will be full by the end of 2008 .
Jorge Wilheim , the São Paulo architect who drafted Curitiba ’s master plan in 1965 , says : “ When we made the plan , the population was 350,000 .
We thought in a few years it would reach 500,000 .
But it has grown much bigger . ”
The municipality of Curitiba today has 1.8 million people , and the population of the metropolitan region is 3.2 million .
“ I know the plan of Curitiba is very famous , and I am the first to enjoy it , but that was in ’ 65 , ” Wilheim continues .
“ The metropolitan region must have a new vision . ”

The Hillary Dilemma
Despite the breathless media reports about every jot and tittle of the Democratic contest for President , not all that much has changed in the last year .
Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has consistently been the frontrunner in national surveys , sometimes by narrow spreads and frequently by sizeable margins .
So far she has weathered the entry of Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , a far more charismatic and exciting candidate , and she has held off any sizeable gains by the other two major contenders , former Senator John Edwards ( D - NC ) and Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico ( D - NM ) .
The main stumbling block for Clinton has been Iowa , where she continues to trail in the trial heats for the first caucus .
But no one else is so well positioned to survive an initial defeat .
Arguably , her strongest potential opponents , moderates Senator Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) and former Governor Mark Warner ( D - VA ) , decided against running , and the other formidable possible candidate , former Vice President Al Gore , is almost certainly not going to run .
The other announced Democratic candidates show little sign of breaking out of the pack .
So it 's smooth sailing for Hillary , right ?
No one questions her intelligence , abilities , policy aptitude , and experience ( hey , this would be her third term ! )
And thanks to the deep unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq War , wo n't any Democrat be favored in 2008 ?
How can the Democrats blow this election , with all their built - in advantages ?
Well , the sailing is going to get rough , and those built - in advantages are somewhat illusory .
But everything depends on whether Democrats -- and the country in general -- consider the big picture prior to voting in January and then November .
It 's anybody 's guess whether they will .
The Crystal Ball is the first to admit that Clinton is a substantial , maybe heavy early favorite for the nomination .
Hillary has become the " woman candidate " in a party strongly influenced by women in its voting base ( if not in public office ) .
Her first - tier opponents are also hobbled in various ways .
The inexperienced Obama is a relative novice at politics , and many Democrats -- including African - American Dems -- are worried that America is n't " ready " for a black President .
( Why America would be ready for a woman and not an African American is a mystery to the Crystal Ball . )
Edwards was an unimpressive Senator and nominee for Vice President in 2004 who has been unable to shake his image as a " pretty boy . "
Richardson has a better resume than all his rivals put together , but this unpolished performer has been unable to break through in fundraising or the debates .
Moreover , the yearning among the public for the end of President Bush 's reign is palpable , and it may simply be impossible to stop any Democratic ticket in November 2008 .
Put aside Democratic antipathy toward Bush ; most Independents and many Republicans are n't listening to Bush anymore , and that 's a big problem for him and his party .
As political scientist Richard Neustadt wrote in 1960 , the essential presidential power is " the power to persuade . "
A Chief Executive has no chance to persuade if few are paying attention .
A President 's party has little chance to win if the public is so soured on an administration that it seeks mainly to punish the incumbent in an election .
To top it off , the GOP electorate appears deeply divided among four major candidates ( Rudy Giuliani , John McCain , Mitt Romney , and Fred Thompson ) and generally dissatisfied and unenthusiastic about their choices -- another effect of the " Bush depression " among Republicans .
Yet Hillary Clinton has her own unique set of difficulties , and neither her party nor the general electorate has focused on them in a comprehensive way .
Let 's take a look :
* There is something about Hillary -- the person , not the politician -- that upsets and repels tens of millions of Americans .
Fairly or not , she is seen as cold , calculating , and ruthless , an off - putting combination of characteristics .
Is some of this sexist ?
Regrettably , you bet it is .
We laugh whenever we hear Senator Clinton derided as overly ambitious .
Which of her male rivals would not eagerly walk over both grandmothers laid end to end in order to make their way into the White House ?
Stomach - turning ambition is in the nature of the political beast .
But with Mrs. Clinton , the public reaction is based on far more than this one quality .
For example , almost every voter now has heard something about her leading role in covering up for her husband 's serial infidelities over the decades .
This is an unusual role for a spouse , even in the twisted world of politics .
Most normal people cannot fathom it , except in the context of a supposed " corrupt bargain " between two power - hungry individuals .
* The result of the voters ' harsh personal evaluation of Mrs. Clinton is obvious .
In many surveys , Clinton runs 3 - 5 percentage points worse than the other widely known Democratic candidates , Obama and Gore , when matched up against the best - known Republican presidential candidates for November 2008 .
Incredibly , close to half of adult Americans already say they have an " unfavorable " opinion of her , and 43 - 46 percent of Americans say that they would not even consider voting for her -- an extraordinarily high proportion this early in a campaign that leaves little room for error later on .
Independents , moderates and swing voters are concentrated in this anti-Clinton group , not just Republicans .
Again , maybe the toxic combination of Bush and Iraq will guarantee any Democrat 's triumph , but should the GOP 's toxicity lessen ( perhaps by means of troop withdrawals by election day ) , Democrats will perhaps be taking an unnecessary chance of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory with Clinton as their standard - bearer .
* Compared to other candidates about whom the public knows much less , Clinton will have to live with the current public perceptions of her , for the most part .
Too much water has gone under the bridge and over the dam since the Clintons burst on the national scene in 1992 .
Mrs. Clinton likes to say that she is the most famous person nobody knows , but in fact , most Americans think they have her number .
Voters are uninformed about the details of politics and policy , but as the great political scientist V.O.
Key once wrote , " Voters are not fools . "
The final several percent of swing voters needed to get Hillary Clinton over the top in the general election will vote for her only with the greatest reluctance , more as a way to stop a Republican than as an endorsement of her .
That is a shaky way to start a Presidency .
* Let 's suppose Mrs. Clinton wins in November 2008 .
Democrats would have to live with the consequences .
There is simply no question that Senator Clinton would be the third deeply polarizing President in a row , following her husband 's divisive and partially wasted tenure and George W. Bush 's deeply disappointing turn at bat .
We bet that she would have a short honeymoon and would be unable to convince her millions of critics and detractors that she had changed -- or was different than they long ago concluded she was .
At a time when the nation could use a unifier and a healer -- to the extent that any President can perform those roles -- partisan warfare would be at fever pitch from Day One .
* Republicans hope that Mrs. Clinton is the nominee because they believe she may be the easiest to beat .
Circumstances may prove them right or wrong , but there is another reason why they should root for her .
The inevitable controversies of the Presidency would erode her shaky support among swing voters faster than is usually the case .
The midterm election of 2010 may not be the fiasco for Democrats that 1994 was - there were few historical parallels for Bill Clinton 's electoral disaster in his first term - yet the GOP would almost certainly make a good start on the comeback trail for control of Congress , governorships , and the state legislatures ( in the all - important redistricting election that will determine much of the legislative line - drawing for a full decade ) .
Granted , it is virtually impossible to get partisans to think about their long - term interests , but in this respect , Democrats would probably pay a sizeable price throughout the 2010s for a Clinton victory in 2008 .
* Democrats ( and some Independents ) have fallen back in love with Bill Clinton , and this has caused a case of mass amnesia about his ( and her ) many scandals from the 1990s .
The muted reactions to the two new books on Hillary Clinton by Carl Bernstein and Jeff Gerth & Don Van Natta , Jr. suggest that voters have already absorbed the embarrassing fundamentals and factored the scandals into their fixed perceptions of the Clintons .
But do leopards change their spots ?
Suppose the news media choose to break more recent ( post - January 20 , 2001 ) information about the former President ?
How much additional tolerance for a continuation of the tired Clinton soap opera is there in the American public ?
If this happens , Democrats will suffer -- whether the revelations come before the nomination is decided or after the nominee ( if Mrs. Clinton ) is chosen .
As First Gentleman , Bill Clinton will also be reasonably subject to the highest level of scrutiny for four or eight more years .
Would the public ignore additional indiscretions as more of the same , or recoil anew and punish Democrats at the polls in future elections ?
One can argue this either way , though we think the latter outcome is much more likely .
Let 's finish up this essay by broadening our critique , and offering a point that ought to concern all Americans .
Every four years , observers pronounce the presidential contenders to be a " weak field , " and that is as unfair as it is predictable .
A much more reasonable criticism is directly related to the dominating presence of Hillary Clinton in this election cycle .
The population of the United States now exceeds 300 million , and the talent pool of the world 's only superpower is deep and rich .
How is it that the country is on the verge of filling its highest office for the sixth consecutive term from one of two families ?
That every President from 1989 to 2017 may be a Bush or a Clinton is a national disgrace .
What has happened to the American Republic ?
How does it differ from a banana republic -- where a couple of dominant families often run everything for generations ?
Have we driven the vast majority of the potentially best Presidents out of the contest because of the high personal and professional costs of running for office ?
Are we the voters responsible because we are too lazy to go beyond the simplistic attractions of familiarity and high name identification ?
Or , most disturbing of all , has our political system become ossified , so that we are too fearful of change to seek out the most outstanding leaders among us for the toughest job in the world ?
We do n't pretend to have the answers .
But we are shocked and dismayed that more people are n't even bothering to ask the questions .
Dr. Sabato , the Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia , founded the Center for Politics in 1998 .
The legends preceded it : chocolate so dark it ceased to taste like chocolate .
Chocolate so intense it required cautionary statements .
Chocolate so fine it cost $ 32 per pound .
One of my coworkers is a fan of dark chocolate , and he was the one who first told me about the 99 % - cocoa Lindt chocolate bar .
Such purity is exceptionally rare .
A normal Hershey bar is rumored to contain about 11 % cocoa ( and could get worse ) .
The “ Special Dark ” Hershey bar is just 45 % cocoa .
Even the “ Extra Dark ” variant clocks in at only 60 % .
Connoisseurs must look to a more exotic manufacturer .
The Lindt Excellence line of fine chocolate bars is widely available in the United States .
Dark chocolate versions with 85 % cocoa can be found with relative ease at chains as plebeian as Target .
Such ubiquity is not shared by the 99 % bar .
For it , one must travel to a Lindt chocolate store .
One exists in the Mall of America .
At the store , I was greeted by two pleasant young women offering free chocolate samples to browsers .
My goal clear , I declined their truffles and proceeded straight to the chocolate bar section .
There , on the wall , I saw it : a 99 % - pure bar of cocoa .
One of the saleswomen regarded my choice with concern .
She made sure that I knew what I was getting into , that I knew I should enjoy the bar slowly , at home , with proper reverence and plenty of water .
Undeterred by the cautionary statements , I asserted my comfort with the chocolate and completed my purchase .
On the way home , I picked up a more mundane 85 % bar for comparison .
The first thing I noticed was that the 99 % bar was smaller than the 85 % bar .
Although the external packages shared identical dimensions , the 99 % bar had a net weight of only 50 grams — half that of the 85 % bar .
That smaller size was not reflected in the price , for the 99 % bar cost 10 % more than the 85 % bar , or 120 % more by weight .
The ingredient lists were very similar ( chocolate , cocoa powder , cocoa butter , and sugar ) , but the 85 % bar contained vanilla while the 99 % bar had none .
Both were made in France — odd , seeing as how Lindt is a Swiss company .
I carefully opened the cardboard shell of the 99 % bar and pulled out a foil tray .
I was more than a bit surprised to find warnings on the wrapper that instructed me to work my way up to the 99 % bar via the 70 % and 85 % versions .
Not wanting to disobey a piece of foil , I pulled out my 85 % bar and warmed up my palate with a few nibbles .
Suitably prepared , I returned to the main event .
The remainder of the foil warning cautioned the consumer to limit indulgence to small pieces left to melt on one ’s tongue .
Oddly , that part of the warning existed only in the English and German versions of the instructions .
Perhaps the French and Italians are naturally better versed in the art of chocolate appreciation .
I took a deep breath and peeled back the wrapper from the fancy tray .
Inside was a thin wafer of the darkest chocolate I have ever seen .
I cautiously broke off a square , an act reported with a crisp snap .
Ready to experience Chocolate Zen , I closed my eyes and laid the square on my tongue .
My mouth closed , and my body heat began to release the essence of the bar .
I was at first struck by a mild bitterness , but that quickly passed ( and was not to return for the rest of the session ) .
The super - dark chocolate melted quickly and imparted a decidedly creamy mouthfeel , not unlike a fine caramel .
Perhaps the most surprising trait was the absence of chocolate flavor , at least not in the traditional sense .
The confection was not tasteless — no , it was simply unlike any chocolate I had ever experienced .
Even the 85 % bar was a world apart .
The 99 % chocolate was an experience of purity .
No chemical aftertaste .
No waxy mouthfeel .
Nothing to distract from the singular cocoa focus .
To compare the 99 % bar with a Hershey ’s dark bar would be to insult the Lindt creation , for they exist not in the same realm .
Whereas the Hershey ’s bar is overtly bitter and artificial , the 99 % cocoa is soothing and natural .
Neither are very sweet , but while the Hershey ’s bar longs for sugar , the Lindt imparts an air of balance in its lack .
I sampled the 85 % and 99 % bars in turn several times , exploring different consumption techniques and speeds .
All methods were enjoyable in their own ways .
After consuming just three squares of the 99 % bar , I felt it was time to bring the experience to an end .
The richness of the chocolate was leaving me satiated , and I did n’t want to waste either bar when I was not in the proper mindset for full enjoyment of the act .
If you get the opportunity to try high - quality , high - purity chocolate , I recommend that you indulge .
If nothing else , you will gain a new appreciation for the rift between American commodity chocolate and what is possible from the world ’s elite chocolatiers .
Users may think that their personal data is safe when they use a secure login page online , but that 's quite far from the truth .
In fact , everything from the contents of your e-mail , who your friends and acquaintances are , and almost anything else you can think of could be easily exposed by hackers if browsed via WiFi network , security firm Errata Security pointed out in a recent paper presented at this year 's Black Hat 2007 and seen by Ars Technica .
The method by which this data could become exposed is nothing new , but it is simpler than most " man - in - the - middle " attacks , says Errata .
Many web services , such as Gmail , BlogSpot , Facebook , MySpace , LinkedIn , and Google Adsense use cookies to identify session information after the user has already logged in .
Using a basic packet sniffer over a WiFi network and a proxy server to pass the information through , a determined hacker can easily " sidejack " the session information as his own by stealing session IDs straight out of the WiFi signal .
He could then use that session ID to represent himself as the original user , says Errata , which would allow him to do things like make blog posts , unfriend all of your Facebook friends ( * gasp * ) , and read or send e-mails .
Even though some sites , such as Gmail , offer secure , SSL - based login pages , things are n't quite so secure post - login .
Unlike many bank web sites that offer a secure browsing experience for the entire duration of the session , most sites dump the user right back out into unsecured territory after logging in , thus exposing their personal data to anyone who wants to get at it .
The report provides several examples of session data pulled from directly from Facebook , MySpace , Yahoo Mail , and BlogSpot sessions .
These concerns raise questions as to why some of these sites simply do n't secure the entire session .
In fact , some Gmail users have been asking why encrypted sessions are not not the default setting for years now ( or at least an option that one can turn on in the preferences ) , but those requests appear to have fallen on deaf ears thus far .
Errata says that most of today 's Web 2.0 sites do n't use SSL throughout the session because of costs involved .
That does n't answer the question as to why some sites do n't offer it by default , however , even though such an option is already available .
For example , Gmail sessions are not secured by default , but users can change the URL prefix to " https " while using Gmail in order to secure all of their data .
However , Errata counters by pointing out that by the time users manually enter " https , " they have already sent a session ID across the wire at least once .
Of course , there are several easy — if not inconvenient , at times — solutions to protect your data .
The obvious answer would be to stick to secured WiFi networks that you know and trust ( such as your home network ) that would not have any strangers on it running packet sniffers .
But if you do need to use public access points , avoid accessing web pages that might transmit personal information .
Those who want to be extremely careful , however , will want to follow Errata 's proposed solution : " [ U ] sers should never use a Wi - Fi hotspot unless they are using VPN ( virtual private networking ) or SSL ( secure sockets layer ) to access their accounts , " the company says .

Facebook WASHINGTON 
Six weeks after a fatal Minneapolis bridge collapse prompted criticism of federal spending priorities , the Senate approved a transportation and housing bill Wednesday containing at least $ 2 billion for pet projects that include a North Dakota peace garden , a Montana baseball stadium and a Las Vegas history museum .
That 's not the half of it .
Total spending on transportation " earmarks " next year is likely to be about $ 8 billion , when legislative projects from a previously approved , five - year highway bill are factored in .
A newly released report by the Department of Transportation 's inspector general identified 8,056 earmarks totaling $ 8.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October , or 13.5 % of the Transportation Department 's $ 63 billion spending plan .
THE REPORT : Read the inspector general 's report
The inspector general 's report found that the vast majority of earmarks — project - specific spending instructions written into bills , usually by lawmakers — were not evaluated on their merits , and that many " low - priority " earmarks often squeezed out more important projects .
The Federal Aviation Administration , for example , had to delay updating high - priority air - traffic control towers in favor of lower priority facilities requested by legislators , the inspector general found .
The report — requested by Sen. Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , a vocal critic of earmarks — does not name the airports .
After the Minneapolis bridge collapse last month , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , and others pointed out that Congress for years failed to fund repairs on scores of " structurally deficient " bridges even as lawmakers earmarked money for projects such as the " bridge to nowhere " in Alaska .
Rep. Jim Oberstar , D - Minn. , who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , has proposed a temporary 5 - cent - per - gallon gas tax increase that he said would raise $ 25 billion over three years to help reduce the backlog of critical bridge repairs .
Among Oberstar 's earmarks in the House transportation bill is $ 250,000 for a bike trail in his district , which he has defended as legitimate .
He did not respond to a request for comment .
Sen .
Patty Murray , the Washington state Democrat who chairs the subcommittee that drafted the $ 106 billion transportation and housing bill , defended the bill and pointed to insertion this week of an additional $ 1 billion for bridge repairs .
Coburn 's staff identified 500 earmarks in the bill , totaling $ 2 billion , that were publicly disclosed under new rules designed to shed some light on the practice .
" No one in America seriously believes that bike paths , peace gardens and baseball stadiums are more important national priorities than bridge and road repairs , " Coburn said .
Coburn and a handful of other lawmakers routinely try to strip bills of earmarks , only to see colleagues crush them with bipartisan efficiency .
On Tuesday , Coburn offered an amendment prohibiting spending on earmarks until every structurally deficient bridge was fixed .
It lost , 82 to 14 .
The bill , which President Bush has threatened to veto , must now be reconciled with the House - approved version .
That measure contains , among other earmarks , money for a California mule and packer museum .

‘ Everyone ’s a hero , everyone ’s a star , ” sings Jon Bon Jovi on his 2005 album , “ Have a Nice Day . ”
It ’s an insipid song , but a fitting anthem for what has become a thoroughly insipid age .
Once upon a time , you had to do something truly exceptional to qualify as a full - fledged hero : single - handedly hold off a battalion of enemy soldiers to allow your platoon to escape , or rescue 100 children from a Nazi concentration camp .
But today , just showing up at your Army recruiting station makes you an instant hero -- and getting yourself hurt or killed doubles your heroism , even if you were sound asleep when your supply convoy went over an IED .
The empty rhetoric of heroism is everywhere these days .
You know what I mean .
Pat Tillman -- the former NFL star -- is “ an American hero , ” apparently because he volunteered for duty along with several hundred thousand other people , then had the misfortune to be accidentally shot by his own side .
Every wounded service member is a “ hero ” too : Sen .
Hillary Clinton proudly sponsored the “ Heroes at Home Act of 2007 , ” intended to improve medical care for wounded military personnel , and the Defense Department recently sponsored the “ Hiring Heroes Career Fair ” to encourage companies to hire wounded veterans .
No soldier left behind !
Bah , humbug .

Before you run me out of town on a rail , let me be clear : I respect the service and sacrifice of the troops .
It takes guts to volunteer for the military .
Injured service members deserve top- quality care , and the families of those killed deserve our deepest compassion .
Soldiers , firefighters , police and many others accept risk and privation to serve the public , and we should be grateful .
But it ’s a big mistake to mix up the idea of service -- or the idea of sacrifice and suffering -- with the idea of heroism .
As most dictionaries explain , true heroism involves “ extraordinary courage , fortitude or greatness of soul . ”
So firefighters who take unusual risks to save others can legitimately be called heroes -- but just showing up for work and turning on a fire hose when required is n’t quite enough .
Similarly , suffering does n’t magically turn an ordinary person , however beloved , into a hero .
Some of the office workers who died on 9/11 were truly heroic , sacrificing their own chance of escape to help others .
But many of those who died never even got a chance to be heroic .
Distinguishing heroism from service and suffering is important for two reasons .
First , it ’s always worth fighting the Lake Wobegon effect because , in a world where “ all the children are above average , ” the truly special child gets no recognition , and genuine acts of exceptional courage are trivialized .

Take Jason Dunham , a 22 - year - old Marine corporal who , in 2004 , threw his helmet and then his body on top of an Iraqi insurgent ’s grenade , saving the lives of the Marines around him .
Dunham died of his wounds and became one of only two soldiers in the Iraq war to be awarded the Medal of Honor , the highest military decoration in the United States .
But in a world where every service member is a “ hero , ” how many Americans have heard of Dunham ’s fatal courage ?
There are plenty of other genuine heroes whose names will never be recorded , like the utility workers described by a Cornell University research team :
On 9/11 , “ they went into the flooded Verizon building just north of World Trade Center 6 , risking electrocution in chest - deep water and kerosene to shut off the building ’s massive circuit - breakers by hand . ”
But when each of the thousands of stockbrokers and secretaries in the World Trade Center qualifies for the “ everyone ’s a hero ” award , why bother to identify those whose actions were unusually selfless ?
But there ’s a deeper reason to be wary of the “ everyone ’s a hero ” rhetoric .
Simply put , it fits neatly alongside other terms beloved of the powers that be , such as “ warrior ” and “ the Homeland ” :
It ’s part of the language of fascism .
For a chilling account of another society in which “ the devaluation of the concept of heroism ” was “ proportional to the frequency of its use and abuse , ” check out Ilya Zemtsov ’s “ The Encyclopedia of Soviet Life . ”
In 1938 , Zemtsov notes , the Soviet Union instituted “ the title ‘ Hero of Socialist Labor ’ . . . .
Thousands of those heroes emerged .
. . .
The hero was supposed to die in the name of Stalin during wartime [ and ] give his or her all in labor on communist constructions .
. . . [ But ] a person upon whom the title ‘ hero ’ is bestowed has often performed no heroic deed whatsoever , but may receive the title . . . merely in return for displaying loyalty and / or diligence .
. . .
With time , the awarding of the title came to be used as a token to be disbursed or withheld according to political considerations .
. . . “

In other words , comrades , whenever it seems as if they ’re handing out “ hero ” medals for free , look out :
There ’s usually a hidden price .

This post was last updated : Friday , May 9 , 2014 at 2:28 PM , Central European Time ( CET )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Vibe magazine has dubbed him " B - Rock . "
He 's getting shout - outs in some of the most popular hip - hop singles of the summer .
He 's even had a high - profile meeting with Ludacris .
Vibe magazine , one of the leading publications covering hip - hop , put Obama on its cover over the headline " It's Obama Time . "
Barack Obama might not be leading the Democratic presidential field in national polls , but the freshman senator has managed to capture the imagination of the hip - hop community , comprised mostly of rap artists , music industry professionals , activists and young fans of all races .
Despite Obama 's sometimes critical opinion of rap music , the candidate 's name is being dropped on iPods , car stereos and music Web sites across the country .
Take one of the summer 's biggest songs :
In his new single " The People , " Common uses the lyric : " My raps ignite the people like Obama , " while the song 's music video flashes on an " Obama ' 08 " bumper sticker .
" He 's fresh , you know , he 's got good style , " Common told CNN .
" As far as people in my age group and people that love hip - hop , there 's a love for Obama .
He represents progress .
He represents what hip - hop is about .
Hip - hop is about progress , the struggle . "
Then there 's " Say Something , " a new track from the popular Brooklyn - based lyricist Talib Kweli , who raps : " Speak to the people like Barack Obama . "
Those references follow a song from Asian - American rapper Jin , who recently penned an up - tempo song called " Open Letter 2 Obama " that 's garnered more than 320,000 hits on Jin's MySpace page .
Jin 's song is so popular online that the Obama campaign is offering it as a free cell phone ring - tone on its Web site , and Obama was introduced with the song before his speech to the College Democrats National Convention in South Carolina in July .
Part of Obama 's hip - hop appeal is simply cosmetic -- he is young and African - American .
It also does n't hurt that his name just works better in a rhyming verse than , say , " Kucinich . "
" More than anything his name is a nugget of lyrical gold , " said Kweli .
" It sounds like a gunshot going off ... Obama rhymes with a lot of things . "
Kweli told CNN that Obama , 46 , is a " refreshing face like [ Muhammad ] Ali in ' 63 " and that among Kweli 's friends , Obama would win a presidential poll overwhelmingly .
Kweli , who said he has n't voted in years and may not vote in 2008 because he believes the political system is broken , explained why Obama has piqued his interest .
" His youth , his being black , the way that he speaks , the way that he lays out his point of view , " Kweli said .
" It 's someone who looks more like you .
I do n't mean black , but I mean the young thing .
And his name is Barack Obama .
This country is become more and more multicultural . "
Asked if the senator listens to hip - hop , campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki directed CNN to a June 27 interview he gave to New York City radio station Hot 97 .
" I 'm old school , so generally , generally , I 'm more of a jazz guy , a Miles Davis , a John Coltrane guy , more of a Marvin Gaye , Stevie Wonder kind of guy , " Obama said in the interview .
" But having said that , I 'm current enough that on my iPod I 've got a little bit of Jay - Z. I 've got a little Beyonce . "
It 's unclear if Obama 's emergence as a hip - hop byword will have any mobilizing effect on young voters or among African - Americans , a demographic he is working hard to cultivate , especially in South Carolina , a crucial early primary where state partly leaders say blacks could make up half of Democratic voters .
What 's more likely is that opponents would try to turn Obama 's relationship with hip - hop -- however tenuous it might be -- into a cultural wedge issue in a general election were Obama to win the nomination .
The tactic has been used on the campaign trail before .
In his 1992 bid for the White House , Bill Clinton blasted recording artist Sister Souljah over her controversial remarks on racial violence , a move designed to appeal to centrist voters .
Fifteen years later , rap music is still a lightning rod in the culture wars , and Obama might be reluctant to embrace hip - hop in the same way hip - hop is embracing him .
" He might say something I do n't agree with , that definitely might happen , " Kweli said .
" But whatever .
It just depends on what it is .
... I think Hillary Clinton voting to go to war is a bigger mistake than Bill Clinton saying something bad about Sister Souljah . "
Since declaring his candidacy , Obama has maintained a complicated relationship with rap music .
He has criticized the industry on several occasions for failing to recognize the power it holds over young people .
His criticism has also frustrated some artists , bloggers , and even music executives , proving that despite all the attention he is getting in song lyrics , Obama can't assume the hip - hop world has his back .
In April , in the midst of the controversy surrounding radio host Don Imus , Obama was quoted by The Associated Press as saying rappers also bear some responsibility for degrading language .
Russell Simmons , co-founder of Def Jam records , responded in the New York Times magazine , calling Obama a " mouse , too , like everybody else , " and saying that instead of reforming rap lyrics , " What we need to reform is the conditions that create these lyrics .
Obama needs to reform the conditions of poverty . "
In the September issue of Vibe , one of the hip - hop industry 's leading publications , Obama agreed with some of Simmons ' criticism but stressed that rap music 's influence is undeniable .
" So yes , my job is to focus on poverty , education , health care , but I think we have to acknowledge the power of culture in affecting how our kids see themselves and the decisions they make , " Obama told the magazine , which put the presidential candidate on its cover above the headline : " It 's Obama Time . "
Common , who hails from Obama 's hometown of Chicago , Illinois , and also attends Obama 's church , Trinity United Church of Christ , said he is willing to accept some criticism of hip - hop as long as Obama wins .
" If you 're really supporting somebody , you 're not looking for something back all the time , " said Common .
" He 'd do best just getting elected and going in there and doing well , that 's the best way he can give back to us .
We do n't need him to be at the concerts . "
Both Common and Kweli bristled at one question that Obama 's faced at recent presidential forums and debates : whether the candidate is " black enough . "
" It 's a horrible question , " Kweli said .
" It 's very divisive .
It divides us .
Obviously that man is black .
I think it 's utterly ridiculous . "
Common laughed and said , " He looks black to me . "

Watchdog 's latest report shows Congress still has plenty of corruption Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 18 , 2007
Print This Email This Murtha goes from ' watch ' list to being named among ' most corrupt '
A year after sweeping midterm elections shifted the balance of power in Congress , based in part on voters ' perceptions that some lawmakers were more concerned with lining their own pockets than legislating effectively , the US Capitol still has plenty of potential crooks roaming its halls , a watchdog 's annual report alleges .
For the third straight year , Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington released its list of the most corrupt members of Congress , comprising 22 lawmakers .
Additionally , two GOP senators who have found themselves embroiled in sex scandals in recent months -- Sens. Larry Craig and David Vitter -- earn " dishonorable mention " on CREW 's list .
 Every year CREW creates this compendium of corruption to expose and hold accountable those members of Congress who believe they are above the law ,  Melanie Sloan , executive director of CREW said in a news release .
 With the third edition of Beyond DeLay it has become abundantly clear that many public officials believe that the rules dont apply to them . 
Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha , one of four Democrats who appear on the list , was singled out last year by CREW as a " member to watch " for ethical improprieties .
Since then , he has assumed chairmanship of a defense appropriations subcommittee , and CREW says he 's used that position " to benefit the lobbying firm of a former long - term staffer " along with also threatening to block Republican earmark requests .
Additionally , CREW alleges , Murtha unnecessarily expanded the federal bureaucracy to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to his district in establishing through an energy appropriations bill a nonprofit center .
Contrary to Murtha 's claims , Department of Energy did not request the earmark establishing the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure , whose employees and family members have donated over $ 115,000 to Murtha 's political committees .
" By earmarking funds for companies represented by the PMA group and CTC in return for campaign contributions , Rep. Murtha may have accepted bribes or illegal gratuities , committed honest services fraud and violated House rules prohibiting members from dispensing special favors , " CREW says .
Alaska scores a dubious trifecta with every member of its congressional delegation appearing on the list -- Sens. Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Don Young , all Republicans .
Stevens , the seven - term Republican , has found himself in the middle of a federal bribery investigation because of renovations to his home that were allegedly paid for by VECO Corp. , an Alaska oil - services company that has benefitted from Stevens ' largesse .
His son , Ben Stevens , a state lawmaker also has been caught up in the investigation , although Ted Stevens maintained he has done nothing wrong .
Alaska 's sole House member , Republican Don Young , is on CREW 's list in part because of his own associations with VECO Corp .
Young also comes under fire from CREW for leading the charge for the controversial " bridge to nowhere " projects last year and for his ties with criminal former - lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
A Republican long - shot presidential candidate , Rep. Duncan Hunter , finds himself on CREW 's list for the first time this year .
CREW says Hunter misused funds from his political action committee to run ads meant to bolster his presidential campaign , in violation of campaign finance law .
The California Republican also has close ties to disgraced former - Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham and the defense contractors who bribed the now - jailed onetime lawmaker .
CREW 's corruption list , entitled " Beyond DeLay , " is named after the former Republican Majority Leader who resigned amidst a criminal investigation in his home state of Texas , Aside from Murtha , three other Democrats stand accused on CREW 's list , including Georgia Rep. David Scott , West Virginia Congressman Alan B. Mollohan and Rep. William Jefferson ( D - LA ) .
Jefferson , who was famously busted with bundles of cash in his freezer , makes the list for the second - straight year after being indicted on bribery charges .
CREW says he also improperly used National Guard troops to collect belongings from his New Orleans - area home after Hurricane Katrina hit .
Last year 's corruption compendium included 25 lawmakers , 10 of whom are no longer in Congress either because they resigned , like former Rep. Bob Ney ( R - Ohio ) , who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges relating to the Abramoff investigation , or lost re-election .
Eight lawmakers from last year 's list are now under federal indictment .
On the same day CREW 's report was released , 13 members of Congress , including many that appeared on CREW 's list this year , were subpoenaed to testify in the investigation of defense contractor Brent Wilkes , who faces charges relating to Cunningham 's bribery conviction .
# CREW's List of the 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress :
Members of the Senate :
Sen. Pete V. Domenici ( R - NM )
Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - KY )
Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK )

Code reviews are an important practice for improving the quality of your software and ensuring that it is ready for release .
Software engineering research has found that reviews ( or inspections ) are a powerful QA practice and have many advantages over testing :
A higher percentage of defects are found when using reviews – as high as twice as many than testing .
When an issue is detected by a review , the root cause of the problem is usually known .
Defects found by testing require further work to analyze .
Reviews can be performed earlier in the development life - cycle than testing .
Reviews provide more precise and more immediate feedback for developers to learn and improve from than testing .
Steve McConnell in his book Rapid Development summarizes these findings on pages 73 to 75 .
Given these many benefits , it is disappointing that more teams do not use code reviews .
If you are part of a team that does regular code reviews , then I congratulate you .
Just because you do code reviews , however , does not guarantee that you will see all the benefits .
In fact , I have often observed highly ineffective reviews .
One example from my own experience is when a developer was asked to do a review but viewed the task as an annoying interruption from more interesting work .
They did a very quick and superficial ' review ' , and then reported that everything looked fine .
As a task the review was completed , but the expected quality improvements were not achieved .
In a sense the review did not really happen .
How can you avoid this from happening to you and your team ?
In this article I present a set of strategies for achieving effective code reviews .
These are based on my years of experience performing code reviews and figuring out what works the best .
Some of these ideas are inspired by concepts from PhotoReading , a multi-step system for efficiently extracting desired information from written text ( aka reading , but not as it is traditionally done ) .
Adopt a Critical yet Playful Attitude
The primary purpose of a code review is to critique the code - to find defects , potential problems , or simply poorly - written sections – which requires a critical mindset that is different from the typical problem - solving mindset used by developers as they solve code .
You cannot simply read over a section of code and accept what you see : you need to challenge the assumptions and decisions behind it .
This is especially important for finding errors of omission .
It is much harder to find a defect because of what was not written , and to do so requires you have a questioning , suspicious attitude towards the code you are reviewing .
You need to mentally prepare yourself before starting a review by reminding yourself of the purpose of the review and the need for a critical , questioning attitude .
Maintaining this critical attitude throughout your review , however , can be difficult , especially if it is not your regular mode of thinking .
It helps to cultivate a delight or enjoyment in finding issues with the code , like you are playing a game searching for treasures hidden by an opponent .
Unearthing a serious defect should feel equivalent to hitting a home run in baseball .
Viewing the review as a fun yet challenging game where you score points for the issues you find will boost your motivation and keep you focused in that critical mindset .
The critical attitude required for reviews is similar to the questioning mindset needed for root cause analysis .
In root cause analysis , however , you are trying to determine why something failed , whereas in a code review you are trying to find all potential causes of failure .
Take Multiple Passes Through the Code
In order to do an effective review you must learn how the code is structured , what it is trying to accomplish , and where it falls short .
It is difficult to do this all at once as you read through the code for the first time .
A much more effective approach is to use multiple passes to review the code with the initial passes focused on learning about how the code works and later passes focused on critiquing the code .
The number of passes you will need will depend on the size of the code base you are reviewing , its complexity , and how thorough a review you are doing .
As a starting point , here is a suggested approach for reviewing a code base in multiple passes .
Problem Overview : Review the requirements or specification to understand what the code is supposed to do .
What problem is it trying to address ?
What requirements is it implementing ?
Solution Overview : Review the design document or specification to learn the overall solution to the problem .
How are the requirements being addressed ?
High Level Organization : Review the code or detailed design document to figure out how the code is organized and functions at a high level .
What are the packages and the major classes within each ?
I find UML class diagrams showing class relationships and hierarchies very useful for this pass , and if none already exist as part of the documentation I often end up sketching out such a diagram .
UML sequence or state diagrams can also be useful to highlight the main interactions or behavior of the system .
Major Class Review : Review the code for the most important classes as identified previously .
While issues and problems can be found in earlier passes through the code , particularly at the design level , this pass marks the transition from learning about the code to critically analyzing it for problems .
Multiple Detailed Review Passes :
The previous passes will have given you a sufficient understanding of the code base to critically review the remainder of the code base .
Even at this point , however , it is still valuable to use multiple passes .
I explain why in the next section .
Focus on One Goal Per Pass
One common response to the problem of poor - quality reviews is the creation of a review checklist that lists all the issues a reviewer should be looking for .
Often these checklists enumerate many specific items and go on for more than a page .
Two examples of checklist items are : ( 1 ) checking the return codes of system calls , and ( 2 ) using prepared SQL instead of SQL literals for parameters .
While the idea of checklists has merit , the reviewer is given no guidance as to how to effectively use the checklist .
Short - term memory , which can only hold approximately seven pieces of information , is all needed for analyzing the code .
Trying to remember a page of issues to look for while reviewing simply does not work .
The solution to this is to focus on a single goal for each detailed review pass through the code .
Each goal can be as specific as an individual checklist item , but I find this level of detail is seldom necessary and leads to too many passes .
The goals I prefer to use generally correspond to categories of issues .
For example , instead of a checklist item such as checking return codes of system calls , I have the goal of reviewing error handling .
As I make my review pass with this goal in mind , I can ignore the bulk of the logic and focus instead on how errors might occur and how they are handled .
Unlike the long checklist , this solution is workable because you only need to hold a single piece of information – the current review goal – in your short - term memory while you are reviewing .
Focusing on a single goal , however , provides an additional benefit : it actually improves our ability to find problems in the code pertaining to the goal .
How does this work ?
Our eyes and other senses constantly transmit a wealth of information to our brain – too much information , in fact , to fully process in detail .
The brain must therefore selectively filter the information it receives .
The brain decides what information to select based in part on our goals and desires – what we view as important .
In essence , our thoughts and perspective affects how we view the world .
When we focus on a single goal such as error handling , as we review the code the brain is more likely to focus on segments of code dealing with error handling ( or the lack thereof ) .
This allows you to review the code faster : you can skim along , skipping past sections that do not apply , then slow down to carefully analyze a relevant block or a suspicious section , and then speed back up again .
Changing your goal between review passes causes your perspective to shift , allowing you to identify a different set of issues in the same code base .
This greatly increases the effectiveness of the review by catching more issues across a wider variety of categories .
Here are some typical goals I use for my reviews :
Functionality : Does the code meet the business ( functional ) requirements ?
Is the logic correct ?
Class Design :
Does each class have low coupling and high cohesion ?
Is the class too large or too complicated ?
Code Style :
Is duplication of code avoided ?
Are any methods too long ?
Are typical coding idioms / standards followed ?
Naming :
Are packages , classes , methods and fields given meaningful and consistent names ?
Error Handling : How are errors dealt with ?
Does the code check for any error conditions that can occur ?
Security : Does the code require any special permissions to execute outside the norm ?
Does the code contain any security holes ?
Unit Tests :
Are there automated unit tests providing adequate coverage of the code base ?
Are these unit tests well - written ?
Add Review Comments Directly to the Code
How should issues found during the review be reported back to the original developer ?
One commonly used approach is to create a review document listing all the issues found .
For each issue the problematic section of code must be referenced , usually by supplying the file name and line number .
Management often prefers the review document because it can be used for process auditing and generating metrics .
Exclusive use of a review document for recording issues , however , causes problems for the reviewer and the original developer .
For the reviewer , switching from the code to a separate document can easily break their flow , especially since they must record not just the issue , but also the reference back to the code .
For the original developer , once they start fixing issues in a particular file , the references ( file name and line number ) of other issues in the same file can quickly become out of date , especially if refactorings such as move method , extract method , or rename class are performed .
I believe , therefore , that the most effective approach to recording issues is to add them directly to the code base as comments , at the place the issue occurs .
Each such comment should be tagged with a special label – I use REVIEW – so that the issues can be easily found later by the original developer .
In fact , if you use the Eclipse IDE for Java development , you can define a task tag for this type of comment that will cause all such comments to appear in the Task view .
Once the review is completed , the code with the review comments can be checked back into the version control system to be made available to the original developers .
If you must produce a review document to comply with your organization 's processes , then I would recommend creating the document at the end of the review from the review comments you added to the code .
Summary
Code reviews are a powerful practice for improving software quality .
The strategies I have found personally useful in increasing the effectiveness of my reviews are :
Adopt a critical yet playful attitude .
Take multiple passes through the code .
Focus on one goal per pass .
Add review comments directly to the code .
If you have any additional strategies you have found particularly useful , please let me know .

Solar powered WiFi routers are nothing new , but a new company is offering for the first time a commercial option at a low enough cost as to be effective in developing nations .
Meraki Networks has come out with a pretty slick looking solar powered Wireless router system powered by the sun .
Meraki ( Greek for doing something with soul ) yesterday announced the new Meraki Outdoor repeater and the Meraki Solar accessory , that together can cover entire neighborhoods with Wi -Fi access .
Priced at just $ 99 , Meraki Outdoor can send a signal up to 700 feet .
Paired with Merakiâ€™s existing indoor $ 49 Mini , the Meraki Outdoor repeater can power access for dozens of households sharing one high speed connection .
Meraki Outdoor can be easily installed on a wall or even a pole outside the house .
Meraki hopes to change the economics of Wi-Fi access , by driving the cost per household of high speed connections to $ 1 to $ 2 a month .
Adding the Meraki Solar accessory kit will allow the repeater to broadcast a signal without being connected to any electrical source , making it an ideal solution for any community , even emerging markets where electricity is scant or unreliable .
Once connected , Meraki Solarâ€™s power usage can be distributed throughout the day and managed by the Meraki Dashboard service ensuring the repeater is powered during peak usage times .
The Meraki Dashboard is a web - hosted management tool designed to make monitoring , configuring , and monetizing a Meraki Network easy and is included with all Meraki products for no additional charge .
The solar kit includes a solar panel , battery pack and an outdoor Ethernet cable .
â€ œTo change the economics of Wi-Fi access across the globe , thereâ€™s got to be a simple , efficient and inexpensive method for sending the signal long distances outdoors , â€ said Sanjit Biswas , CEO and a co-founder of Meraki .
â€ œThe Meraki Solar and Meraki Outdoor will play an important role in our efforts to bring the next billion people online in the coming years.â€ 
Formally launched just months ago , Meraki is already enabling Internet access around the globe .
Today , more than 1,000 Meraki networks are up and running in more than 35 countries , providing access to about 40,000 users .
Networks exist in a variety of economic and geographical landscapes – from urban networks in San Francisco , Portland and Caracas to rural networks in Alaska , Ecuador , and Brazil .
Some of the technical specifics of the Meraki Outdoor and Meraki Solar kit :

* – Pricing will be set this summer but the Meraki Solar will clearly be the most affordable option on the market
Both Meraki Solar and the Meraki Outdoor are expected to ship late this summer .
Merakiâ€™s mesh networking enables anyone to easily and affordably install wireless networks in their home , apartment building , or across a city .
The mesh topology enables multiple people to share one Internet connection , significantly changing the cost of Internet access ( read some case studies ) .
The Meraki system includes inexpensive hardware , network management tools , and online billing services .
Incidentally these are the same people who have put in place the San Francisco free net , and have backing by Google .
This could be the way we all get our ( almost free ) internet access in the future .

What I Did on 9/11
by Greg Perry by Greg Perry
DIGG THIS
What did you do this week on Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 , the 6th anniversary of the World Trade Center and Pentagon disaster ?
Did you mourn the dead ?
Did you hug your family members ?
Did you watch the ceremonies on television ?
All three of those are good things to do .
Well , on second thought watching the ceremonies on TV probably is n’t a great use of your time for a number of reasons that only those on LewRockwell.com would understand .
Celebrate Freedom
Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 , I celebrated freedom in the best way possible .
It ’s an eroding freedom .
It ’s freedon in a land where freedoms before 9/11 were dwindling and after 9/11 they began dwindling more rapidly .
It ’s a freedom where the airports treat you like criminals instead of customers .
It ’s a freedom where you are considered crazy if you want to protect your children from the government school system by keeping them at home where you can raise them in the way they should go .
It ’s a freedom where if you risk a bunch of money to build a building for your new business you are then forced to reserve the best parking spaces and bathroom stalls for people who may never ever be a customer of yours ( think Gold ’s Gym as a prime example ) .
Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 , I celebrated freedom in the best way possible .
Although it ’s an eroding freedom , we must admit that we ’re still free in most states ( California is an example of a state that despises freedom unless you ’re Mexican ) .
You ’re reading LewRockwell.com and until it ’s not allowed to exist , we do still have more freedom than many countries had throughout history .
We still have enough freedom to turn the tide and restore the true freedoms that made America great , the years from our founding up to about 1914 .
How I Celebrated Freedom in the Best Way Possible
Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 , I celebrated freedom in the best way possible .
I bought a gun .
It ’s not just any gun .
It is the gun .
I bought an M1A .
A Springfield Armory M1A , a .308 caliber rifle .
A rifle that shoots a bullet that has more energy after the bullet flies 300 yards than an M16 / AR - 15 has at its muzzle .
In other words , my real rifle ’s bullet is still more powerful after it ’s traveled 300 yards than the U.N. ’s bullet the moment it leaves the gun .
My M1A has far more than twice the distance of those little 22 - caliber peashooters that the jackbooted thugs carry with them when they descend upon a nation to squelch the life from it .
My rifle can really reach out and touch someone .
Are You a Rifleman Or a Victim ?
I just love a guy named Fred who writes for Shotgun News .
He has a web site where you can learn what it takes to become a Rifleman too .
Thanks to Fred I now have a weapon that is usable .
Thanks for Fred I have a weapon with which I can be a Rifleman .
Thanks to Fred I now can defend my freedom if I ’m ever called to do so by the situation .
It would just be great if I never have to defend my freedom .
It would just be great if I have fun shooting the rest of my life at little targets I set up 400 — 800 yards down the field .
It would be great if I never have to defend my freedom and my country ’s freedom but I will immediately prepare to be able to do so if required .
Can you hit a man -sized target at 400 yards ?
That ’s a primary , doable , easily - obtainable requirement to become a Rifleman .
500 yards is n’t too tough after that .
This is n’t sniper school .
This is old - fashioned Rifleman skills , the skills that Americans used to have in general and a skill that would be useful for our military if they got any real rifle training these days ( most do n’t ) .
Become a Rifleman .
That is how you celebrate your freedom .
Step One Completed
Becoming a Rifleman is only step one in celebrating your freedom .
Step two is forming a group of like - minded individuals .
Step three is training others to become Riflemen .
Yes , of course , women who wish should become Riflemen too ; Annie Oakley could outshoot 9 out of 10 sharp - shooters of her day and a woman is often a good shot because she will follow instructions better than a man .
That ’s the thing about becoming a Rifleman .
It ’s not difficult .
We usually make it more difficult than it is .
Hitting a 400 - yard shot requires only a little proper training .
Yes , you need to be able to shoot out to 400 yards or so with any standard rifle and any ammunition you find that works .
I mean any real rifle , not some AR - 15/M16 that the U.N. uses .
That dart - thrower is effective for close urban quarters , and also for situations such as if the BATF needs to shoot children at Waco who try to flee flame throwers , but worthless in a Rifleman ’s hands when distance is the key to winning the battle .
You do n’t need " match grade " anything to hit a man-sized target 400 — 500 yards down the way .
Heck , use an SKS if you have to because even they can punch through 450 yards in a pinch .
Yes , you can become a Rifleman with a cheap SKS if you have to .
You ’ll eventually save enough to get a better rifle .
Go look at Fred ’s site .
Order his book , How to Become a Rifleman .
Order some targets .
Even if you do n’t have a real rifle yet ( and I generally reserve the term real rifle for .308 or 30 - 06 caliber with only a few exceptions ) , get Fred ’s book and order some of his skill - building targets .
By the time you get through about 10 pages you ’ll be looking for one of those real rifles , like the M1A or his proud daddy , the M1 Garand .
By the time you read 10 pages of anything Fred writes , you ’ll know your next goal in life is to celebrate your freedom by getting an M1A too .
A Nation of Riflemen Celebrate Freedom By Breathing
If we were once again a nation of Riflemen , we would be a free nation .
Our freedoms would n’t be eroding away day - by - day .
The box on my new , 9/11 M1A says this : " Not allowed in the State of California . "
Do you live in California ?
If so and you ’re reading this , why have n’t you called the realtor yet ?
There are a lot of states that would benefit you .
And perhaps you might just become a Rifleman and pay back some of that benefit .
You might just train someone else some day to become a Rifleman .
I realize I ’m being caustic when I say what I ’m about to say but I really say it because I really care about you :
If you live in California , are you sure you respect freedom ?
Are you sure you would do everything in your power to protect your family when faced with the opportunity ?
I do n’t know if you would but I ’m a skeptic at heart .
I ’m not challenging your love for your family but I do challenge your willingness to do what is necessary to protect them from harm .
Until you can open the box I opened this week legally in your own state , I ’m not convinced you love freedom more than you love the security of the state .
For any of us , it is a lot easier to remember 9/11 by watching flowers laid on graves and watching debates on how the World Trade Center memorial should be designed .
And it ’s a whole lot cheaper than working extra hard to purchase a real gun .
And it ’s a whole lot less stressful than moving to a state where you can be an asset for your freedom for a change .
Are You a Rifleman or a Victim ?
Fred is just great as some who order his book and follow it will learn .
Fred says you ’re either a Rifleman or a Cook .
Fred is being kind ; I ’m not that kind .
I say you ’re either a Rifleman or a victim .
Let ’s hope the day never comes when I have to prove my Rifleman skills and let ’s hope the day comes when many of you do n’t get to prove how easy it is to be a victim .
I am grateful I found out about Fred before I was forced to prove I was a victim .
I do n’t know Fred .
I assume Lew does n’t know Fred .
Neither Lew nor I make money if you order Fred ’s book .
Lew and I are better off if you do , however , because you might actually read it ; and better still , you may even follow its advice to the letter .
I followed Fred ’s advice to the letter .
More important , Tuesday , September 11 , 2007 , I followed Fred ’s advice and bought my M1A .
The Best of Greg Perry
When the headline and the lede in Frank Bruni 's restaurant review in the New York Times are both about noise , maybe , just maybe , we 've reached the point of no return when it comes to restaurant noise levels .
Consider the following line from Bruni's review : " Talking with tablemates at Mercat can be like watching an in - flight movie when you have n't purchased the earphones . "
Here 's my question :
Is that state of affairs either necessary or desirable ?
When you talk to chefs and restaurateurs about this issue , some will say the noise level in their restaurants is the result of faulty design , that they did n't know the noise level was going to be a problem until they opened their doors and discovered that sitting in their full restaurant was like being on an idling jet waiting to take off .
Others say they like the noise level high , that it translates into diners thinking they 're at a hot , successful restaurant pulsating with energy .
Some of those same people claim that their restaurants are meant for people who welcome sitting in that kind of environment , those carefree young folks who actively seek out those kinds of eating experiences .
Sometimes the noise level is exacerbated by earsplittingly loud music , which , as a serious serial music lover , I would be more appreciative of if the DJ , chef , or restaurateur had n't chosen awful techno pop .
I do n't think this state of affairs is going to change anytime soon .
Loud restaurants will open for people who either seek them out or tolerate them .
Quiet restaurants will open up for people who want to savor the sounds of their tablemates ' voices and the food .
But as a food lover , I 'm saddened by the fact that I probably wo n't get to eat at Mercat because I do n't want to put up with a noise level that can be described as a " volume of sound that crosses over between pulse - quickening and brain - rattling . "
Would n't it be great if restaurants , like the Long Island Railroad , had quiet sections ?
I know achieving a quiet sub - space is much easier to do on a train , where it 's a matter of isolating people in individual cars .
Maybe I 'm just too old for Mercat or for Resto , an insanely loud restaurant I recently ate at with three friends .
I loved the artery - hardening , incredibly delicious food , but I have n't thought about returning because of the noise level .
I literally could n't hear half of what my friends were saying , which was a real shame because the conversation was both stimulating and intimate .
The architect David Rockwell once said he designed restaurants around the idea that they were places that people went to take two - hour vacations from their lives .
I 've always loved that idea , but lately I 'm beginning to realize that there are all kinds of vacations to be had , and that some folks like to rock and roll on South Beach all night long when they go away .

ECONOMIC UPDATE …. Retail sales in April were down 2.4 % , “ the most wretched year - over - year showing by major retailers since the International Council of Shopping Centers began tracking the data in 1970 , ” according to the LA Times .
But take heart .
Sales may be down at places that cater to ordinary schmoes , but business is sunny at Saks , Nieman Marcus , and Nordstrom .
Apparently shoppers at those places do n’t have to worry so much about the home mortgage meltdown , rising gasoline prices , or the soft labor market .
And that ’s not all .
In other economic news , business is booming for boat moorings in Newport Harbor .
So buck up !
Scientists find way to separate HIV virus from cells Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday June 29 , 2007 Print This Email

In a breakthrough that could potentially lead to a cure for HIV infection , scientists have discovered a way to remove the virus from infected cells , a study released Thursday said .
The scientists engineered an enzyme which attacks the DNA of the HIV virus and cuts it out of the infected cell , according to the study published in Science magazine .
The enzyme is still far from being ready to use as a treatment , the authors warned , but it offers a glimmer of hope for the more than 40 million people infected worldwide .
" A customized enzyme that effectively excises integrated HIV - 1 from infected cells in vitro might one day help to eradicate ( the ) virus from AIDS patients , " Alan Engelman , of Harvard University 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , wrote in an article accompanying the study .
Current treatments focus on suppressing the HIV virus in order to delay the onset of AIDS and dramatically extend the life of infected patients .
What makes HIV so deadly , however , is its ability to insert itself into the body 's cells and force those cells to produce new infection .
" Consequently the virus becomes inextricably linked to the host , making it virtually impossible to ' cure ' AIDS patients of their HIV - 1 infection , " Engelman explained .
That could change if the enzyme developed by a group of German scientists can be made safe to use on people .
That enzyme was able to eliminate the HIV virus from infected human cells in about three months in the laboratory .
The researchers engineered an enzyme called Tre which removes the virus from the genome of infected cells by recognizing and then recombining the structure of the virus 's DNA .
This ability to recognize HIV's DNA might one day help overcome one of the biggest obstacles to finding a cure : the ability of the HIV virus to avoid detection by reverting to a resting state within infected cells which then cease to produce the virus for months or even years .
" Numerous attempts have been made to activate these cells , with the hope that such strategies would sensitize the accompanying viruses to antiviral drugs , leading to virus eradication , " Engelman wrote .
" Advances with such approaches in patients have been slow to materialize . "
New experiments must be designed to see if the Tre enzyme can be used to recognize these dormant infected cells , he wrote .
" Although favorable results would represent perhaps only a baby step toward eventual use in patients , the discovery of the Tre recombinase proves that enzymatic removal of integrated HIV - 1 from human chromosomes is a current - day reality , " he said .
The researchers who developed the enzyme were optimistic about their ability to design additional enzymes which would target other parts of the virus 's DNA .
However they warned that there were significant barriers to overcome before the enzyme could be used to help cure patients .
" The most important , and likely most difficult , among these is that the enzyme would need efficient and safe means of delivery and would have to be able to function without adverse side effects , " wrote lead author Indrani Sarkar of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden .
" Nevertheless the results we present offer an early proof of principal for this type of approach , which we speculate might form a useful basis for the development of future HIV therapies , " Sarkar concluded .
Tonight , Friday September 14 , Michael Moore will appear on an ABC 20/20 special entitled " Whose Body is It Anyways ?
Sick in America " .
From the preview , it looks like it 's going to be a thought provoking show :
Towards the end of the above preview , John Stossel claims the free market does everything better to which Moore responds , " the market does everything better ?
I love this !
You are so 13th century . "
According to an editorial by John Stossel from July 15 , it looks like the Moore interview will go beyond health care and look at the basic philosophy of forcing people to do things when they are harming no - one else :
I INTERVIEWED Michael Moore recently for an upcoming " 20/20 " special on health care .
It 's refreshing to interview a leftist who proudly admits he 's a leftist .
He told me that government should provide " food care " as well as health care and that big government would work if only the right people were in charge .
Moore added , " I watch your show and I know where you are coming from . ... "
He knows I defend limited government , so he tried to explain why I was wrong .
He began in a revealing way :
" I gotta believe that , even though I know you 're very much for the individual determining his own destiny , you also have a heart . "
Notice his smuggled premise in the words " even though . "
In Moore 's mind , someone who favors individual freedom does n't care about his fellow human beings .
Does n't it stand to reason that someone who wants everyone to be free of tyranny does so partly because he cares about others ?
Moore thinks respecting others ' freedom means refusing to help the less fortunate .
But where 's the connection ?
All it means is that the libertarian refuses to sanction the use of physical force ( which is what government is ) to help others .
Peaceful methods -- like voluntary charity -- are the only morally consistent methods .
If Moore 's goal is to help the less fortunate , he should preach voluntary charity instead of government action .
Surprisingly , he did show an understanding of the importance of the libertarian philosophy to America .
" John , your way of thinking actually was great for this country .
I mean it ; it helped to found the country .
It helped build us into one of the greatest nations , perhaps the greatest nation , that the earth has ever seen .
Limited government , pull yourself up by your bootstraps , every man for himself , forward movement , pioneer spirit .
" That 's why a lot of people in these other countries really admire us , because there 's this American get up and go . "
I interrupt here to point out another smuggled premise .
Did you catch that " every man for himself " line ?
America was never about every man for himself .
A free society is about voluntary communities cooperating through the division of labor .
Libertarianism is far from " every man for himself . "
After acknowledging that limited government helped make America great , Moore went on to say , " But I do n't think that what you believe is what 's going to allow us to survive . "
He means that if government does not assure people health care and food , our society will disintegrate .
But why would a philosophy that was good enough to build a successful society be unsuited to sustaining that society ?
Individual freedom , with minimal government , made it possible for masses of people to cooperate for mutual advantage .
As a result , society could be rich and peaceful .
As the great economist Ludwig von Mises wrote , " What makes friendly relations between human beings possible is the higher productivity of the division of labor .
. . .
A preeminent common interest , the preservation and further intensification of social cooperation , becomes paramount and obliterates all essential collisions . "
Freedom and benevolence go hand in hand .

In some of science fiction 's most influential stories , Isaac Asimov laid out three laws of robotics , the first of which was that " a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . "
He later added a law that said robots must also protect humanity as a whole .
Judging by some recent robotic creations , it may be time to add another law : " A robot may not harm the environment .
While they 're at it , they might as well start helping fix the place up a bit . "
Recently , researchers have created a small army of robots that work side by side with scientists to steward the planet better .
They are helping biologists detect toxins , explore remote environments , and learn about endangered species .
They do work that is too inaccessible , dangerous , or just plain boring for us weakling carbon - based life forms .

Secret Agent Fembots
In Isaac Asimov ’s short story “ — That Thou Art Mindful of Him , ” engineers attempt to acclimate humans to robots by creating robots that look like birds and insects and also detect and correct ecological problems .
Thirty - seven years later , Asimov looks like Nostradamus .
Gail Patricelli , an ecologist at the University of California at Davis , is leading the bird - robot revolution .
She studies the sage grouse , a bird native to the American West that looks like a miniature turkey and has a wacky love life .
The male attempts to impress females by puffing up two yellow air sacs in the white fluff of his chest , the inflation and deflation of which produce an odd blooping sound .
Meanwhile , he struts before a group of female sage grouse .
If his strutting , inflation , and noise - making are impressive enough , one female will approach him and — after more strutting , inflating , and noise — mate with him .
Sage grouse are on the decline , and scientists think that ( in addition to habitat loss ) the problem may be that noise pollution from natural gas development in their native areas across the western United States interferes with successful mating .
Patricelli set out to measure how sage grouse use noise in their mating displays :
If calls were obscured by background noise , would the grouse mate less ?
To find out , she needed to put herself in the female sage grouse ’s shoes ( as it were ) to record what they hear and see during male displays .
So she built the world ’s first sage grouse fembot .
The robot is a metal frame covered with a real sage grouse skin .
It 's “ a combination of arts and crafts , engineering , and taxidermy , ” Patricelli says .
She directs the fembot to watch the males ' displays and uses its onboard microphone and video camera to measure what role sound plays .
“ We can basically get inside the head of a female , ” she says .
If sound pollution is causing a problem , Patricelli and her team plan to work with local conservation agencies to mitigate the effects .
Other researchers have also created functional robotic cowbirds , turkey chicks , and even bees and cockroaches .
“ It ’s getting easier to do .
Most of the parts we used were available online , ” Patricelli says .
“ If you decide you ’re interested in animal behavior and you want to build a model , you sit down and figure it out with Lego Mindstorms . ”
The Saint Louis Zoo uses three different sizes of telemetric eggs ( shown without their coat of camouflage paint ) in their waterfowl nests .

Robo Eggs Can Fool Even a Mother
Passive robots in the form of sedentary animals may be less flashy than a bird skin stretched over a robotic frame , but they can be just as good at keeping tabs on their environment — and significantly less nasty .
Take for instance the computerized eggs that the Calgary Zoo in Canada is using to try to bring back the critically endangered whooping crane .
All whooping cranes alive today are the descendants * of only 16 cranes alive in the 1930s , says Tian Everest , conservation research program coordinator at the zoo .
“ Each whooping crane egg is incredibly valuable , ” she says .
“ Whooping cranes exist today in large part because of the captive breeding program .
And of all the stages of captive breeding , incubation is one of the least well understood . ”
Everest and other biologists increase birth rates by taking eggs away from the nest as soon as the mother lays them .
The mother , thinking that her egg has disappeared , will go on to produce as many as six eggs rather than just one .
These abducted eggs are raised by hand in an aviary , and the birds will later learn to migrate by following an ultralight plane rather than their parents .
Biologists noticed that eggs watched by their parents — or even by foster sandhill crane parents — hatched more successfully than eggs in the incubators .
“ We ’re using these [ telemetric ] eggs to teach us how cranes incubate their eggs , so we can mimic [ the process ] in the incubators , ” Everest says .
The telemetric eggs , sized and painted to look just like whooping crane eggs , continually measure their ambient temperature and humidity , record how often the parent turns the eggs , and use a light sensor to detect when the eggs are being sat upon .
The National Zoo uses similar telemetric eggs to infiltrate the nests of kori bustards and flamingos , while the St. Louis Zoo does the same with endangered waterfowl and Humboldt penguins .
Eggs are n’t the only robotic biomonitors sitting around .
Brian Helmuth of the University of South Carolina uses thermometers tucked inside mussel shells to study how global warming affects coastal invertebrates .
These robo-mussels pick up on how the animal ’s shell interacts with sun , wind , and tide to determine its body temperature — a subtle point that a plain old thermometer would miss .
* Correction , September 12 , 2007 : The article originally confused " ancestors " with " descendants . "
The New Doggy Treat : Poisonous Chemicals
Natalie Jeremijenko of New York University leads groups of students in creating robotic dogs to sniff out chemical pollutants .
Each student chooses a commercially available dog robot , like HasBro's iDog or Sony ’s defunct Aibo , and customizes it to detect certain toxic chemicals .
Classes program their dogs to work in packs .
When released on a site , the dogs communicate among themselves and compare signals .
The dog with the strongest scent becomes the temporary leader of the pack until another dog picks up a stronger scent .
This continues until the dogs locate the spot with the highest concentration of whatever toxic chemical they are sniffing out .
The virtue of the project is that it not only traces toxic substances , Jeremijenko says , but also gets people interested in toxic waste detection and cleanup .
“ The kids themselves have a lot of fun with the theatrics of the dogs , ” she says .
“ The packs sit when they hit a certain level [ of chemical contamination ] .
Or they ’ll bark the national anthem .
Or they ’ll fall over and play dead . ”
The sight of the dogs sniffing out toxic levels of chemicals helps students understand and explain to their communities the distribution of toxic waste .
Jeremijenko has bred 10 packs of dogs in places as diverse as Arizona , Dublin , and the Bronx , New York .
Currently she ’s creating a curriculum that will help educators proliferate the chemical - tracking canines throughout classrooms worldwide .
Other researchers have placed similar robots , in the form of lobsters and lampreys , on the seafloor , and Jeremijenko hopes to have still more varieties hopping , slithering , and climbing their way into the environment soon .
Robots Don't Blink
Sometimes all a biologist needs is a pair of eyes watching the sky .
Humans , imperfect lookouts that we are , are prone to distraction , especially when being drowned , baked by a hot southern sun , or bitten by poisonous snakes .
Robots are resistant to these human frailties , which is why they ’re perfect for scrutinizing the patch of Arkansas swamp where an ivory - billed woodpecker — a bird scientists thought had been extinct for decades — may have been spotted in 2005 .
“ Robots do n’t blink , ” says Ken Goldberg , an engineer at the University of California at Berkeley .
After hearing of the ivory - billed woodpecker sighting in a notoriously inhospitable swamp , Goldberg contacted biologists at Cornell University and offered his help .
He and Dezhen Song , a computer scientist at Texas A&M University , built an autonomous camera to keep an eye on the sky .
A pair of cameras continuously records video of the swamp and can distinguish birds from airplanes , drifting leaves , and trees waving in the wind .
They store images of birds and each month a researcher in a canoe paddles out to retrieve the data .
Eventually , the cameras will be able to send them back to Song electronically .
The system has n't found its quarry since it was set up last October .
But ornithologists suspect that the woodpecker ’s extreme skittishness has kept it under the radar for decades , so the robot may have a better chance than a relatively noisy and impatient scientist .
Goldberg and Song hope to soon set up cameras to record grizzly bears in Alaska , gorillas in Rwanda , and giant pandas in China .
Patient Notification
UT Southwestern Medical Center inappropriately disclosed the email addresses of patients previously seen in the UTSW Ophthalmology Clinic through use of a third - party vendor .
The vendor was used to send messages to patients about the reopening of its Ophthalmology Clinic , which had been temporarily closed due to the COVID - 19 pandemic .
While patients email addresses / accounts were not comprised in any way , they were shared inappropriately with a third party .
UT Southwestern considers the protection of our patients ’ privacy of utmost importance , and we deeply regret the occurrence of this incident and any worry , distress , or difficulty that it may cause .
If you are a current or previous patient of the Ophthalmology Clinic and have questions about whether your email address was affected , you can contact the UT Southwestern Privacy Office at ( 214 ) 648-6080 .
The fifth public alpha build of Firefox 3 has been officially released .
The new alpha build , which is codenamed Gran Paradiso , features early components of the revamped Places system , a cohesive storage framework that will unify bookmark and history storage .
An earlier prototype of the Places system was tested in early Firefox 2 alpha ( Bon Echo ) builds but was removed because it could n't be completed within the Firefox 2 release timeframe .
The current implementation of the Places system is still a work in progress , but the final version will support features like bookmark tagging , full - text indexing , extended metadata search , built - in syncing functionality , and support for exporting bookmarks in a broader number of formats .
The Places user interface has n't been developed yet , so there really are n't any aspects of the Places system that are visually apparent in the alpha 5 build .
This alpha release primarily incorporates infrastructure elements of the Places system .
In particular , alpha 5 migrates bookmark storage from the current XML data format to the SQLite - based MozStorage system .
Bookmarks can now be found in the places . sqlite file in Firefox profile directories .
Firefox 3 alpha 5 also features a new password manager .
Firefox developer Justin Dolske has ported much of the C++ code used in the previous password manager to JavaScript and increased the component 's modularity to facilitate support for alternate backends .
" These changes should now make it much easier to write a component integrating Login Manager with the OS X Keychain ( or the Gnome Keychain , or whatever ) , " says Dolske in a blog entry .
Firefox 3 bookmark tagging mockup
An assortment of new minor features are also included in Firefox 3 alpha 5 .
A new crash reporting system called Breakpad is now available in some Mac OS X and Windows builds but is not yet supported on Linux .
Support for the Growl notification framework and native controls are also available in Firefox 3 alpha 5 builds for Mac OS X .
One of the most significant features in Firefox 3 is Gecko 1.9 , a vastly improved Cairo - based HTML rendering engine .
As we reported in our early review of the first Firefox 3 alpha , Gecko 1.9 can pass the Acid 2 test , a CSS test case developed by the Web Standards Project to illuminate flaws in HTML / CSS rendering engines .
Support for Cairo - based rendering in Gecko 1.9 also ensures higher quality SVG rendering .
Gran Paradiso alpha 5 source code and binary builds for Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux are available for download from the Mozilla.org web site , but users should keep in mind that Firefox alpha builds are primarily intended for testing and debugging rather than regular use .
The compressed Bz2 archive containing the Gran Paradiso alpha 5 build and associated files for Linux is about 8.6 MB , but it expands to about 25 MB after decompression .
As usual , we recommend caution when testing alpha software .
Users should back up their Firefox configuration directories and create alternate profiles for use with alpha builds .
When testing the alpha 5 release , users should keep in mind that the bookmarks .
html file is migrated to the places .
sqlite file only once .
If you are using the same profile with Firefox 2.x and a Firefox 3 alpha ( which is probably not a good idea ) , bookmarks added with one version wo n't be accessible by the other after the initial conversion .
The official Firefox 3 schedule does not include an anticipated release date for Firefox 3 .
One more alpha release is expected to occur at the end of this month which will incorporate most of the features planned for inclusion in Firefox 3 .
The first beta release will occur in late July following the final feature and user interface freeze , and a second beta is planned for September .
After the second beta release , additional betas and release candidates will be released as needed until the final Firefox 3 release .
With support for Gecko 1.9 and the long - anticipated Places system , Firefox 3 promises to be a powerful and impressive release .
Firefox market share continues to climb and is currently estimated at anywhere between 12 and 20 percent by various sources .
The addition of compelling new features in Firefox 3 should help Firefox 's ascent .
Jack Straw said communities had to help themselves
Jack Straw
He said young black men needed their fathers as role models , otherwise their development suffered .
Black girls from similar backgrounds had different attitudes and succeeded more than black boys , he said .
He was responding to US civil rights activist Jesse Jackson who said inner city violence was an economic problem .
" Gang violence is rooted in the economics of desperation , " said Rev Jackson , adding that some people were " profiting " from providing guns to deprived areas .
It 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting
Justice Secretary Jack Straw
He called for more investment in pre-natal care and education , rather than building more jails .
But Mr Straw , speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , said the problem was not due to economics .
" One of the striking things is the difference between the attitude and the success in life of black girls from exactly the same backgrounds compared to black boys . "
Black girls perform around the average at Key Stage 4 , aged 16 , compared to the overall population , he said .
' Lads need dads '
" Black boys go backwards when they get to secondary school .
" It 's a cultural problem .
It 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting .
" And as we know - lads need dads .
Of course they need their mums as well , but there is a particular point in teenagers ' development , of young men , where fathers are very important and they are more likely to be absent in the case of the Afro - Caribbean , " Mr Straw said .
Mr Straw said the government had put in place schemes to deter people from getting into gang violence , but admitted " there is a very great deal more to do " .
" But this can not just be a matter for the government .
" It has to be a matter for these communities because the problem for these communities is that not only are they - the black lads - much more likely to end up in prison , but they are also much more likely to be the victims of crime than the white or non-black sections of the community . "
Army career
He praised a project by the chairman of the Commission on Equality and Human Rights , Trevor Phillips , to encourage black senior military officers to mentor young black men and persuade them not to become involved in gangs and crime .
He said : " The Army is a very good career for many black and Asian people , and I do n't think its an accident that my very close friend Colin Powell , the former US secretary of state and head of services there , managed to make his way in society through his experiences in the US Army . "
Rev Jackson is visiting the UK to launch Equanomics UK , a programme focussing on wage inequality , poverty , trade policy , and the impact of credit and debt on ethnic communities .
He said the UK's black and ethnic communities should be encouraged to play a bigger role in politics .
" The people of colour are under - represented at every level of government . "
Surfing As GoogleBot – Their IP , Their User - Agent , Their Bot Characteristics
After reading this article and this article which give frustratingly over - simplifications on user - agent spoofing to get past cloaked websites , I figured I should write something on how to REALLY behave like Google .
Cloaking often goes well beyond this , using IP delivery , User Agent cloaking , javascript and cookie detection , and referer detection – all of which can be used to determine that you are you and not a bot .
So , how do you beat all 5 major types of cloaking ?
1. Beat IP Delivery : Use Google Translate as a Proxy , translating from spanish -> english even though the site is already in English .
2. Beat User - Agent Cloaking : Use the FirefoxUser - Agent Switcher to spoof as GoogleBot
3. Beat Javascript Detection : Use the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar to turn off javascript .
4. Beat Cookie Detection : Use the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar to turn off cookies .
5. Beat Referer Detection : Use the Firefox RefControl Extension to prevent referer from being sent .
Using these in conjunction can be extremely effective , even at pay - for - information sites .
Doing this may be against the terms of service of the site you are visiting .
There are plenty of popular sites out their that cloak content which is normally only available to paying members .
While these techniques work on those sites too , be careful .
Good browsing !

Oil reserve management needs more transparency , the report says
The anti-corruption body said urgent steps were needed to ensure that corruption did not become endemic .
Publishing its annual report , TI said there was evidence of " high levels " of corruption in post - war Iraq .
The Iraqi government , coalition forces and foreign donors must be more " aggressive " on corruption , it said .
' Strong measures '
Foreign contractors should be bound by anti-corruption laws while the management of Iraq 's oil revenues needed to be much more transparent and accountable , Transparency International said in its Global Corruption Report 2005 .
" Strong and immediate measures must be taken to address corruption before the real spending on reconstruction starts , " it said .
Iraq has so far failed to learn the lessons of post - war reconstruction in Cambodia , Congo and Afghanistan , TI said , where a combination of weak government , thriving black markets , and a legacy of patronage allowed corruption to flourish .
The US has been a poor role model in how to keep corrupt practices at bay
Transparency International
Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , bribery has taken place at all levels of government while officials within the Coalition Provisional Authority , contractors and ministry staff have admitted to corruption .
According to Transparency International , the former regime 's control of the economy left a legacy of corruption which survived its collapse .
' Secret process '
However , the body is critical of the United States ' handling of the reconstruction process , arguing that its process for awarding public contracts was secretive and favoured a small number of large firms .
Its comments echo those of the International Advistory and Monitoring Board , a United Nations body , which in December criticised the CPA for awarding contracts to oil services firm Halliburton and other firms without a competitive process .
" In its procurement strategies , the US has been a poor role model in how to keep corrupt practices at bay , " the report says .
Attempts to tackle corruption , such as independent auditing of government ministries and new laws to protect whistleblowers , had only had a modest impact .
The diversion of funds from publicly financed projects represents an unacceptable tax on the poor
James Wolfensohn , World Bank
Failure to address corruption threatened to push up the cost of rebuilding Iraq and hold back its economic development .
" Corruption does n't just line the pockets of political and business elites , it leaves ordinary people without essential services and deprives them of access to sanitation and housing , " said Peter Eigen , Transparency International 's chairman .
Blacklisting
Tougher penalties are needed to stamp out the corruption blighting public procurement , not just in Iraq but worldwide , TI said .
Companies found guilty of bribery should forfeit the relevant contract and should be prevented from bidding for similar work .
Tendering processes should be open to public scrutiny and independent oversight .
The World Bank - which since last year has required all companies awarded large - scale projects under its control to sign an anti-bribery agreement - said the report highlighted issues of " deep concern " .
" The diversion of funds from publicly financed projects represents an unacceptable tax on the poor , " said World Bank president James Wolfensohn .
" In the construction sector , it represents a deplorable opportunity lost for the delivery of essential services and it undermines citizen trust in government . "
Other than OJ , the missing pretty white girl du jour ( none that I know of , but I have faith ... there must be one ) , and whatever Britney Spears has done lately , is Iran what Americans are all talking about ??
And do they really think Iran is a credible threat and we should go to war with them ??
WTF ?
Never mind that we 've already utterly destabilized the entire region by invading Iraq ...
Never mind that our occupation resulted in the death of an estimated 1 million Iraqis ...
Never mind that we 're coming up on 4000 American troop deaths in Iraq ...
Never mind that thousands of men and women have come home to America physically and mentally altered forever ...
Never mind that those men and women are not receiving adequate care upon returning home ...
Never mind that Osama bin Laden is still out there ( and he has a MUCH higher approval rating than Bush or America among Pakistanis ) ...
Never mind that we 've spent hundreds of billions on this stupid boondoggle ...
Never mind that the huge deficits we 've created provide an excuse for the right to cut funds for our social safety net ...
Never mind that New Orleans was wiped off the map two years ago and we still have n't done what 's needed there ...
Never mind that we know damn well there were NO WMDs ...
Never mind the Downing Street Memo came out so long ago that most of us have forgotten about it ...
Never mind our government used " the war on terror " as an excuse to repeal the Magna Carta ...
Never mind that 70 + % of Americans oppose the war in Iraq ...
Never mind that our troops have gone on multiple rotations to Iraq , many with substandard equipment while there , and we 've extended the military to the breaking point ...
Never mind ALL OF THAT - which I would consider to be a LONG LIST OF REASONS why we should NOT GO TO WAR ANYWHERE right now -
Iran is NOT a serious threat and there is NO case for war .
How would Americans respond if someone suggested randomly that we bomb Tahiti ?
Or Canada ?
How about Greece ?
Or why not Thailand ?
Mali ?
Uruguay ?
Can Americans even find these places on the map ?
We 've got no reason to go to war with any one of them - and we have no more reason to go to war with Iran .
Do we agree with Iran on every issue ?
Of course not .
Of course we do n't .
But we do n't agree with MANY countries on MANY issues .
And a disagreement is not a case for war .
Do we like Iran 's government ?
Nope .
Not a bit .
But how many other countries have craptastic governments ?
And many of them are our allies .
To name two : Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
Could Iran have nukes some day ?
Yep .
Some day .
Not yet .
But guess what ?
Pakistan has them now .
And remember what I said about Pakistanis liking Osama better than they like us .
And still , we call them an ally .
Does Iran contain Muslim extremists ?
You bet .
And so does the UK , Germany , the U.S. , Indonesia , and countries all over the world .
For the record , most countries also contain peace - loving Muslims as well .
Here in the U.S. , I count many devout Muslims among my good friends .
We 're talking Koran - reading , Urdu - and Arabic - speaking , scarf - wearing , brown - skinned Muslims who abstain from drinking alcohol , fast during Ramadan , and have arranged marriages .
Yep , arranged marriages .
And they are my good friends .
They have NO desire to commit any sort of violence or interfere with the government or the safety of the United States in any way .
On the contrary , several are doctors .
One 's a biology teacher .
They save American lives and educate American children .
On one radio show tonight ( I 'm not sure which ) , a guest said the best prevention for war with Iran would be to fly each American to Iran for a visit .
I bet he 's right .
I have n't been there - the closest I 've gotten are Turkey , Israel , and Egypt - but I 've been to about 20 countries and everywhere I 've been , people are the same .
Cultures differ GREATLY .
Even the British are significantly culturally different from us .
And the differences between US and the UK culture pale in comparison to the differences between American and Chinese culture .
But overall , beyond that , people are people .
They want to live their lives in peace .
Go to work , come home , care for their families , hang out with their friends , that 's all anyone wants .
For those who thought a war would bring some excitement , well , we 've got two now .
Are they exciting ?
It 's every bit as brutal and bloody and horrific as the history books warned us it would be .
Why anyone would advocate any war of any kind is beyond me , but then again , I do n't understand why Jeffrey Dahmer killed and ate people either .
If I had the ability to speak to every American - and I wish I did - I want to tell them :
There is no threat from Iran , not one that even requires discussing war or considering war .
Forget Iran .
â€ œI do n't think you are supposed to put others through hell so you can avoid it yourself .â€ 
- A Good Friend -
In the cold , early morning hours of January 1 , 1974 , a good friend , then a 19 - year - old college student , was driving home alone from a New Yearâ€™s Eve party .
Her Volkswagen was forced off the road .
She was dragged kicking and screaming into the van of a man who had decided to kidnap and rape her .
My friend spent the hours immediately after her brutal violation convincing the man not to kill her .
â€ œA van appeared out of nowhere attempting to run me off the road .
I was panic - stricken .
I pulled into a parking lot where two men were preparing morning papers for delivery and ran from my car trying to reach them .
My attacker caught me from behind and dragged me into his van .
I was so close to the paper men I could almost touch them .
I screamed for them to help me .
The man who would rape me shouted to them that I was his girlfriend and that we were having a fight .
Apparently that was okay with the paper men.â€ 
â€ œHe drove to an isolated area in a nearby town , then ordered me to take off my clothes and get in the back of the van .
I fought him until he punched me .
I remembered hearing once that the best way to survive a violent sexual assault was to give in , so I did .
The guilt of doing so haunted me for years.â€ 
The Wisconsin State Senate overwhelmingly passed the â€œCompassionate Care for Rape Victims , â€ a bill that requires hospitals providing emergency services to inform a rape victim of her right to receive Plan B emergency contraception ( high - dosage birth control pills administered within 72 hours of intercourse ) and to immediately provide it upon her request .
The bill was referred to the Assembly Judiciary and Ethics Committee , where it was amended by the committee chair , Rep. Mark Gundrum , a dogmatic Roman Catholic who was awarded the 1999 Legislator of the Year Award by Pro-Life Wisconsin , an anti-contraceptives / anti-choice organization opposed to the Compassionate Care for Rape Victims bill .
The amendment was a â€œconscience clauseâ€ allowing healthcare providers to opt out of informing a rape victim about the Plan B emergency contraception option because of religious or moral beliefs .
The amendment was passed by a 6 - 4 party line vote in the Republican controlled committee .
Rep .
Gundrum included the amendment because he believes there were some First Amendment issues with the bill , â€œ freedom of speech and freedom of religion . . . forcing people to say things they donâ€™t mean . . . that may be against their religious beliefs.â€ 
This amendment becomes a serious problem in the first 72 hours of a rape crisis , especially in rural areas with small medical clinics , if one or more of the healthcare providers have religious convictions against informing a victim of rape that she has an option that will safely and effectively prevent her from becoming pregnant with her assailantâ€™s child .
One - third of reproductive age women remain unaware of emergency contraception .
The Wisconsin compassionate care law has nothing to do with freedom of speech or freedom of religion and everything to do with appropriate , responsible , legal health care . . . not to mention basic humanity .
â€ œAfter he raped me , he said he did n't know what to do with me .
He said that he could kill me and I thought he would .
There were shotgun shells strewn across the dashboard and he said he had a shotgun.â€ 
â€ œIn the days and weeks following the rape I did not sleep , I could not eat , and I was afraid to be out after dark .
My entire life changed .
There simply are no words to describe the shame and guilt that became so much a part of my life .
I remember soaking in the tub for what seemed like hours , night after night , attempting to cleanse myself of the filth of the rape.â€ 
In 2004 there were 1,134 forcible rapesâ€ ” one every 7 hours and 43 minutesâ€ ” reported in Wisconsin .
One in four of those victims said they feared death or serious injury .
Nationally , over 300,000 forcible rapes are reported each year .
Twenty - five thousand of these women will become pregnant .
If these victims have timely access to Plan B emergency contraception , an estimated 22,000 pregnanciesâ€ ” almost 90 percentâ€ ” could be prevented .
A 1996 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology revealed that 50 percent of rape - related pregnancies end in abortion .
Plan B would prevent these abortions .
â€ œI was so young and so naÃ¯ve that it did n't immediately occur to me I could be pregnant .
I was a virgin the morning I was raped .
I was not using birth control .
Plan B emergency contraception was not an option 33 years ago .
The only options at the time were to have had an abortion or to carry to term and give birth to the child of the man who had kidnapped and raped and threatened to kill me .
I became possessed by this decision , wondering if I would see this man 's face in the child .
And if I chose to have his child , could I love it the way a child needs to be loved . . . unconditionally .
Would I ever heal ?
In the end , I decided I could not have an abortion .
I would have chosen Plan B , however.â€ 
There is federal legislation , the â€œCompassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies
Act , â€ in both houses of Congress that will require hospitals receiving federal funds through the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide Plan B emergency contraception to rape victims .
One can safely assume that right - wing Christian organizations such as â€ œFocus on the Familyâ€ and â€ œConcerned Women of Americaâ€ will be putting their considerable political clout into melting the spine of any politician with the slightest inclination to support the federal CARE Act .
Like Wisconsinâ€™s compassionate care law , it will no doubt get locked up in committee , eviscerated and forgotten about .
This is , after all , not the first attempt at passing such federal legislation .
Only nine states have statutes providing victims of rape with timely access to Plan B emergency contraception .
Considering the current fragile state of Roe v.
Wade , strong state and federal compassionate care laws may be a rape victimâ€™s only hope of having her right to choose the rest of her life supercede the rapistâ€™s â€œrightâ€ to impregnate her .
If the likes of Rep. Gundrum or Pro-Life Wisconsin or Focus on the Family prevail , the man who chooses to rape will win hands down .
â€ œThough many years have passed and I consider myself healed from the rape , there are still times I look at my four children and thank God Iâ€™ve never had to explain to one of them that their father was a rapist .
I also thank God I am not reminded of that man and of that cold New Yearâ€™s morning whenever I look at them but , instead , know that each one of my children was conceived by choice , and in love , and were fathered by a most wonderful man.â€ 

So how does the Establishment deal with a Ron Paul candidacy ?
What else did you expect ?
By ignoring him as much as possible .
The Reuters headline following the May 3 GOP debate : " 2008 Republicans back war . "
All right , you say , perhaps that ’s just a crude summary .
A headline ca n’t say everything , after all , and the article itself will surely disambiguate the candidates .
It ’s certainly newsworthy that a nine - term Republican congressman had been a fierce opponent of the war from the beginning , and made his antiwar position clear time and again during the debate .
Naturally this will get some play .
But not even a hint of that in the Reuters article by John Whitesides .
I mean , hey , did n’t you read the headline ?
The 2008 Republicans back war !
Here ’s the entire coverage of Ron Paul : " Also participating were Kansas Sen . Sam Brownback , Reps. Tom Tancredo of Colorado , Ron Paul of Texas , and Duncan Hunter of California . "
Well , that ’s just a smash - up job there , Mr. Whitesides .
That was n’t an isolated case .
On the Liberty and Power blog , David Beito reports : " Later that night , CNN ’s post - debate spin segment sank to an even greater low .
The panel included Arianna Huffington and some neo-con guy from The Weekly Standard .
Nobody mentioned Paul ’s views .
The ever - insufferable Huffington , who either did not watch the debate or lied about what she saw , self - righteously proclaimed that all of the ten candidates supported the war .
Nobody challenged her .
Are we to be spared nothing ? "
The creepy Dick Morris is in a category all his own .
First , he declared John McCain the winner .
Now anyone who watched the debate had to be wondering if McCain ’s , well , weirdness was meant for laughs .
At the same time , you almost had to admire how he could be at once stilted and robotic , and yet also crazed and menacing .
But back to our subject : Morris ignored Paul altogether .
Now he managed to find time to mention Jim Gilmore , Mike Huckabee , Duncan Hunter , Tom Tancredo , and Tommy Thompson — heck , he mentioned every other candidate besides Ron Paul , even listing specific winners and losers .
Since a candidate like Ron Paul is n’t allowed to exist in Dick Morris ’ world , he apparently could n’t win or lose .
Now we have the phenomenon of Yahoo News inexplicably excluding Ron Paul from its list of GOP candidates .
Yet right there are Mike Huckabee and Duncan Hunter , whose combined support in the polls trails Ron Paul’s .
Stunned , I actually called Yahoo and left a voicemail message for their chief communications officer , and included my email address .
In their emailed reply , I was told : " According to the latest FEC filings , it is our understanding that Congressman Paul has not officially entered the 2008 Presidential race , but has only gotten to the stage of forming an exploratory committee . "
Huh ?
Unannounced candidates are allowed into the debates ?
Ca n’t possibly be true , I thought .
So I simply went to the Federal Election Commission website , and after three seconds of searching I found Ron Paul ’s filing statement , dated March 12 .
( That ’s funny : I was told Yahoo had consulted " the latest FEC filings . " )
Well , here are Ron Paul ’s documents right here .
To Yahoo ’s credit , after I sent them this documentation I was told that they would have a page for Ron Paul up within a week .
But apparently it ’s going to take persistence and vigilance to ensure that Paul is treated fairly .
As of yesterday , for example , ABC News began deleting and banning posts about Ron Paul , as well as posts complaining about this deletion policy .
See this article .
Since that post was written , ABC has begun blocking all comments about Ron Paul .
The same media establishment that bought the Iraq propaganda package and then claimed to be oh - so - sorry is now trying to keep out of the limelight the one presidential contender who has actually bucked the establishment and does something other than parrot government / media slogans .
But that ’s what the mainstream media ’s purpose is : to define the nature of our political debate and make sure no fundamental questions are ever raised .
No , I do n’t mean that the heads of these organizations held a special meeting and after exchanging the secret handshake pledged to keep mum about Paul .
My point is that no such meeting is necessary .
As shills for the establishment , they think alike on everything that matters .
While marginal debate is to be permitted here and there , truly independent voices are to be demonized , drowned out , or , better yet , ignored altogether .
( Ask Amy Goodman of the left ’s Democracy Now !
program why she does n’t close up shop and just let ABC and Fox give us our news . )
The media establishment likes the status quo just the way it is .
This is all the more reason for people interested in Ron Paul to talk about him , write about him , and light up the Internet about him .
( I wrote this piece as a quick intro to Paul so people could quickly and easily show their friends what made him so unusual and admirable . )
Not only will you serve the cause of genuine political debate in this country — if we wind up with Rudy and Hillary , what on earth will they have to debate about ? — but you ’ll also tick off the race of clones who give us only the news they think we need .
That ’s reward enough , is n’t it ?
The Best of Tom Woods
I was queuing for a ticket at Clapham Junction when it happened .
The train was leaving any minute from a platform at the other end of the station , so I was tense .
To add to my woes , the person in front of me using the machine was one of those professional ditherers the Sod 's Law Corporation apparently employs to arrive in your life at the most infuriating moments .
As time drained away , he gawped at the screen like a medieval serf trying to comprehend helicopter controls , confounded by one simple question after another - questions such as where he was going , and how many of him there were .
I ground my teeth to chalkdust as his hand hovered over the touch screen , afraid to choose , like a man deciding whether to stroke a sleeping wolf .
Finally the prick was done , and once I had waited for him to collect his tickets and his bloody receipt , it was my turn .
Having no change , I opted to pay by card .
But just as my hand moved toward the keypad to enter my pin , a voice in my head whispered : " You do n't know what it is . "
And it was right .
I did n't .
I scanned my head , but nope : my pin had vanished .
It had gone .
I tried inputting something that seemed about right .
" INCORRECT PIN , " said the screen .
I slowed my breathing to clear my head .
Rested my hand on the keypad a second time .
Tried to fall back on muscle memory .
Performed a finger dance .
" INCORRECT PIN . "
I became aware of the snaking , sighing queue behind me .
Now I was the ditherer .
A third bum guess would swallow the card , so I snapped it back into my wallet , turned on my heel and walked off , past the eyes of the queue , trying vainly to look as though not buying a ticket had been my plan all along , and everything was going smoothly , thanks for asking .
Annoyed , I went outside and hailed a taxi .
As I sat in the back , I examined the contents of my head .
The number had to be in there somewhere .
After all , I 've only got one card .
One pin to remember .
And I use it all the time , every day ; in supermarkets , cafes , cashpoints , stations ... everywhere .
I realised that I 'd better remember it soon or I would n't be able to function in modern society .
Yet the harder I thought , the more elusive the number became .
The only thing I knew for certain was that it did n't have a letter J in it .
And that was n't much of a clue .
My brain had deleted it for no reason whatsoever .
I asked friends for advice .
One told me to close my eyes and visualise my fingers on the keypad .
Trouble is , I 'm so scared of thieves peeking over my shoulder , I 've perfected the art of making my hand look like it 's entering a different pin to the one it 's actually entering .
When I try to picture it in my mind 's eye , I can't actually see what I 'm doing .
I 've managed to fool myself within my own head .
Someone else told me the key was to stop worrying about it and go Zen .
Next time you 're passing a cashpoint , relax : it 'll just come to you , they said .
But I could n't relax .
If you forget your pin , you have two guesses at an ATM , and two guesses in a shop .
A third incorrect guess incurs a block , and is n't worth risking .
Fail on your first two tries and you have to wait till the following day , when your guess tally is reset .
All of which makes each attempt pretty nerve - racking - like using an unforgiving and incredibly irritating pub trivia machine .
Over the past few days I 've approached cashpoints with misplaced confidence , only to suffer last - minute performance anxiety .
It 's like trying to go at a crowded urinal , when you 're wedged between two men with penises the size of curtain rods , pissing away like horses .
Just as a shy bladder refuses to wee , my brain refuses to dislodge the number .
It wo n't come out .
Not a drop .
I 'm impotent .
This morning I gave in and called the bank , ashamed .
Sensibly , they would n't read my pin out over the phone , but offered to post a reminder .
But because they 're a bank , and banks work to an infuriating Twilight Zone calendar in which any task that would normally take five minutes in our dimension suddenly takes five to 10 " working days " , I 'm currently operating in that unsettling limbo familiar to anyone who 's lost a wallet ; you become a social outcast , carrying ID into your home branch and begging for some old - fashioned banknotes to tide you over .
Inconvenience aside , what 's creeped me out is the thudding blank hole in my head where the number used to live .
It ca n't be possible to completely forget something so familiar .
Perhaps it was stolen .
Perhaps someone hacked into my mind while I was dreaming and sucked it away through a pipe .
Or perhaps this is stage one of my inevitable descent into thrashing , bewildered madness .
What am I going to forget next ?
How to chew food ?
In the meantime , if anyone 's got any hints on lost - memory retrieval , pass them on .
I 've tried everything from getting drunk to lucid dreaming , and the little bastard is still hiding in the bushes , looking on and laughing .
I can sense it .
But I can't see it .

SIMD - oriented Fast Mersenne Twister ( SFMT ) :
twice faster than Mersenne Twister *1 .

What is SFMT ?
SFMT is a new variant of Mersenne Twister ( MT ) introduced by Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto in 2006 .
The algorithm was reported at MCQMC 2006 .
The article published in the proceedings of MCQMC2006 .
( see Prof. Matsumoto 's Papers on random number generation . )
SFMT is a Linear Feedbacked Shift Register ( LFSR ) generator that generates a 128 - bit pseudorandom integer at one step .
SFMT is designed with recent parallelism of modern CPUs , such as multi-stage pipelining and SIMD ( e.g. 128 - bit integer ) instructions .
It supports 32 - bit and 64 - bit integers , as well as double precision floating point as output .
SFMT is much faster than MT , in most platforms .
Not only the speed , but also the dimensions of equidistributions at v-bit precision are improved .
In addition , recovery from 0 - excess initial state is much faster .
See Master 's Thesis of Mutsuo Saito for detail .
The following implementation SFMT19937 can be compiled in three possible platforms :
Standard C without SIMD instructions CPUs with Intel 's SSE2 instructions +
C compiler which supports these feature CPUs with PowerPC's AltiVec instructions +
C compiler which supports these feature
In each platform , SFMT has better performance than MT : see comparison of speed .
We put tables of equidistribution of SFMT .
They are 32 bit and 64bit .
This code is released on January 31st in 2007 , so it may contain some bugs .

The purpose of dSFMT is to speed up the generation by avoiding the expensive conversion of integer to double ( floating point ) .
dSFMT directly generates double precision floating point pseudorandom numbers which have the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating - Point Arithmetic ( ANSI / IEEE Std 754-1985 ) format .
dSFMT is only available on the CPUs which use IEEE 754 format double precision floating point numbers .
dSFMT does n't support integer outputs .
dSFMT supports the output of double precision floating point pseudorandom numbers which distribute in the range of [ 1 , 2 ) , [ 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 ] and ( 0 , 1 ) .
And it also supports the various periods form 2607 - 1 to 2132049 - 1. ( dSFMT ver. 2.1 supports the periods from 2521 - 1 to 2216091 - 1. )
This code is released on March 12th in 2007 , so it may contain some bugs .

Emacs for Rails
This tutorial is a bit out dated now .
I have created a new version of it over on my new blog which is an updated version of this one .
If you are interested in setting up Emacs on Windows , OS X or even in a terminal specifically for Rails development , this 5 part series of posts is for you .
Starting as a total Emacs newbie , I install it on OS X and Windows with the goal of making it the ideal platform independent development for Rails development .
Setting Emacs up for Rails is a great way to learn the both basics of the editor and some more advanced features .
If you have been toying with the idea of learning what Emacs is all about follow along and before you know it you will not longer be a Emacs newbie !
Part one discusses why I chose to learn Emacs
Part two gets Emacs installed and some other essential details
Part three gets the Emacs Code Browser installed – one of the most useful features !
Part four gets some Ruby specific features installed plus a little compile magic
Part five finally gets the full blown Rails integration working
If you liked these articles and use Oracle in your day job , you may also be interested in how to connect to SQLPLUS in Emacs .
O'Reilly takes on Tony Snow , ' You ca n't win' in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get breaking politics headlines with RSS .
Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly promised his audience " the truth about Iraq " on Thursday , saying that most Americans now feel the war has not been worth the costs , while " the president 's argument for sustaining the war is largely theoretical . "
O'Reilly turned on his special guest during the segment , White House press secretary Tony Snow , saying , " You ca n't win ... unless the Iraqi people turn on all the terrorists .
And they 're not . "
O'Reilly said he agreed with the president that defeat in Iraq could harm the US but said that " enough is enough . "
The populist pundit who , according to his Wikipedia entry has n't been a registered Republican since 2000 , added that the American people are as exhausted by this war as they ultimately were by Vietnam , and also that " the Iraqi government is incompetent and " the people themselves largely ungrateful . "
" The whole thing is tragic and depressing , complicated and dangerous , " O'Reilly concluded .
" After more than four years , Iraq remains a huge stone around America 's neck . "
O'Reilly then turned to former Fox anchor Snow , who argued that " Iraqi security forces ... are increasingly on the front lines " and that the Iraqi people have chosen the Iraqi government over al Qaeda and are saying " thank you " to the Americans .
As Snow continued to insist that the Iraqis will support the American troops if they seem them standing up to protect them , O'Reilly countered him with the analogy of Vietnam .
" We do n't have the hearts and minds there , " said O'Reilly .
" It 's like South Vietnam . ...
We had a lot of South Vietnamese helping us ... but there was n't enough of them . "
Snow then offered the argument that by remaining in Iraq , the president is fulfilling his responsibility to protect America .
He said , " Everybody wishes al Qaeda did n't want to kill us , but they do , " and backed that up with the assertion that " you saw that in Glasgow a couple of weeks ago . "
This was a reference to recent car bomb attacks that British reports have indicated were inspired by but not directly linked to al Qaeda .
Snow finally suggested that Americans are discouraged because , instead of stories about progress in Iraq , " people see scenes of dead American soldiers . "
However , the New York Times has reported that " A survey last year found that in a six - month period in which 559 Americans and Western allies died , almost no pictures were published of the American dead in the mainstream print media . "
The following video is from Fox 's O'Reilly Factor , broadcast on July 12 .
Update :
For an interesting counterpoint to the myth of the 10 x engineer , check out this blog post by Shanley .
My post is more focused on what makes a good developer than the 10 x myth .
In the The Mythical Man-Month , Fred Brooks highlights an eye opening disparity in productivity between good and poor programmers ( emphasis mine ) .
Programming managers have long recognized wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones .
But the actual measured magnitudes have astounded all of us .
In one of their studies , Sackman , Erickson , and Grant were measuring performance of a group of experienced programmers .
Within just this group the ratios between the best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements !
Robert Glass cites research that puts this disparity even higher in his book Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering .
The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers , according to “ individual differences ” research .
Given that their pay is never commensurate , they are the biggest bargains in the software field .
In other words , the best developers are generally underpaid and the worst developers overpaid .
But do n’t leave your job just yet .
This is not to say that there should be a 1 to 1 correlation between productivity and pay .
People should be paid by the value they bring and productivity is only part of the value proposition , albeit a big part of it .
Even so , we ’d expect to see some amount of correlation in pay with such a drastic productivity difference .
But in general , we do n’t .
Why is that ?
It ’s because most managers do n’t believe this productivity disparity despite repeated verification by multiple studies .
Why should they let facts get in the way of their beliefs ?
That would only mean the factonistas have won .
Kidding aside , why is this productivity difference so hard to believe ?
Allow me to put words in the mouth of a straw - man manager .
Well how in the world can one developer write code 28 times faster than another developer ?
This sort of thinking represents a common fallacy when it comes to measuring developer productivity .
Productivity is not about the lines of code .
A huge steaming pile of code that does n’t get the job done is not productive .
There are many aspects to developer productivity , but they all fall under one main principle ( borrowing a term from the finance industry ) , TCO .
TCO - Total Cost Of Ownership .
In general , I ’ve tried to always hire the best developers I can find .
But I ’ve made mistakes before .
Yes , even me .
One situation that comes to mind was with a developer I had hired ( under a lot of pressure to staff up I might add ) at a former company .
I handed off a project to this erstwhile coworker to take over .
A few days go by and I do n’t hear anything from the guy , so I assume things are humming along nicely .
Fast forward another few days and I swing by to see how it ’s going and the developer tells me he does n’t understand a few requirements and has been spinning his wheels trying to figure it out this whole time .
Good Developers take Ownership so You Don’t Have To
This is one of the first ways that good developers are more productive than average developers .
They take ownership of a project .
Rather than spend a week spinning wheels because they do n’t understand a requirement , a good developer will go and grab the decision maker and squeeze out some clarity .
Likewise , a good developer does n’t require you to prod them every few moments to make sure they are progressing .
If they get overly stuck on a problem , they ’ll come to you or their coworkers and resolve the problem .
A developer who can write code fast , but does n’t take ownership of their projects is not very productive because they end up wasting yourtime .
Good Developers Write Code With Less Bugs
I once worked with a developer who was praised by my boss for being extremely fast at writing code .
He sure was fast !
He was also fast at introducing bugs into code .
His code was sloppy and hard to understand .
The key measure that was n’t figured into his productivity measurement was the amount of productivity lost by the QA team attempting to reproduce bugs introduced by his code , along with the time spent fixing those bugs by this developer or other developers .
Everyone focused on his time to “ completion ” , but not on the total cost of ownership of that code .
Code is not complete when a developer says it is complete .
That is not the time to stop the stopwatch .
It ’s when QA has had its say that you can put the stopwatch away for the moment .
As I like to say , productivity is not about speed .
It ’s about velocity .
You can be fast , but if you ’re going in the wrong direction , you ’re not helping anyone .
Good Developers Write Maintainable Code
Hand in hand with writing less bugs is writing understandable maintainable code .
As soon as a line of code is laid on the screen , you ’re in maintenance mode on that piece of code .
Code that is brittle and difficult to change wastes hours and hours of developer cycles when trying to amend a system with updates and new features .
By writing maintainable code , a good developer can make these changes more quickly and also improves the productivity of his or her team members who later have to work on such code .
Good Developers Do More With Less Code
Another hallmark of a good developer is that they know when not to write code .
As a friend always tells me
Why build what you can buy ?
Why buy what you can borrow ?
Why borrow what you can steal ?
With a few exceptions , the NIH ( Not Invented Here ) syndrome is a pathological productivity killer .
I ’ve seen developers start out to write their own form validation framework until I point out that there is already one built in to ASP .
NET that does the job ( It ’s not perfect , but it ’s better than the one I saw being written ) .
All of that time spent reinventing the wheel is wasted because someone else has already written that code for you .
And in many cases , did a better job as it was their only focus .
In such a situation , finding an existing library that gets the job done can provide a huge productivity boost .
The caveat in this case is to be careful to avoid non-extensible and rigid 3rd party libraries , especially for very specialized requirements .
You might a lot of time trying to fit a round peg in a square box .
Even when you must invent here , good developers tend to write less ( but still readable ) code that does more .
For example , rather than build a state machine to parse out text from a big string , a good developer might use a regular expression ( ok , some will say that a regex is not readable .
Still more readable than hundreds of lines of text parsing code ) .
Back to TCO
Each of these characteristics I ’ve listed keeps the total cost of ownership of a good developer low .
Please do n’t let the term ownership distract you .
What I mean here is the cost to the company for having such a developer on the payroll .
By writing less code that does more , and by writing maintainable code that has fewer bugs , a good developer takes pressure off of the QA staff , coworkers , and management , increasing productivity for everyone around .
This is why numbers such as 28 times productivity are possible and might even seem low when you look at the big picture .
Hopefully seeing this perspective will convince managers that good developers really are as productive as the studies show .
Negotiating a 28 x pay increase on the other hand , is an exercise left to the reader .

For the last four years , along with a rapidly growing constituency of other mature American citizens in a wide variety of respected professions , we have devoted our lives to exposing the severe danger that computerized voting poses to our country ’s democracy .
And we succeeded !
State legislatures are passing laws attempting to manage the use of computers in elections .
Election officials are ordering studies of the machines – and receiving back scathing reports .
Congress is realizing that there is a severe problem that must be addressed .
Even some of the media has begun to report responsibly about the issue .
By presenting overwhelming evidence of the practical and theoretical failure of computerized voting , we succeeded in educating citizens , law - makers , election officials , and the press to the imminent danger of trusting our elections to invisible ballots controlled by greed - motivated vendors .
Now what ?
A few pets poisoned by tainted pet food , and a national recall begins within days .
Tens of thousands of voters disenfranchised by flawed computer equipment ; thousands of votes lost on e-voting machines ; hundreds of elections in doubt ; dozens of lawsuits filed against the vendors and the use of their machines ; and our elected representatives can’t figure out what to do !
Have we become a nation of idiots ?
When a clear and present danger to democracy becomes evident , why ca n’t our public servants figure out what to do ?
Even the most corrupt among them must realize that if democracy dies , their own life style will die along with it .
The New York Times is calling for a national ban on electronic voting machines .
So are untold numbers of citizens who have been studying the issue for years .
So are we .
There may still be time for our representatives to listen .

As nightfall does not come all at once , neither does oppression .
In both instances , there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged .
And it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness .
~ Justice William O. Douglas~
In April , 2007 I was pleasantly surprised to find Naomi Wolf 's article , " Fascist America , In 10 Easy Steps " posted in several places online .
I have been a fan of Wolf for many years , greatly appreciating her works and especially her 1991 book , The Beauty Myth .
I had been looking for a list - or more specifically , an encyclopedia of the losses of civil liberties in the United States that might clarify for my history students the extent to which America has become a fascist empire .
Wolf 's " 10 Easy Steps " was perfect , but her just - published book , The End Of America : Letter Of Warning To A Young Patriot , from which the 10 easy steps was compiled , offers an even fuller picture - a succinct and engaging explanation of how our civil liberties have been hijacked in the past decade .
It is the most poignant , powerful , genuinely patriotic piece of literature I have encountered since Thomas Paine 's Common Sense .
No wonder then , that the book 's cover greatly resembles that 46 - page tract by Paine written in 1775 - as well it should .
One of the most frightening realities of teaching college history is that most students rarely have a clue what fascism is .
They know about Hitler and the extermination of Jews , but they see little connection with Nazi rule in the 1930s and 40s and the current political milieu in the United States .
Overwhelmingly , they cannot define fascism , nor can they define socialism or democracy .
After all , they were pre-occupied during grammar school with becoming standardized human beings by way of taking standardized " No Child 's Behind Left " tests , five hours a day , four days a week .
So why would they know the definitions of fascism , socialism or democracy ?
Refreshingly ,
Wolf is not shy about using the term fascism and lets the reader know why .
" I have made a deliberate choice in using the terms fascist tactics and fascist shift when I describe some events in America now .
I stand by my choice .
I am not being heated or even rhetorical ; I am being technical . "
( 20 ) She explains that where Americans tend to see the various political " isms " as all - or - nothing , that perception is often inaccurate because of what she calls a " range of authoritarian regimes , dictatorships , and varieties of Fascist states ... there are many shades of gray on the spectrum from an open to a closed society . " ( 20 )
Wolf also emphasizes that America has flirted with fascism openly in the 1930s when numerous corporations and robber barons helped finance Hitler and when as Edwin Black notes in IBM And The Holocaust , some American corporations assisted the Nazi regime in carrying out its " final solution " to the " Jewish problem . "
In fact , several of these corporate tycoons attempted to stage a coup d' etat to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 and restructure the American government under fascist control .
A thorough investigation of American politics and society from the end of the Civil War until the present moment reveals , as I have carefully traced in my book U.S. History Uncensored : What Your High School Textbook Didn't Tell
You , that much of recent American history is replete with a preference on the part of corporations and the politicians they own for an economic and political system on the far right end of the spectrum .
In fact , resistance to fascism in the United States has been an arduous and daunting struggle for those who have been able to understand and oppose the appeal that fascism has to the corporatocracy , and in fact , take seriously Mussolini 's fundamental definition of fascism : " Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power . "
As an historian who views American history as the complex unfolding of events that it is , I feel invigorated upon hearing someone like Wolf - especially the Wolf of feminist Beauty Myth fame - part company with the presentation of the Founders as " dead white men " inwardly tormented by various hypocrisies , such as the ownership of slaves and the subordination of women .
Yes , Jefferson owned slaves and fathered six children by one of them , but what gets lost in that drama and other colorful stories of the Founders is that they were also thinking , speaking , and writing highly subversive thoughts .
" You are not taught , " says Wolf , that " these men and women were radicals for liberty ; that they had a vision of equality that was a slap in the face of what the rest of their world understood to be the unchanging , God - given order of nations ; and that they were wiling to die to make that desperate vision into a reality for people like us , whom they would never live to see . " ( 27 ) I do not wish to romanticize the Founders and their generation living in a milieu replete with racism , misogyny , and classism , but neither will I throw their achievements out with the bathwater of political correctness , nor is Wolf willing to do so in her examination of them .
In the " 10 easy steps " outlined by Wolf , countries move from open to closed and repressive societies by devolving past certain markers , and Wolf makes a powerful case for the way in which the United States is following a similar pattern without any significant deviation .
In each instance she compares and contrasts how America 's adherence to the pattern compares or contrasts with the pattern in pre-World War II Germany .
The 10 steps are :
Invoking an external and internal threat Establishing secret prisons Developing a paramilitary force Surveiling ordinary citizens Infiltrating citizens ' groups Arbitrarily detaining and releasing citizens Targeting key individuals Restricting the press Casting criticism as " espionage " and dissent as " treason " Subverting the rule of law
As noted in the quote from Justice Douglas above , the fascist shift is a protracted process ; it never happens overnight , and in U.S. History Uncensored , I offer an historical narrative describing exactly how we have arrived where we are - at " the end of America " .
Some aspects of the process were generated before the U.S. Civil War , but our recent history is nothing less than the story of the acceleration of the fascist agenda and the death of the Republic .
Frequently , books come into our lives with momentous timing .
Several weeks ago a friend of mine was traveling through a small town in upstate New York looking for the location of a meeting he was scheduled to attend .
Realizing that he was lost , he spotted a police officer in a marked car and waived to the officer to pull over .
The officer pulled over , and my friend innocently got out of his car to walk back to the officer 's car .
Suddenly , the officer 's voice came blasting across a loud speaker , " Get back in the car !
Stop where you are !
Get back in the car ! "
My friend returned to his vehicle and waited for the officer to approach his driver 's side window .
The officer , with a hand on his holstered firearm , angrily asked my friend what he wanted .
When my friend asked him for directions , he replied with hostility that he did n't know the location of the place for which my friend was searching and once again repeated , " Never get out of your car when you 're dealing with a police officer . "
So much for asking directions from a police officer these days .
On another occasion , two friends of mine returning from Canada were detained at the U.S. / Canadian border , and while one of them had a U.S. passport , the other had forgotten to bring his .
He produced a variety of identification but was taken aside , questioned , shouted at , and harassed in an extremely hostile manner as if he were an enemy of the state .
Fortunately , after over - the - top intimidation from a couple of surly customs officers , he was allowed to enter the U.S .
About three weeks ago I was returning from a routine visit to the dentist in Mexico and had a U.S. passport with me , even though none will be required for returning from Mexico until January , 2008 .
I was told by a very aggressive female customs agent to pull over to the center where vehicles are detained .
I was ordered in a very hostile manner to give her my driver 's license and the keys to my vehicle and stay in my vehicle .
When I asked what the problem was , I was told to be quiet and again , to stay in my vehicle .
Having taught in Mexico for three years , returning to the U.S. every day and rarely having to show any identification whatsoever , I found this procedure to be astonishingly rigid and unnecessary .
I have made many trips to Mexico in recent months and have never had any problem when the automatic photos that are taken of every license plate crossing the border appeared on U.S. Customs computer screens .
After what seemed like an eternity the female officer returned and told me that it appeared that I had had an expired vehicle registration four years ago which I had not taken care of and that I needed to do so at once .
She gave me the name of the court where the offense was allegedly registered .
The very next day I contacted the court and discovered that indeed I had been stopped four years ago for an expired registration for which I was given a warning .
Every year since , I have purchased my annual registration well before the deadline , but the offense was never brought to my attention , and I even acquired a new driver 's license last year through the motor vehicles division and was not informed of the offense .
Not wanting any further hassle regarding the " heinous crime " of having an expired registration four years ago , I agreed to pay the small fine imposed by the court .
Some readers may assume that I was harassed because of who I am and my open delivery of alternative news and opinions on this website daily .
I , on the other hand , do not believe that this was " all about me . "
Whether or not it was , it is blatantly obvious to me that the behavior of law enforcement in the United States has shifted dramatically in recent months .
Whether or not I was targeted , which I sincerely doubt , this kind of treatment is becoming standard in law enforcement procedure throughout the United States .
And now fast - forward to yesterday , September 18 , 2007 , at Florida State University and the tasering of a student questioning John Kerry regarding the 2004 elections and Kerry 's membership in Skull and Bones - an incident which has been viewed by millions on the internet and on mainstream TV news broadcasts .
Writing of this debacle , Wolf 's article " A Shocking Moment For Society " appeared on various internet sites this morning , and in it she states :
There is a chapter in my new book , The End of America , entitled " Recast Criticism as ‘ Espionage ' and Dissent as ‘ Treason , ' " that conveys why this moment is the horrific harbinger it is .
I argue that strategists using historical models to close down an open society start by using force on ‘ undesirables , ' ‘ aliens , ' ‘ enemies of the state , ' and those considered by mainstream civil society to be untouchable ; in other times they were , of course , Jews , Gypsies , Communists , homosexuals .
Then , once society has been acculturated to that use of force , the ‘ blurring of the line ' begins and the parameters of criminalized speech are extended - the definition of ‘ terrorist ' expanded - and the use of force begins to be deployed in HIGHLY VISIBLE , STRATEGIC and VISUALLY SHOCKING WAYS against people that others see and identify with as ordinary citizens .
The first ‘ torture cellars ' used by the SA , in Germany between 1931 and 1933 - even before the National Socialists gained control of the state , during the years when Germany was still a parliamentary democracy - were informal and widely publicized in the mainstream media .
Few German citizens objected because those abused there were seen as ‘ other ' - even though the abuse was technically illegal .
But then , after this escalation of the use of force was accepted by the population , students , journalists , opposition leaders , and clergy were similarly abused during their own arrests .
Within six months dissent was stilled in Germany .
What is the lesson for us from this and from other closing societies , some of them democracies ?
You can have a working Congress or Parliament ; newspapers ; human rights groups ; even elections ; but when ordinary people start to be hurt by the state for speaking out , dissent closes quickly and the shock chills opposition very , very fast .
Once that happens , democracy has been so weakened that major tactical and strategic incursions - greater violations of democratic process - are far more likely .
If there is dissent about the vote in Florida in this next presidential election - and the police are tasering voters ' rights groups - we will still have an election .
What we will not have is liberty .
We have to understand what time it is .
When the state starts to hurt people for asking questions , we can no longer operate on the leisurely time of a strong democracy - the ‘ Oh gosh how awful ! ' kind of time .
It is time to take to the streets .
It is time to confront those committing crimes against the Constitution .
The window has now dropped several precipitous inches and once it is closed there is no opening it without great and sorrowful upheaval .
As I read Wolf 's latest article , I realized that despite my enormous admiration for her and The End Of America , there are a number of areas where I must disagree with her .
First , the only thing shocking to me about the University of Florida incident is that so many Americans are shocked that it happened .
Last night I posted a communication to her mailing list regarding the incident from former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney who says :
No police officer should be in the business of denying Constitutional rights to anyone ; I am particularly chagrined when it appears that a black police officer participated in this attack on an innocent student .
What is happening to us ????
How much more will the people accept ??
I was outraged as early as 2000 when Florida was stolen and the Democrats said nothing !!!!
Now , innocent students get tasered just for asking questions .
What kind of US Senator do we have who can't or wo n't answer a question about his own election that affects all of us ???
Wolf has given us a compendium of civil and Constitutional rights stolen from us during the past eight years of the Bush administration .
If one understands this odyssey of oppression , then yesterday 's tasering of a questioning student makes perfect sense .
I appreciate why Wolf used the word " shocking " in her most recent article , but I 'd be willing to bet that she is n't shocked at all - not after the extraordinary documentation she has given us in The End Of America .
What I do believe she wishes to clarify is the intentionally traumatizing methodology of law enforcement to maintain social control .
Secondly , I must take issue with Wolf regarding her statement that " ... we on the left must snap out of our ‘ it 's - all - the - WTO - the - two - parties - are - the - same ' torpor ...
We have to reengage in an old - fashioned commitment to democratic action and believe once again in an old - fashioned notion of the Republic .
We need to help lead a democracy movement in America like the ones that have toppled repressive regimes overseas . "
( 141 )
Again , let 's fast forward not to yesterday , but today and the headline " Senate bars bill to restore detainee rights " - a decision which supports the Bush administration 's denial of habeas corpus to Guantanamo prisoners who want to challenge their imprisonment in court .
Need we reiterate one more time that since the 2006 elections , the Democrats have done virtually nothing to end the occupation of Iraq ?
Need we watch the video one more time of John Kerry standing mute and statue - like on the University of Florida auditorium stage - saying or doing nothing as a student was tasered for asking him why he handed the 2004 election to George W. Bush ?
Does anyone seriously believe that in a world where fellow students applaud as police remove and taser a questioning student and do nothing to speak up against such an outrage that we will see a viable , effective " democracy movement in America like the ones that have toppled repressive regimes overseas " ?
As for Wolf 's suggestion in today 's article that we " take to the streets " , the police state is preparing for that eventuality as well by letting us know that it has developed severely injuring electromagnetic crowd control technology that will dramatically limit how many and how often people can " take to the streets . "
Welcome to full - spectrum " 1984 " .
I repeat : the police state is right here , right now !
Moreover , some pivotal factors that Wolf has not addressed are global energy depletion , climate change , and global economic meltdown which are exacerbating the fascist shift about which she so brilliantly writes and which will continue to embolden that shift as energy scarcity , climate chaos , and financial crises add fuel to the fires of terrorism that the ruling elite have so consciously and carefully incited and fanned throughout America .
As American society continues to unravel , the fascist shift will escalate , and what is left of our civil liberties will further evaporate .
As for political parties , I prefer the definition offered by Mike Ruppert in " America : From Freedom To Fascism " in which he explains that the two major parties are like two crime families - the Genoveses and the Gambinos .
They function like players in a crap game that feign opposition to each other , but when the chips are down , they will always unite to serve their common interests .
( If the Iraq occupation is not a case in point , then I do n't know what is . )
When we vote in presidential elections for corporately - owned candidates or " the lesser evil " , we are merely choosing between the two crime families , and even if one candidate were not a crime family member , our votes in the past two presidential elections , as Bev Harris has so astutely demonstrated , have been hacked .
In the throes of the current , and I might add , rapidly - accelerating fascist shift , what evidence do we have for assuming that if there is an election in 2008 , anything will be different ?
Tell me again , what 's the definition of insanity ?
At this moment another Naomi comes to mind - Naomi Klein whose book Shock Doctrine I shall soon review on this site .
In that work Klein documents one of the key strategies of fascist empires : shocking their citizens into submission in a variety of ways from widespread societal terrorism to the administering of electroshock therapy to individuals .
What we witnessed at the University of Florida yesterday , and what we are likely to see more frequently in America , are deliberate shock tactics applied by law enforcement to citizens for the purpose of achieving massive social control .
Some of my students who are criminal justice majors tell me that the latest strategies now being taught to police officers are " shock doctrine " techniques which terrorize and intimidate civilians in order to control them .
Law enforcement officers are no longer encouraged to " keep a cool head " but to " follow their own instincts " ( which usually means their own internal , adrenaline - charged state of terror ) and react with full force because it 's easier to apologize ( or encounter a lawsuit ) than to ask permission or risk being killed .
Terrified people should not be wearing a badge and carrying a gun , and when they are , a fully terrorized society is guaranteed .
In spite of my disagreements with Naomi Wolf 's suggested solutions , I cannot recommend The End Of America enthusiastically enough .
It is now a permanent part of my U.S. history curriculum and is an ideal tool not only for educators , but for parents who want to teach their children where all those civil liberties we used to have actually came from as well as how and why they are disappearing in the present moment .

China ’s rapid economic and military expansion is certainly a blip on everybody ’s radar .
It has a lot of investors excited , but it also has a lot of China ’s neighbors worried .
That ’s why countries like Taiwan and Japan are making a point to further their involvement with India , another future world power .
In a report issued Sept. 9 , Taiwan ’s Council for Economic Planning and Development ( CEPD ) established new goals for economic relations with India .
According to the China Post , Taiwan is planning to boost its cooperation in India in the fields of construction , finance , and transportation , making it one of Taiwan ’s top ten trade partners by the year 2015 .
The report outlined a number of advantages and disadvantages with respect to investment in India .
The country has a growing middle class of 300 million consumers and a well - developed software industry .
However , it lacks modern infrastructure and an efficient government .
It also has high production costs that discourage foreign investment .
Still , Taiwan hopes to establish a higher level of communication , and increase its annual exports to the nation by 15 % over the next three years .
Currently India is ranked at No. 25 on Taiwan ’s trade list , but Taiwanese officials are hoping India will have cracked the top 10 by 2015 .
To that end , a series of seminars have been held over the past few weeks with the objective of accelerating the transition .
According to the report , the next step will be for Taiwan to increase its technological and academic exchanges with India as well as bilateral cooperation in the sectors of construction , finance , transportation , and agro-technology .
The report also outlined several strategies for inviting high - end Indian talent and corporations to establish their own footholds in Taiwan .
Japan is also pushing for broader exposure to the Indian market , which many of its experts feel is lacking .
In a report presented to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , the Japan Forum on International Relations urged the government to take further steps to promote free trade talks and private - sector exchanges with India .
The heightened sense of urgency stemmed from perceived gains by Western companies from outsourcing clerical and information technology operations to low - cost Indian firms .
According to the Forum , “ Unless Japanese companies do likewise , they risk remaining the only ones not leveraging India ’s IT expertise , and could end up losing international competitiveness . ”
The Forum also called for more foreign direct investment in India , estimating that only 5 % of India ’s FDI comes from Japan , while 8 % comes from the U.K. and 12 % from the United States .
Eisuke Sakakibara , the former Finance Ministry official who headed up the group , also pointed out that Japanese companies have failed to exploit the buying power of India ’s burgeoning middle class .
“ A giant market is developing and Japanese companies risk missing a huge opportunity , ” he said .
Advantages Over China
In light of all the attention it has received , India is starting to show signs of confidence , and a desire to step outside of China ’s shadow .
John Elliot quotes several Indian sources in his Riding the Elephant Blog , which can be found on CNN.com .
Elliot quotes , M.V. Kotwal , a director of Larsen & Toubro ( L&T ) , as saying that China “ is a regulated economy which means suppression of independent thinking , and that limits entrepreneurial activity . ”
By contrast , in India “ there is a lot of freedom of thought which means that talent is available , and people come out with solutions whenever they are given a chance . ”
L&T is India ’s largest and most international heavy engineering group .
It has sold ten coal gasification plants totaling $ 350 million to China in the past three years .
Also , Anand Mahindra , managing director of Mahindra & Mahindra , made the point that Chinese machinery workers can beat deadlines , but they lack the flexibility to switch instantly to a different machine .
“ The Indian mind is not fazed by confusion and apparent disorder , ” he said , “ If there is a wrinkle on a dye , an Indian engineer will sort it , but a Chinese will want to fly in an expert . ”
Party of Four
India ’s strengths expand well beyond economic growth however .
It is beginning to look more and more like the best chance for a democratic counterbalance to China as well .
And that is another role it is eager to embrace .
During first week of September , India entertained the largest known collection of foreign navy vessels ever in the Bay of Bengal for joint military exercises .
The largest representation was that of the United States which volunteered 13 ships including two aircraft carriers , a nuclear submarine , two guided missile cruisers , and six guided missile destroyers .
In all , 30 warships and 200 aircraft from India , the U.S. , Australia , Singapore , and Japan took part in the exercise .
Also this month , the respective leaders of Australia , the United States , and Japan held their first - ever joint strategic meeting in which they discussed India ’s potential role in the region .
At face value , it looks as though Australia , India , Japan and the U.S. are forging an informal defensive pact based on shared national interests and democratic values .
An Indian commentator , Sudha Ramachandran , has called it a “ quadrilateral axis of democracy ” or “ quad . ”
This is the most concrete evidence of the multi-lateral construction of a counterweight to Chinese expansion we ’ve seen so far .
Meanwhile China is struggling to maintain its unprecedented levels of growth without losing control .
ENDING THE WAR ….
Matt Yglesias suggests that , politically speaking , Democrats are n’t really all that anxious to withdraw from Iraq :
Not only are Democrats afraid of taking certain kinds of political risks to end the war , but they see no prospect of a political upside to ending it .
There was a fairly overwhelming belief in Washington in mid-to - late November 2006 that Republicans would start moving to end the war in January .
It did n’t happen , but then came the belief that they would start to abandon ship in September 2007 , which also did n’t happen .
But given that Republicans are n’t doing what everyone expected them to do and reducing their political exposure on Iraq by winding the war down , Democrats are disinclined to go out on a limb to do it for them .
That ’s true , but I ’ll take it even further .
Consider all the political upsides and downsides of a bruising but eventually successful congressional battle to end the war .
Upsides first .
From the antiwar left — and let ’s be honest here — a few congressional leaders who led the fight would get big props , but the rest of the Democratic caucus would get bupkis .
Intead , we lefties would probably spend most of our time complaining that they were too late , that they only acted under pressure , that they did n’t pull out enough troops , etc. etc .
The odds of a genuine political lift are pretty small .
That ’s pretty much it for political upsides , such as they are .
Now for the downsides .
War supporters , of course , would go ballistic and start blaming every bad event on the planet on the Defeatocrats who pulled the plug on Iraq and betrayed our men and women in uniform .
Squishy centrists , most of whom say we ought to withdraw , would probably be apprehensive about voting for someone who actually went ahead did it .
Iraq itself would probably get worse if we pulled out , at least in the short term , and there ’s an outside chance that it would get way worse .
Dems would get all the blame , of course .
And finally , Democrats would no longer have the war as an issue to run on in 2008 .
But there ’s more .
Not only are there fewer upsides than downsides , but the upsides are vague and fuzzy while the downsides are sharp and terrifying and potentially career - ending .
This is the underlying dynamic that will probably keep us in Iraq essentially forever , no matter who we elect president .
It ’s all very discouraging .
How Not to Cheat
Let ’s say you discover an old lamp and rub it , and out comes a genie offering to grant you a wish .
You are greedy and devious , so you wish for the ability , whenever you play online poker , to see all the cards that the other players are holding .
The genie grants your wish .
What would you do next ?
If you were a total idiot , you would do exactly what some cheaters on the Web site Absolute Poker appear to have done recently .
Playing at the very highest stakes games , they allegedly played every hand as if they knew every card that the other players had .
They folded hands at the end that no normal player would fold , and they raised with hands that were winners but would seem like losers if you did n’t know the opponents ’ cards .
They won money at a rate that was about 100 times faster than a good player could reasonably expect to win .
Their play was so anomalous that , within a few days , they were discovered .
What did they do next ?
Apparently , they played some more , now playing worse than anyone has ever played in the history of poker — in other words , trying to lose some of the money back so things did n’t look so suspicious .
One hand history shows that the players called a bet at the end when their two hole cards were 2 - 3 and had not paired the board … there literally was no hand that they could beat !
I do n’t know whether these cheating allegations are true , because all the information I am getting is third - hand .
The poker players I ’ve talked to all believe it to be true .
Regardless , I bet these guys wish they had it to do over .
If they had just been smart about it , they could have milked this gig forever , winning at reasonable rates .
For the stakes they were playing , they could have gotten very rich , and their scheme would have been nearly undetectable .
( Note that I say nearly undetectable , because while that poker site probably never would have detected them , I am working with a different online poker site to develop a set of tools for catching cheaters .
Even if these guys were careful , we would catch them . )
“ They might drive down slightly the wages of roofers in the United States , ” Mr. Lazear said .
“ But as a result of having this valuable supply of labor from abroad , other people on the construction project like carpenters and electricians are more productive .
They have better people to work with , more people to work with .
The cost of doing the job is lower , and some of that is passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices . ”
The study reinforces President Bush ’s campaign for a comprehensive immigration bill that calls for more border security , a guest worker program and a “ merit - based system ” of selecting immigrants that emphasizes education and job skills .
The bill , pending in the Senate , would also offer legal status and work permits to most of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States .
Many Democrats say the bill could depress the wages of American workers .
Senator Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota , said the guest worker program would “ put downward pressure ” on the wages in construction , manufacturing and other industries .
The White House is entering a debate that has been raging for years .
In one study , George J. Borjas , a professor of economics at Harvard , found that “ by increasing the supply of labor between 1980 and 2000 immigration reduced the average annual earnings of native - born men by an estimated $ 1,700 , or about 4 percent . ”

“ Among natives without a high school education , who roughly correspond to the poorest tenth of the work force , ” Professor Borjas said , “ the estimated impact was even larger , reducing their wages by 7.4 percent . ”
The World from Berlin The Isolation of America
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday proposed the idea of basing a nation 's carbon emissions allowance on population size .
German commentators on Friday say it 's another step on the path towards isolating the USA .
As a Monday deadline neared for the Bancroft family to decide on Rupert Murdoch 's $ 5 billion offer for Dow Jones & Co. , last - minute wrangling by family members and their trustees intensified .
Family lawyers were scrambling Friday to change the voting structure of the biggest Bancroft trust so it would better reflect the views of all the beneficiaries .
The trust 's overseers include Christopher Bancroft , a prominent family member who has been outspoken in his opposition to the deal .
The restructuring could dilute Mr. Bancroft's ...

( CNN ) -- Loathed by most , loved by virtually none , battlefield cuisine has left an indelible mark on the taste buds of American troops -- and it's not a good one .
Marines eat their MREs in a burned - out hotel in Haqlaniyah , Iraq , in 2006 .
" Meals Rejected by Everyone " is a popular nickname for MREs , which stands for Meals Ready to Eat , those brownish polymer pouches filled with precooked food and snacks .
While MREs provide food when there 's no way to make it to the mess hall , they are no substitutes for what troops crave .
" They really want pizza and beer , " says Judith Aylward , senior food technologist at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center in Natick , Massachusetts .
She and a team of food technicians are working hard to improve the quality and the taste of combat food .
And while they have n't been able to give servicemen and women everything they desire , troops are eating a variety of foods far more appetizing than the canned C-rations of World War II , Korea and Vietnam .

Soldiers now dine on penne pasta with vegetarian sausage in spicy tomato sauce , chicken breast fillet and boneless pork rib .
" I like to eat the chicken breast when on the move because it does not have any gravy , so it will not spill all over and make a mess , and it fills you up , " said Army Staff Sgt. Joel Klein , of St. Petersburg , Florida , who served in Iraq .
Klein is currently stationed at Fort Benning in Columbus , Georgia .
The beef patty is also a favorite , Aylward says .
" It comes with two slices of wheat snack bread , and we include a package of cheese and BBQ sauce so they can feel like they are eating at McDonald's . "
While perennial favorites like spaghetti and beef stew please most palates , old classics have fallen out of favor -- like Chicken a - la - King , affectionately called by some Chicken a - la - Death .
Other entrees just never catch on .
" We had a tuna noodle casserole ... the troops really did n't like it , " she says .
On The Menu 3,400,000 MRE cases were produced in 2006 for $ 181,179,000 .
One MRE costs around $ 7.50 , $ 22.50 for three , a full day 's worth of food .
The estimated cost for one FSR -- an entire day 's meal -- is about $ 15 .
Some items coming in 2008 : Chicken pesto pasta , lasagna with vegetables , instant vanilla / chocolate pudding , chipotle snack bread and chocolate - covered coffee beans .
Items out in 2008 : Chicken with cavatelli and vegetable manicotti .

" My least favorite is the cheese omelet with vegetables , " says Fort Benning Pvt. Antonio Kinslow , from Macon , Georgia .
Klein 's least favorite is also the omelet .
Watch as civilians taste MREs »
Opening up a case of today 's MREs is a lot like walking into a mall food court , says Stephen Moody , team leader for the Individual Combat Ration Team .
There are 24 MRE menus , and Italian , Mexican and vegetarian meals are represented .
Whenever possible , familiar commercial items like M&Ms and Tabasco are tossed in -- a taste of home that boosts morale , Aylward says .
Find out what 's in an MRE »
Troops enjoy mixing and matching MRE items , creating their own culinary recipes .
" Peanut Butter + Crackers + Coffee + Sugar + Creamer + Coco Base Powder ( Crush it all up and mix in a little water ) = Instant Joy , " according to 1st.
Sgt. Donel Hagelin , from Fayetteville , North Carolina .
Hagelin is also based at Fort Benning and served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The flexible pouch - based meals have been around for more than 20 years .
In the early 1980s , the military replaced the C-ration with the MRE , a 1,200 - to 1,300 - calorie entree meal with snacks , spreads and a dessert .
And it 's a hot meal -- just place the entree in the flameless ration heater bag , add water , and a chemical reaction warms the food in 10 minutes .
Troops can enjoy a hot cup of coffee with the included plastic - zippered hot beverage bag .
" All items in the MRE are useful , from the matches to the toilet paper , " Hagelin says .
MREs are considered restricted rations -- food eaten when regular meal services cannot be provided .
They are meant to be eaten for up to 21 days and have a three - year shelf life .
" There are a lot of great commercial items where if we only needed six months [ of shelf life ] , we could just go down to the Kroger or the Safeway and grab what 's popular , but there are n't a whole lot of things on the shelf that last for three years at 80 degrees Fahrenheit , " Moody says .
The military uses the three - year shelf life to maintain its " war reserves . "
There are millions of cases of MREs positioned around the world at any given time for contingencies , he explains .
Sometimes , the military needs something more practical than the MRE .
During intense combat operations , troops do n't have time to heat an MRE , and they do n't have the space to carry nine of them , enough food for a typical 72 - hour mission .
To give troops something to eat on the go , the team at Natick came up with the First Strike Ration , or FSR -- pocket sandwiches and snack food that can be eaten throughout the day .
One FSR has 3,600 to 3,900 calories and is packed with energy boosters like nutrition bars , electrolyte beverages and caffeinated gum .
One FSR is equal to three MREs .
Moody says troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are downing a lot of Red Bull and Starbucks products .
" We 've got a group of young caffeine drinkers on our hands , " he said .
" We 're trying to meet those needs for them . "
Several thousand assault ration prototypes were shipped to Iraq , Afghanistan , Germany , Kuwait and Haiti , and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive on the weight savings vs. the MRE .
The military estimates the assault ration will begin shipping to troops in November .

Mother 's Milk for the Kaczynskis Nude Merkel Montage Raises ... Eyebrows
It 's not the first time the Polish weekly Wprost has gotten in trouble in Germany .
This week , the cover depicts Chancellor Angela Merkel breast - feeding the Kaczynski twins .
But it could have been worse , the editor - in - chief points out .
At least they used a 21 - year - old model .
Seagate ’s shares rose 1.05 percent Friday to close at $ 24.96 and were up about 4 percent for the week after news that it might enter the flash memory market .
There does not appear to have been any significant increase in trading of Seagate options .
With a booming economy and $ 1.33 trillion in foreign - exchange reserves , Chinese companies are in a position to acquire American companies , as Japanese and West European companies were several decades ago .
While those earlier acquisitions were often opposed out of fears that they would damage American economic competitiveness , the acquisition of American companies by Chinese companies is regarded with more suspicion , particularly in the high - tech sector .
Since the Lenovo sale , the government has become increasingly concerned about technology security , according to members of federal advisory committees .
“ Seagate would be extremely sensitive , ” said an industry executive who participates in classified government advisory groups .
“ I do not think anyone in the U.S. wants the Chinese to have access to the controller chips for a disk drive .
One never knows what the Chinese could do to instrument the drive . ”
The transfer of advanced disk drive manufacturing technology would give the Chinese a major leg up in competing in information technologies .
China , however , still lags in basic manufacturing skills like semiconductor design and manufacturing .
“ This is clearly a critical component of a computer system and the purchase by the Chinese or other nations merits a full review to determine what our risks are , ” said Michael R. Wessell , a commissioner of the U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission , a group that monitors the national security implications of trade with China for Congress .
I.B.M. , which invented the disk drive in the 1950s and which dominated the industry through the 1990s , sold its disk drive business to the Japanese computer maker Hitachi in 2002 , leaving just two American companies : Seagate , based in Scotts Valley , Calif. , and Western Digital , based in Lake Forest , Calif .
Odile Crick , an artist whose original sketch of the double helix of DNA , the genetic blueprint for life , became a symbol of modern molecular biology , died July 5 at her home in La Jolla , Calif .
She was 86 .
The cause was cancer , said her stepson , Michael Crick , who said the family had not announced Mrs. Crick ’s death until July 20 .
The structure of DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , was discovered in 1953 by Mrs. Crick ’s husband , Francis H. C. Crick , and James D. Watson .
The breakthrough laid the foundation for molecular biology by making it clear that the DNA molecule is the medium in which genetic information is stored and passed from generation to generation .
The double helix consists of two chains of DNA spiraling in opposite directions , each made up of four types of chemical units that are linked together .
The sequence of those chemical units is the basis for genes , which signal the synthesis of the essential components of every living cell .
Dr. Crick , who died in 2004 , and Dr. Watson were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1962 .
The DC Gun Ban
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Last Friday a federal appeals court in Washington DC issued a ruling that hopefully will result in the restoration of 2nd Amendment rights in the nation ’s capital .
It appears the Court rejected the District of Columbia ‘s nonsensical argument that the 2nd Amendment confers only a " collective right , " something gun control advocates have asserted for years .
Of course we should not have too much faith in our federal courts to protect gun rights , considering they routinely rubber stamp egregious violations of the 1st , 4th , and 5th Amendments , and allow Congress to legislate wildly outside the bounds of its enumerated powers .
Furthermore , the DC case will be appealed to the Supreme Court with no guarantees .
But it is very important nonetheless for a federal court only one step below the highest court in the land to recognize that gun rights adhere to the American people , not to government - sanctioned groups .
Rights , by definition , are individual .
" Group rights " is an oxymoron .
Can anyone seriously contend that the Founders , who had just expelled their British rulers mostly by use of light arms , did not want the individual farmer , blacksmith , or merchant to be armed ?
Those individuals would have been killed or imprisoned by the King ’s soldiers if they had relied on a federal armed force to protect them .
In the 1700s , militias were local groups made up of ordinary citizens .
They were not under federal control !
As a practical matter , many of them were barely under the control of colonial or state authorities .
When the 2nd Amendment speaks of a " well - regulated militia , " it means local groups of individuals operating to protect their own families , homes , and communities .
They regulated themselves because it was necessary and in their own interest to do so .
The Founders themselves wrote in the Federalist papers about the need for individuals to be armed .
In fact , James Madison argued in Federalist paper 46 that common citizens should be armed to guard against the threat posed by the newly proposed standing federal army .
Today , gun control makes people demonstrably less safe — as any honest examination of criminal statistics reveals .
In his book " More Guns , Less Crime , " scholar John Lott demolishes the myth that gun control reduces crime .
On the contrary , Lott shows that cities with strict gun control — like Washington DC — experience higher rates of murder and violent crime .
It is no coincidence that violent crime flourishes in the nation ’s capital , where the individual ’s right to defend himself has been most severely curtailed .
Understand that residents of DC can be convicted of a felony and put in prison simply for having a gun in their home , even if they live in a very dangerous neighborhood .
The DC gun ban is no joke , and the legal challenges to the ban are not simply academic exercises .
People ’s lives and safety are at stake .
Gun control historically serves as a gateway to tyranny .
Tyrants from Hitler to Mao to Stalin have sought to disarm their own citizens , for the simple reason that unarmed people are easier to control .
Our Founders , having just expelled the British army , knew that the right to bear arms serves as the guardian of every other right .
This is the principle so often ignored by both sides in the gun control debate .
Only armed citizens can resist tyrannical government .

Tom is a copywriter living in Los Angeles .
He 's desperately looking for a new job , so he signed up to Monster - the online careers and recruitment resource for employers and jobseekers .
An email he believed was from Monster arrived , inviting him to download the new " Monster Job Seeker Tool " .
But Tom soon discovered that it was no such thing .
Instead , he had fallen victim to the " worst ever " ransomware trojan that encrypted all his files and stole information .
" Hundreds of files , if not over 1,000 , were encrypted , " says Tom .
He found messages in his folders from the Glamorous Team demanding $ 300 ( £ 150 ) to decrypt his files and threatening to share his private information .
A few days later , a friend pointed him towards Prevx , a UK - based internet security company which had written a free decryption tool .
File encryption
" Unfortunately , it seems my files were encrypted a few times over , so the tool did n't work for me .
I never considered paying up .
I would never run a program from these crooks on my machine - who knows what it would be .
My big concern is their threat to share my personal info with the world , " says Tom who , thanks to good backups , only lost recent family photographs .
Mike , a management consultant from Arizona , had been let go from his job , and was moving files from his company laptop so he could return it .
" I noticed the " read_me.txt " files [ with the ransom demand ] on my 80 GB external hard drive , and of course knew there was a problem .
Thinking I was doing the right thing , I deleted all of the .txt files and copied my good files to DVDs .
When I tried to read the DVD to make sure the files would open , my heart sank as I discovered that everything was trashed , " says Mike .
" Of the 80 GB of data , I would estimate that I permanently lost about half . "
" This is the worst attack I 've ever seen , " says Jacques Erasmus , Prevx 's director of malware research and a former hacker who has proved a worthy opponent for the Glamorous Team .
He 's spent days trying to help victims like Tom and Mike recover their files .
" We received a first sighting of this around eight hours after it was released via spearphished emails to a targeted audience of people looking for work using the monster.com website , " says Erasmus .
The attack may have used an email list stolen from Monster or a similar job - seeking service .
" [ Normally ] to get an uptake of 1,000 machines , you 'd need to send the email to around 75,000 people .
However , because this email was highly targeted , the conversion ratio would be much better .
Therefore I believe it was sent to around 10,000 email addresses , " says Erasmus .
A secondary wave of infection involved pornography and a malicious website in Panama .
Only people in the USA were affected , except for one person in Saudi Arabia .
The software was a password - stealer trojan with a new ransomware feature and three functions : encrypting files on the victim's hard disk ; stealing browser data and silently sending out stolen information to a website on a shared Yahoo server .
No documents were taken - just data from browser sessions - although panicked users who deleted the read_me.
txt messages with the randomly generated encryption key lost their files forever .
A key component was an http sniffer , which captures user data from browser sessions by bypassing the SSL encryption - the lock icon - normally relied on for secure internet transactions .
Every 60 seconds , stolen data was encrypted by the trojan and sent to a dump site created only days beforehand .
" It took us about six hours to reverse - engineer the [ encryption ] algorithm including testing , " says Erasmus .
" We made two tools , one to decrypt the stolen data and one to decrypt the files for users . "
Helped by access to the dump site ( possibly an oversight by the ransomware creators ) , Erasmus found that around 1,000 PCs had been infected .
Apart from individuals at home , the victims included US government departments and multinationals including Hewlett - Packard .
He found 257MB of stolen data and contacted the FBI and a dozen seriously affected companies .
The data proved startling in its detail .
An employee of General Dynamics Corporation , working inside the US Department of Transportation , was monitored making his online passport application to the US Department of State .
A woman working for Booz Allen Hamilton , a global consulting group , was seen applying for a job directly to the CIA .
Although both were using secure browser connections , they now face identity theft from organised criminals .
" There was an entire biometric profile of a government contractor in the stolen data - details such as eye colour , hair colour , exact measurements and weight , " says Erasmus .
" What worried us more was the level of data that was compromised from large US corporations and government contractors .
Logins to critical systems , databases and intranet logins were captured .
This could be devastating . "
Stolen data
The Guardian has seen 5.6 m lines of stolen data including credit card and bank account numbers , home addresses , social security numbers , logins , passwords , job applications and even emails with sexual content .
We quickly found logins for Mike in Arizona and Bill in Oregon .
Using Bill 's details , we logged into his email account and left a message .
His view of the ransomware trojan now ?
" Very malicious , and dangerous , and very scary . "
We sent Mike his login details for his Fuse . net email and Paypal accounts , discovering even more about the trojan 's capabilities .
" My first reaction , to put it bluntly , is holy shit ! " says Mike .
It 's even worse for other people .
Stolen banking information , almost certainly sold on by the Glamorous Team , will delight cash - seeking criminals .
" We believe that Glamorous Team are Russian and part of a bigger crime network , " says Erasmus .
Only Prevx ( prevx.com ) users were protected as its software works by stopping any suspicious behaviour rather than reacting to previously detected files .
Are we going to see such a well - targeted attack here in the UK ?
It 's very likely , although the criminals are probably now lying low .
" For what they have achieved , I 'd need to give them high marks .
They 've got into the government , major defence contractors and major corporates in the USA , " says Erasmus .
As a former hacker , Erasmus admires the criminals ' technical skills and he urges people not to be fooled by odd - looking emails that could be phishing attacks .

I had covered earlier , that Bush had announced plans to help borrowers avoid foreclosure .
At the moment it was rhetoric as we did n’t quite understand what would be required of homeowners in order to qualify for the assistance .
Well , today those details have come .
Big thanks to CreditBloggers for breaking it :
It ’s been tricky trying to find details about the FHA insured refinance plan President Bush announced last Friday .
All we knew was that the plan could help 80,000 homebuyers who struggled with an ARM reset to refinance into lower terms .
An online Q&A session with HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson cleared up a few points .
The refinance program is being called FHASecure and to qualify a borrower must have : A history of on - time mortgage payments before the borrower ’s teaser rates expired and loans reset Interest rates must have or will reset between June 2005 and December 2008
Three percent cash or equity in the home A sustained history of employment Sufficient income to make the mortgage payment Borrowers must also be occupants of the house they are trying to refinance and have a mortgage below the insured loan limit for your area ( $ 263,150 in Arizona ) .
More from HUD :
President George W. Bush today announced that HUD ’s Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) will help an estimated 240,000 families avoid foreclosure by enhancing its refinancing program effective immediately .
Under the new FHASecure plan , FHA will allow families with strong credit histories who had been making timely mortgage payments before their loans reset - but are now in default - to qualify for refinancing .
“ Many hard - working American families who were able to make their mortgage payments under the initial teaser terms of the exotic loan are now struggling to make ends meet because their rates have doubled or tripled , ” said HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson .
“ FHASecure will bring stability to the housing market and give eligible families who were in good financial standing before their loans reset a chance to keep their homes . ”
“ FHASecure is designed for families who are good borrowers but were steered into high - cost loans with teaser rates , ” said Assistant Secretary for Housing - FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery .
“ These homeowners , many of whom are minorities , need a safe , affordable mortgage product that will help build wealth .
All FHA borrowers pay mortgage insurance premiums to offset claims to the FHA insurance fund and ultimately prevent risk to the taxpayer . ”
The caveat seems to be though , that while the FHA limits are somewhat reasonable given today ’s market .
How many have the equity to cover what ’s between the limit of $ 263,150 ( in Arizona ) , and their loan amount at the peak of the market boom ?
One course at a time , David Siegel consumes five gourmet dishes remarkable for their flavor and also for where the ingredients came from : sardines and sand dabs from Monterey Bay , Calif. , squab and veal from the state 's central coast , and strawberries from Oxnard , Calif .
" Ordinarily , I would be gun-shy and run the other way when I hear the word ' sardine , ' " says Mr. Siegel .
But " because they did n't have to preserve it in salt , this had a freshness and nonfishy taste I 've never experienced .
It was delightful . "
The comment is music to the ears of Neal Fraser , chef of the well - known Grace Restaurant here , who designed a " Close to Home " menu where 90 percent of the ingredients are sourced within 400 miles .
Advancing a so - called " socially and environmentally responsible " agenda throughout his restaurant – which includes serving filtered local tap water rather than bottled water from afar and fueling his own car with leftover vegetable oil – Mr. Fraser is part of a growing nationwide restaurant movement to go " green . "
The ideas are not new , say experts , but they are gaining fresh currency because of the burgeoning global environmental movement and new generations of youth with budding enthusiasm for long - established notions of sustainability , ecological health , and food safety .
As exemplified by Grace Restaurant , one key idea is to leave less of a carbon footprint wherever possible – choosing local meats , vegetables , fish , and fruit over those shipped from thousands of miles away .
Another push is to support smaller local ranchers and farmers who avoid the kinds of animal diets and pesticides that are typically used for produce and meat and are often served in the nation 's 1 million restaurants .
There is a laundry list of other strategies to reduce global warming : from recycling and composting waste to conserving water and lights , using nontoxic cleaners , tapping wind or other " green " power , and designing minimal - impact buildings .
Like Grace , many restaurants are moving away from bottled water because of environmental concerns about bottle waste , refrigeration needed , transportation costs , and shipping containers .
" I just began to think about the future of the planet that my daughters would be inheriting and their children and so forth , " says Fraser , who decided it was time to change after seeing the movie " An Inconvenient Truth , " starring Al Gore .
Supporters report more interest by owners and diners than at any time since such notions began coalescing in the late 1960s .
" The movement today is really huge and the debate is getting a far broader audience now , " says Wynnie Stein , co-owner of Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca , N.Y. , considered one of the national pioneers of locally sourced organic farming .
" It 's everybody from restaurants to colleges to food - service directors in schools , hospitals .
People are very concerned about the environment for themselves and future generations and there is a new urgency to dramatically expand on ideas that have been around for years . "
One measure of the interest is the growth of the Green Restaurant Association , which certifies restaurants coast to coast and encourages them to take four new steps to help the environment each year .
Founded in 1990 in San Diego , the association has seen the number of its certified restaurants skyrocket from 60 to 300 in the past two years .
The group is also negotiating with major restaurant chains , which could rapidly boost membership to 5,000 .
" In the last year we have gotten more interest than in the previous 16 years combined , " says founder and director Michael Oshman .
" It 's beginning to build exponentially from interest of previous decades . "
Such restaurants are also drawing attention to the plight of smaller farms , ranches , and suppliers whose practices fit the model but are in danger of being lost .
" Government policies are making it very hard for the smaller , independent , family - run businesses , which operate with higher environmental standards , " says Mike Antoci , who runs Superior Anhausner Foods , a Los Angeles distributor .
" Restaurants like Fraser 's are starting to raise public consciousness about what is at stake . "
The new spotlight is creating a domino effect , say observers , in which restaurant customers begin to ask more questions about the local - food movement .
" We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of people who value the availability of food produced right in their own community , " says Linda Halley , who runs Fairview Gardens , a nonprofit organic farm and education center in Goleta , Calif .
Some observers question some of the claims of the local - food movement .
They say it 's entirely possible that food grown locally could have a considerably larger carbon footprint than food flown halfway around the world because transportation represents only a tiny fraction – some experts say as little as 2 percent – of the energy required to grow , store , process , and package the food .
Supporters say that the movement is raising questions that society needs to ask .
Mr. Oshman notes that Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf , with 200 stores nationwide , was the first large chain to be certified green last year and this year has announced it will run its stores on windpower exclusively .
" If larger chains like this can do it , it shows this is not a fringe thing anymore . "
Have you ever wondered why so much public space seems to go to waste ?
Even apparently ‘ natural ’ green areas are carefully cultivated , requiring time , energy and water .
However , these only produce a return if people are sitting , interacting , or playing on them .
A great deal of urban green space is never used for these purposes .
However , such spaces can be ( and many are ) subverted through guerilla gardening : the act of seeding useful plants in public spaces .
Guerilla gardening , like many forms of guerilla action or communication , is not typically legal unless it is overtly sanctioned by a city .
Some guerilla gardeners have been questioned by the authorities , suspected of vandalism or even accused of terrorist activity .
Technically , guerilla gardening is a kind of graffiti or vandalism – just done with plants instead of spray cans .
However , the kind of guerilla marketing addressed here , though illegal , rarely gets people into trouble .
Other higher - profile types such as moss graffiti and mayday actions have caused conflicts with the law .
For more information on guerilla gardening , see the Wikipedia article on the subject .
Also see related guerilla communication articles on unusually legal street art and cleaning urban surfaces as guerilla marketing .
Have you done any guerilla gardening ?

THE job of representing the pope in Burundi brings with it a fine colonial villa , but nobody would say Archbishop Paul Gallagher has an enviable post .
In 2003 his predecessor , Archbishop Michael Courtney , died in a hail of bullets after mystery attackers ambushed his car .
Whoever they were , the killers were clear about their target : the vehicle bore diplomatic plates and a Vatican flag , while the Irish cleric , in white cassock and purple skull cap , was known to all ; so was his role in negotiating a peace accord , sealed a month earlier .
The day of his death , December 29th , is now a fixture in Burundi 's calendar .
Thousands of miles away , on the frontier between Argentina and Chile , papal diplomacy is remembered in a different way .
A mountain pass has been renamed after Cardinal Antonio Samorè , who before his death in 1983 helped settle a territorial dispute that could have led to war .
In different ways , the Irish archbishop and the Italian cardinal represent the best of an ancient and often contentious quirk of the international scene : the fact that the Roman Catholic church , alone among faiths , is a diplomatic player .
Over the past century — despite the march of secularism — the Vatican 's role in world affairs has expanded .
In 1890 a famous English Catholic , Cardinal Manning , said the Holy See 's diplomatic activities were “ a mere pageant ” , a medieval relic .
He would be amazed to find that in 2007 papal diplomacy is more active than ever .
The real explosion came under John Paul II .
When he was elected in 1978 , the Holy See had full ties with 85 states .
When he died , the figure was 174 .
Among states that dropped their misgivings were Margaret Thatcher 's Britain , Ronald Reagan 's America and Mikhail Gorbachev 's Soviet Union .
The Holy See now has full diplomatic relations with 176 states .
Vietnam , China and Saudi Arabia are among the few without formal links .
Recent years have also seen an expansion in the See 's multilateral diplomacy .
It sits in on the deliberations of 16 inter- governmental bodies , including the United Nations , the African Union and the Organisation of American States .
The Vatican acts , by its own choice , as a “ permanent observer ” rather than a voting member of the UN ; but it is a signatory to some UN human - rights conventions , including those on racial equality and the rights of the child .
It uses these vantage points to lobby for its ideas : non-violence , a better economic deal for poor nations , the extension of international law , support for marriage — and , controversially , the “ sanctity of life ” from the time of conception , which means opposing contraception , abortion and euthanasia .
Arguments over the Holy See 's diplomatic status came to a head in 1994 when the pope 's envoys — lining up with Muslim states — used their muscle to water down the outcome of a UN meeting on population in Cairo .
The Vatican took a similar , albeit slightly lower - key , stance at a follow - up conference in 1999 .
This prompted campaigners for “ reproductive rights ” to demand that the Vatican be stripped of its diplomatic status — arguing that neither as a state , nor as a religion , should the Holy See have a place at the UN .
The pope's “ diplomatic service ” is a reminder of his unique and ambiguous status as both a religious and temporal leader .
Formally , the pope 's diplomats represent the Holy See — not the Vatican state which , under a 1929 accord with Italy , is the sovereign power in part of Rome .
But in years past , some states ( such as America in the 19th century ) would deal with the pope only as head of a sovereign state .
The fact that pontiffs wear two hats , temporal and spiritual , gives them , and their interlocutors , a certain flexibility .
In 2001 , when Greece 's Orthodox clergy grumbled over a visit by Pope John Paul II , the government in Athens could retort that it was merely receiving him as a head of state .
But more and more governments have in recent years seemed happy to deal with the Holy See on its own terms , especially after John Paul II boosted its global profile .
For any state , an embassy to the See offers attractions .
For poor ones , it is a chance to garner information from one of the world 's best - informed chancelleries .
For powerful ones , it offers a way to influence the Vatican and seek papal approval .
Napoleon told his man in Rome : “ Deal with the pope as if he had 200,000 men at his command . ”
After some years in Rome , the envoy said 500,000 was nearer the mark .
The real extent of the Vatican 's power is hard to compute .
One in every six human beings was baptised into the pope 's church .
Of course , many quit the faith , but he remains a global opinion - former .
His views can sway Catholic votes — a point not lost on American presidents , who rarely miss a chance to visit the Vatican .
In Burundi all top politicians and expatriates flock to Archbishop Gallagher 's residence for the papal feast day .
Cutting a lower profile than his predecessor , the 53 - year - old Englishman reports only “ occasional ” contacts with Burundi 's rebel factions , the last of which signed a ceasefire agreement in September 2006 .
In the rich world one respecter of papal clout is Britain 's new prime minister , Gordon Brown .
Three years ago this son of a Presbyterian minister went to seek Vatican endorsement of a proposal to boost aid to poor nations .
This year he returned to co-launch a plan to bring new vaccines to poor states .
The pope 's divisions
Papal diplomacy is almost as old as the papacy .
But it was not until 1500 that a permanent nunciature , or diplomatic service , was established , in Venice .
The earliest Protestant state to send an ambassador was Prussia in 1805 : its envoy was Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt , a philosopher and linguist .
The first non-Christian state to establish relations was Japan , in 1942 .
Of the countries with links today , only 78 keep missions in Rome — and they form one of the world 's odder diplomatic corps .
The embassy with the biggest staff , along with that of Germany , is the Dominican Republic's .
Iran has a large mission , with as many diplomats as America .
( “ Who knows what other duties they have ? ” sighs a senior Vatican official . )

The diplomats ' main point of contact with the papal administration is the Secretariat of State , housed in the pope 's residence , the Apostolic Palace .
It has two departments : the Section for General Affairs deals with national churches , while the smaller Section for Relations with States does conventional diplomacy .
Its current head , in effect the Vatican 's foreign minister , is Dominique Mamberti , a French expert on Islam .
Born in Morocco , Archbishop Mamberti has represented the Holy See in Algeria , Chile , Lebanon , Sudan and at the UN .
Papal diplomats , all priests nowadays , are trained at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome .
The academy has had a colourful history , once losing its assets to a rogue administrator .
Its graduates do two jobs : representing the Holy See to the local government and keeping a vigilant eye on national churches .
Vatican envoys usually stay longer en poste than secular ones ( one nuncio was in Dublin for 26 years ) .
Some cover vast cultural distances : the nuncio in Algeria was born in Taiwan .
Conventional diplomacy is a small part of what they do .
“ In most places , 95 % of our work relates to the life of the church , ” says a former nuncio .
“ The overwhelming bulk of the correspondence has to do with the appointment of bishops . ”
Another big difference between papal and ordinary diplomats is that the former have little protection — and never pull out of dangerous situations .
“ The pope leaves his representatives to suffer with the people of the country to which they are accredited , ” says a Vatican official .
Compared with many foreign services , the Holy See 's is tiny , less than 300 - strong .
There are rarely more than two people in each mission .
According to the Vatican 's official directory , the “ Section for Relations with States ” has only 18 diplomats and 29 other staff in Rome .
Until recently , one desk officer watched Britain , South Asia and bits of Latin America .
Yet visitors to the Vatican “ foreign ministry ” are amazed by the knowledge they find .
“ We are priests , ” says one veteran .
“ We have no family .
We work 24 hours a day if necessary .
It 's the key to understanding why we are so few , and so efficient . ”
Oded Ben-Hur , Israel 's envoy to the Holy See , adds that its diplomatic service is “ just like any foreign service , with different people having different abilities .
But they have an advantage : they are highly cultured .
They know languages .
They know history .
They are very well - informed . ”
A former papal envoy to a war - torn nation tells with pride how the American embassy would send a diplomat each morning to ask him about the war zones , knowing the pope 's man would have been fully briefed by local nuns .
Like their secular counterparts , these brainy clerics have in recent years had to share the diplomatic action with other institutions , both official and unofficial .
The Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace , a sort of overseas - aid ministry , speaks for the Vatican in some forums , while an independent Rome - based body , the Sant ' Egidio Community , has achieved some of the more spectacular successes of Catholic diplomacy .
Sir Ivor Roberts , a former British diplomat who worked with Sant ' Egidio over schools in Kosovo , calls it an “ unorthodox , extra corps d'elite ” that can plug gaps “ in areas where conventional diplomacy has n't worked . ”
Mario Giro , a Sant 'Egidio official , says it is now doing mediation work in “ Darfur , Ivory Coast , north Uganda and two other places outside Africa I cannot name ” .
In Burundi last year the Catholic Peacebuilding Network — which calls itself “ a network of practitioners , academics , clergy and laity ” — held a meeting on the Great Lakes region that involved the nuncio , local bishops , Sant 'Egidio and other Catholic agencies : an array of expertise on the related conflicts of Burundi , Rwanda and Congo .
Last month the network held a similar pan-Catholic forum in Colombia .
Even as they share tasks with sister agencies , envoys from the Vatican must live with the fact that their boss — like any political master — reserves the right to upset the whole apple - cart with “ undiplomatic ” outbursts .
John Paul
II 's blunt talk about communism swept away years of cautious accommodation .
His successor has upset Muslims ( by seeming to link their faith with violence ) , South Americans ( dismayed by his views on the record of missionaries ) , Jews ( because of the revival of a liturgy whose original form called for their conversion , though the number two in the hierarchy has said that bit of the rite might be changed ) , and most recently , Protestants , who ask why the Vatican chose last week to repeat its view that their churches do n't deserve the name .
These embarrassments highlight one of the drawbacks of the Holy See 's ambiguous situation : it enjoys many of the privileges of a state while also speaking for a faith .
Vatican officials say this paradox is both defensible and beneficial : unlike diplomats who act for a state , and whose first duty is to promote and protect its interests , papal envoys strive for the good of humanity .
A former Vatican “ foreign minister ” , Cardinal Jean - Louis Tauran , said recently the Holy See “ tries not only to promote and defend , if necessary , the freedom and rights of the Catholic communities around the world , but also to promote certain principles without which there is no civilisation . ”
But it also has a specific political agenda .
It wants international status for Jerusalem .
It recognises Taiwan as China .
Listing the keystones of foreign policy , Cardinal Tauran stressed the “ right to life at all stages of biological development ” .
Statements like that make the Vatican respected in some quarters , mistrusted in others .
Some activities , such as taking lethal risks for peace in Burundi , are almost universally admired .
But in an age when the power of independent agencies ( including Catholic ones ) is growing by the day , might n't the Vatican enhance its authority by clarifying its own status ?
Instead of claiming to practise a form of inter-governmental diplomacy , it could renounce its special diplomatic status and call itself what it is — the biggest non-governmental organisation in the world .
I 'd respect the Republicans mishandling this war a tiny bit more if they actually worried about paying for this war rather than blather on about tax cuts .
A new Congressional study finds that President Bush 's plans for the U.S. in Iraq over the next several decades will reach the trillions of dollars , on top of the approximately $ 567 billion the war has already cost .
That accounting assumes a significant troop drawdown -- and still tallies a daunting expense for the United States [...]
A prior CBO study estimated that U.S. costs in Iraq from 2009 to 2017 will total approximately $ 1 trillion .
On top of that , under the reduced - force combat scenario envisioned in this CBO estimate , the U.S. will spend another $ 1 trillion by 2057 -- the lifespan of the U.S. 's Korean presence to date .
All estimates are in 2008 dollars .
Both estimates are arguably conservative .
In the combat scenario , for instance , Army units serve 12 - month tours , whereas they now serve 15 - month tours .
In the non-combat scenario , the CBO ratcheted down the Defense Department 's cost - of - war estimates to reflect " lower costs for such items as equipment maintenance , fuel and consumable materials . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq , President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out .
President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada .
On Wednesday in Kansas City , Missouri , Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that " then , as now , people argued that the real problem was America 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , " according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House .
" Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left , " Bush will say .
" Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ' boat people , ' ' re - education camps ' and ' killing fields , ' " the president will say .
The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility , citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam , according to the excerpts .
" Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , " Bush will say .
On Tuesday , Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said , " President Bush 's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two .
Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history .
" While the President continues to stay - the - course with his failed strategy in Iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government .
It is time to change direction in Iraq , and Congress will again work to do so in the fall . "
The White House is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the American Legion , as an effort to " provide broader context " for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen.
David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad .
President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop " surge " in Iraq until the report comes out in September .
Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government »
It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill , particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war .
Earlier this month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin .
Bush 's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag .
A recent CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two - thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion .
The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq .
In addition to his analogy to Vietnam , Bush in Wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia , including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s , according to the excerpts .
" In the aftermath of Japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy .
Then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , " Bush will say .
" Today , in defiance of the critics , Japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . "
Speaking about the Korean War , Bush will note that at the time " critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that America 's intervention was divisive here at home . "
" While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges , America never broke its word , " Bush will say .
" Without America 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war , millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime . "

" It will allow us to safeguard our state ’s security , " declared Russia ’s deputy armed forces chief of staff in publicly praising what is called the " Father of All Bombs . "
As the erstwhile Soviet Union continues with the fallout of its collapse , the surviving Russian government has sought ever - more - powerful weapons with which to threaten and kill those who dare to secede from its authority .
Russian generals threatened to use such weaponry against Chechnyan rebels .
Twenty years ago , in my Calculated Chaos book , I wrote of the institutional virtues of the neutron bomb : a weapon that only destroys people , without damaging buildings , bridges , transportation facilities , factories , and other physical assets .
While it is different from the neutron bomb , the Russians ’ latest contribution to the state ’s arsenals of destruction serves similar ends .
" All that is alive merely evaporates , " the Russians reported .
The aforesaid government official added : " I want to stress that the action of this weapon does not contaminate the environment . "
It only obliterates pesky people , those elements in the statist equation which , characterized by their own self - interested free will , are capable of upsetting governmental planning and control .
A bridge , or an airport , or an office building do not care to what ends they are being put , for they have no capacity for " caring . "
The state , like other institutions , seeks conditions of " equilibrium , " of changelessness .
The only time in which humans are in equilibrium is when they are dead or , at the very least , can be counted upon to not deviate from governmental dictates .
This is why the state has long been attracted to robotic actors , be they technological or biological in nature .
The only practice in which the state has demonstrated any competency lies in its increased efficiency in the mass slaughter of people .
Consistent with all forms of human action , it constantly endeavors to lower the unit costs of mass destruction .
The arms race — from spear - throwing to the use of more conventional weapons to nuclear bombs — has always been driven by a desire to maximize destructiveness at the lowest costs .
But the state must also take into account the costs of cleaning up the mess afterwards .
The World War II " battle of Stalingrad " reportedly left some two million dead on the surrounding battlefield , with the remains of soldiers still being found .
Even to the Russian government — never known to be squeamish about such matters — this is a most untidy affair .
Far better to have the dead vaporized , rather than being left to litter streets , parks , and offices !
Like their American counterparts , the Russians are learning to touch all the politically - correct bases in defending their policies and practices .
This bomb " does not contradict a single international treaty , " the government reports , nor does it discriminate on prohibited grounds ( such as race , gender , religion , etc . ) .
It destroys indiscriminately any who have been unfortunate enough to be in a targeted area .
Above all else , the bomb is environmentally safe , a quality that many self - styled environmentalists — for whom human well - being has never been the highest priority — will likely find attractive .
The Russians have added this bomb to the package of mechanized horrors with which political institutions terrorize people .
In threatening to use such super - bombs in its " anti-terrorist operation " against the Chechnyans , the Russians have acknowledged that the alleged " war on terror " is , in fact , a " war of terror . "
The United States admitted as much — at least to those willing to look behind the cascade of lies — in the use of its own super - bomb to terrorize Iraqi civilians in its campaign of " shock and awe . "
Nor have the American people been deprived of the opportunity of discovering what the Chechnyans have learned , namely , that the " war on terror " is , in reality , a war against themselves .
So , where does this leave the Americans ?
Russian officials stated that this bomb is four times more powerful than the American version — known as the " Mother of All Bombs . "
In employing familial imagery in the naming of such vicious weaponry , the state has cynically perverted the normal loving and protective role parents play toward their children , into the psychotic acts by which some mothers drown their children , or fathers shoot theirs .
The conservative celebrants of warfare who love to bleat their " pro-life " and " family values " homilies , might pay close attention to the contradictions they enthusiastically endorse .
I suspect that most Americans can now be counted upon to urge their government to respond with an ever - more - powerful super - bomb .
After having " won " the Cold War — whatever that may mean — " we " do not want to take second place in the race to develop the tools for the mass obliteration of all the " others " in the world who might insist upon their own purposes and directions for their lives .
Perhaps scientists at the University of California ’s Livermore Labs can be counted upon to restore American pride by developing a " Super - Father " of a bomb .
Defense contractors can certainly be counted upon to promote such a project !
Despite the rampant insanity by which we continue to organize human society , most people still regard anarchists as unrealistic and strange , and politicians as practical visionaries .
Perhaps this is to be expected when people evaluate one another ’s conduct by normative standards ( e.g. , in a cannibal society , a vegetarian would be looked upon with distrust ) .
Nonetheless , I remain optimistic that the state is in decline : recourse to such weaponry as described herein is testimony to the failure of political systems to generate the peaceful order they have long vocalized as their purpose .
The collapse of the state will come about , I suspect , for the same reason that brought about the demise of that earlier leviathan , the dinosaur : an inability , occasioned by its massive size , to remain resilient to the changes over which it had no control .
On the other hand , it may be argued that we are genetically fated to our self - annihilation .
The late Arthur Koestler once described mankind as an evolutionary mistake ; a killer ape with a highly - developed intelligence was bound to prove troublesome .
If Koestler is right — and I am not convinced that he is — our obsession with employing so much of our energy to the creation of technologies for controlling and destroying one another , may be so programmed into us that only a head - on confrontation with life forces might alter our behavior .
If this is so , as we humans continue our lemming - like march to our own destruction , we may glimpse the dolphins waiting in the wings to bring a peaceful expression of intelligence to life ’s stage .

Timothy Ferriss is quite an accomplished man .
He ’s a Princeton University guest lecturer in High - Tech Entrepreneurship and Electrical Engineering , the first American in history to hold a Guinness World Record in tango , a national Chinese kickboxing champion , and even a MTV breakdancer in Taiwan .
But , what he ’s most known for , at least lately , is his bestselling book , The 4 - Hour Workweek : Escape 9 - 5 , Live Anywhere , and Join The New Rich , that focuses on the 80 - 20 principle , outsourcing your life , and getting away from your desk .

Perhaps it ’s not as easy as it sounds , but Ferriss ’s own life makes it appear so .
We caught up with him recently to assess whether his theories are more hype than fact .
Read on to learn what he had to say .
Admittedly , some workers have probably discovered the “ 4 - Hour Work Week ” principles on their own .
However : are people who ’ve discovered these practices themselves the only ones who are risk - ready enough to use them effectively ?
Not at all .
The principle concept of “ lifestyle design ” is lower risk than the “ deferred - life ” career planning most follow .
It is not anti-investment , but it is anti-retirement - as - life - goal .
I have maxed - out IRAs and 401 ( k ) s and never gamble .
The 4 - Hour Workweek is intended to save people the trouble of trial and error — it ’s the mistakes that cost you , not the recommendations I make .
Some of your critics dislike that you condone the use of loopholes or technicalities to gain advantage ; they think its tantamount to cheating .
Is your school of thinking at odds with , or consistent with the idea of the “ American work ethic ? ”
It ’s 100 % consistent with work ethic .
People are fond of misquoting me , but I only criticize the predominate overwork ethic that focuses on activities instead of results , being busy instead of productive .
The founding fathers advocated innovation , dissent , and hard work when applied to the right things .
This book is reflective of their philosophies .
Most critics have n’t read the book .
I never break rules — I analyze them and question the outdated assumptions and habits based on them .
To put this in historical context , the bar in the Olympic high jump used to be jumped in a hurdling motion .
Then , one athlete started used the current back - flop technique and revolutionized the game .
Similar evolution can be seen in almost all sports , from better materials and drafting in the Tour de France to hydrodynamic suits in swimming .
Is this cheating ?
Is Netflix “ cheating ” against Blockbuster by eliminating retail ?
No — it ’s being a smarter player .
Career planning is now evolving , and I ’m trying to teach people how to be the chess player instead of the chess piece .

This book has generated controversy among readers .
Do you take readers ’ invective personally ( when they express disbelief or criticism ) , or was this bestseller simply a low - maintenance money - making venture , or “ muse ? ” I do n’t take it personally .
This book challenges a lot of behaviors people hold dear , even though they are counterproductive .
People either “ get ” this book or they do n’t .
At the end of the day , it ’s just the number of people who get it that count .
My blog is on the blogroll of some of the top tech CEOs in the world .
Do I have all of the answers ?
Of course not .
But I ’m asking some important and long - avoided questions that make people uncomfortable .
I knew people would either love this book or hate it , and I ’m fine with that .
I never expected to make a profit on this book .
Something like 13 of 14 publishers turned it down , and some editors — just like some readers — were offended and hostile that I would question their work - a - day comfort zone .
No one expected it to become a phenomenon , getting parodied on Jay Leno , sold into dozens of countries , and so forth .
It ’s been unreal .
Do most corporate workers hate their jobs ?
No .
Most corporate workers are bored and dangerously comfortable .
They are in that gray area between love and hate that leaves most with constant low - grade anxiety and an acute sense of wasted potential .
This is more common and more damaging than hate , because hate spurs action .
Tolerable mediocrity leads you to wake up one day and ask “ what happened to the last 20 years ? ”
That ’s no way to spend the prime of life .
I was in that zone from 2000 to 2004 , and it could have continued until I had a heart attack 20 or 30 years later .
I realized this in June of 2004 , and that ’s when I started experimenting with more uncommon alternatives .
Boredom should scare people as much as hate .
Is this the future of out - sourcing ?
Not just corporate exportation of labor , but personal exportation of labor ?

It is .
In a digital world where the Center for Work - Life Policy reports the new “ 40 - hour ” week is 70 hours and growing , where the norm is time poverty , it ’s an inevitable shift .
Millions of people are already spending income — a renewable resource — to reclaim fleeting time — a non-renewable resource .
So , what if there were an eBay for all of the tasks you did n’t want to do , where people worldwide would compete to give you more time ?
What if you could get an MBA for $ 5 an hour to handle all of your menial personal chores and time - consuming business busywork ?
I have a veritable army working on my behalf , and someone who makes $ 30,000 per year could do the same .
There are dozens of companies set up in places ranging from India and the Phillipines to Jamaica and Canada .
It ’s the fastest evolving market I ’ve ever seen , and it ’s only speeding up .
Five years from now , most white - collar workers will have digital concierges of some type .
A lot of your lifestyle suggestions describe ways to limit the unnecessary expenditure of one ’s creative energy .
Is creativity a scarce resource for most people ?
Creativity is just an under - exercised faculty .
It ’s always easier to choose from the standard menu of options than to think laterally , but the latter is definitely where rewards come faster .
Take the red pill .
Is Inc. really the only business magazine you read every month ?
It ’s the only magazine I tend to read cover - to - cover .
I skim Internet Retailer magazine as well .
Besides that , I get specific information when I need to act on it .
Catching up beats keeping up every time .
With last night ’s dismantling of the Rangers , the Yankees have won seven
straight games .
Five of those wins have been over the Texas Rangers , who
really have to be considering the merits of the National League , or the
Mexican League , or the League of Nations–hell , any league that does n’t
include the Yankees–at this point .
The Yankees are 10 - 3 , which is the best
record in baseball in the young season .
It ’s no secret that I think the Yankees are due for a fall , that I think
the team is old and thin .
I picked the Blue Jays to win the AL East this
year , although that was before their pitching staff was replaced by the
cast of NBC ’s " Just Shoot Me . " ( Yes , that was David Spade serving
up all those runs to the Angels last night .
Laura San Giacomo is tonight ’s
starter . )
What the Yankees have in abundance , however , is starting pitching .
It hangs
from the rafters and piles up in the corners of the locker room .
They have
more starting pitching than the entire American League West .
This winning
streak is a product of that strength .
Their starters have posted five
quality starts in the streak , and have a combined ERA of 3.28 in the seven
games .
What ’s truly amazing is the depth the Yankees have in the rotation ,
especially in contrast to their lack of same on offense .
The nominal # 4 and
# 5 starters of a month ago , Andy Pettitte and Ed Yarnall ,
pitched zero innings in the streak .
Ramiro Mendoza and Jason
Grimsley came out of the bullpen to give the Yankees good starts .
Grimsley is n’t anything special , but Mendoza is at least a # 3 starter on 28
other teams .
On the Yankees , he ’s insurance .
Their rotation means they ’ll be in almost every game they play , and
minimizes the number of innings the back of the bullpen pitches .
As we’ve
noted in the past , good teams win by getting into the soft underbelly of
their opponent ’s bullpen .
As long as the Yankees get good starting
pitching , Allen Watson and Darrell Einertson will remain
tucked away for low - leverage situations .
Like simulated games and
Father / Son Day .
Even with a deep , effective rotation , I remain skeptical that this team can
hold off both the sitcom stars and the Red Sox .
If the Blue Jays can pick
up a starter or two–and " ER " has some arms available–they have
the offense to be very dangerous .
The Yankees are extremely vulnerable to
injuries to their position players , and the age of their lineup makes it
unlikely that Scott Brosius will be the last one they have to address .
But for now , I have to tip my hat to a team that has one remarkable
strength and is riding it for all it ’s worth .

WASHINGTON —
When they write the cultural history of childhood in 21st - century America , I hope they leave room for a few unkind words about “ Kid Nation . ”
CBS ’ latest new reality show — that wonderful oxymoron — is about 40 kids from 8 to 15 years old who are dropped into a ghost town in New Mexico with only a production crew to call their own .
The kids ’ task , we are told in the best go - team fashion , is to “ try to fix their forefathers ’ mistakes and build a new town that works . ”
Their real job , of course , is to attract viewers who want to see what happens to the “ first ever kid nation . ”
Will kids left to their own devices create a democratic idyll or a savage anarchy ?
There is nothing particularly new about the conflicting images of children as innocents and children as beasts .
It ’s as old as mythology .
It lives on in the heart of every parent who ’s seen her child turn from a screaming sociopath at the supermarket checkout to a philosopher king at the beach : “ Who painted the sky blue ? ”
But the real founding fathers of “ Kid Nation ” leave little to chance or choice .
It ’s the producers , not the so - called “ pioneers , ” who determine the structure of the town called Bonanza .
It ’s the adults who lay the cultural grid down the main street .
And this makes “ Kid Nation ” an entry into the annals of childhood as it ’s now lived and argued about in America .
You see , this is what the adults brought with them from Hollywood to Bonanza : competition , class and consumerism .
In the very first episode , the children were directed to form four armies for color war .
And they did .
They were told that victory would determine their class status .
And it did .
In a scenario Karl Marx could n’t have made up , the winners of the war were dubbed “ upper class , ” the runners - up were labeled “ merchants , ” then “ cooks , ” and finally “ laborers . ”
The little capitalists were allowed to use their very unequal paychecks for very unequal chores to pay for goodies at the town store .
The producers did everything but deny the lower income children their health coverage .
Cutthroat competition , class divisions , unrelenting consumerism .
Maybe it is reality programming after all .
Are n’t these the basic three C’s of the culture in which we are all raising children ?
Parent bashing is the favorite indoor sport these days .
It ’s behind the voyeurism that makes “ Supernanny ” popular and Britney Spears unpopular .
It ’s why we cheered the judge assigning the sinking celebrity a parenting coach .
Ordinary parents are held responsible for protecting their children from every imaginable danger .
They are fed a high - anxiety diet of horror stories about lead paint in toys , Crocs on escalators and killer cribs .
If you google “ danger ” and “ children , ” you get 21 million hits of everything from online predators to takeout junk food .
Yet even the most watchful parents are not immune to criticism .
The latest villains are the helicopter parents .
See them hover over their children ’s lives !
Watch them pull the invisible apron strings of a cell phone , book their children ’s playdates and write their college entrance essays while squashing their sense of imagination .
Parents even have to protect kids from overprotection .
The back story is that America has privatized child - raising .
We regard children as the wholly owned subsidiary and responsibility of their families .
Parents , in turn , can become so absorbed in worrying about the side rails on cribs that we lose focus on the cultural environment that encases all of us .
And there is no bike helmet that can protect our children ’s brains from the three C’s .
Before it premiered , “ Kid Nation ” itself was charged with endangering the children by violating child labor laws and even child abuse laws .
Indeed , the consent form that the parents signed is as creepy as the ones you do n’t read before you go into surgery .
Even creepier was the scene when two homesick children cried and not one adult had the impulse to drop a camera and offer comfort .
Nevertheless , the real trouble in Bonanza is not that the cast of mini-survivors was exposed to “ serious bodily injury , illness or death . ”
It ’s that the children urged to build a better town ( read “ world ” ) than their forefathers were manipulated into the copycat media culture .
The reward is a gold star literally worth its weight in gold : $ 20,000 .
The only hero so far is 8 - year - old Jimmy , the New Hampshire boy who had the good sense to go home .
As for the rest ?
The children of Bonanza did n’t make the rules .
They inherited them .
It ’s not a kid nation .
It ’s our nation .

The all - terrain vehicle industry for years opposed mandatory standards dictating the way they build their machines .
But the industry has changed course as it lost market share to lower - priced Chinese - made A.T.V.’s that do not meet voluntary standards , including some with inadequate brakes and top speeds that exceed guidelines .
“ When you move from voluntary to mandatory you give the government policing power to make sure that products on the market meet safety standards — so we are all on a level playing field , ” said Tim Buche , president of the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America , which represents companies that manufacture A.T.V.’s in the United States .
The willingness of state legislators to enact their own regulations or attorneys general to join together to go after companies has also inspired industry groups to seek new federal regulations .
California and Oregon , for example , enacted laws requiring antifreeze manufactures to include a bitter - tasting additive to their formulas to help prevent children and pets from drinking it .
That was enough to convince the trade group to drop its opposition to a federal standard and come forward in an alliance with the Doris Day Animal League to propose a new mandate , which included liability protection against any claims filed related to the change in the formula .
Environmental groups , though , object to the proposed solution , saying the additive could pollute water .
Some of the broadest shifts by industry have come as Congress , now controlled by Democrats , is indicating that it is serious about taking up major regulatory changes , including tobacco regulations , a possible increase in fuel efficiency standards and legislation addressing climate change , which could affect factories that manufacture thousands of different products .
“ They are coming forward , trying to shape the debate with their own proposals so that when activist legislators start writing the new laws , they are included , ” said Rena Steinzor , a professor of environmental law at the University of Maryland and a former federal regulator .
Ms. Steinzor said she was surprised recently when several major corporations sought her help in negotiating with environmental groups .
The slow response by the Bush administration to several of these proposals has been a source of frustration to some industry groups .
“ We have had a very , very uphill battle trying to get regulation , ” said David H. Baker , a lawyer for the Lighter Association .
The organization , representing cigarette lighter manufacturers , has been seeking a mandatory standard because unsafe , inexpensive Chinese imports were flooding the market , but staff members at the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommended against such a rule , saying the number of deaths and injuries did not justify it .
For the last four years , Vice President Dick Cheney has made the controversial claim that his office is not fully part of the Bush administration in order to exempt it from a presidential order regulating federal agencies ’ handling of classified national security information , officials said Thursday .
Cheney has held that his office is not fully part of the executive branch of government despite the continued objections of the National Archives , which says his office ’s failure to demonstrate that it has proper security safeguards in place could jeopardize the government ’s top secrets .
According to documents released Thursday by a House committee , Cheney ’s staff has blocked efforts by the National Archives ’ Information Security Oversight Office to enforce a key component of the presidential order : a mandatory on - site inspection of the vice president ’s office .
At least one of those inspections would have come at a particularly delicate time -- when Cheney ’s former chief of staff , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , and other aides were under criminal investigation for their suspected roles in leaking the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
In an eight - page letter to Cheney on Thursday , Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) also charged that Cheney or his top staffers tried to abolish the Information Security Oversight Office this year after its director tried repeatedly to force Cheney ’s office to comply with the presidential order .

Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride confirmed the vice president ’s position Thursday but said she could not discuss the matter in detail , including whether Cheney or his aides tried to abolish the information security office .
“ We are confident that we are conducting this office properly under the law , ” McBride said .
Some legal scholars and government secrecy experts noted the irony in Cheney ’s stance that his office is not fully part of the executive branch , given his claims of executive privilege when refusing to provide information requested by Congress .
Cheney ’s office has also refused to file required reports with the National Archives elaborating how much national security information was being classified and declassified , which was first reported by the Chicago Tribune last year .
Documents released Thursday offer new details about the intensifying dispute between the office of the vice president and the National Archives .
The archives has appealed to Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales to intervene but has not received a response .

President Bush amended an existing executive order regarding classified information in 2003 to address post - Sept. 11 concerns that sensitive data were being mishandled .
Cheney ’s staff filed annual reports with the National Archives in 2001 and 2002 , as required of all federal agencies that handle national security matters .
But it has n’t filed any of the reports since 2003 , when Bush ’s order established a uniform , government - wide system for safeguarding classified national security information to ensure it is not accidentally released or leaked for political gain .
Waxman and others criticized Cheney and his staff , saying their refusal to comply with the presidential order could endanger national security .
“ To my knowledge , this was the first time in the nearly 30 - year history of the Information Security Oversight Office that a request for access to conduct a security inspection was denied by a White House office , ” Waxman wrote to Cheney .

What ’s more , the congressman said , it suggests that the vice president considers himself above the law -- even when the directive in question was created by his own boss , Bush .
“ This is a very dangerous position he is taking and a ridiculous one , but it is a quite serious one , ” Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said in an interview .
“ I do n’t know if he is covering something up or not , but ... when somebody refuses to make this information available , you wonder what they do n’t want the inspectors from the National Archives to know . ”
A frequent critic of the Bush administration , Waxman also asked Cheney how the vice president ’s office could claim , as it has in correspondence he cited in his letter , that it was not “ an entity within the executive branch . ”
Advertisement
One Cheney staffer familiar with the matter said Thursday that the vice president has not complied with the order because his office has dual functions :
It is part of the executive branch -- the Bush administration -- but also part of the legislative branch , given Cheney ’s position as president of the Senate .
As such , the vice president ’s office has no legal obligation to abide by the order because it only applies to the executive branch , said the Cheney staffer , who was not authorized to publicly discuss the inner workings of the office and requested anonymity .
Cheney ’s position is articulated in the 2004 edition of an annual government directory of senior officials known as the Plum Book :
“ The vice presidency is a unique office that is neither a part of the executive branch nor a part of the legislative branch , but is attached by the Constitution to the latter .
The vice presidency performs functions in both the legislative branch ... and in the executive branch . ”
Advertisement
Waxman said Cheney ’s refusal to allow oversight of its classification system was a problem for another reason :
The office has had a history of leaks of classified information in recent years .
In his letter to the vice president , Waxman said two Cheney staffers -- including Libby -- have been criminally prosecuted in the alleged illegal disclosure of classified information .
Waxman also said the Libby prosecution uncovered information suggesting that Cheney himself “ apparently misused the declassification process for political reasons ... as part of a damage - control effort ” to defend the administration ’s rationale for going to war in Iraq .
“ Your office may have the worst record in the executive branch for safeguarding classified information , ” Waxman wrote .
Advertisement
Steven Aftergood , director of the Federation of American Scientists : Project on Government Secrecy , said the information that Cheney ’s office is required to report is essentially trivial , most of it routine data on classification and declassification activity levels .
“ But the significance of the dispute is enormous .
It reveals with unusual clarity how stubbornly this vice president resists oversight , ” Aftergood said .
“ If the executive order on classification can be violated at will , as the vice president has done , then agencies can abuse secrecy to conceal all kinds of mischief , and worse . ”
Gordon Silverstein , a constitutional scholar at UC Berkeley , said Cheney ’s claims were all the more noteworthy given his repeated assertions of executive privilege , based on his senior position within the Bush administration , as a reason why he has not had to testify before Congress or provide lawmakers with information on such national security issues as torture , interrogation and CIA renditions of terrorists .
“ Here ’s a guy who raises ‘ executive privilege ’ to historic levels to exempt himself from all rules and oversight , and now he says he ’s not part of the executive branch ? ” said Silverstein .
“ Here we have a subordinate part of the executive branch asserting independent constitutional authority even against its own superior .
It is flabbergasting . ”

Do Blueberries Impact Cognitive Processing ?
It might be time to pick - up more B.C. or Maine grown blueberries ... Scientists at the University of Toronto and at Tufts University recently completed a study of age - related cognitive decline utilizing temporal processing speed as the unit of measure .
Against this criterion , one group of aging rats was given a supplement of blueberry derived phytochemicals .
The other group was given a placebo .
After two months of regular feeding , the subjects were tested and the rats fed the complex of antioxidants derived from blueberries responded more quickly to a type of stimulus known as FM or frequency modulation .
Their quicker response time approximated that which might be observed in a younger rat .
The result suggests that blueberries can play an important role in maintaining cognitive fitness .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Bavaria ’s most glamorous politician -- a flame - haired motorcyclist who helped bring down state premier Edmund Stoiber -- has shocked the Catholic state in Germany by suggesting marriage should last just 7 years .
Gabriele Pauli , who poses on her web site in motorcycle leathers , is standing for the leadership of Bavaria ’s Christian Social Union ( CSU ) -- sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) -- in a vote next week .
She told reporters at the launch of her campaign manifesto Wednesday she wanted marriage to expire after seven years and accused the CSU , which promotes traditional family values , of nurturing ideals of marriage which are wide of the mark .
“ The basic approach is wrong ... many marriages last just because people believe they are safe , ” she told reporters .
“ My suggestion is that marriages expire after seven years . ”
After that time , couples should either agree to extend their marriage or it should be automatically dissolved , she said .
Fifty - year - old Pauli , twice divorced , is a maverick intent on shaking up her male - dominated and mainly Catholic party which has dominated Bavarian politics since World War Two .
“ This is about bringing ideas into the CSU and starting a discussion , ” she told German television Thursday after she had unleashed a wave of criticism from other politicians .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Former foe Stoiber said she did not belong in the CSU and European lawmaker Ingo Freidrich dismissed her views .
“ She is diametrically contradicting our Christian , ethical values , ” Freidrich said .
Peter Ramsauer , head of the CSU in Germany ’s parliament , compared Pauli ’s ideas to “ the dirt under your fingernails . ”
Pauli , who attracted attention earlier this year when she posed for a magazine wearing long black latex gloves , was at the center of a snooping scandal which eventually led to Stoiber , Bavarian premier for 14 years , saying he would stand down early .
She said his office tried to obtain details about lovers and alcohol consumption to use against her .
The CSU will elect Stoiber ’s successor as party head at a conference next week .
He will be replaced as state premier in early October .
Viewed as a party rebel , Pauli stands almost no chance of winning next week ’s vote .
The contest has been fought mainly between Bavarian state economy minister Erwin Huber and German Consumer Minister Horst Seehofer .
The popularity of Seehofer , a 58 - year - old married father of three , has suffered from the disclosure that he had been having an affair with a younger woman who recently had his baby .

Quick Scatterometer ( or QuickScat ) launched in 1999 Measures ocean wind and direction from sea ripples Scan width of 1,800 km ; covers 90 % of Earth 's surface in 24hrs Data used to understand drivers of weather and climate
The QuickScat satellite , caught in a controversy that cost the director of the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) his job , provides useful data on wind that helps weather forecasters detect major storms , such as the one that hit Japan this past week .
The decision not to replace it will diminish forecasters ' ability to predict some hurricanes and comes at a time when the need for climate data is paramount .
While the instrument still works , the satellite that carries it has begun to show signs of age .
Some of the sensors that provide orientation have failed and its transmitter is wearing out .
" I can't imagine it 's going to last three more years , " said David Long , an engineer with QuickScat and director of the Brigham Young University Center for Remote Sensing .
It all comes down to politics and money , and the long - term well - being of the Earth depends on these decisions
Timothy Liu , Nasa / JPL
The National Hurricane Center director , Bill Proenza , was forced to step down the week before last after criticising his bosses and suggesting that the loss of QuickScat would keep the NHC from doing its job effectively .
He was called before Congress on Thursday to explain his position .
Wind picture
Dr Proenza had angered his staff by failing to distinguish between the satellite 's usefulness in tracking hurricanes in the open ocean and those close to shore .
As hurricanes approach land , the NHC relies more on reconnaissance planes and radar .
The NHC has said its ability to make accurate forecasts for hurricanes making landfall in the Atlantic and Caribbean will not be compromised when QuickScat fails .
However , the satellite is more important for tracking hurricanes far offshore , beyond the reach of aircrews , in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific where the planes do n't fly .
The scatterometer aboard QuickScat helps detect changes in wind speed and direction that lead to the formation of a hurricane .
Unlike ground - based instruments , it provides a global picture of the world 's oceans .
" Out here in the Western Pacific Ocean , I do n't have an aircraft , " said Roger Edson , a tropical meteorologist at the Noaa weather forecast office in Guam .
" Having satellite data from a scatterometer is an incredible advantage , " he said .
It is particularly useful for determining wind distribution throughout a storm 's structure where speeds can vary by over 100 km / h , Dr Edson added .
No descendents
Joe Sienkiewicz , a scientist at the Noaa Ocean Prediction Center , said QuickScat data complemented other sources to make forecasts over the North Atlantic and North Pacific , but that its high resolution and large coverage made it particularly good for short - term forecasting and for determining levels of threat .
" It helps us distinguish the intense storms from the more routine storms , " he said .
A hurricane is a spinning vortex of winds swirling round a eye of very low pressure Warm , moist air is drawn upwards around the eye Cooler dry air is sucked down by the low pressure centre Banks of thunderstorms surround the edges
But Dr Edson said the backup methods were not as accurate .
The measurements taken by the scatterometer on AScat , for example , were farther apart and covered less territory .
" The QuickScat scatterometer covers 90 % of the Earth a day , " he said .
" AScat gives about half that coverage . "
Nasa scrapped a proposed mission to replace QuickScat in 2006 .
The Ocean Vector Winds ( OVW ) mission would have provided continuity with QuickScat , but was never funded .
An updated version , the Extended OVW Mission ( XOVWM ) , is listed as a priority mission and recommended for launch between 2013 and 2016 , in a major study released this year by the National Research Council ( NRC ) .
But it does not have funding either .
' Pressing need '
The NRC said the cancelled and delayed missions were due to federal cuts to Nasa and Noaa ( National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration ) Earth science budgets .
If the trend continued , by 2015 the US environmental satellite missions would be cut in half , the study warned .
" This is happening at a time when the need for them has never been greater , " said Richard Anthes , co-chairman of the committee that wrote the report .
He testified before Congress about 2008 budget requests in June .
NPoess is often described as a replacement for QuickScat
Eyes in the sky grow dim
But it does not have a scatterometer , and its proposed sensor , " will not do the job as well , " said Timothy Liu , senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , who worked on QuickScat and the proposed OVW mission .
While Dr Anthes said bills recently passed by Congress that recommended boosts to the Nasa / Noaa budgets were a trend in the right direction , they fell well short of what the NRC had recommended for Earth science , and would not be enough to fly XOVWM .
" It all comes down to politics and money , " said Dr Liu , " and the long - term well - being of the Earth depends on these decisions . "
Data costs
QuickScat has been valuable in weather forecasting ; but it was originally designed to provide data on climate , said Dr Liu .
Its sensor provides key information on sea ice coverage and wind circulation .
Winds and ocean currents are the major drivers of heat between the tropics and the poles .
QuickScat does its most important work over the ocean
Such basic climate data is important to future forecasting .
As the Earth heats up , as scientists expect it to , changing wind patterns will influence upper ocean currents , which in turn are likely to alter that heat transport system from equator to poles .
Asked why Nasa is not flying all the missions recommended by the NRC , Dr Freilich said it came down to resources .
" It 's a matter of realism , " he said .
" Our job is to do the best we can with the resources we have . "
Congress is expected to vote on the legislation in September .
Well , you knew Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would n’t waste much time in this climate of unease and anger over the war in Iraq ( amid a presidential campaign ) to dash off a reply to the Pentagon .
The Democratic presidential candidate , who has over time modulated her position on the war from supporting the use of military force in 2002 to now calling for a withdrawal of most American troops and de-authorization of the use of force , sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates today .
In it , she complained about statements made in a letter to her this week from Undersecretary Eric Edelman , in which he warned that public discussion of any such plans for a phased withdrawal would play into enemy propaganda .
( See our post from last night , with credit to The Associated Press for breaking the story . )
Saying that other members of the Bush administration had not resorted to political attacks when asked about contingency plans or the possibility of a phased withdrawal , Senator Clinton , a member of the Armed Services Committee wrote :
Rather than offer to brief the congressional oversight committees on this critical issue , Under Secretary Edelman – writing on your behalf – instead claims that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies .
Under Secretary Edelman has his priorities backward .
Open and honest debate and congressional oversight strengthens our nation and supports our military .
His suggestion to the contrary is outrageous and dangerous .
Indeed , you acknowledged the importance of Congress in our Iraq policy at a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee in March , when you stated , “ I believe that the debate here on the Hill and the issues that have been raised have been helpful in bringing pressure to bear on the Maliki government and on the Iraqis in knowing that there is a very real limit to American patience in this entire enterprise . ”
As an update today , Senator Clinton and Senator John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , plan to introduce legislation to “ require a report and briefing from the Pentagon to Congress on contingency planning for withdrawal from Iraq , ” according to her Senate spokesman , Philippe Reines .
To recap , Mr. Edelman ’s letter outlined what the Pentagon and the administration consider successes and progress from its current strategy in Iraq .
In the process , he contended that discussions of withdrawing troops carried the risk of emboldening the enemy , a phrase used often by the administration .
And , in fairness , he closed the letter by saying that policy forbade the release of contingency plans , as well as operational plans , outside of the Defense Department .
Now some have pointed out that the military always has contingency plans afoot ; others have highlighted the lack of planning for the post- invasion violence .
For the longest time , Senator John McCain has criticized the military operations from that post- invasion time that he believes allowed the conditions we see today to fester and explode .
Whether Senator Clinton ’s back - and - forth with the Pentagon offers a salve to the portion of the anti-war movement that still finds her initial support for the war troublesome – if not a reason not to vote for her – remains an open question .
But she certainly has been staking out a battleground within the battlefield , alongside some of her Democratic rivals who are pushing even further for a full withdrawal of troops .
( Her plan would leave residual troops there , ostensibly for stabilization and counterterrorism efforts . )
If comments from Caucus readers to our overnight post are any indication ( and they ’re definitely not a random sample of the voting public ) , this war - at - home segment provides a glimpse of presidential politics at work , as well as an effort to harness some of the energy and passion of the majority of Americans who are deeply upset about the war .
Moscow is being built at a very rapid rate these days .
In Russia there is no any other big city like Moscow , there is no such a diversity of big cities like in the USA – Chicago , San Francisco , New York City , etc – only Moscow is the one place in Russia where all the main offices of all the big companies reside , where is all the politicians live and work and to where all the people from smaller towns go to climb the social stairs .
As we mentioned once Russians say that 90 % of money that are in circulation in Russia are in Moscow , and then they add that 90 % of those 90 % is in the centre of Moscow .
So it ’s no secret why Moscow is being developed so fast .
This Russian blogger Russos got himself on the top of the building “ Federation Tower ” , that should be the tallest building in Europe when finished .
He shot views of Moscow in all the directions and here are those photos .
This is the idea of the height of the tower , not from the top floor , but instead of security barriers or fences you got used to see on the usual skyscrapers top levels here is nothing like this .
One can reach the window without any barrier and look down .
The photographer says he could n’t force himself to walk to the edge , he crawled instead .
That is the store where the coating stops from where he shot the rest of the images .
The altitude was 220 metres ( around 700 ft ) , from the total of 354 metres ( 1050 feet ) it would reach after would be finished .
You see – no security barriers .
One of the Moscow bridges .
A radio-mast .
The new living skyscraper styled like old - time Stalin ’s one .
Another tower from the tower complex surrounding the “ Federation Tower ” .
This one is almost finished .
This one is a railroad bridge .
This is not a mosk , it ’s a “ Park of the Victory ” in Moscow .
Moscow ’s World Trade Center .
That ’s an Ostankino tower we had its view standing above the clouds from the plane .
A lot of construction sites in Moscow .
A railroad station .
That ’s a hotel “ Ukraine ” , built in Stalin ’s era .
That ’s a bridge .
That ’s another railroad station “ Kievskaya ” .
And this is “ Luzhniki ” stadium .
That is Russian ’s “ Whitehouse ” , in Russia by this word a place where goverment meets is being called .

The National Hockey League has become the first major sports league to embrace the Slingbox .
Sling Media and the NHL have announced a new agreement allowing Slingbox owners to use Sling Media 's Clip + Sling technology to share NHL programming online .
Clip + Sling is currently in beta but will be incorporated into the SlingPlayer software once development is complete .
It gives Slingbox owners the ability to easily record and share video clips .
Those clips will be posted to an upcoming Sling Media " video destination site " where they can be viewed by anyone .
NHL clips will be grouped together and searchable , although as a Chicagoan I 'm assuming that the search results for " Chicago Blackhawks highlights " will be depressingly small .
The NHL will also make league - produced content available on Sling Media 's site .
Unlike most other North American sports leagues , the NHL has been relatively quick to embrace the Internet when it comes to making video content available .
After the loss of the 2004 - 05 season to labor problems , the league signed an agreement with Comcast to stream some of its games live on the Internet to Comcast cable subscribers .
In contrast , the NFL refuses to let any site other than NFL.com show game footage while maintaining draconian restrictions on how other league footage can be shown online ( no more than 45 seconds of practice or press conference footage a day , please ) .
Major League Baseball is also trying to go the exclusive route with MLB.TV and continues to make threatening noises about the Slingbox 's place - shifting abilities .
" Having the most tech - savvy fans of all major professional sports , who also tend to be early adopters of new technology , makes offering NHL content through Clip + Sling a natural fit , " said Keith Ritter , president of NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises , in a statement .
" This partnership expands the visibility of our NHL games online and we are excited and proud to be the first sports league to offer this service to our fans . "
Expanding the visibility of the NHL is the key for the league .
The just - concluded Stanley Cup finals between Anaheim and Ottawa garnered record low ratings south of Canada after games 1 and 2 were consigned to cable outlet Versus and the last three games were aired on NBC .
Those final three games averaged a 1.6 rating , according to NBC , putting it on par with Sunday afternoon golf for a minor tournament .
Game 3 , televised last Saturday night on NBC , produced an abysmal 1.1 rating — the lowest prime - time rating in NBC history .
With the NHL struggling for attention , the deal with Sling Media makes sense .
It will also help Sling 's Clip + Share feature and video destination site get off the ground if it becomes a go - to destination for hockey fans in North America .
But do n't expect more popular leagues to follow suit : the more popular the property , the greater the desire for exclusivity .
Chicago police are constantly monitoring their multi-million dollar surveillance cameras to bust black people drinking beer in brown paper bags on the street , as part of a tactic to remind the city 's ethnic neighborhoods that they live in a panopticon , according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
In contrast , San Francisco 's budding network of 248 surveillance cameras is not monitored until after a crime has been reported .
Earl Gardner lounged on the street near his home just west of downtown Chicago , a 24 - ounce can of Crazy Stallion beer in his hand .
A mile away , police Officer Al Garbauski slid a computer mouse to maneuver a camera that was perched a block from Gardner .
Zooming in tight , Garbauski saw malt liquor meet mouth and sent an officer to arrest Gardner for drinking in public .
" I did n't appreciate it , not one bit , " the 55 - year - old Gardner said the other day .
" The liquor store was closed when I got out ( of custody ) . "
It might seem like a steep expenditure of police resources for a small - time arrest , but Chicago authorities say busts like this serve a higher purpose .
They let everyone know that police are watching as the city 's 560 anti-crime cameras look in on the toughest street corners , a strategy intended to deter small - time and big - time crime alike .
Cameras survey Chicago 's toughest blocks , but do they reduce crime ?

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , said that “ the president ’s claim that the war in Iraq is protecting us from Al Qaeda is as misguided and dangerous as the conclusions that drove us to Iraq in the first place . ”
“ Despite what the president would like us to believe , ” he added , “ it has been established that Al Qaeda had no active cells in Iraq when we invaded , and we have long known that we were not attacked from Iraq on 9/11 .
Saying otherwise does not make it so . ”
Still , judging by recent opinion polls , the president has had some recent success in making a case to voters for continuing the war in Iraq .
He has insisted both that success is possible and that failure would be catastrophic , in part because Al Qaeda in Iraq might then turn its attentions elsewhere .
Earlier today , the White House spokesman , Tony Snow , was asked why Mr. Bush felt the need at this point to insist that the two Al Qaeda groups were closely connected .
“ I think , when somebody tries to argue that Al Qaeda in Iraq is not a key part of the problem , it creates a basis of saying , well , you need to go someplace else , ” he said .
Mr. Bush emphasized in his remarks that Al Qaeda in Iraq ’s top leaders include people from Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Tunisia and Turkey , and said that American forces had recently unmasked an effort by the group to pass off an Iraqi actor , using the surname al - Baghdadi , as its leader to give it a more Iraqi image .
Mr. Bush said that after the United States - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Mr. Zarqawi “ was able to expand dramatically the size , scope and lethality of his operation , ” and that he swore formal allegiance to Mr. bin Laden the following year .
Flood water threatens the town of Upton - upon - Severn
Enlarge Image
Up to 350,000 people in Gloucestershire will be left without running water by Monday evening , as the Severn and Thames rivers threaten to overflow .
The Environment Agency said water levels on both rivers had exceeded those of devastating floods in 1947 .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would set up a review of the crisis .
Mr Brown flew by helicopter over Gloucestershire , the worst - affected county , before heading to the police headquarters where the emergency response is being co-ordinated .
The review would look at drainage and flood defences , while extra funding would help pay for essential emergency work in the aftermath of the crisis , Mr Brown said .
The Environment Agency said water levels on the River Severn at Gloucester could peak early on Tuesday , while the level of the Thames in Oxford may not peak until early on Wednesday .
Severe flood warnings are in place for the Midlands , Oxfordshire and Bedfordshire .
At their height , some rivers will be more than 20ft higher than normal .
Environment Agency spokesman Anthony Perry said : " We have not seen flooding of this magnitude before .
The benchmark was 1947 and this has already exceeded it . "
In March 1947 , millions of pounds of damage was caused in the south of England , the Midlands , East Anglia and North Yorkshire when many rivers burst their banks .
Other main developments include :
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn told the House of Commons the emergency was " far from over " and further flooding was " very likely " .
An independent person would head the flood review announced by the prime minister , he confirmed .
Environment Agency chief executive Baroness
Young told the BBC that about £ 1bn a year was needed to improve flood defences .
The Association of British Insurers has said the total bill for the June and July floods could reach £ 2bn .
The RAF said it is carrying out its biggest ever peacetime operation , with six Sea King helicopters rescuing up to 120 people .
More than one hundred Royal Navy personnel have been sent to Gloucestershire to help the worst affected areas .
Severn Trent Water warned all residents in Gloucester , Cheltenham and Tewkesbury - an estimated 350,000 people - would lose their supply by Monday evening due to a treatment works being flooded .
The situation is expected to last several days , it said .
No electricity
Gloucestershire County Council said bottled water was being provided and a number of water bowsers being deployed to the area .

Elsewhere in Gloucestershire , 15,000 homes are still without power after a major electricity substation at Castlemeads was turned off because of the rising water .
Electricity supplier Central Networks has advised customers to ring 0800 328 1111 to report loss of supply .
Over the border , parts of Worcestershire were under 6ft of water and the Army has been deployed to help emergency services provide supplies to people in Upton - upon - Severn .
Richard Myers , a butcher in the town and a volunteer for Mercia Inshore Search and Rescue Service , said he had been rescuing people from bedroom windows .
" This is the worst I 've ever known it , " he said .
The Bishop of Worcester , Dr Peter Selby , said : " It is rare for a disaster of this kind to affect so much of the country at once , and my prayers are with everyone in the affected places at this difficult time . "
Warwickshire and Berkshire have also been badly affected and severe warnings remain in place for Oxfordshire .
Residents at risk of flooding in Oxford have been told to leave their homes as water levels are expected to rise .
Some homes in Oxford , Abingdon , Kidlington and Bladon have already been flooded and conditions are expected to deteriorate .
' Critical ' situation
Meanwhile , the government has rejected calls to stop building houses on flood plains , despite the recent extensive flooding .
A draft of the Housing Green Paper , which was obtained by the BBC , says it is " not realistic " to rule out new developments in areas at risk of flooding .
The Environment Agency has issued eight severe flood warnings and says the situation is " critical " .
There are four in the Midlands for the River Avon and River Severn between Worcester , Tewkesbury and Gloucester .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We must now look at proper regional controls and answers for surface water problems

Three severe flood warnings are in place for Oxfordshire , from Eynsham to Abingdon , and one has been issued for the River Great Ouse from Turvey to Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire .
The heaviest rain is due to fall in southern England in an area between the Isle of Wight and Suffolk , where an inch of rain could fall on Monday .
Gloucestershire and Worcestershire could see 10 or 15 millimetres of rainfall , forecasters said .

The ancient animal stood taller than any modern - day penguin
More details
The fossilised remains of the animal , which lived some 36 million years ago , were found in what is today Peru .
At 1.5 m ( 5ft ) tall , the penguin looked quite different from its modern - day cousins , a report in PNAS journal says .
It had a long protracted skull and what its discoverers are describing as a grossly elongated beak that was spear - like in appearance .
The Icadyptes salasi penguin would dwarf all the penguins who walk the planet today .
It would have stood head and shoulders over the emperor and the king penguins of the southern seas .
Its well - preserved skeleton was discovered in the Department of Ica on the southern coast of Peru along with the remains of as many as four other previously undiscovered penguin species , all of which appear to have preferred the tropics for colder climes .
Indeed , the Icadyptes appears to have lived happily at such warmer latitudes at a time when world temperatures were much hotter than they are today - and long before anyone thought penguins had reached such low latitudes .
Of course , not all modern - day penguins are adapted for life in cold temperatures .
The African or Galapagos penguins , for example , as their names suggest , also prefer warmer waters to the better - known penguins of the southern seas and Antarctica ; but they are comparative newcomers , say the researchers , compared with the giant whose discovery they are now announcing .
" That was sort of a dominant hypothesis - that in fact penguins had only reached low latitude regions comparatively recently and after two major periods of cooling in Earth 's history , " said Dr Julia Clarke , of North Carolina State University , US , and a member of the research team .
" One was around the Eocene - Oligocene about 34 million years ago ; and more recently , post 15 million years ago - but in fact we find penguins there now in much warmer periods and much , much earlier . "
Full details are reported in a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) of the United States of America .
Conservative sexual fetishes : A hardcore guide / New to right - wing kinks ?
Violet Blue explains them all
Conservative right - wingers really know how to make the most of their sexual fetishes , but do they have to do it in public ?
Indeed they do -- and it's a form of paraphilia just waiting for its own Wikipedia page .
It 's the way that Michelle Malkin dramatically draws out the word " smut " like a phone sex operator 's tool of the trade .
It 's the deliciously deep sexual fascination that prompted former Sen. ( and current Fox News contributard and senior advisor for Washington 's Ethics and Public Policy Center ) Rick Santorum to state as fact to the Associated Press , " In every society , the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality .
That 's not to pick on homosexuality .
It 's not , you know , man on child , man on dog , or whatever the case may be . "
Pastor Ted Haggard and Jim
West know that what 's " wrong " feels oh - so - right .
So do porn obsessed former Attorney General Ed Meese , porn - fixated current Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
See the obsessively sexual agenda of the American Family Association .
These people are way more fixated with sexual transgression than me and my porn star friends put together , and in a wholly apodysophiliac kind of way .
Extreme conservatives have cultivated their anti-sex obsessions into some highly refined , luridly sexualized fetishes .
New to conservative fetish sex ?
Let 's explore those fetishes , and what makes them so hot :
Homosexuality : easily caught on a toilet seat .
This is the world 's best excuse for dwelling on fags and bondage , and you 're carte blanche to talk to as many people about it as you want when you " warn " them with lurid details about the homosexual menace and sexual torture .
Just the threat of getting some on you is exciting all on its own , but it 's even more titillating to imagine what these leather - clad people are doing with each other .
Of course , what 's imagined is as far from reality as possible , but that 's the point : the homosexual scenario is where you explore your nastiest homoerotic fantasy ( Fire hydrants !
Great Danes !
Ralph Lauren tablecloth weights ! )
BDSM ( or ess and emm ) is for evildoers .
The BDSM exchange is where you project your wildest edge - play ideas .
( Serial killers , helpless victims , and pasty guys with mullets who give the name Mistress Bitchslap at Starbucks are all possible components in your fantasy scenarios . )
Everyone at Fox News knows that BDSM where consenting adults get tied up and spanked for sex is one and the same with torture .
( Like in Vietnam , NOT like Abu Ghraib because " we do n't torture . " )
Except the outfits , that 's the only difference , though uniforms are always optional alternatives to 1980s studs and leather .
You can easily convince your minions and followers that your enemy du jour is a homosexual pedophile by bringing in the whips and chains ; only bad people " force " others to do things .
Especially sexual things , which you should linger over for as long as possible .
Everyone knows that normal people never , ever have any hint of power exchange in their sexual encounters .
The computer is an evil voodoo box of pornography .
The Internet is like the real world , except MUCH scarier .
This type of edge play is for conservatives who like to feel out of control , who maybe have to be the person in charge in their everyday lives but fantasize about helplessness and surrender .
It 's also a fabulous punishment tool , as guilt can be a more powerful mistress than Fleshbot.com .
Naughty thoughts you have can be guiltlessly channeled into public humiliation of your enemies ( those bad sex people that give you those weird feelings ) in gay cure blogs , anti-porn websites , anti-sex email campaigns against cable advertisers , and the occasional reporting / expulsion of a member from a social networking site for not " thinking of the children . "
Sex is bad and wicked , so look for it everywhere .
Until the whole world agrees with your versions of truth , justice , right and wrong , you 're pretty much living in a world just like that great movie They Live where the evils of the alien invasion ( in this case , porn / sex ) were invisible to everyone until " Rowdy " Roddy Piper found sunglasses from the resistance that revealed the bad guys and their subliminal messages ( for you , Pure Life Ministries ? ) and saved everyone ( like Bush and Gonzales are saving everyone with abstinence education and obscenity prosecutions ) .
You already have your secret decoder sex sunglasses in your head , so the pernicious evils of sexuality pop out at you like evil fun - house clowns from TV commercials and corner stores , except your sunglasses have no filter for normal healthy human sexuality , the myriad sexual expressions of love , or sex in bad taste so it 's all out to get you and the innocents you must protect , whoever they are .
I envy that you live in a more sexually thrilling world than I do .
And I live in the Castro , okay ?
Safe sex is the same as hardcore pornography .
Talking about condoms and explaining STDs and STIs is tantamount to describing the finer points of bukkake -- to children .
Abstinence is the cleanest , purest , closest - to - God way to talk about sexuality , from the classroom to the news desk .
Promoting abstinence as a truism over accurate sex information actually acts as a magic golden force field carried by beautiful fairies ( the straight kind ) to prevent you and everyone who agrees with you from getting HIV / AIDS .
Only dirty , filthy people promote safer sex , because they clearly enjoy talking in detail about all those nasty sex parts .
Think about it .
A lot .
Meet me in the closet .
Pretend that porn , fetish , homos and female sexuality used to live " on the fringes of society " rather than in everyday life because it 's hotter that way .
What 's great about insisting that any sexual expression outside heterosexual missionary position needs to stay marginalized ( or that there was a reason for staying in the closet ) is that it reinforces the taboo .
And we all know how hot taboos are .
Plus , pretending that something naughty was n't there all along ( even if it was ) makes ( re ) discovery so much more fun .
Obsessing about porn " for the children " is better than going to confession .
Kids should n't see porn , but that does n't mean you can't get your rocks off trying to keep adults from seeing it too ( while you do lots of " research " , of course ) .
You can pretty much screw anything -- like the First Amendment -- if you 're doing it for the children .
Kids are convenient patsies because they 're young and dumb and probably wonÕt remember you boinking their personal freedoms and privacy rights into oblivion .
They can easily be used as a foil for your porn consumption , and your compulsive preoccupation with sexual peril combined with visual stimulation .
Forget reason , forget filtering software , and definitely forget about talking to your kids about sex or teaching them the difference between healthy sexual expression and not .
This is a great way to think about porn a lot , and to enact nonconsensual power play with other adults .
Bonus !
Uniforms and schoolgirl outfits are optional for any related " for the children " role - play scenes .
Aside from this very snarky guide , and having recently researched and authored Fetish Sex : An Erotic Guide for Couples , I can honestly tell you that sexual fetishes are not bad , wrong or harmful -- they 're just human sexual expression .
And despite right - wing conservative pundits ' best efforts to convince us otherwise , adult sex and pornography is not bad , wrong or harmful either .
Homosexuality and trans identity are normal -- and are in every American community from coast to coast and in between , no matter if you think you see them , or not .
And all that " for the children " smokescreen ?
There is no evidence that kids encountering sexuality in healthy contexts , or teaching them about understanding sexual expression , is bad .
Disney movies have shown my friend 's 4 - year - old how to strike freakishly provocative poses , yet give her no tools to know not to do that in front of strange men at the mall .
How about instead of " OMG sex ! " in the media and hiding sex " for the children " , instead we give accurate sex information , and provide kids with tools to navigate the sexuality they 're already encountering in the world ?
There 's nothing wrong about a conservative with a sexual fetish , as long as they 're enjoying it with someone who consents .
If they could only take a page from harm reduction ; accept human behavior and the world we all live in , with each other , and provide tools for individual to reduce the risks ( and maintain their values without stepping on anyone else 's rights or values ) .
Except , I know , that would be way less hot .
Now if we could just get them to keep their fetishes to themselves .

The recent claim by Dick Cheney to have both executive privilege and not to be part of the executive branch of government seems to amount to a claim that Cheney is simply above the rule of law .
It appears that both Bush and Cheney think they rule by divine right like the absolute monarchs of medieval Europe or the dictators of the old Soviet Bloc .
Both need to be impeached .
Until they are removed from office , the media , Congress and the courts should be aggressively investigating , exposing and opposing their abuses of power .
Bush has ignored the rule of law repeatedly .
He has wiretapped American citizens without court orders in clear violation of the law by claiming nonexistent Presidential authority .
Both Bush and Cheney lied to the American public and Congress to take America into an illegal war in Iraq .
Republican politicians helped Bush and Cheney pack our federal courts and the US Department of Justice with partisan political hacks who do everything possible to make illegal actions benefiting Republicans appear legal .
Elections have been essentially rigged by denying millions of Americans of their right to vote or to have their votes accurately counted .
Corporation channeling money to Republican organizations or candidates have been able to win billions of dollars worth of no -bid government contracts under highly questionable or obviously illegal conditions .
Corporate givers were able to ignore government regulations and federal laws concerning oil and mineral leases , environmental considerations , worker safety , consumer rights , fair competition , price - gouging and anti-monopoly concerns .
Congress should immediately repeal the falsely - named Patriot Act because neither Bush or Cheney can be trusted with the powers that law hands to the White House and the Executive Branch .
All funding for the White House should be strictly limited and closely monitored by Congress .
White House funding should be conditioned on Cheney revealing all details of his Energy Task Force and all details of Karl Rove ’s role concerning the various election scandals seemingly connected to the White House .
All details concerning the outing of CIA agent Valerie Palme and the lies promoted by the White House leading up to the invasion of Iraq should be revealed to Congress .
White House involvement in torture and secret prisons should be publicly exposed .
Our national security has been undermined .
Our civil liberties threatened .
Our traditional political freedoms badly trampled by an out of control Executive Branch actively abetted by Republicans in Congress and Republican federal judges .
Corruption and incompetence dominates the leadership of the Republican Party at the state and national level almost everywhere in America .
Investigations are underway in state after state from California to Texas to Ohio of Republican political abuses .
Many more are called for in places like Alabama , Arizona , Delaware , Florida , Maryland , Nevada and Pennsylvania .
Partisan political considerations should never trump the rule of law .
It is up to Republicans to clean - up the corruption and contempt of American political traditions by their leadership .
Republican leaders need to choose between their Party leadership and the future of the American nation !
First step :
Wrap the outside of your magnet with a single layer of tape to electrically insulate it .
Electrical tape , packing tape , or other types of insulating tape will also work for this job .
In the photo , you can see that my half - inch thick “ magnet ” is actually a stack of two 1/4 ″ thick magnets .
Step 2 : Using more tape , attach the magnet to the tray .
You can see in the first photo where the magnet will end up : towards one end of the tray and centered in the other direction .
If you have double - sided tape , use a piece below the magnet to help hold it in place .
Make the incisions .
Use a knife to score a short , narrow slit along two sides of the magnet as shown .
The slits should be allow you to push the two quarters into the foam tray where they are held in place by friction .
It ’s a good idea to make the initial slits narrow and short ( shorter than a quarter ) so that the quarters will be held in place securely and the seal will be water tight .
The quarters should be parallel , centered around the magnet , and as close to the magnet as possible .
Danger :
You must exercise extreme caution when handling a sharp knife near a strong magnet like this .
The safe way to cut these slits is to first mark where the magnet goes , take the magnet off , cut the slits , and thentape the magnet on .
Carefully attach the 9V battery to the craft , it should happily stick to the magnet .
Begin wiring up the craft :
Hook one end of each of the two alligator cables to the battery terminals .
( Do n’t hook the terminals to each other . )
If you do n’t already have any alligator clip cables , this is a great excuse to make or buy some .
To complete your MHD boat , clip the other ends of the two alligator cables to the two quarters .
Go get the Dom , it ’s time for the maiden voyage .
When you float the craft in salt water , the water completes the electric circuit , allowing electricity to flow between the two exposed half - quarters on the bottom side of the tray .
As in the case of the simple MHD demonstration , the electric current flows perpendicularly to the magnetic field , so a force is produced , which will push the craft along .
Avoid getting salt water in the top of the tray ; it will short out the circuit and drain your battery without giving you any propulsion .
Get your basin ready and salt the water .
We used this clear storage bin to test out our little boat .
The water is a couple of inches deep , so that the quarters wo n’t touch bottom .
We emptied that container of salt into it , but I ’m not convinced that we needed quite that much .
Because we ’re using such a small battery , the total thrust is not very high .
To see it , you will need to avoid other factors that can move the boat .
Most importantly , you need to avoid water currents , wind currents , and nearby magnets or ferromagnetic items .
We had an early shipwreck with this design when we tried to test it out in our bathtub .
It turns out that our bathtub is magnetic .
The boat was almost instantly yanked to the bottom .
Oops .
A more subtle problem is that your craft may slowly float towards the nearest giant chunk of steel , so do n’t try this right next to your car .
Once you eliminate major magnetic interference , you may find that your craft still acts as a weak compass .
( If your magnet pointed horizontally instead of vertically , it would make a
very good compass . )
The compass effect will only mess with your steering , not the thrust direction .
If you ’re careful , you should then be able to tell compass steering from attraction towards metal objects .
To check for magnetic interference without eating up batteries , disconnect one of the alligator clips from the battery and set the craft in the basin of water .
If it starts drifting ( not turning ) , then you need to put your basin somewhere else .
Once you ’ve found an interference - free test site , reconnect your battery .
To test your MHD craft , place it in the center of your salt water basin .
Assuming that you ’ve removed magnetic interference , the craft will begin to move forward .
However , without knowing which pole of your magnet is which , you ca n’t tell which way forward will be .
The end with the magnet is either the bow or the stern .
If you ’d like it to go the other way , swap the role of the two alligator clips at the battery end .
To prolong battery life , always take the craft out of the water as soon as it hits one of the walls .
Disconnect the battery if it ’s going to spend any significant time sitting out before the next run .
Short movie ( 43 s , no sound ) , demonstrating this magnetohydrodynamic propulsion craft on YouTube .
Troubleshooting
If you have trouble getting your craft to work , the first suspect should be the battery ; try a new one .
There ’s very little to go wrong in this circuit , so it should ( in principle ) be easy to debug .
If the battery is hot and the craft does n’t move , then you may have a short circuit .
Check to make sure that you do n’t have any water leaks ( remember that salt water is a conductor ! ) and make sure that the insulating wrap around your magnet is intact .
What ’s next ?
This might be a good starting point for a larger vehicle , as a classroom
demonstration , or a science fair project .
That ’s up to you .
Right now , I ’m making radio controlled versions .
How will it turn out ?
Time will tell !
Despite the fact that the arxiv has made it possible to disseminate papers well before they are sent to a journal , the process of anonymous peer review is still crucial to physics and the rest of science .
Anyone who has at least a couple of published papers has appeared on the radar screen of various journals as a potential referee , and pretty soon the requests to review papers come fast and furious .
And it 's not a matter of rubber - stamping ; I 've personally refereed about 100 papers , and recommended less than half of them for publication .
Of course , individual referees can behave quite differently ; editors like referees who will actually read the paper , are willing to reject it if it 's bad , and get the reviews back quickly .
I used to be good at all three of those , although my record on the last point has deteriorated seriously of late .
Every paper sent to a journal like Physical Review ( in all of its contemporary manifestations ) is sent to a referee as a matter of course .
It was n't always thus .
The current issue of Physics Today has a great article about Albert Einstein 's run-in with the journal in 1936 .
In his salad days , Einstein published in German journals such as Annalen der Physik , but he eventually switched to American journals after he moved to the U.S.
He had published a couple of papers in the Physical Review , which were apparently accepted by editor John Tate without being sent to a referee .
These included the famous Einstein , Podolsky and Rosen paper on nonlocality in quantum mechanics , " Can Quantum - Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete ? "
But in 1936 Einstein and Rosen submitted a paper on the existence of gravitational waves that struck Tate as suspicious , and he decided to send it to the referee .
The Physics Today article reveals that the referee was relativist Howard Percy Robertson .
Soon after the initial formulation of general relativity , Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves by doing the obvious thing -- examining the behavior of small fluctuations in the gravitational field using perturbation theory .
But Einstein and Rosen had attempted to solve the full equations without any approximations , and were able to prove that there were no non-singular solutions ; they therefore claimed that gravitational waves did n't exist !
Robertson figured out that they had made a classic error in GR -- essentially , they had used a bad coordinate system .
He wrote a ten - page report explaining why the conclusions of the paper were incorrect .
Einstein explained that he had submitted his paper for publication , not for refereeing .
Dear Sir , We ( Mr. Rosen and I ) had sent you our manuscript for publication and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed .
I see no reason to address theâ € " in any case erroneousâ € " comments of your anonymous expert .
On the basis of this incident I prefer to publish the paper elsewhere .
Respectfully , P.S. Mr. Rosen , who has left for the Soviet Union , has authorized me to represent him in this matter .
After this incident , Einstein vowed never again to publish in Physical Review -- and he did n't .
The Einstein - Rosen paper eventually appeared in the Journal of the Franklin Institute , but its conclusions were dramatically altered -- the authors chose new coordinates , and showed that they had actually discovered a solution for cylindrical gravitational waves , now known as the " Einstein - Rosen metric . "
It 's a little unclear how exactly Einstein changed his mind -- whether it was of his own accord , through the influence of the referee 's report , or by talking to Robertson personally .
But it 's pretty clear that he would have loved the innovation of arxiv.org .
A tool - using strategy that was key to the advancement of early humans has been observed by scientists in a bird .
" Metatool use " , the ability to use one tool on another , is something that humans and great apes such as chimps and orang - utans are capable of , but with which monkeys struggle .
However , a study has shown that New Caledonian crows can manage this task easily .
Researchers offered the crows a tasty morsel of meat that was out of reach in a box .
To reach the food the birds had to use a long stick .
But this stick was inaccessible in another box .
To reach the long stick , the birds had to prise it out with a smaller stick which they could reach .
" It was surprising to find that these creatures performed at the same levels as the best performances by great apes on such a difficult problem , " said Russell Gray , of the University of Auckland , New Zealand .
" Six out of seven birds tried to get the long stick with the short stick at their first attempt at solving the problem . "
The test revealed that the birds knew the short stick was too small to reach the food but that the longer stick would solve the problem .
" They had to inhibit their normal response of trying to get the food directly with the short stick and realise that they could use the short stick to get the long stick , " he said .
New Caledonian crows previously have been shown to adapt tools for a specific job , something only a few primates can manage .
Chimpanzees are the most adept ape tool - users apart from humans , using spears to hunt bushbabies , rocks to crack nuts and sticks to fish for termites .
Metatool use , involving making more complex and useful tools , was vital in our ancestors ' development , say the researchers .
" [ It ] may reflect the ' cognitive leap ' that initiated technological evolution , " they write in the journal Current Biology .
The ability is conceptually hard , they argue , because the applying of one tool to another represents another step removed from the goal itself .
First the animal has to realise that tools can be used on non-food objects , second it has to suppress the urge to go straight for the food itself , and third , it has to perform a sequence of actions in the correct order .
And , to see the solution to the problem , requires " analogical reasoning " , the ability to see a new situation as essentially similar to a previous one .
To ensure the birds were not simply probing randomly with the short stick and getting the long stick by trial and error , the test involved yet another box with a stone inside .
Only one bird tried poking the short stick into this box - and that was after she had already solved the problem .
I ran across an post by David Altenburg about the enumerate , map , filter , accumulate pattern .
These are certainly common functional techniques , but they 're also common Smalltalk techniques .
We call them do : , collect : , select : , and inject : into : .
He showed a Java implementation of a simple and common programming problem ...
int maxSalary = 0 ; for ( Employee employee : employees ) { if ( Role . PROGRAMMER.equals(employee.getRole( ) ) ) { int salary = employee.getSalary ( ) ; if ( salary > maxSalary ) { maxSalary = salary ; } } }
Comparible to a C# 1.0 version ...
int maxSalary = 0 ; foreach ( Employee employee in employees ) { if ( employee .
Role == Role .
PROGRAMMER && employee .
Salary > maxSalary ) { maxSalary = employee .
Salary ; } }
Then he does a Scheme version using a more functional style ...
( define ( salary - of - highest - paid - programmer records ) ( accumulate max 0 ( map salary ( filter programmer ? records ) ) ) )
And a Ruby version of similar style , note the Smalltalk 'ishness of it ...
employees .
select { |emp| : programmer == emp.role }. map { |emp| emp.salary }. inject {|m , v| m > v ? m : v}
And for comparison here 's a Smalltalk version ...
( employees select : [ : emp | emp role = # programmer ] thenCollect : [ :emp | emp salary ] ) inject : 0 into : [ : a :b | a max : b ]
Though if I found the pattern that common I 'd define a quick helper method on Collection to clean up the syntax to this ...
employees select : [ : emp | emp role = # programmer ] collect : [ : emp | emp salary ] inject : 0 into : [ : a :b | a max : b ]
What 's interesting about them to me is really the difference between the Java / C# approaches and the more composable Scheme / Ruby / Smalltalk style .
Because Java / C# 1.0 lack first class functions ( C# actually has them now in 2.0 and a nice lambda syntax in 3.0 ) and a literal syntax for declaring them , everything ends up being a special case of for / foreach .
They lack the ability to factor out common patterns like select : , collect : , and inject : into : into higher order functions .
As a side effect , select : turns into nested if 's and a loop , collect : into a temporary variable and a loop , and inject : into : into both an if , a temporary variable , and a loop .
You end up writing these patterns inline over and over rather than just reusing existing versions from the base library .
Languages that can't support and make idiomatic the use of higher order functions , are n't worth using these days in most domains .
They 're just too damn much work .
However , using functional techniques does n't at all mean using a functional language .
All of these work quite well in good object oriented languages like Smalltalk and Ruby .
Plenty of ink has been spilled in arguments over the proper business model for music in the P2P age .
The publishers generally want to hold onto the current market - based system , but there are voices in the wilderness arguing that a compulsory license model actually makes the most sense for both artists and consumers .
One of those voices is Steven Page , singer and guitarist for the Barenaked Ladies , who recently spoke to Ars about this issue and called for an ISP - based licensing model that would allow consumers access to all the music they want and would ensure that artists get paid .
But the US Register of Copyrights , Marybeth Peters , calls this a bad idea .
Here 's the idea : compulsory licenses allow anyone to take advantage of whatever works are covered by the license without obtaining the permissions that would otherwise be required .
It is essentially an exception made to copyright law that takes away a person 's right to control how copies of their material are handled .
This does n't mean a compulsory license is free , though , only that the rate is determined by statute .
The best known of these in the US is the mechanical license .
Songwriters and their publishers receive this rate — currently set at $ .091 per song — for every copy of an album sold that features their song .
Music labels are free to negotiate a lower rate , and many do ( 75 percent of the mechanical rate is common ) , but they can simply choose to pay the mechanical royalty rate without negotiations .
Steven
Page wants to see the model extended to music consumers , who would pay a flat fee in order to legally access any digital music they can get their hands on — and no one would need to obtain a license from a record label to distribute that music .
Dressed in gray suit and sneakers ,
Page is an articulate spokesman for his position , which is premised on the idea that " music pirates " are actually " fans " and should n't be punished for wanting to hear music .
They should pay for the privilege , but that payment should be low and kept as simple as possible .
And they should be allowed to redistribute and mash up material .
" Not everyone 's an artist , " Page says , " but people can now express themselves like artists do , by sharing something that means something to them .
If we had a system of compulsory licenses , they do n't have to worry about going and getting a license to do it , or circumventing the system . "
Canada does something a bit like this in that it places levies on blank media ; that money is then distributed to artists .
But the system " works better in principle than it does in practice , " Page says .
Blank media prices stay high , and only Canadian artists are a part of the system , which means that " I 'm getting paid , but 50 Cent 's not . "
The ISP solution
The other problem is the formula used to distribute the cash .
It 's based on radio play and record sales , but Page points out that " what 's being downloaded from the Internet and burned to CDs is usually not that stuff . "
Instead , he proposes the ISP model , where ISPs simply build an amount — $ 5 or $ 10 a month , for instance — into their fees , all of which is distributed to artists based on tracking data from P2P networks , etc .
ISPs are the natural place to collect such a fee , he thinks , because they provide the gateway for people to access digital media .
" People do n't like paying for music , " Page admits , but says that " it 's not because they think it 's free , they just do n't like the process . "
This would make that process simpler and remove the shackles of DRM that prevent interoperability .
ISPs who choose to filter P2P traffic could offer access to those who do n't want digitial music , but Page thinks most people would find a blanket license a great deal .
But will it happen ?
The nation 's top copyright official , Marybeth Peters , said at a recent LexisNexis / Variety DRM conference that it 's not something she wants to see .
" I hope we do n't go to a system of compulsory licenses , " she said .
" I do n't see how any creator benefits from a compulsory license . "
None of the other industry executives expressed much love for the plan , either , arguing that the market would work out all of its current interoperability problems on its own , and that a compulsory license would stifle innovation .
But Page is adamant .
" We need to get our music where our fans want it , " he says , " not the other way around . "
Rewritten surveillance law passed by Congress could give Bush more power for domestic wiretaps Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday August 30 , 2007

The recently passed law which allows President Bush to continue wiretapping Americans ' telephone calls overseas may allow for domestic spying as well , according to a new report commissioned by Congress .
A recently - acquired Congressional Research Service report of the controversial Protect America Act , which formally legalized communications surveillance where one party is overseas , offers nebulous language which is broadly open for interpretation , according to Steven Aftergood of Secrecy News .
The new legislation seems to provide legal latitude that could smooth the way for domestic spying initiatives involving US citizens .
Given the Administration 's penchant for signing statements , such an open door may be irresistible .
 The new CRS report offers a careful reading of each provision of the Act ,  writes Aftergood , who obtained a copy of the CRS review Wednesday .
 But instead of fully clarifying its impact , the report serves to highlight just how unclear and indeterminate the new law actually is .
Wendy Morigi , a spokeswoman for Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) told RAW STORY by email that she would familiarize herself with the report .
Steven Aftergood points out instances where the CRS summary cant definitively say what the Act calls for .
Quoting the report , he says ,  One provision could conceivably be interpreted to apply to parties within the United States .
Another provision might be seen to be susceptible of two possible interpretations .
Still others appear to  or would seem to  or may also have one uncertain consequence or another . 
 In other words ,  he says ,  the new law bears the hallmarks of its hasty , poorly - considered origins . 
In an email to RAW STORY Thursday , Aftergood characterized what he thought was a fundamental flaw in the new provisions .
 I would say the most basic problem is that the new law redefines basic legal terms such as ' electronic surveillance , ' he wrote .
" It adopts new terms such as ' [ surveillance ] directed at ' without a clear definition at all .
The upshot is that the practical meaning of the law is uncertain in many cases . "
On the report 's summary page , CRS states that the legislation was enacted " with regard to past abuses of electronic surveillance for national security purposes and to the somewhat uncertain state of the law on the subject , " adding that the Act " also creates a mechanism for acquisition , without a court order under a certification by the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) and the Attorney General , of foreign intelligence information concerning a person reasonably believed to be outside the United States . "
Powers conferred by the amendments are set to expire in six months , although they can extended if Congress so chooses .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , who voted against the measure , said in a statement after its passage that the bill " does violence to the Constitution of the United States , " and " also could produce convictions that may well be overturned because the bill does not heed the instructions from the Supreme Court . "
President Bush , meanwhile , commended the bill for giving intelligence professionals " the legal tools to gather information about the intentions of our enemies , " and said that , because of the amendments , " America is safer . "
If anything , Aftergood writes , the new CRS report may help identify questions Congress may have when it revisits FISA legislation next month .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez used a visit to Russia on Thursday to lambaste U.S. “ imperialism ” but his hosts kept him at arm ’s length to avoid spoiling Vladimir Putin ’s weekend trip to the United States .
In a barnstorming speech lasting more than an hour at a reception in Moscow , the left - wing leader quoted the works of Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin and thanked Putin for showing solidarity in Venezuela ’s feud with the United States .
But the visit comes at an awkward time because President Putin flies on Sunday to the United States for an informal meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush at his family ’s ocean - front retreat in Kennebunkport , Maine .
In a signal the Kremlin wants to keep Chavez ’s visit low profile , the pro-Kremlin majority in parliament overturned an earlier decision to invite the Venezuelan leader to address the full chamber on Friday , moving him to a smaller hall instead .
Putin is to meet Chavez during the three - day visit but a Kremlin official said the main focus would be on economic ties and not politics -- Russian energy firms are investing in Venezuela and Chavez is a big buyer of Russian arms .
“ It seems the Kremlin has decided not to irritate the White House on the eve of the meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents , ” Kommersant newspaper wrote .
Russia has its own disputes with Washington , in particular over U.S. plans for a missile defense shield in eastern Europe , but Putin says he still sees Bush as a partner and friend .
Chavez , a left - wing former soldier who says the United States wants to topple him , has called Bush a “ devil ” in a speech at the United Nations and sought to make common cause with other countries wary of Washington ’s influence .
Speaking through an interpreter at the opening of a Latin American cultural centre in Moscow , Chavez said Russia and Venezuela were on the same side .
“ We , like you , are fighting for a fair world based on respect for all peoples .
American imperialism is destroying peoples , undermining their traditional cultural values , ” he said .
“ I want to recall Lenin ’s work , ‘ What to do ’ in which he described imperialism as the last stage of capitalism .
The world is returning to this idea . ”
Chavez said that at his last meeting with his ally , Cuban leader Fidel Castro , the two men had raised a toast to Putin for a speech in Munich in February when he attacked Washington for trying to impose its will on the rest of the world .

We struggled , myself and a brother , two sisters , my mother there , to keep the farm in the family and keep it going .
And we barely made a living .
So that 's what made me appreciate the job so much , that it was a lot easier and the money was secure .
Before I even started the job , they was always telling me , the worse things get out in the world , the better things get in jail .
You 'll always have a job .

In the United States today there are more prisoners than farmers .
[ 2 ]
And while most prisoners in America are from urban communities , most prisons are now in rural areas .
During the last two decades , the large - scale use of incarceration to solve social problems has combined with the fall - out of globalization to produce an ominous trend : prisons have become a " growth industry " in rural America .
Communities suffering from declines in farming , mining , timber - work and manufacturing are now begging for prisons to be built in their backyards .
The economic restructuring that began in the troubled decade of the 1980s has had dramatic social and economic consequences for rural communities and small towns .
Together the farm crises , factory closings , corporate downsizing , shift to service sector employment and the substitution of major regional and national chains for local , main - street businesses have triggered profound change in these areas .
The acquisition of prisons as a conscious economic development strategy for depressed rural communities and small towns in the United States has become widespread .
Hundreds of small rural towns and several whole regions have become dependent on an industry which itself is dependent on the continuation of crime - producing conditions .
Ironically , while rural areas pursue prisons as a growth strategy , whether this is a wise or effective strategy is far from clear .
Increasing evidence suggests that by many measures prisons do not produce economic growth for local economies and can , over the long term , have detrimental effects on the social fabric and environment of rural communities .
Moreover , this massive penetration of prisons into rural America portends dramatic consequences for the entire nation as huge numbers of inmates from urban areas become rural residents for the purposes of Census - based formulas used to allocate government dollars and political representation .
A Rural Growth Industry
Since 1980 , the majority of new prisons built to accommodate the expanding U.S. prison population have been placed in non-metropolitan areas , with the result that the majority of prisoners are now housed in rural America .
By contrast , prior to 1980 , only 36 % of prisons were located in rural communities and small towns .
Calvin Beale , a senior demographer with the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , reports that throughout the 1960s and 70s , an average of just four new prisons had been built in rural areas each year .
During the 1980s that figure increased to an annual average of 16 and in the 1990s , it jumped to 25 new prisons annually .
[ 3 ]
Between 1990 and 1999 , 245 prisons were built in rural and small town communities -- with a prison opening somewhere in rural America every fifteen days . [ 4 ]
Some of the most depressed rural areas in the United States have had significant infusions of prisons and prison work :
On the west Texas plains , where both farm work and oil field jobs were in full retreat in the 1990s , eleven rural counties acquired prisons , where earlier only one prison existed .
Overall , one of every five new rural prisons in the 1990s opened in Texas , which had the largest number of new rural prisons by far , with forty - nine .
The Mississippi Delta picked up seven prisons in the 90s , added three in 2000 - 2001 , with two more underway as of 2001 .
Nine prisons opened in the Southern Coal Fields region ( Appalachia ) and three new federal prisons were underway as of 2001 .
South central Georgia has a contiguous string of fourteen rural counties with new prisons , and 24 altogether in the state .
The new rural prisons of the 1990s had about 235,000 inmates and employed 75,000 workers at the end of the decade -- averaging 30 employees for every 100 prisoners .
All in all , about 350 rural counties have acquired new prisons since the start - up of the prison boom began in 1980 , and more than half of all rural counties added prison work to their available employment mix during the final two decades of the century just past . [ 5 ]
Prisons as Economic Development : Boom or Bust ?
Despite a lack of studies documenting the effects of prisons on rural areas and small towns over time , prisons are now heralded by economic development professionals and politicians of all stripes as beneficial economic engines for depressed rural economies .
Along with gambling casinos and huge animal confinement units for raising or processing hogs and poultry , prisons have become one of the three leading rural economic enterprises as states and localities seek industries which provide large scale and quick opportunities .
The county economic development director in the small New York town of Romulus , for example , states that economic development experts throughout the state consider correctional facilities to be positive contributors to local economies , providing good - paying jobs and benefits in communities where employment is scarce . [ 6 ]
Ernie Preate , a former Pennsylvania Attorney General and member of the advisory board for Northeastern Pennsylvania 's economic development council , says " it is policy in Pennsylvania to pursue prisons as economic stimulation for depressed rural areas . " [ 7 ]
When announcing the potential siting of a federal prison in Northumberland County , Pennsylvania , in August 2001 , Congressman Paul Kanjorski called the prison " the single largest public works project in the history of Northumberland . " [
8 ]
Prison officials go to great pains and often great expense to convince rural communities of the economic benefits of prisons .
It is common for local officials to sponsor town meetings where prison officials and their supporters are invited to extol the benefits of prisons to communities .
When proposed prisons are on the table , local newspapers are filled with articles reporting grand claims for economic salvation and flyers flood into local coffeeshops , general stores and mini-marts .
The purported benefits are described by a California Department of Corrections official who states that " Prisons not only stabilize a local economy but can in fact rejuvenate it .
There are no seasonal fluctuations , it is a non-polluting industry , and in many circumstances it is virtually invisible ...
You 've got people that are working there and spending their money there , so now these communities are able to have a Little League and all the kinds of activities that people want . " [ 9 ]
As a result of such claims , the competition for prison " development projects " has become fierce and political .
In order to be considered competitive in the bidding wars for public prisons , rural counties and small towns give up a lot to gain what they hope will be more : offering financial assistance and concessions such as donated land , upgraded sewer and water systems , housing subsidies , and , in the case of private prisons , property and other tax abatements .
In the all - out contest spurred by New York Governor George Pataki 's 1996 proposal to build three new maximum - security state prisons , the rural town of Altamont set aside 100 acres of land to entice the state to locate a prison there .
Antwerp , another small community in northern New York , applied for a $ 600,000 federal grant to rebuild their water supply system to increase their chances of winning a state prison . [ 10 ]
States also compete fiercely with each other for federal prisons .
In 1997 , Pennsylvania offered up to 200 acres of prime state - owned farmland in rural Wayne County to the Federal Bureau of Prisons ( FBOP ) for a dollar .
When a rural citizens group legally challenged the sale , the land -- also evaluated as eligible for status as a National Historic Register District due to historic remains on the site -- was again transferred by the state to the FBOP as part of a " friendly condemnation . "
That transaction was also sealed for a dollar .
Despite the prevailing wisdom regarding prisons as economic panaceas , evidence suggests that prison boosters in rural America should be careful what they wish for .
The majority of public prison jobs , for example , do not go to people already living in the community .
Higher - paying management and correctional officer jobs in public prisons come with educational and experience requirements which many rural residents do not have .
Seniority ( and in some cases union rules ) in public corrections systems means that these prisons are typically activated with large cadres of veteran correctional personnel from other prisons .
In addition , competition for jobs in depressed areas is fierce , so rural residents compete in a wider than normal market for available positions .
The distances people drive to work at prisons are quite large , in most cases nearly double the average commuter range , according to Ruth Gilmore , a professor at UC - Berkeley .
Gilmore 's study of prison towns in California shows that less than 20 % of jobs on average go to current residents of a town with a new state prison .
While over time that percentage increases , it is below 40 % for all of California 's new rural prison towns . [ 11 ]
The findings of Gilmore 's study in California are echoed in reports from disappointed local officials in prison towns across the country .
The 750 jobs that a state prison opened in 1999 brought to the tiny rural town of Malone , New York went mostly to people from outside the town because of prison system seniority rules .
According to the village 's director of the Office of Community Development , " Did we get seven hundred fifty jobs ?
We did n't get a hundred " [ 12 ]
A significant development in rural incarceration is the advent of private prisons , which accounted for one - sixth of non-metro prisons built in the 1990s . [ 13 ]
While private prisons do fill most jobs with new recruits when they open , and they sometimes give a hiring preference to local residents , they fail to provide a stable employment base in their host communities because they suffer extremely high rates of job turnover -- three times higher than the rate for public prisons .
Correctional officer turnover rates in for - profit facilities are 40.9 % ( compared to a turnover rate of 15.4 % in government - run prisons ) , due mostly to poor training and low wages .
This rapid turnover can create staffing problems that play out in understaffed shifts , low morale , and a sense of instability in the facility and the surrounding community . [ 14 ]
According to Thomas Johnson , an economist and professor of public affairs at the University of Missouri , prisons are not very good economic development strategies because they generate few linkages to the economy , failing to attract significant numbers of associated industries , as an auto plant might spark the development of delivery companies , radio assemblers and electronic harness makers . [ 15 ]
Prisons may also fail to foster significant retail development .
Because prisons , as a large - scale enterprise , attract chain stores , there is a " replacement " effect , with giants such as McDonalds and Walmarts pushing out locally - owned enterprises .
In Tehachapi , California , home to two state prisons , 741 locally - owned businesses failed in the last decade of the 1990s , while box - store chains absorbed the local markets .
As a result , there may be no net increase in tax revenues , and , because profits made by chain stores are not locally reinvested in the way that locally - owned profits may be , the circulation of dollars within a community may drop in absolute terms .
Anticipating that prisons will both attract new people to live in the host community and that locals with prison jobs will be able to afford better housing , developers build new housing .
But because today 's prison employees often choose not to live in small rural towns , opting instead to commute from urban and suburban areas , speculation in housing development can end in disaster both for the speculator and for the town , as happened in the prison towns of Corcoran and Avenal , California .
The impact of prisons on housing can also cause economic hardships for the poor and elderly in rural communities .
Both land and rental values generally increase when a prison siting is authorized by a governmental or corporate entity ; however , land values fall once the actual ( low ) number of locally - gained jobs , and associated homeowners , becomes clear .
This has the effect of placing additional burdens on poorer members of the community , particularly renters and elderly homeowners , since rents generally rise when real property prices rise , but landlords rarely reduce rents during economic downturns .
As a result renters , who are often the poorest members of communities , are made even poorer because their fixed costs increase while income does not change .
This happened in Crescent City , California , when a state prison opened in 1989 .
For elderly homeowners , the rise and fall in prices during the period of speculative development ultimately devalued their homes . [ 16 ]
Prisoners themselves may also displace low - wage workers in struggling rural areas .
One researcher assessing the impacts of prisons on host communities noted that " Prisons as industries do have the added plus of a captive workforce available for community projects . " [ 17 ]
Work projects performed by prisoners for local government , churches , hospitals , libraries , and many other kinds of organizations are very common in prisons located in rural communities and small towns , and prison officials tout them as good " community relations . "
This can lead to competition within the community for the services of inmates working both inside and outside the prison .
In Coxsackie , New York , home to two state prisons and 3,000 prisoners , work performed for the community varies widely according to the prison guard coordinator of the inmate work crew : " We 've done a lot of painting this year , painting a community center building in Athens , painted the inside of a church parish hall , put a roof on the town of New Baltimore town hall , had them sealing blacktop ... just about everything .
They get an industrial rate which amounts to 42 cents an hour . " [ 18 ]
Though local governments and other organizations save money on work they would otherwise have had to contract out to workers at a prevailing wage , prison labor may result in displacement of workers in these communities and can deepen local poverty . [ 19 ]
The " hidden " costs of doing prison business can be high for small communities .
Local court and police systems are often the first to feel the impact .
In many states county or district public defenders are responsible for defending indigent inmates charged with committing crimes ( e.g. assaults on guards and other inmates ) within state prisons .
In low - population counties with large numbers of prisoners , the prisoner share of a defender 's caseload can be quite high and the much higher rate of inmate assaults on staff and inmates at private prisons as compared to government - run facilities means this is a particular burden for towns with private prisons .
Since private prison guards do not have the same police powers that state or federal correctional officers do , many disciplinary infractions in private prisons are handled by district or county courts .
In Bent County , Colorado , filings in the county court increased an astonishing 99 % after the opening of the privately - operated Bent County Correctional Facility in Las Animas . [ 20 ]
The increasing practice of importing inmates from other states can exacerbate these costs .
This poses serious problems since , in the event of a disturbance or escape , state and local law enforcement personnel can be left with the task of " cleaning up " when there is a problem .
This happened in 1999 at the Correctional Service Corporation 's Crowley County Correctional Facility ( CCCF ) in Olney Springs , Colorado , when inmates from Wyoming protested inadequate food service and state employees were called in to restore order .
State investigators found that CCCF employees were not trained to detect possible problems , handle disturbances , or even properly use their radios . [ 21 ]
Though boosters claim that prisons are " recession - proof , " in fact they are subject to downturns in the economy and expected booms can change to busts for small towns .
Bonne Terre , Missouri , chosen in 1995 as the home for the state 's largest and costliest prison , learned that lesson the hard way .
In 2001 , six years after the announcement , the city was in debt , and new businesses nearly broke because state budget shortfalls delayed the opening of the prison .
Like many small communities trying to replace dead or dying industries with prisons , Bonne Terre , once one of the nation 's top lead - mining towns , gave a lot to get what they hoped would be more .
The town purchased the land for the prison and issued bonds to help pay for $ 14 million in improvements that included new roads , sewer and water lines .
But the town has been forced to pay back the debt on these loans without the expected increases in revenue from the prison .
Businesses like a Texaco convenience store and gas station , car washes and fast food outlets which opened in anticipation of the prison found themselves in a similar bind .
One local land developer , unable to get more than one business to commit to a 240 - acre site that that he bought and cleared , estimated that businesses in Bonne Terre lost millions of dollars . [ 22 ]
The effects of the recession begun in March 2001 also show that Bonne Terre 's experience may look good compared to other prison towns in states like California , Ohio , Michigan , and Illinois , which have announced their intentions to close existing prisons .
States faced with choices between spending on corrections and spending in other areas are now up against a wall , shelving prison - building plans for the near future and laying off hundreds of prison employees .
As one North Dakota legislator put it , " For every dollar that you 're spending on corrections , you 're not spending that on primary and secondary education , you 're not spending it on the colleges or tourism .
It 's just money down a rat hole , basically . " [ 23 ]
Prisons can also discourage other kinds of economic development .
The lack of amenities in a town , coupled with the dominance of a prison on its social and economic horizon , may discourage other industries from locating in the town which might , for all other purposes , be perfectly suitable .
In California , all new prison towns have had great difficulty attracting other industries .
Explanations for this difficulty range from the " specter " of prison as an undesirable neighbor , to the fact that prisons are not necessarily required to conform to all environmental and other controls .
Thus , in California prison towns like Tehachapi and Avenal , water quantity and quality have become major issues . [ 24 ]
The town of Malone , New York , is another small community in the throes of realizing its future as a prison town .
Despite having three state prisons , a hoped - for food processing plant to serve the prisons has n't materialized , and a $ 4.5 million expansion of the sewage - treatment plant , paid for by the state to accommodate the third prison opened in 1999 , has increased the amount of nitrates dumped on a daily basis into the Salmon River , a beautiful trout stream treasured by the community .
Because the loans to build the sewage plant and a new water system for the prison were based on the village 's borrowing capacity , not the state 's , taxes have gone up , and the payments were estimated to be more than $ 1 million in 2000 .
Boyce Sherwin , the town 's industrial recruiter who was born and reared in Malone , deplores the prison boomlet .
" It will institutionalize a degraded environment and quality of life , " he states .
" Is this our legacy to our children ? "
The executive director of Friends of the North Country , a community development group that has opposed prison building believes that " Once you have the reputation of a prison town , you wo n't become a Fortune 500 company town , or an Internet or software company town , or even a diverse tourism and company town . "
Sherwin sees a dream that has gone sour : " It was get a prison and your community is set , " he says .
" But look around , is this heaven ? " [ 25 ]
Norman Rockwell Meets Quentin Tarantino
In response to increased difficulty in attracting other industries , local officials in towns with one prison often opt or are forced to lobby for more prisons , creating a " one- company town " scenario over time .
The tendency of states -- including Texas , Arizona , New York , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Michigan , Colorado , Florida , and California among many others -- to " cluster " prisons in distinct rural regions has created dozens of rural penal colonies where prisons dominate the community 's economic , social , political , and cultural landscape with myriad and profound effects .
In the small town of Ionia , in a rural region of Michigan , a sixth state prison was due to open in 2002 , tying it with Huntsville , Texas , for most lockups in a U.S. city .
The prisons cover two square miles and comprise a third of the city 's size .
They hold 5,094 prisoners and have 1,584 workers .
According to a Detroit News reporter , " When this world of servitude collides with that of freedom , Ionia takes on the look of a Norman Rockwell painting defaced by Quentin Tarantino . "
He noted that prison supervisors belong to the Chamber of Commerce and are regulars at Rotary .
One warden serves on the City Council while another was president of the city 's fair association .
It 's not uncommon to come across an inmate in his prison blues pruning bushes at police headquarters or , during the winter , shoveling snow for seniors .
Teams in city leagues drive into lower security prisons to play softball against inmates . [ 26 ]
And while the local government and business leaders of Ionia express contentment with its prison town identity , there 's no shortage of anecdotal evidence of increased rates of divorce , alcoholism and substance abuse , suicide , health problems , family violence , and other crimes associated with multi-generational prison communities , suggesting that below the surfaces of local power structures , people in these communities are suffering . [ 27 ]
The stress of work in prisons , though not a subject of open discussion in most prison towns , is well - documented and most recently made the subject of popular discussion with the publication of journalist Ted Conover 's book , an account of a year working as a prison guard inside one of America 's most famous prisons . [ 28 ]
A quick perusal of the letters Conover has received from prison guards and their family members from across the nation speaks to the dehumanization of both prisoners and guards that inevitably takes place behind bars and to the toll on the loved ones , neighbors , and friends of correctional officers . [ 29 ]
The impact of this process of soul - death on a small community is suggested in remarks made by Richard Purdue , a former mayor of Ossining , New York , the prison town that changed its name from Sing Sing in an attempt to alter the perceptions of the town by outsiders .
In a letter written in 1997 addressing New York 's proposal to locate a maximum security prison in the tiny town of Tupper Lake in the state 's Adirondack Mountain region , Purdue says " A state prison is a disadvantage to a small community .
A maximum security prison in particular drags on the public perception of a town and quietly injures a town 's perception of itself .
The State Legislature still can turn back the Tupper Lake proposal .
For Tupper Lake and for the Adirondacks , this could initiate a period of progress , rather than a dismal retreat into the industry of incarceration . " [ 30 ]
Perpetuating Racism
Racial hatred behind and beyond prison walls is another deeply troubling consequence of the increasing dependence of rural communities on prisons .
While racism is not a new feature of the U.S. prison system , efforts to address the problem are undermined by the trend toward building prisons in rural areas where the work force is predominantly white and prisoners are predominantly people of color .
Calling racism pervasive in rural prisons , author , researcher and former corrections officer Kelsey Kauffman has gathered extensive documentation on both individual and organized acts of racist activity in rural prisons throughout states as diverse as Indiana , New York , Virginia , Florida , New Jersey , Illinois , Colorado , California , Maine and Michigan . [ 31 ]
Individual acts of racism in prisons include the wearing of Klan - style robes or hoods at work and the wearing or displaying of confederate or skinhead flags or insignias by employees inside prisons .
The problem becomes one of organized or organizational racism when excuses like " hey , it was just a joke , " or " that 's my heritage " are accepted and translated by prison management as " White boys will be white boys . " [ 32 ]
In at least six states , guards have appeared in mock Klan attire in recent years .
Guards have also been accused of race - based threats , beatings and shootings in 10 states .
Lawsuits have been filed in at least 13 states by black guards alleging racist harassment or violence from white colleagues .
And uncounted settlements have been reached in civil cases filed by guards or inmates , where damages are sealed by court order . [ 33 ]
The Florida NAACP has joined more than a hundred black employees in filing suit against the state Department of Corrections for harboring and condoning overt racism in the state 's prisons .
Black officers and prisoners have accused white officers of carrying so called " nigger knots " ( small knotted nooses on their key chains worn as symbols of solidarity ) ; of wearing and displaying racist symbols ( such as Klan tattoos ) at work ; of routinely using racist epithets ; and of retaliating against employees -- black and white -- who challenge these practices . [ 34 ]
In the late 1990s , two separate lawsuits by African - American correctional officers were filed against the Department of Corrections in Washington , where individual and organized racist activity among white prison guards has been a widely reported problem in rural prisons throughout the state .
In 2000 , the Washington Department of Corrections paid $ 250,000 in an out - of - court settlement to black officers who had accused it of condoning racist behavior at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center located in a remote northwest corner of the state , where most of the prison guards are white , formerly unemployed loggers . [ 35 ]
" The people we work with out there are ex-loggers , " said former guard Doris Washington , a plaintiff in the Clellam Bay suit .
" They have never come into contact with the outside world per se .
They do n't know how to deal with us because they 've never been around us . "
Though Clellam Bay 's prisoner population is 48 percent minority , only 4 of its 326 employees are black .
The lawsuit stated that black officers were denied promotions , subject to threats and racial epithets like " coon , " and that minority prisoners were harassed and set up for beatings .
Some white guards had taken to calling Martin Luther King Jr. Day " Happy Nigger Day " and a handful of guards openly bragged about associations with hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan .
A similar lawsuit filed in 1999 by black employees of Washington Correctional Center in Shelton , also included complaints about organized neo -Nazi activities including " Heil Hitler " salutes among some white officers and distribution of hate literature inside the prison . [ 36 ]
In other instances , prison officials would like to sanction employees who are prominently associated with white supremacist organizations outside the prison but can't because these employees have clean records inside .
And while there have also been cases where correctional officers who are leaders in their local white supremacist organizations have been fired when they openly recruited at work , others who flaunt their white supremacy at work keep their jobs .
" Such situations are highly corrosive for those who work in rural prisons , for those who live in them , for the communities around them , and ultimately for the nation as a whole , " says Kauffman , who recommends the first course of action to address this problem is to stop building prisons in rural areas :
" Beyond the obvious parallels that we are once again using black bodies to sustain white rural economies , we are setting ourselves up , over the long term , for greater racial tensions in this country .
Prison walls cannot and will not contain the racial hatreds generated within them . " [ 37 ]
Redistributing Wealth and Political Power
The shockwaves of the prison - building spree in rural America are now penetrating the inner core of our nation 's large cities and threatening dramatic and troubling changes in the way the nation allocates resources and political representation .
The near - doubling of the prison population and the rural prison boom during the 1990s portends a substantial transfer of dollars from urban to rural America because prison inmates are counted in the populations of the towns and counties in which they are incarcerated and not in their home neighborhoods .
The result ?
Inner -city communities , home to large numbers of prisoners , will lose out .
The prisoner " share " of the nearly $ 2 trillion in federal funds tied to population counts distributed nationwide during this decade will go to the mostly rural hometowns of their keepers . [ 38 ]
Ironically , it is prisons that are reversing long - standing trends of population loss in rural counties .
Sussex County , Virginia , a 496 square mile patch of peanuts , cotton , and hog farms , was recently declared the fastest growing county in the United States .
The reason ?
Between 1998 and 1999 , two new maximum - security prisons increased its population by 23 per cent .
As rural communities gain inmates , they harvest federal cash .
In Coxsackie , New York , prisoners make the community more " competitive " for federal anti-poverty funds distributed on a per capita basis .
Because they earn little or no money , prisoners in the town 's two correctional facilities -- who made up 27.5 per cent of Coxsackie 's 1990 population -- drove down its median income on the census and made it eligible to receive more funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Since that time , the number of Coxsackie 's prisoners has continued to grow , and local officials acknowledge that Coxsackie will benefit even more from the final 2000 census count . [ 39 ]
As the cutoff for that census approached , localities rushed to get their piece of the pie .
In 1998 , an Arizona law permitting municipalities to annex prisons set off a bidding war between the towns of Gila Bend and Buckeye for neighboring adult and juvenile prisons .
Buckeye won , and as a result expects to reap $ 600 per inmate every year , amounting to over $ 10 million in census - tied subsidies in this decade . [ 40 ]
Florence , Arizona , with five prisons , employed an even more novel approach when it paid the Census Bureau thousands of dollars for mid-decade population tabulations to adjust for new prisons built there -- assuring that its " fair share " of census - tied federal and state dollars would flow into the town before the results of the 2000 census were in . [ 41 ]
The big losers in this shift will be urban communities of color .
Half of all U.S. prisoners are African American and one - sixth are Latino .
The vast majority is from places like East New York and South Central Los Angeles .
As a result , these neighborhoods -- which have already sustained years of economic and social crises and loss -- stand to lose more money in coming years .
These communities also stand to lose political representation and power as a result of the prison boom in rural America .
Political districts are based on population size and determine the number of Congressional , state and local representatives .
When political boundaries are redrawn to conform with census figures the huge numbers of urban people imprisoned will be reapportioned to the rural areas hosting their prisons .
We are thus on the verge of a national crisis , particularly in situations where the communities that " win " are predominantly white , and the communities that " lose " are predominantly minority .
In Florida , for example , including the state 's growing inmate population could greatly affect political boundaries in sparsely populated North Florida counties , where prisons have cropped up like mushrooms over the past decade .
Gulf County has two new prisons accounting for a significant percentage of its 13,000 residents ; a prison built in Gadsden County could help move state legislative boundaries that affect Tallahassee and other Big Bend counties .
Opinions issued by Florida 's Attorney General in August , 2001 , said county commissions and school boards must include prisoners when redistricting . [ 42 ]
So , while they can't vote , Florida 's 82,000 prison inmates may figure heavily in the state 's redrawing of political boundaries .
Therein lies another major dilemma .
Because prisoners in 48 states are disenfranchised , if prisoners are allowed to be counted in the region of their imprisonment for the purposes of political representation , then their votes are effectively given to those who happen to live near a prison , thus diluting the voting power of the predominately black , Hispanic , and urban prison population and giving it to mostly white , rural regions . [ 43 ]
Among political gatekeepers , concerns about these potentially significant impacts are growing .
In 1999 , Republican Congressman Mark Green of Wisconsin introduced a bill which would allow states to count for census purposes the state and federal prisoners exported to other states .
The Congressman was concerned that Wisconsin could lose one of its nine Congressional seats after the 2000 census count . [ 44 ]
Conclusion
While the growth in prisoner populations and new prisons slowed somewhat in the late 1990s , without other interventions such as changes in mandatory sentencing laws and parole policies , or more extensive use of alternatives to incarceration , prisoner populations and prison - building may climb upward again .
As well , the use of prisons as money - makers for struggling rural communities has become a major force driving criminal justice policy toward mass incarceration of the urban poor regardless of policy rationales like rising crime and prison overcrowding .
As former New York State legislator Daniel Feldman observed " When legislators cry ' Lock 'em up ! , ' they often mean ' Lock 'em up in my district ! . ' " [ 45 ]
Indeed , the rural prison boom during the decade of the 1990s occurred at a time of falling crime rates and experience shows that the federal and state governments are reluctant to pull the plug on the many interests that now lobby for and feed off prisons .
Allowed to continue , this cycle will have catastrophic consequences for the health and welfare of individuals , families , and communities in urban and rural areas , and indeed for the nation .

Notes
The Free - Libre / Open Source Software ( FLOSS ) License Slide by David A. Wheeler 2017-01 -26 ( was 2007 - 09 - 27 ) [ PDF Version ] | [ OpenDocument Version ]
There are a large number of Free - Libre / Open Source Software ( FLOSS ) licenses , but only a few are widely used .
The widely - used licenses tend to be compatible , i.e. , the software can be combined to produce a larger work .
The following “ license slide ” figure makes it easy to see when common licenses can be combined :
In this figure , the shaded boxes are the names of different FLOSS licenses .
An arrow from box A to box B means that you can combine software with these licenses ; the combined result effectively has the license of B , possibly with additions from A .
To see if software can be combined , just start at their respective licenses , and find a common box you can reach following the arrows ( aka “ following the slide ” ) .
For example , Apache 2.0 - licensed software and GPLv2 + - licensed software can both reach “ GPLv3 or GPLv3 + ” , so they can be combined using GPLv3 or GPLv3 +.
This figure has been carefully crafted so following a path determines if two licenses are compatible .
For more information you must examine the license text , but this gives the basic answer quickly .
At the left are the “ permissive ” licenses , which permit the software to become proprietary ( i.e. , not FLOSS ) .
At the top left is “ Public Domain ” , which strictly speaking is n’t a license but in effect it works like one .
Public domain ( in the sense of copyright law ) means that there is no copyright on the work at all ( note that public domain in the sense of export control law is different and not what we mean in this paper ) .
You can do anything with public domain software ( in the copyright sense ) , but it is rare ; the software must be explicitly released to the public domain ( some debate if that is possible in some jurisdictions ) or be created by a U.S. Government employee in their official capacity .
Next is the so - called “ MIT ” or “ X11 ” license , which is very permissive ( you can do just about anything except sue the author ) .
Software under the MIT license is easily combined with the modern 3 - clause Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD - new ) license , which compared to the MIT license adds a clause forbidding the use of the author ’s name to endorse or promote products without permission ( it ’s debatable if this clause actually does anything , since you typically have to have such permission anyway ) .
Finally we have the Apache version 2.0 license .
At the right are the “ strongly protective ” ( “ strong copyleft ” ) licenses , which prevent the software from becoming proprietary .
This includes the most popular FLOSS license , the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
The GPL has a version 2 ( GPLv2 ) and 3 ( GPLv3 ) ; a “ + ” afterwards means “ version X or later ” .
GPLv2 - only cannot be combined with the network - protective Affero GPLv3 , but GPLv2 + ( “ version 2 or later ” ) can via GPLv3 .
In the middle are the “ weakly protective ” ( “ weak copyleft ” ) licenses , a compromise between permissive and strongly protective licenses .
These prevent the software component ( often a software library ) from becoming proprietary , yet permit it to be part of a larger proprietary program .
This figure shows the rules when you are making other software part of the weakly protected component ; there are other possibilities if you are only using the component as a library .
The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is the most popular weakly protective license , and has a version 2.1 ( LGPLv2.1 ) and 3 ( LGPLv3 ) .
Note that LGPLv2.1 gives you permission to relicense the code under any version of the GPL since GPLv2 .
Another such license is the Mozilla Public License 1.1 ( MPL 1.1 ) , but the MPL has the serious drawback of being incompatible with the widely - popular GPL ; you ca n’t even use an MPL module in a larger GPL ’ed program .

When most people think of flying cars , they think of the Jetsons TV show , and speculate that , maybe one day in the far - off future , people may drive flying cars .
You might be surprised to know that flying cars have been in development since the 1930s - - even before the Jetsons .
Maybe it should n't be that surprising , though .
After all , we have cars , and we have planes -- is it that far - fetched to combine the two ?
There is serious research going on today to investigate the possibilities for flying cars .
One of the biggest events , AeroTech 2007 , hosted by the Society for Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) , will be held next week at the Los Angeles Convention Center .
In preparation for the future , here 's a look at some of the most famous flying cars during the past century .
( Please note that this is an incomplete list , and that other experiments with flying cars were not intentionally left out . )
The W - 5 Arrowbile , designed in 1936 , was called a " hybrid flying auto . "
On roads , the all - metal , three - wheeled Arrowbile could travel up to 70 mph ; and in the air , 120 mph .
Because it had three wheels and a single headlight , the DMV actually classified it as a motorcycle .
The Arrowbile was quite easy to operate , as demonstrated by the fact that a businessman with only 35 hours ' flight experience flew one from Washington , D.C. in his business suit .
http://www.aerofiles.com/water.html
One of the most famous flying cars is Aerocar 's Aerocar , built in 1946 , which was called a " roadable aircraft . "
Designed by Moulton Taylor , the Aerocar had wings that folded up , allowing the car to be easily converted into flight mode by a single person in just five minutes .
When the rear license plate was flipped up , the propeller shaft and a pusher propeller could be attached .
When driving on the road , the wings and tail unit were simply towed behind the vehicle .
As a car , the Aerocar could drive up to 60 miles per hour , and had a top airspeed of 110 miles per hour .
http://www.aerocar.com/
The AVE Mizar ( named after the star ) , was built in 1971 by Henry Smolinski .
The flying car was a true hybrid , with the front half modeled on a Ford Pinto and the back half consisting of a Cessna Skymaster plane .
For taking off , the flying car used both the car engine and the aircraft engine , and the car engine was shut off once the car was airborne .
AVE had scheduled production for 1974 , but unfortunately , the year before , one of the models got in an accident during a test flight .
The right wing detached and the Pinto was separated from the wings , resulting in a fiery crash that killed Smolinski and the pilot .
The car was said to have been slightly over the weight limit during the trial , but the Mizar legend ended with the crash .

The Strong Mobile Magic Dragon Aircar has been worked on by retired Air Force pilot - engineer Rich Strong over the past 50 years .
Strong hopes to entice business travelers to invest in a Magic Dragon Aircar , which he claims can fly a few hundred miles in a few hours - or , about twice the speed of a car on the highway .
The aircar also works both on the roads and in the air , with the wings folding up in the body when in drive mode , and in flight mode , a duct fan on the front of the aircar provides propulsion .
The model will also be presented at SAE AeroTech 2007 next week at the LA Convention Center on Wednesday , September 19 .

The LaBiche Aerospace FSC - 1 is one of the modern flying cars , currently in development .
The FSC - 1 has the unique ability of automatically converting from aircraft to car at the touch of a button .
Also , while most flying cars require a pilot 's license , designers are working on a very interesting feature for the FSC - 1 : a new satellite - navigation " hands free " flight system would allow users to travel from airport to airport , eliminating the need for a pilot 's license ( upon FAA approval ) .
For something very sci-fi , you can watch a scheme of the car transforming itself into a plane here .

The Haynes Aero Skyblazer is another work in progress .
The Skyblazer is expected to have a top speed of 400 mph , and a range of up to 830 miles .
The vehicle uses a single turbofan engine , which would provide thrust for flying , and generate electricity to power an electric motor for driving .
http://www.haynes-aero.com/Netscape/frames.html
One of the most recent flying cars to appear in the news is the Urban Aeronautics X - Hawk , which is a " Vertical Take - Off and Landing " ( VTOL ) vehicle , similar to a helicopter .
But unlike a helicopter , the X - Hawk is safer because its rotors are not exposed , but rather enclosed in large ducts .
The X - Hawk is being aimed at emergency programs for search and rescue missions , since it can hover close to a building or achieve other positions unattainable by traditional aircraft .
Urban Aeronautics and designer Rafi Yoeli expect to have the X - Hawk available by 2010 , for a price of $ 3 million .

The Terrafugia Transition is also currently in development , and the company hopes to release this " personal air vehicle " in late 2009 .
As opposed to the X - Hawk , the Transition is aimed at general consumers , as it can hold two passengers with " room for luggage . "
The Transition could fly for up to 500 miles on a single tank of unleaded premium gasoline .
The expected price , at $ 148,000 , is almost reasonable .

So flying cars are not a new thing .
However , there are several companies today with high hopes for producing flying cars in the surprisingly near future .
Hopefully , we 'll be hearing more about them .

After doing some further digging this evening , I decided that the business solar incentives in Oregon are absolutely astounding .
With some help from the Office of Sustainable Development in Portland , I ’m able to provide you with some real life examples of how state and government incentives can be combined to create very affordable installation options for business owners .
On the home front this is a much different story .
Check out the following examples of how incentives work for both groups .
.
Please note that the following treatment of the tax incentives does not by any means constitute tax advice and cannot be used to avoid IRS penalties ( Not like you ’d actually be dumb enough to cite solarpowerrocks.com on your IRS grievance letter right ?
The last thing we need is something like that ) .
Ok , here we go .
Lets start with businesses .
Consider a 17 kw commercial solar electric system :
.
17 kw Commercial Solar Electric System
$ 153,000 Total estimated installed cost
( actual cost will vary ) – $ 21,250 Energy Trust incentive
( $ 1.25 / watt x 17,000 watts ; add $ 0.25 for PGE customers ) – $ 76,500 Oregon Business Energy Tax Credit
( up to 50 percent of installed cost ) - $ 55,900 Approximate net present value ( up to 30 percent ) of federal tax credit ( and accelerated depreciation ) Just about nothing !
Approximate final net cost
to business
Ok , so as a business owner , if having incentives account for just about your entire PV system cost does n’t sound good to you , perhaps you should n’t be in business in the first place .
Demand for systems should be HUGE !!
Let ’s take a look at a commercial example for heating water with solar in Oregon :
.
Typical Commercial Solar Water Heating System
$ 30,000 Total estimated installed cost – $ 6,000 Energy Trust incentive
( $ 6.00 / therm x 1,000 therms ) – $ 8,000 Oregon Business Energy Tax Credit
( based on $ 16,000 eligible cost * 50 % ; limited by 15 year payback requirement ) - $ 13,000 Approximate net present value ( up to 30 percent ) of federal tax credit ( and accelerated depreciation ) $ 3,000 Approximate final net cost to business
.
Again , this is awesome .
By utilizing a mix of federal and state incentives , a business owner may only be responsible to finance 10 % of the total installed cost of a solar hot water system .
Wow .
Let ’s turn the focus to the home .
While many consider a solar system a long - term investment in your home ( the value continues to grow as energy costs rise ) those business credits dwarf what is available to homeowners .
Cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon and tax credits from the State of Oregon and the federal government only seem to cover half as much for homeowners as they cover for business - owners :
. 2 kW PV system for residential PGE customers $ 20,000 Total installed cost ( see note ) - $ 4,500 Energy Trust incentive ( $ 2.25 / watt x 2,000 watts ) $ 15,500 Amount paid by customer to contractor – $ 6,000 Oregon tax credit ( $ 3.00 watt x 2,000 watts , $ 6,000 cap ) - $ 2,000 Federal tax credit ( 30 % of $ 15,500 , $ 2,000 cap ) $ 7,500 Final net cost to customer
.
Now , we turn to the residential solar water heating example .
First some background information .
Heating water accounts for about 15 percent of the average household ’s energy use — second only to heating and cooling your home .
You can expect a solar water heating system to heat about half of the total hot water your family will need in an entire year .
According to the Office of Sustainable Development , from May through October ( In Oregon ) these systems frequently provide enough energy to heat 90 percent of your home ’s hot water .
Again though , it seems a little unfair that if you ’re a business you can recoup up to 90 % of the total cost of your system and if you ’re a homeowner you ’re lucky to recoup 50 % .
Hell though , it ’s great that in Oregon you are able to recoup anything ( imagine if you lived in Alabama or something .
Actually , I have n’t reviewed Alabama ’s solar incentives yet so I should probably shut my mouth ) : .
Drainback system that saves 2,200 kwh/yr
$ 8,000 Total installed cost ( see note ) -$ 880 Energy Trust incentive ( $.40 / kWh x 2,200 kWh ) $ 7,120 Amount paid by customer to contractor – $ 1,320 Oregon tax credit ( $.60 / kWh x 2,200 watts , $ 1,500 cap ) - $ 2,000 Federal tax credit ( 30 % of $ 7,120 , $ 2,000 cap ) $ 3,800 Final net cost to customer
.
From here , we just need to do a little more simple math to calculate payback for homeowners .
Since the price of energy has n’t done anything but rise at a rate of about 7 % , let ’s say over 15 years the average price of electricity from the utility will be $ .13 / KwH – So annual savings is about $ 290 ( 2200 KwH * $.13 ) .
Now , under current residential incentives , this system pays itself off in about 13 years .
That ’s a long time for a homeowner to recoup the investment compared to a business owner .
The blame for this disparity should not lay with the Oregon state legislature .
Instead , the cause of this large gap between business solar credits and homeowner solar credits lies with the federal government .
Why ?
The ability to rapidly depreciate this solar equipment on your taxes .
You ca n’t do this as a homeowner but you can as a business .
That benefit alone accounts for a significant amount of the net cost to businesses ( Look above at the percentage that accounts for ! ) .
.
So if you ’re a homeowner and you want to finance your solar equipment , until some progressive energy legislation passes through Washington DC , you either need to refinance your mortgage with an energy efficient loan , or you could start a home based business and use the rapid depreciation schedule .
Another day , another blog post about how Java on OS X is dooooooomed .
These posts follow a reasonably predictable formula :
Apple is late releasing Java 6
The latest Java 6 DP is Leopard - only
The Cocoa -Java bridge has been deprecated
Steve Jobs said " Nobody uses Java anymore "
Therefore , Apple is dropping support for Java .
Therefore , Apple is dooooooomed .
Let 's address these points one at a time .
Apple is late releasing Java 6
The two major vendors in Java - land are Sun and IBM .
Sun , obviously , needs to support Solaris .
They also need to support Windows and ( more recently )
Linux , because without those two platforms on board any claim to " write once , run anywhere " is laughable .
IBM has its own JDK .
The current stable version is 5.0 , with a Java 6 implementation available as a developer preview .
What 's the current stable Java version for HP - UX ?
For FreeBSD ? For Tru64 ?
5.0
This puts Apple behind Sun ( duh ) , on a par with IBM , slightly ahead of the remainder of Unix - land and , it 's worth mentioning in passing , light - years ahead of Microsoft and the Linux vendors who do n't even maintain their own JDKs any more ( hands up if you remember waiting for the Linux Java ports from blackdown.org ) .
The latest Java 6 DP is Leopard - only
This does n't necessarily mean that the final Java 6 release will be confined to Leopard , but let 's assume it 's the most likely eventuality .
What does this mean for the Java platform on OS X ?
Firstly , any software written against Java 6 will be Leopard - only .
Secondly , developers looking to write Java 6 code on the Mac will have to upgrade .
The vast majority of Java software is bespoke development .
The general rule for all this software is that you do n't get to choose what version of Java you use .
The deployment platform determines the Java version you are targeting .
In the vanishingly small possibility that you are contracted to a company looking to deploy Java applications on a Mac this year , you 're confined to Java 5 .
Big deal , so is everyone writing for Websphere or Weblogic .
It 's even worse if you 're writing shrink - wrap software .
I have n't even written a single line of commercial Java 5 code yet , because there are still stragglers living in the dark ages .
The general rule is that if it has n't been end - of - lifed yet by Sun , we 're going to get complaints if we do n't support it .
As for developers , if you want to write Java 6 code , you 'll probably have to spend $ 129 on an OS upgrade .
According to Steve Jobs ' WWDC keynote , two thirds of OS X users are running the most recent version of OS X ( Tiger ) .
Given that developers are notorious early adopters ( doubly so if you 're developing against the bleeding - edge of Java ) , are you really trying to tell me the upgrade is a huge impediment to writing code ?
The Cocoa -Java bridge has been deprecated
The Cocoa -Java bridge was deprecated for two reasons :
Java imposed a significant runtime overhead for Cocoa apps , and was a bad fit for the Cocoa framework 's heavy use of dynamic typing Nobody was using it to write OS X applications
Actually , this is really one reason , as the two feed quite neatly into each other .
Every book or article I read on Cocoa development had one piece of advice regarding the Cocoa - Java bridge .
Do n't .
The Mac developer community responded by producing a plethora of incredibly useful , innovative and powerful applications , none of which were written in Java .
There are two significant general - purpose desktop applications on the Mac that are written in Java .
The Azureus Bittorrent client , and NeoOffice .
Only the latter uses the Cocoa - Java bridge .
Java developers like to talk about how Apple is shooting itself in the foot by deprecating the bridge , but the Java community had five years to develop compelling Cocoa - Java applications , and they came up with one , a UI built on top of the ( C++ ) OpenOffice suite .
Maintaining the Java bridge to support one application does n't really make much sense .
Instead , Apple has changed its focus to a universal bridge .
Apple is supporting the bridge for Ruby and Python out of the box , but both of these implementations emerged from community efforts to write such bridges without Apple 's involvement .
If the Java community was really interested in doing more than complaining about the dropped support , they could do the same .
Steve Jobs said " Nobody uses Java anymore "
He was talking about the iPhone .
Maybe there are a lot of fantastic ( i.e. not games ) Java applications written for cell - phones .
None have gathered any kind of mass - market appeal .
Meanwhile I 've never been able to get a decent cell - phone Java SDK for the Mac , so I really do n't see this to be a huge change in the status quo for Mac - based J2ME developers .
Therefore , Apple is dropping support for Java
As far as I 'm aware , the Java team inside Apple is pretty small .
I do n't know the exact numbers myself , but I 've never heard the team described as being more than a handful of developers .
They 've done some great work over the years , first integrating Java tightly with Cocoa and Aqua , then painstakingly unravelling the two for the Java 5 release .
Their class data sharing work was pulled back into the Java standard .
But still , it 's always been a pretty small team , working towards the goal of having a Java version on OS X that 's reasonably current .
Given the popularity of Macs among Java developers , something Apple must be aware of , having that ' couple of guys ' continue to work on Java support in OS X makes good economic sense .
Having a larger team devoted to getting new JDK releases out and polished on the same time - frame as Sun , tested against a wider range of OS versions , does n't .
Therefore , Apple is dooooooomed
The 1990 's called .
They want their catch - phrase back .
I am pleased to report the inflation monster has been captured and placed in a jar .
This stunning announcement as well as an accompanying video detailing the highlights was made by the European Central Bank in cooperation with the national central banks of the euro area .
Along with the announcement , the ECB has produced an information kit on inflation entitled " Price stability : why is it important for you ? "
It is targeted at young teenagers and teachers in all the official languages of the European Union .
The ECB 's eight minute video is actually somewhat entertaining so I recommend that everyone click on the above link take a look .
Even though it is entertaining , it sure flops as an educational tool unless of course the goal is self serving promotion by the ECB , for the ECB .
Unfortunately the video does not explain that the real source of inflation is printing of money by the central bank itself .
Nor does it explain why 2 % is such a good inflation target .
Finally it does not really explain how prices across the board can be contained by broad brushed practices like setting of short term interest rates .
Those things were not explained simply because they can not be explained .
Why should inflation be targeted at 2 % and not 1 % or 3 % ?
Why should any inflation be targeted at all ?
Even if it was for some reason smart to target prices , can prices really be measured it accurately ?
What do central banks do to overcome lag effects of monetary tightening and loosening ?
Is this just blind faith " we know neutral when we see it " ?
The problem of course is targeting prices in the first place .
Sometimes money flows into houses and stock and bonds instead of goods and services .
Sometimes productivity improvements mask inflation .
Sometimes falling commodity prices mask inflation .
Of course I am talking about " real inflation " as measured by increases in money supply as opposed to hedonically adjusted price inflation as seen through the eyes of central bankers .
The last paragraph is exactly what made a fool out of Greenspan .
In the mid -to - late 1990's , " real inflation " ( a rampant increase in money supply ) , was masked by productivity improvements , falling oil prices , and falling prices of goods from Asia .
Greenspan called it a " productivity miracle " .
It was a " miracle " indeed .
Rampant increases in money supply fueled the 2000 stock market bubble and spawned nonsensical talk about " new paradigms " .
Then in sheer panic " after the bubble pops " adjustments that he likes to make , Greenspan refused to allow a recession run its course .
Instead he slashed interest rates to 1 % , fueling the biggest housing bubble the world has ever seen .
Here we are three short years later now facing a " new paradigm " in housing , with debt levels far worse at both consumer and governmental levels .
Greenspan will soon be gone and Bernanke is next to bat , waiting in the on - deck circle .
Like the ECB , Bernanke wants to set price inflation targets of 2 % .
I have some advice for him :
It simply can not work .
With all the hedonic adjustments , with all the nonsense about core inflation vs non-core inflation , with all the imputed economics , with all the understating of medical costs , and with enormous discrepancies between rental costs vs housing ownership costs , there is not a person on this earth that could possibly know 2 % price increases if it hit them smack in the face .
Compounding the problem for these so called " inflation fighters " is energy costs .
One reason energy costs are rising is peak oil .
Another reason oil costs are high is geopolitical tensions .
A third reason energy prices are high is supply disruptions .
Finally , oil and natural gas demand are relatively inelastic .
As prices go up , people more or less have to pay it .
To maintain a CPI price target of 2 % , central banks might have to raise interest rates to unreasonably high levels if energy prices are included in their measurements .
That clearly would be bad policy .
The root problem of course is assuming it is wise to target prices rather than money supply in the first place .
The Deflation Monster
I almost forgot to mention that the ECB claims to have “ the deflation monster ” bottled up as well .
I guess we will see but I think they are hopelessly wrong .
The ECB points out " deflation monster " problems when in fact deflation is both a blessing as well as the natural state of affairs .
Rising productivity is " price deflationary " : more goods are produced faster by fewer people .
Prices naturally decline as a result .
Look at how few farmers today produce more grain than 100 times as many farmers did not that long ago .
Corn prices fell to 1943 levels a couple weeks ago .
Is that a problem ?
For whom ?
It 's only a problem because the US and ECB blow countless billions of dollars every year on price crop supports .
It is a total waste of money .
Bear in mind that China is actually losing textile jobs .
The enquiring mind might be asking : to whom ?
The answer might be shocking : to no one .
Fewer workers are needed to turn out the same amount of goods .
That is one of the reason this protectionist talk you hear right now out of Congress is total nonsense .
Those jobs simply are not coming back ever .
Cranking up money supply in an attempt to create jobs lost by productivity improvements and outsourcing can only result in asset bubbles and / or increased overcapacity .
Besides , who does not like lower prices on goods and services ?
If deflation is such a good thing , why do central banks fear it ?
One answer is because deflation is debt 's worst enemy .
If asset prices and wages fall , people can not possibly ever pay back what they owe .
Banks and credit card companies do n't seem to like that state of affairs .
Is that a problem with deflation ?
No , that is a problem created by a reckless lending , easy credit , and endless cheerleading on CNBC every time consumer spending rises and people sink heavier into debt .
The second answer is because inflation benefits those that receive money first : the government and banks .
The former is via automatic tax increases not indexed to inflation ( especially property taxes ) , the latter simply because banks are first in line to receive money from the FED at rates no one else sees .
By the time lending standards drop so that the masses have access to credit , the boom is well underway .
By the time credit is granted to anyone that can fog a mirror , the boom is nearly over .
Those buying assets late in the game will eventually be crushed by those selling assets that got in early .
Simply put , inflation eventually becomes a moral hazard .
The Pivot Point
We are now at or close to the pivot point .
The pivot point or tipping point if you prefer , is the point at which consumers can not or will not take on any more debt and / or corporations simply are unwilling or unable to extend more credit .
I have been writing about various tipping points for some time now and we seem to be hitting those tipping points simultaneously in many areas : jobs , housing , consumer spending , and credit expansion .
The malinvestments of the have - it - now , me too , ownership society is about to be unwound .
We are where we are because Central Banks have printed ever expanding amounts of money to prevent normal business cycles , to satisfy politicians wanting to waste more taxpayer money with silly projects , and to foolishly fight deflation .
The only thing the Central Banks have accomplished is putting off the inevitable deflationary credit crunch while making it worse along the way .
There are many that think true deflation ( decrease in money supply ) can not happen under a fiat system .
I disagree but perhaps the point is moot .
Money supply itself actually never contracted in Japan .
Instead , it grew very slowly for quite some time .
However , bank credit outstanding contracted for 60 months in a row .
Clearly there was a credit contraction .
How did money supply still manage to grow ?
Fiscal deficits were ramped up immensely , roads to nowhere were built , and the Bank of Japan monetized all of it .
In addition , money velocity plummeted .
The net effect of the credit contraction on prices was clearly what one would nowadays call " deflationary " .
Prices across a broad range of assets and goods and services fell .
Indeed , practically everything fell but government bonds .
People were amazed at the alleged " bond bubble " as well as the Zero Interest Rate Policy ( ZIRP ) of the BOJ .
However , a 1 % interest rate on a 10 - year bond makes sense when prices fall 2.5 % annually .
The real yield is obviously far higher than 1 % .
Perhaps a practical way to think of deflation under a FIAT system is the destruction of credit / debt that exceeds growth in money supply .
Regardless of social and economic differences I fully expect the US to follow in the footsteps of Japan .
Although a central bank might be able to sustain a certain amount of inflation by resorting to extreme measures , it can not stop a credit contraction in the private sector .
Nor will a central bank bail out consumers at the expense of themselves and other creditors .
The Fed like the BOJ will stop short of destroying themselves and their power .
At some point , most likely tied to a property bubble implosion , consumers will refuse to take on more debt and / or banks will refuse to lend consumers credit as the value of assets behind the loans plunge .
Consumer bankruptcies will soar as various credit bubbles implode .
Furthermore , in a world awash in overcapacity there will be no reason for corporations to borrow .
That is why the Bank of Japan failed to defeat deflation and that is why Bernanke will fail as well .
In due time I suspect we will find out that the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 will fail its intended purpose .
We have already seen massive bankruptcy filings to beat the October filing deadline .
That is one such consequence .
Given there is now a " means test " based on median family income , I just wonder if the way around that test is for someone to manage to lose their job .
If so , that will only increase the size and number of writeoffs during the established credit counseling and waiting periods .
One of the complaints by the US and others against Japan in their long battle with deflation was Japan 's refusal to write off bad banking sector loans .
The US " solution " to that problem was to pass legislation designed to make people debt slaves forever .
I am convinced that legislation will backfire in ways we have not yet begun to understand .
The problem by now should be obvious .
Central Banks are attempting to do the impossible as well as the unwise .
Arguably the best thing that could happen would be for the Central Banks to abolish themselves .
Since that is not about to happen for many reasons , let 's instead turn to more practical solutions for " stability " .
Instead of trying to achieve " price stability " which as we noted is something that can neither be achieved nor measured , how about shooting for " money supply stability " instead ?
Central banks should refuse to monetize government spending and trade deficits
Central banks should let the market set interest rates
Central banks should embark on a campaign of tightening reserves requirements over time to rein in fractional reserve lending
Life would be so much simpler if Central Banks everywhere would stop trying to micromanage both prices and economic cycles .
Quite simply , they are trying to achieve nirvana when nirvana can not possibly be measured , nor can nirvana be achieved in the first place with the policies they have in place .
Of course if they stop doing these things , they will cease to be Central Banks in the modern sense , so perhaps they will get the hint and just close shop .
Yes we will still have economic cycles if Central Banks do those things , but the cycle peaks and valleys would not be as exaggerated as they are now .
It seems as if we have learned nothing from the great depression or the more recent experience by Japan .
I fear we may get a second chance .

Common on the blog .
“ One of the most exciting areas of research in the last few years has been the realization of the BEC - BCS crossover , ” Wolfgang Ketterle tells PhsyOrg.com .
Ketterle and a team of scientists at the MIT - Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms have completed the first study of critical velocities in this crossover region where magnetic tuning of the interactions is possible by a Feshbach resonance .
The results are available in Physical Review Letters , in a piece titled “ Critical Velocity for Superfluid Flow across the BEC - BCS Crossover . ”
In ultracold gases , the BEC - BCS crossover basically addresses how superfluidity in bosons transforms into superfluidity in fermions .
At issue , says Ketterle , is how fermions can be made to interact very strongly so that superfluidity occurs at higher temperatures .
Furthermore , an improved understanding of the pairing mechanism can lead to the developments of new materials that could serve as superconductors .
“ Bare electrons repel each other , ” says Ketterle , “ unless there are many other particles around them which can lead to some attraction and to pairing .
Once paired , fermions act as bosons . ”
So far , the group has studied fermionic atoms with attractive interactions , but in the future , they hope to see how to pair fermions , which repel each other , to resemble the electrons .
“ These are important issues , ” Ketterle explains .
“ Superfluids and superconductors have many possible applications .
We use them now , but if we understood them even better , more applications could open up . ”
He illustrates : “ Imagine having a superconducting power grid where energy flows without resistance or developing better magnets for MRIs . ”
These are only a couple of the applications that scientists can think of now .
“ A better understanding of superfluids may lead to the design of new materials in the future . ”
But for the here and now , Ketterle ’s team has managed to create conditions that use tuning to control the pairing of fermions .
“ When we modify the external magnetic field , we can loosen up the binding between the particles until they reach a point where two of them are not bound at all , but many of them still are . ”
The MIT team studied the critical velocity only in the center of the atom cloud , avoiding the limitations of inhomogeneous density .
They moved an optical lattice ( an interference pattern between two laser beams ) through the superfluid .
The group found that the critical velocity is highest when molecular pairs transform into Cooper pairs “ in which attractive forces are about to support a molecular state . ”
Ketterle expects other studies to follow — and to perform additional quantitative tests of the theoretical predictions .
“ We have seen that this system allows us to study the breakdown of superfluidity , ” Ketterle says .
“ The ultimate goal is to use our new tools and methods to find new regimes of superfluidity , to find out for what interactions and in what kind of geometry superfluidity is most robust , ” says Ketterle .
“ This is an exciting frontier .
We are able to study superfluids over the whole range of interactions throughout the crossover .
This is the latest advance toward understanding superfluidity and superconductivity . ”

In the not - too - distant - future , you 'll be able to have your sagging breasts lifted on your lunch hour !
Well , just about ....
An Israeli company , MIM ( Minimally Invasive Mastopexy ) has developed a two - hole breast lift procedure to insert what amounts to a permanent push - up bra under your breasts .
How clever and how considerate !
Yup !
If the human trials are successful , the huge anchor incisions on women 's bodies , made for the " aesthetic " lifting of sagging breasts , may become a thing of the past .
Breast lifts are currently among the most invasive cosmetic surgeries , involving the removal and new placement of breast tissue , lots of incisions , often removal and replacement of the nipple , and insertion of implants .
These surgeries are painful afterwards and can involve weeks of recovery .
Then there is that chance they will not be successful and you require a repeat surgery .
The new technique , called the " Cup&Up " involves the insertion of a silicone implant through two small incisions and its attachment to the ribs and connective tissue with a few small screws and some surgical thread .
Does n't sound too bad , does it ?
Pigs were chosen as the first subjects for " Cup& Up " testing because their skin is the most like human flesh .
The pig Cup&Ups were tested successfully for " staying power , tissue reaction and damage or injury to muscles or ribs . "
Now that MIM is ready to conduct human trials , plastic surgeons from all over the world are trying to get their patients into the clinical trials .
( Oh , me first , me first ! )
Because of the demand for breast lifts worldwide , the Cup& Up procedure should be available within a few years .
So in the meantime , babes , keep wearing those push - up bras and try doing some push - up workouts to firm up your chest muscles .
Keeping you posted !
EDITOR'S NOTE : Non-surgery alternatives to fix the appearance of sagging breast include silicone bra inserts .
These silicone bra inserts get great reviews on Amazon and may be worth trying .

The hit on Iglesias was issued on Dec. 7 - " Pearl Harbor Day , " he says without irony - though news of his departure as the top federal prosecutor for New Mexico did n't make the papers until this week .
[...]
Iglesias , 48 , was n't alone .
He says several U.S. attorneys have been dismissed by the Bush administration in recent weeks .
[...] he talks about his departure with a calm , measured dignity .
" I can't complain that I only had 5 years , " he says .
" It was a fantastic ride .
I think we got some good results for the people of New Mexico .
And no one can say we hosed up the office .
The opposite is true . "
Albuquerque Tribune , December 23 , 2006
Judging from Iglesias ' background one would assume he had a bright future in Republican politics .

So why would someone who on paper looks like a Republican golden - boy be unceremoniously given the boot ?
Phill Casaus of the Albuquerque Tribune has a theory :
And now this : Iglesias , a straight arrow from GOP Central Casting , being deposed in a way that may hurt him if he ever runs for office .
Given his resume , he'd be a natural for something big .
A young , intelligent , telegenic Hispanic Republican with federal prosecutorial credentials ?
Think that might work in an election ?
Apparently , someone in D.C. did n't care .
That 's what 's so interesting .
Maybe someone there - in close contact with someone here - was incredibly disappointed by the results of the corruption case of former state Treasurer Robert Vigil , a Democrat .
Or , maybe , that special someone wanted November indictments in an unrelated public corruption investigation that may make the Vigil - Montoya affair look like a jaywalking ticket .
Maybe someone thought the right kind of results in both instances might 've helped the GOP 's fortunes in November 's elections .

Cases prosecuted by Iglesias
Iglesias , working with the FBI , was responsible for charging two state treasurers with extortion ... both Democrats .
New Mexico's state treasurer and his predecessor were charged on Friday with taking about $ 700,000 in kickbacks .
A racketeering indictment stemming from a two - year F.B.I. investigation accused the treasurer , Robert Vigil , and the former treasurer , Michael Montoya , both Democrats , of receiving the illegal payments from investment advisers .
New York Times Published : September 17 , 2005
One would think that successfully prosecuting corruption cases against two high profile Democratic office holders would elicit praise and the eternal gratitude of Iglesias ' fellow Republicans .
But as Andy Lenderman , of the " New Mexican , " points out , things do n't always work out the way you think they will .
For some , Iglesias ' inability to max out the case was viewed as a defeat .
" If you ’re a corrupt politician , you ’re going to do hard federal time . " — U.S. ATTORNEY DAVID IGLESIAS ALBUQUERQUE --
In the end , Robert Vigil 's family surrounded the former state treasurer and protected him from the news cameras as he left the federal courthouse late Wednesday afternoon . [...]
Moments earlier the Ribera native received a 37 - month prison sentence and a fine of nearly $ 100,000 for his conviction on one count of attempted extortion , which related to his pressuring a contractor to give a job to the wife of a political friend .
U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said the sentencing sends a clear message : " If you 're a corrupt politician , you 're going to do hard federal time . "
Lawyers from both sides may still appeal the sentence or the case .
Prosecutors objected that it was too low , and Vigil 's defense team may appeal the case to a higher court .
Vigil 's sentencing capped the largest part of a massive white collar crime case .
Prosecutors said Vigil was part of a multimillion - dollar kickback scheme where Vigil and his predecessor , Michael Montoya , demanded kickbacks in exchange for sending state investment business to private financial advisers . [...]
The debate -- led by Browning -- was an exhaustive lesson in federal sentencing procedure .
" It would not be reasonable to punish Mr. Vigil with the same sentence if the jury had convicted him on 23 counts , " Browning said .

The prosecution of the State Treasurer (s ) was used , ironically , by both sides in the 2006 House seat race between Patricia Madrid and Heather Wilson .
In the daily tit - for - tat , Madrid accuses Wilson of ignoring important questions leading up to the war in Iraq and being a rubber stamp for the Bush administration .
Her supporters call ( ed ) her the best candidate to face Wilson since the representative 's first election in 1998 .
In return , Wilson , who many say is in the political fight of her life , accuses Madrid of ignoring corruption in the state despite her being the top law enforcement official there .
There are other considerations in the Iglesias dismissal that need to be considered .
Cases under investigation by Iglesias ' Office :
From the Albuquerque Tribune ...
Rumors have also swirled for months about an investigation into corruption involving major public construction projects in Bernalillo County including the state District Courthouse and Metro Courthouse .
An FBI spokesman confirmed in October that an investigation had been forwarded to Iglesias ' office - although he declined to specify details .
Since then indictments have regularly been expected and then delayed .
Or perhaps Iglesias ' strong stand on immigration led to his undoing .
Running contrary to Bush administration policy , Iglesias wrote an editorial for The Washington Times ( 2/17/06 ) in support of the House Bill on Immigration Reform , specifically citing the need to crack down on the smugglers who traffic in illegal immigrants while displaying concern for the immigrants themselves :
" Our existing alien smuggling laws are inadequate , outdated and unnecessarily complicated . " [ warning : PDF ]
The bill passed by the House would address these gaps and would give federal prosecutors on the southwest border many desperately needed tools to take down smuggling rings and obtain justice for the victims .
In particular , the bill strengthens the penalties for alien smugglers , especially those who put immigrants at risk of death or serious bodily injury .
It extends the arm of the law to better reach foreign alien smuggling rings and those who help illegal aliens to cross our borders .
The legislation would also impose new penalties for organized passport and immigration fraud and makes it a federal crime to defraud immigrants .
These important changes will provide prosecutors additional tools to prosecute every person involved in smuggling an alien into the country or defrauding immigrants .
[ read the whole PDF here ] :
As more information comes to light , the rationale behind Iglesias ' dismissal might finally be uncovered .
The key might end up not to be anything Iglesias did ... but rather who is chosen to be his successor ... and why .
Who will be Iglesias Replacement ?
Iglesias has recently announced his last day will be February 28th , 2007 – and who will be replacing him ?
Will President Bush review the names submitted by the New Mexico Congressional delegation , or will we see another Gonzales appointment ?
In a statement , U.S. Sen .
Pete Domenici said , " It is my pleasure to recommend four individuals that I believe would serve New Mexico and the nation with distinction as U.S. Attorney for our state .
I am familiar with each of them , and I believe that they have the necessary legal backgrounds and right temperaments for the job .
I look forward to President Bush 's choice . "
All four mentioned by Domenici are lawyers : Jim Bibb , Glenn Ellington , Charles Peifer and Pat Rogers .
The names are familiar to many in New Mexico political and legal circles .
Bibb , of Santa Fe , ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for state attorney general last fall against Gary King and has been an assistant U.S. attorney in the past .
Ellington , 45 , also of Santa Fe , is a former state Taxation and Revenue Department secretary in private practice with Ellington & Ellington LLC .
He 's also a former state appellate and district judge . [...]
Peifer has been in private practice for 16 years with Peifer , Hanson and Mullins , and has served as chief assistant attorney general .
He said he 's honored to be considered . [...]
Rogers , 51 , of Albuquerque , is a longtime attorney with Modrall , Sperling , Roehl , Harris and Sisk and has served as chief counsel to the state Republican Party .

UN General Assembly meets under shadow of US threats against Iran
By Peter Symonds
24 September 2007
The UN General Assembly meets this week under the shadow of menacing demands by the US and its allies for tough new UN sanctions against Iran over its alleged nuclear weapons programs .
The Bush administration ’s “ diplomacy ” , in which the French government has been playing a very visible role , is aimed in the first instance at bullying Russia and China into line by threatening to impose US and EU penalties on Tehran .
In the background , the rising drumbeat of war is unmistakable .
The tensions flared into the open during a meeting in Moscow between the French and Russian foreign ministers last week .
Since coming to office in May , French President Nicolas Sarkozy has adopted a more belligerent stance toward Iran , aligning his government more closely with the Bush administration .
Just days before arriving in Moscow , Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner warned on French TV that it was “ necessary to prepare for the worst ... and the worst is war . ”
In his joint press conference with Kouchner , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov publicly repudiated the suggestion of war .
“ We are convinced that no modern problem has a military solution , and that applies to the Iranian nuclear program as well , ” he said .
“ We are seriously concerned about increasingly frequent reports that military action against Iran is being considered . ”
Lavrov also criticised French efforts to press for unilateral EU sanctions outside of any agreement in the UN Security Council .
“ If we decided to act collectively on the basis of consensual decisions in the UN Security Council , what good does it do to take unilateral decisions ? ” he exclaimed .
Behind this pathetic appeal for a return to UN consensus , Lavrov obviously feels double - crossed , particularly by France , which Moscow had previously counted upon to help rein in Washington .
Far from playing down the differences , Kouchner responded by declaring : “ Contrary to my friend Sergei , I believe that we must work on sanctions , on precise sanctions , to show that we are serious .
If there is no third resolution in the UN , we will maybe be forced to use them . ”
By the standards of international diplomacy , the tone of the press conference was decidedly frosty .
Both sides are well aware that the turn by the EU to join the US in imposing unilateral economic sanctions on Tehran opens up the prospect of joint military action against Iran .
In the course of last week , Kouchner toned down his warnings of war , declaring that “ everything should be done to avoid war ” .
But this formula is not markedly different from that of the Bush administration , which declares that it supports “ diplomacy ” , while refusing to negotiate directly with Iran and insisting that all options , including the military one , are “ on the table ” .
President Sarkozy delivered a similar message last Thursday when he flatly declared Iran ’s efforts “ to obtain an atomic bomb ” were “ unacceptable ” .
While declaring that France “ does not want war ” , Sarkozy did not rule it out .
The developing alignment was on display in Washington the following day .
At the joint press conference after talks with Kouchner , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice commented : “ I think there ’s essentially no difference in the way that we see the situation in Iran and what the international community must do . ”
Efforts by the UN Security Council permanent members — the US , France , Britain , Russia and China — plus Germany to agree to new sanctions against Iran have been floundering for months .
The previous UN resolution mandated the end of May as the deadline for Iran to shut down its nuclear facilities — in particular , its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz .
Tehran has repeatedly declared that it is not engaged in building nuclear weapons and insisted on its right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to provide fuel for its planned nuclear power reactors .
Russia and China have both opposed demands for any immediate new sanctions and supported an agreement reached last month between the International Atomic Energy Commission ( IAEA ) and Iran to resolve outstanding questions about its nuclear programs .
The Bush administration has bitterly opposed the deal and publicly castigated IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei , accusing him last week of “ muddying the message ” to Iran by not including a halt to uranium enrichment in the agreement .
For his part , ElBaradei warned once again of the dangers of war , telling the Associated Press : “ I would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the Iraq situation , where 700,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons . ”
As in the case of Iraq , the US claim that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons is based on a flimsy concoction of supposition , half - truths and outright lies .
The Bush administration ’s objections to the IAEA - Iran agreement are completely hypocritical .
Its justification for demanding that Iran freeze uranium enrichment — a legitimate activity under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — was that Tehran had previously covered up its nuclear activities and failed to fully satisfy the IAEA on all of its activities .
Now that Iran has agreed to clarify the IAEA on outstanding issues by the end of the year , the US opposes the process for wasting time .
Washington ’s unwillingness to wait simply confirms that it is working to its own agenda and timetable , which includes the “ option ” of military strikes on Iran while Bush still holds office .
Senior officials of the UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany met on Friday in an effort to bridge the schism in their ranks .
A terse statement by US Undersecretary of State Nicolas Burns described the talks as “ serious and constructive ” but gave no details .
In the course of this week , the six powers are due to hold further discussions , with a meeting of foreign ministers to be held on Friday .
But with no signs of any agreement , the US and France are pressing ahead with unilateral sanctions .
Britain , the Netherlands and Italy have already indicated support for imposing EU penalties on Iran .
And while there have been indications of German opposition to new sanctions , German officials have downplayed any divisions between the major EU powers .
Underscoring Russia ’s opposition to the US - led campaign to isolate Iran , Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to visit Tehran on October 16 — his first to Iran — as part of a summit of Caspian states .
Iran ’s Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki visited Moscow last week and a meeting of the Iran - Russia Joint Economic Commission has been scheduled .
Iranian and Russian officials have also held talks during the past week over the completion of Iran ’s nuclear power reactor at Bushehr .
Moscow has previously delayed the provision of fuel for the reactor , in large part to indicate its support for UN Security Council measures against Tehran .
Behind the conflicts between the major powers over Iran , fundamental economic and strategic interests are at stake .
Russia , China and the European powers all have a major economic stake in Iran .
Last year Germany was Iran ’s largest trade partner , exporting $ 5.7 billion worth of goods to the country .
But under pressure from Washington , Berlin has scaled back its provision of export credits .
German exports to Iran in the first half of this year slumped by 17 percent .
According to the International Herald Tribune last week , German exporters are concerned that China , which has rapidly expanded its trade with Iran , will fill the void .
France ’s shift toward Washington highlights the mercenary considerations at stake .
In 2003 , the French government opposed the US invasion of Iraq and refused to support a UN resolution sanctioning the war .
Its posturing quickly proved shallow as France joined other UN Security Council members in providing a veneer of legitimacy to the occupation after the event .
Now , however , France under Sarkozy is actively drumming up support in Europe for the Bush administration ’s campaign against Iran .
The new orientation is clearly motivated by an understanding that France will share in the spoils of US military adventures in the Middle East .
Last month , the US oil giant Chevron signed a deal with Total of France to prospect and develop the huge Majnoun oilfield in southeast Iraq , near the Iranian border .
Majnoun is estimated to be Iraq ’s fourth largest oil field , with reserves of more than 12 billion barrels .
Rights over the field had previously been awarded by Saddam Hussein to the French energy company Elf , but the contract was nullified by the US occupation .
As for the US , after nearly three decades of economic sanctions , its trade and investment with Iran is negligible .
If the standoff over Iran ’s nuclear programs were peacefully resolved and Tehran established normal relations with the rest of the world , the major losers would be American corporations , which have been compelled to watch on the sidelines as their European and Asian rivals established footholds in Iran over the past decade .
The Bush administration ’s escalating denunciations of Iran and preparations for war are a desperate attempt to once again use military muscle to establish untrammeled American strategic and economic dominance in this key resource - rich region .

Here are a few tips from observations / dealings I have encountered on CL that will speed the process up and make everyone happy , especially me .
If you want to avoid a headache , read this , if you honestly want to get rid of an item , read this .
If you want to buy something and want to cut to the chase , then read this and I swear when it ’s all over you will thank me and wanna kiss my ass for all the time and effort I have saved you !
If I sound a little bitter , it ’s probably because I am and I apologize in advance for my potty mouth and lack of patience for what I like to call ….
slow folk .
1. Condition : State the condition as it is , not what your emotionally charged brain tells you !!!
Your best bet is to go ask the neighbor who hates your guts and wishes that you would die already .
He ’s pissed because he knows that you let your dog sneak over and shit in his yard everyday and do n’t bother to clean up after it .
Ask him , “ Hey there neighbor , how would you describe this couch …. or mattress set ….. or kids sandbox .
I bet he will give you an exact opposite answer than you were going to give .
Use his description in your post and NOT yours .
Nothing fails to piss people off more than arriving to a location and expecting to see an “ almost new ” “ only used in the guest room ” “ still in the plastic ” queen mattress and box spring set that really looks like it started it ’s life in a hotel room in 1962 , then entered the porno industry where it was used everyday till the mid 90’s where well known mobster Joey " bago donuts " Spilottro picked it up as a conversation piece , was subsequently shot 12 times with a 12 gauge shotgun while laying on it , was thrown away by the crime lab once the case was closed , and picked up by some fuckstick like you .
“ New ” means new as in I could take it back to the store and at least get a god damn store credit for it , not fucking new to YOU .
I have seen many a piss encrusted mattress pictures on CL pictures , even asked about one picture and was told it was a design flaw .
Wrong !!!!
That , my good man , … is a piss stain .
Now granted , buying a used mattress anywhere is risky in itself , and I shudder when I see people picking one up from the side of Culver Rd. and I would not do it , but I feel is a good example of the point I ’m trying to make .
Same with couches .
If your dog chewed the fuckin legs off the damn thing … say so !
Do n’t make some poor schmuk like me drive for a half hour , bring a buddy to help load it , only to find out that the throw pillows are all stuck to the couch because your dog has been humping them for 10 years , and the fabric on the ends is gone because that mangy beast you call a cat has been using it as a scratching post .
Those are important pieces of information I NEED TO KNOW !
2 .
Price :
This is a touchy area as the sellers want the highest price and the buyers want the lowest .
We will start with the sellers first .
Spent $ 5000 on that custom bedroom set 6 months ago , wo n’t fit in the new place , and now I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy it on CL for $ 4500 ?
Get real fuckface .
Ain’t gonna happen .
Do n’t get me wrong , 1 out of a million might , but it sure is n’t gonna be you !!!!
Not my fault you bought some ugly ass shit , and then decided to move into a smaller place .
Suck it up , take the loss , and chalk that shit up to one of life ’s crazy little lessons , and move on .
Yea , it ’s going to burn for a bit , but it will get better .
I know , I know , you post it on there every day , sometimes twice , yet low and behold no one is responding .
I wonder why ???
If you are gonna post something , pull your head out and be real .
You might want to ask that neighbor , the one that wants to push your face into a running table saw with a cross cut blade on it , what he thinks you could get for it .
At least that will be a good start .
To the buyers on CL .
Its your world baby .
I suggest start low .
Might seem offending at first , but when reality sets in and the seller is desperate , he will remember you , and likely give you a call and beg and plead .
Stand firm and always remember
You made it through life for xx number of years without that $ 5000 custom bedroom set , and if you cant get it for $ 750 or a grand …. fuck em .
Let him eat it or use it for firewood .
3. Disclose everything !
Do n’t try to be sneaky .
That fridges ice maker all fucked up ?
You sure know we are not gonna ask you to plug that fucker in and wait an hour for it to cycle so we can check it out .
But I can guarantee when I lug that bitch all the way home , get it installed and find out it does not work , I ’m coming back and busting your head down to the white meat !
Gonna post an ad then go out of town for a week ?
SAY SO .
And what the fuck would you do that for anyway ?
You retarded ?
Wait till you get back , then post it .
When you put in catchy little phrases , that ’s an instant red flag .
I will give you some examples of what they really fuckin mean .
“ Only used once = it ’s fucked up ” ---
“ Highway miles = balls to the wall red light to red light ” --- “ vintage = mid 80’s ” --- “ Antique = mid 70 ’s ” --- “ my loss is your gain=a fuckin headache ” ---“ one of a kind=made at a summer camp for special kids by special kids ” --- I think you get the drift .
Do n’t try to be an advertising guru , your not and we can see right through that shit .
4. Respond to any inquires .
Sure the offer might be offending , but at least say no .
Send a quick e-mail and say fuck off , or whatever , but at least let me know you got it .
If not , you will probably be bitching about the 40 + phone calls your gonna get .
My motto is : It Never Hurts To Ask .
Just the other day , at the place of one of my employments , in Henrietta , an extremely attractive little number who was fixing up her house to sell asked about a product that was sold only in bundles .
Well , she only needed two .
Now I could have been a prick and said sorry , no , ca n’t help you .
Instead I said lets take a look , found some loose ones she could use and sold them to her for .25 or .50 cents , so lesson learned , always ask .
Now I digress for a moment and plead that if this woman by chance happens to read this and is not married or has a significant other and is at all interested , please for gods sake drop me a line with the store and product so I know its you .
I would love to get a bite to eat or drinks with you .
I am sane , extremely shy , have all my shots , and have some very respectable references .
If you are taken , I curse the lucky man and thank you for brightening my day .
Now , some of the nay sayers will state ,
Hey you just did that because you thought she was hot .
WRONG , I do it for the 70 - year - old men in their sansabelt leisure suits that are always tinkering around the house too , and NO , I do n’t want to go have coffee with them , but yes , I did think she was a cutie .
I know , I know ….
it ’s the wrong forum but give me a break .
If I posted it where it SHOULD go , she might actually see it , and like I said , I ’m shy ….. so piss off .
5 . Watch what you sell .
Why in the hell would you bother to sell some kitchen utensils for $ 2.00 on CL ?
If I was your fucking neighbor , I do not think it would be worth my time to WALK next door for that shit , much less drive from the Park Ave. area to Victor .
I would have $ 10.00 invested just in gas only to find out that they look like they sat on a burner and melted .
Now I have a $ 12 lump of melted shit with handles .
Get real already .
Nobody wants shit like that .
Might as well bundle it with the anal beads you also have posted that were “ only used once ” .
If you are selling shit for less than $ 5 it better be spectacular .
You are wasting bandwidth and fuckin up my searches with this stuff .
And no funny guy …
I ’m not searching anal , but I might be searching beads .
That is shit for a garage sale and only a garage sale .
Well that ’s pretty much it in a nutshell .
Be realistic , be honest , and respond to the offers !
What do you expect for free ?
If you do n’t like it , sell your shit on eBay .
Pay the fees , package it up , stand in line at the post office , hope the guy is happy and count your blessings if you get good feedback .

Scientists will be looking now to see how well the ice recovers
More details
The National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) said the minimum extent of 4.13 million sq km ( 1.59 million sq miles ) was reached on 16 September .
The figure shatters all previous satellite surveys , including the previous record low of 5.32 million sq km measured in 2005 .
Earlier this month , it was reported that the Northwest Passage was open .
The fabled Arctic shipping route from the Atlantic to the Pacific is normally ice - bound at some location throughout the year ; but this year , ships have been able to complete an unimpeded navigation .
' Fast track '
Arctic sea ice loses area in summer months and regrows in the winter cold .
The researchers at NSIDC judge the ice extent on a five - day mean .
The minimum for 2007 falls below the minimum set on 20 - 21 September 2005 by an area roughly the size of Texas and California combined , or nearly five UKs .
Speaking to BBC News on Monday this week , Mark Serreze , a senior research scientist at the NSIDC , said : " 2005 was the previous record and what happened then had really astounded us ; we had never seen anything like that , having so little sea ice at the end of summer .
Then along comes 2007 and it has completely shattered that old record . "
He added : " We 're on a strong spiral of decline ; some would say a death spiral .
I would n't go that far but we 're certainly on a fast track .
We know there is natural variability but the magnitude of change is too great to be caused by natural variability alone . "
The team will now follow the progress of recovery over the winter months .
Modelled decline
In December 2006 , a study by US researchers forecast that the Arctic could be ice - free in summers by 2040 .
A team of scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) , the University of Washington , and McGill University , found that " positive feedbacks " were likely to accelerate the decline of the region 's ice system .
Rather than reflecting sunlight , the ocean absorbs 90 % of it , causing the waters to warm and increase the rate of melting .
Scientists fear that this feedback mechanism will have major consequences for wildlife in the region , not least polar bears , which traverse ice floes in search of food .
On a global scale , the Earth would lose a major reflective surface and so absorb more solar energy , potentially accelerating climatic change across the world .
In contrast to the Arctic , the extent of sea ice in the Antarctic has come close this year to breaking its satellite - monitored record for maximum area of 16.03 million sq km .

How Dogs Are Being Trained to Sniff Out Coronavirus
Duration : 01:03
Man and woman ’s best friend gives us yet another reason to adore them .
Officials at Helsinki-Vantaa airport in Helsinki , Finland are testing out how efficient dogs are at detecting COVID - 19 in airline passengers .
Four dogs have started working at the airport , and 10 dogs are being trained in total .
The whole process is easy and painless , and does not require swabbing , just a little affection from a pup .
Inside Edition Digital ’s Stephanie Officer has the details .
We interrupt this weighty discussion for an announcement .
The previous post generated some excellent comments about the ethics of creating a simulated world of sentient beings , and I want to address that topic in another post .
But first , let me announce a small competition based on two far - from - certain premises :
1 . We ’re living in a computer simulation being run by some intelligent being ( ethical or otherwise ) that I ’ll call the Prime Designer .
2 . The Prime Designer is an avid reader of this blog .
Now , is there anything you ’d like to say to the Prime Designer ?
Post your messages here , and the best one will receive a DVD of the “ The 13th Floor ” ( or , if you prefer , one of the other movies or books dealing with a computer - generated world – you ’ll find lots of recommendations from readers who commented after my first post on this topic . )
I ’ll also throw in a signed copy of my book , “ The Best - Case Scenario Handbook , ” which includes advice on what to say if you encounter Santa Claus or God , among other visitors .
Speaking of God , I realize some readers worry that this talk of a Prime Designer sounds like shilling for the intelligent - design side in the evolution debate .
Rest assured I do n’t believe this designer is a supernatural being beyond the laws of physics who created the Earth a few thousand years ago and then revealed the secret to a few clerical scribes .
This simulation hypothesis is n’t an excuse to teach the Bible in addition to Darwin in science class .
But while most of the adherents of intelligent - design theory may be may be members of religions that believe in a supernatural deity , the theory of intelligent design is “ not inherently theistic , ” as Bradley Monton points out in this paper .
Dr. Monton , a philosopher the University of Colorado , argues that the reason to teach Darwin instead of the Bible is because of empirical evidence , not because intelligent design is inherently unscientific or supernaturalistic .
He writes : “ The intelligent cause could be God , but it need not be .
It may be that living things on Earth were created by a highly intelligent alien civilization , as Raelians believe .
It may be that the whole universe we experience is really just a computer simulation being run by highly intelligent non-supernatural beings , as Nick Bostrom argues is plausible . ”
If we are in that simulation , what ’s your message to the simulator ?
You can offer constructive criticism ( think of the blog as a suggestion box ) , meditations , strategic flattery , pleas or rationales for letting humanity ( or at least you ) survive and prosper in this world and beyond .
Post whatever you want , and I ’ll pick a winner next week .
The Navy plans to spend $ 600,000 for “ camouflage ” landscaping and rooftop adjustments so that 1960s - era barracks at the Naval Base Coronado near San Diego will no longer look like a Nazi swastika from the air .
The resemblance went unnoticed by the public for decades until it was spotted in aerial views on Google Earth .
But Navy officials said they became aware of it shortly after the 1967 groundbreaking , and had decided not to do anything .
“ There was no reason to redo the buildings because they were in use , ” a spokeswoman for the base , Angelic Dolan , said .
She added that the buildings were in a no- fly zone that is off limits to commercial airlines , so most people would not see them from the air .

Glenn Greenwald once remarked that “ the highest achievement to which one can aspire in the neocon universe it to be compared to Winston Churchill . ”
So Churchill would advocate another surge and toughing it out forever in Iraq , right ?
Here is what he wrote in 1922 , a couple of years after Britain was awarded Iraq by the Versailles Treaty as a ‘ mandate ’ ( i.e. colony ) .
[ Britain was forced out as mandatory power in Iraq in 1932 , when it became an independent country , though of course it was influential until 1958 . ]
“ Winston S. Churchill to David Lloyd George ( Churchill papers : 17/27 ) 1 September 1922
I am deeply concerned about Iraq .
The task you have given me is becoming really impossible .
Our forces are reduced now to very slender proportions .
The Turkish menace has got worse ; Feisal is playing the fool , if not the knave ; his incompetent Arab officials are disturbing some of the provinces and failing to collect the revenue ; we overpaid £ 200,000 on last year ’s account which it is almost certain Iraq will not be able to pay this year , thus entailing a Supplementary Estimate in regard to a matter never sanctioned by Parliament ; a further deficit , in spite of large economies , is nearly certain this year on the civil expenses owing to the drop in the revenue .
I have had to maintain British troops at Mosul all through the year in consequence of the Angora quarrel : this has upset the programme of reliefs and will certainly lead to further expenditure beyond the provision I cannot at this moment withdraw these troops without practically inviting the Turks to come in .
The small column which is operating in the Rania district inside our border against the Turkish raiders and Kurdish sympathisers is a source of constant anxiety to me .
I do not see what political strength there is to face a disaster of any kind , and certainly I cannot believe that in any circumstances any large reinforcements would be sent from here or from India .
There is scarcely a single newspaper – Tory , Liberal or Labour – which is not consistently hostile to our remaining in this country .
The enormous reductions which have been effected have brought no goodwill , and any alternative Government that might be formed here – Labour , Die-hard or Wee Free – would gain popularity by ordering instant evacuation .
Moreover in my own heart I do not see what we are getting out of it .
Owing to the difficulties with America , no progress has been made in developing the oil .
Altogether I am getting to the end of my resources .
I think we should now put definitely , not only to Feisal but to the Constituent Assembly , the position that unless they beg us to stay and to stay on our own terms in regard to efficient control , we shall actually evacuate before the close of the financial year .
I would put this issue in the most brutal way , and if they are not prepared to urge us to stay and to co-operate in every manner I would actually clear out .
That at any rate would be a solution .
Whether we should clear out of the country altogether or hold on to a portion of the Basra vilayet is a minor issue requiring a special study .
It is quite possible , however , that face to face with this ultimatum the King , and still more the Constituent Assembly , will implore us to remain .
If they

do , shall we not be obliged to remain ?
If we remain , shall we not be answerable for defending their frontier ?
How are we to do this if the Turk comes in ?
We have no force whatever that can resist any serious inroad .
The War Office , of course , have played for safety throughout and are ready to say ‘ I told you so ’ at the first misfortune .
Surveying all the above , I think I must ask you for definite guidance at this stage as to what you wish and what you are prepared to do .
The victories of the Turks will increase our difficulties throughout the Mohammedan world .
At present we are paying eight millions a year for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano out of which we are in no circumstances to get anything worth having . ”

No pullout from Iraq while I ’m president , declares George W. Bush .
On to Iran , declares Vice President Cheney .
Israel is a " peace - seeking state " that needs $ 30 billion of US taxpayers ’ money for war , declares State Department official Nicholas Burns .
The Democratic Congress , if not fully behind the Iraqi war , at least no longer is in the way of it .
Nor are the Democrats in the way of the Bush regime ’s build up for initiating war with Iran .
The Bush regime says it is going to designate part of Iran ’s military — the Revolutionary Guards — a terrorist organization , whose bases and facilities Bush intends to bomb along with Iran ’s nuclear energy sites .
Three US aircraft carrier strike forces are deployed off Iran .
B - 2 Stealth Bombers are being fitted to carry 30,000 pound " bunker - buster " bombs to use against hardened sites .
Politicized US generals assert that Iran is providing arms and aid to the Iraqi resistance to the US occupation .
The media is feeding the US population the same propaganda about nonexistent Iranian weapons of mass destruction that they fed us about nonexistent Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
A former CIA Middle East field officer , Robert Baer , has written in Time magazine that the Bush regime has decided to attack the Revolutionary Guards within the next 6 months .
Remember the " cakewalk war " ?
Well , this time the neocons think that an attack on the Revolutionary Guards will free Iran from Islamic influence and cause Iranians to back the US against their own government .
Lies , unprovoked aggression , and delusional expectations — the same ingredients that produced the Iraq catastrophe — all over again .
The entire Bush regime and both political parties are complicit , along with the media and US allies .
According to Baer , the Bush regime has given no consideration to whether Iran ’s response to a US attack might be different than to welcome it as liberation .
What if Iran really were to arm the Iraqi resistance and / or to sink our aircraft carriers ?
How can any government , even one as incompetent , delusional and unaccountable as the Bush regime , initiate war without any thought to the consequences ?
The Bush regime ’s planned war against Iran casts light on the large increase in military armaments that the US is supplying to Israel .
With Iraq in chaos and civil war , an attack on Iran leaves as opposition to Israel only Syria and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon .
Israel cannot finish off the Palestinians until Hezbollah is destroyed .
An Israeli attack on Syria while the US attacks Iran would leave Hezbollah without supplies in the face of a new Israeli attack .
The agenda unfolding before our eyes may be the neoconservative / Israeli / Cheney plan to rid the Middle East of any check to Israeli territorial expansion .
Nicholas Burns said that the $ 30 billion in military aid was not conditional on any Israeli concessions or progress toward resolving the conflict with the Palestinians .
Israel ’s ghettoizing and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian West Bank proceeds apace .
Meanwhile in America , while more money is poured into more war , condemned bridges collapse killing Americans who trusted their government to provide safe infrastructure .
Devastated residents of New Orleans remain unaided .
Financial difficulties deepen for more Americans as falling home prices and jobs lost to offshoring push more Americans into desperate straits .
The US dollar continues to fall as the government ’s war debts build up abroad .
Except for the armaments industry , where is the gain to America in Bush ’s wars ?
Before Bush invaded Afghanistan , the Taliban had stamped out drug production .
The US invasion has brought it back .
On August 22 Bush told the Veterans of Foreign Wars that US troops are the " greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known . "
Tell that to the 650,000 dead Iraqis and the 4 million displaced Iraqis , and the tens of thousands of slaughtered Afghans , and the coming civilian deaths in Iran .
Tell that to all the bombed civilians from Serbia to Africa who are blown to pieces in order that a US president can make a point .
Bush goes far beyond George Orwell ’s " Newspeak " in his novel , 1984 , when Bush equates US hegemony with liberation .
America ’s hegemonic hubris is a sickness .
A country that tolerates a war criminal while he openly plans to attack yet another country is definitely not a light unto the world .

KURTZ : I think the argument that I 've heard Olbermann make in the past about Fox News -- it 's not an argument that I embrace -- is that , because it poses as a news organization and puts out dangerous misinformation --

Let ’s continue our on - again , off - again series about making Rails better .
We ’ve talked about fixing ActiveRecord ‘s awkward handling of attributes , implementing RESTful error handling and using Content Negotiation with Rails .
Today let ’s dive back into ActionView .
This wo n’t make me many friends , but there is n’t a nice way to say this – the internals of ActionView are ugly .
The fundamental problem is that ActionView lacks the right abstraction – in fact , it has no abstraction at all .
Without a guiding design , ActionView descends into a mass of tangled , hard - to - pick apart code that lacks cohesion and has high coupling .
A Better Abstraction
What ’s bizarre about this state of affairs is that the abstraction is easy to see .
What does ActionView do ?
It renders templates .
Do templates changes – you bet !
Rails has three built - in template types ( erb , builder , rjs ) and there are a myriad of 3rd party templates .
So quick – what ’s the abstraction ?
Doh – an AbstractTemplate class of course .
Its API would be something simple like this ( note there might be one or two methods missing , I ’d have to whip up a prototype to be sure ) :
c lass AbstractTemplate def render ( response , options = {} , assigns = { } ) end def template_exists ( template_path , extension = nil ) end end
Implementers could then inherit from the AbstractTemplate class when creating their own custom templates types and override the base functionality as needed .
Sadly , Rails does n’t do this .
Instead we are faced with this ugliness in ActionController : : Base :
module ActionController class
Base def render_text ( text = nil , status = nil , append_response = false ) end def render_javascript ( javascript , status = nil , append_response = true ) end def render_xml ( xml , status = nil ) end def render_json ( json , callback = nil , status = nil ) end def render_nothing ( status = nil ) end end end
Followed by this ugliness in ActionView : : Base :
module ActionView class Base def erb_template_exists ?( template_path ) end def builder_template_exists ?( template_path ) end def javascript_template_exists ?( template_path ) end e nd end
Just looking at the method names should set off alarm bells .
First , the division of labor between ActionController and ActionView is murky – resulting in tight coupling between them and lousy cohesion internally in both classes .
Second , its clear that Rails was n’t designed to support multiple template types and they have been bolted on as ugly warts .
Two Code Paths
As I mentioned above , there are plethora of 3rd party template types .
So how does ActionView supports support them ?
By punting – you register your template type and define a render method – then you are on your own .
Thus there are two separate code paths in ActionView for built - in templates and custom templates .
But what ’s the difference between a built - in template and a custom template ?
Nothing of course .
So why are there two code paths ?
Why ca n’t a custom template type reuse the applicable parts of ActionView ( such as checking to see if a template exists on disk , caching a template , etc. ) .
Finishing Up
Introducing an AbstractTemplate class to ActionView would work wonders .
It would make ActionView more extensible , simplify its interface , improve cohesion , reduce coupling and make the code a whole lot easier to follow and understand .
So here is hoping the Rails core reworks ActionView for Rails 2.0 and expunges the ugliness that exists in it today .
HANOVER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidates pounced on rival Hillary Clinton for her positions on Iraq and Iran in a debate on Wednesday as they sought to undercut her status as the campaign front - runner .
Democratic presidential candidates ( L - R ) U.S. Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , former U.S. Senator John Edwards ( D - NC ) , U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich , ( D - OH ) , and U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) pose for photographers before their debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire September 26 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Lisa Hornak
Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards , a distant third place in most national polls and needing a breakthrough performance , led the attack against Clinton on the campus at Dartmouth College .
With the Democratic left - wing demanding a hasty U.S. timetable out of Iraq , Edwards criticized the New York senator for not ruling out that U.S. troops might engage in some combat missions in Iraq if she were to win the 2008 election .
“ To me that ’s a continuation of the war , ” Edwards said .
“ Combat missions mean that the war is continuing .
I believe the war needs to be brought to an end . ”
Edwards ’ broadside put Clinton on the defensive at a time when she is enjoying a comfortable lead in opinion polls and trying to appear above the fray .
But there was no sign that the debate would prompt a major shake - up in the Democratic field .
“ There may be a continuing counter - terrorism mission , ” she said , while adding that “ the vast majority ” of American troops would be out of Iraq by the end of her prospective first term in 2013 .
The cross -fire on the campus of Dartmouth College came at the first debate of the critical autumn season leading up to the early voting contests in January ahead of the November 2008 election to replace President George W. Bush .
Iraq was a dominant theme of the debate as Democrats seek a way to force Bush to change his war strategy , which may leave as many as 100,000 troops there by the time the next president is inaugurated in January 2009 .
IRAN ’S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD
Iran occupied plenty of attention as well .
Washington accuses Iran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb and supplying weapons to Iraqi guerrillas fighting the U.S. forces .
Tehran denies the charges .
Edwards criticized Clinton for voting earlier in the day in Washington to approve a nonbinding motion calling on the State Department to designate Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard as “ a foreign terrorist organization , ” which Edwards said was a potential first step toward war against Iran .
“ I have no intention of giving George Bush the authority to take the first step on a road to war with Iran , ” Edwards said , pointedly mentioning that two other candidates on stage , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden and Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd , had voted against the measure .
Long - shot candidate Mike Gravel jumped on Clinton as well , saying , “ I am ashamed of you , Hillary , for voting for it . ”
After a loud laugh at the often - comical Gravel , Clinton defended her vote .
She said it would allow the U.S. government to designate the Revolutionary Guard “ as a terrorist organization which gives us the options to be able to impose sanctions on the primary leaders to try to begin to put some teeth into all this talk about dealing with Iran . ”
OBAMA HOLDS HIS PUNCHES
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , in second place in the polls despite leading in fund - raising , held his punches against Clinton .
He reiterated his position that he would engage in direct talks with Iran , a pledge Clinton has said shows Obama is too inexperienced to be president .
“ We ’ve got to talk to our enemies and not just our friends , ” Obama said .
Biden suggested Clinton ’s experience as first lady in the administration of her husband , former President Bill Clinton , when she tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to reform health care , would hamper her effectiveness as a U.S. president .
“ I ’m not suggesting it ’s Hillary ’s fault .
I think it ’s a reality that it ’s more difficult , because there ’s a lot of very good things that come with all the great things that President Clinton did , but there ’s also a lot of the old stuff that comes back , ” Biden said .
As Clinton fixed a chilly stare on him , Biden hurriedly added : “ When I say old stuff , I ’m referring to policy , policy . ”
disabling the timer is quite important , each scan line in the signal must take 63 ( +/- 0.5 ) us , if the interrupt fires during the line generation , it will blow out the timing significantly , I will try to take a picture of what I get when the timer is NOT disabled , then you can compare what you 're getting .
I 'm not too sure how to disable it on the amtega8 , but try using agent_orange 's solution of ' cli ( ) ; ' somewhere in the setup ( ) routine .
with regards to the 75 ohm resistor , I can't be sure how critical it is , the most important thing is that you can generate 4 distinct voltages wrt the tv signal pin .
the voltages that you are aiming for are close to :
sync = 0.0v
black = 0.33
v
gray = 0.66
white 1v
I was able to generate approx :
sync = 0v
black= 0.30
gray = 0.64
white = 0.95
Check your results with a multimeter first , to see what you get .
Good luck !
Oh , on a side note , I can't verify how correct the PAL signal is , ( I do n't have an oscilloscope ) so I only know that this works on the 2 tvs that I have ( which are both pal , but quite new ) .
If anyone has actually got this working , maybe they could post back with their resistor values and geographical location .

Or so says Wells Fargo & Company .
It has announced that it has made the largest equity investment in solar energy in the companyâ€™s history – in Nevada Solar One , a 64 - megawatt Concentrated Solar Power ( CSP ) plant southeast of Las Vegas .
The $ 266 million project developed by Acciona Energy is the largest solar energy facility built in the world in 16 years .
The project is expected to help stabilize electricity costs for residents and businesses in Nevada , where electricity prices have risen more than 50 percent since 2000 .
Nevada Solar
One will provide clean renewable power during peak demand , when electricity prices and demand are highest .
The electricity generated will be purchased by Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company through long - term power purchase agreements at fixed electricity prices .
“ Vast opportunity exists to help our customers and our nation take advantage of clean , renewable energy , ” said Barry Neal , Wells Fargoâ€™s director of Environmental Finance .
“ Our goal is to seize the right opportunities by drawing from our breadth of financing capabilities to deliver solutions that benefit our customers , our communities , our shareholders and our environment . ”
Nevada Solar
Oneâ€™s solar field covers 400 acres and features more than 182,000 parabolic trough - shaped mirror panels that track the sun throughout the day and concentrate solar radiation onto receiver tubes .
This heats a special fluid in the receiver tubes to create steam that drives a conventional steam turbine generator to produce electricity .
The CSP project is provides a utility - scale solution with no greenhouse gas emissions .
The transaction is the first leveraged lease structured financing for a CSP plant in the U.S. Wells Fargo participated as one of three equity investors including an affiliate of Northern Trust and JPMorgan Capital Corporation who underwrote the equity and led the equity investors .
Debt participants include Banco Santander and BBVA of Spain , and CAIXA of Portugal .

From loathing and resisting BitTorrent and the illegal distribution of their shows to encouraging downloading and leaking pilots , TV studios have a come a long way .
The creator of ' Weeds ' is stoked that someone pirated her show .
An unusually large number of pre-air TV shows have been appearing on BitTorrent sites months and , in some cases , several months before their scheduled air dates .
Many of those leaks appear to be inside jobs , and TV executives are starting to realise that leaking shows to BitTorrent can help promote them .
In a recent interview for the Seattle Post , I speculated that it seemed likely that TV executives and writers were purposefully leaking their yet - to - air shows to BitTorrent to build up hype and an audience .
It looks like I was n’t too far off .
An anonymous Warner Brothers Television executive has admitted he helped leak the pilot of “ Pushing Daisies “ , an upcoming TV show .
His reason ?
He wanted to make sure the show “ got out there , ” and wanted to “ help the cause . ”
The executive did n’t upload it himself ; he got his neighbour ’s kid to do it .
And the kid was delighted to , because it pushed up his ratio on some private network .
You might think , as I did , that someone made this story up .
Turns out , the executive used his work e-mail ID ( yep , @warnerbros.com or whatever ) when he contacted Rick Ellis of AllyourTV.com .
When asked about what made him leak the pilot , he replied :
I just thought it was a good idea .
Even though [ … ]
I do n’t have any direct stake in the show , it ’s a really great project .
It ’s tough to describe , though , and while it makes great sense once you ’ve seen it , it ’s one of those shows that will only work if people do tune in at least once .
Which , by the way , is one of the reasons that ABC and Warners are promoting the show in all sorts of venues .
The pilot has been screened at everything from auditions for ABC reality shows to Comic - Con .
We all believe in the show .
And if I can do something that might in some small way helpâ€ ¦I can live with that .
One last thingâ€ ¦some of this is also about building pressure with the network .
I do n’t think anyone here involved with “ Traveler ” was exactly thrilled with the treatment ABC gave the show .
But it did n’t really have any champions inside either company .
And I suppose all of us are hoping that this show gets the support it deserves .
Further evidence of TV studios embracing BitTorrent can be found in an interview with Jenji Kohan , the creator of ‘ Weeds ‘ .
The third season of Weeds was leaked around a month before it was to be aired on TV .
Although another week is left before season three is broadcast to the world , hundreds of thousands of people from around the globe have already downloaded and watched episodes of it .
And what does Kohan think of this ?
She ’s glad her show ’s gaining a larger audience : “ Revenue aside , I do n’t expect to get rich on Weeds , ” she told Advertising Age jubilantly .
“ I ’m excited it ’s out there .
Showtime is great , but it does have a limited audience . ”
‘ Weeds ’ and ‘ Pushing Daises ’ are n’t the most popular of shows .
The first has a relatively small following and the latter has yet to gain one .
But both are mainstream , television shows , not podcasts .
Kevin Rose being ‘ cool ’ with fans torrenting Diggnation a week before it ’s released to non-subscribers and a primetime TV show ’s creator doing the same are two vastly different notions , with the second having a significantly greater impact on traditional broadcast TV .

When I spoke to Harri Hursti this week , he indicated thatvoting machines may be on the ropes again in Great Britain as well .
Atleast a few people in Europe seem to be coming to their senses .
By theway , Nedap voting computers are being marketed in the USA under vendor name " Liberty " wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/Computersniet.nl - Sept. 29 , 2007 Dutch voting computers will be decertified shortly ' We do not trust voting computers ' demanded that every single votewould be retained on its own piece of paper in the polling station .
And that is what will happen from now on .
On September 27 , 2007 the Korthals Altes Committee issued its ' Voting with confidence ' report .
The state secretary for the interior immediately announced that 'Regulation for approval of voting machines 1997 ' will be withdrawn .
As a result all Dutch voting computers will be decertified .
Electionsin the Netherlands will be held using paper ballots and red pencil fora while .
After that , likely using ' vote printers ' and optical scancounting computers .
We , the proponents of verifiable election results , are winning acrossthe globe !
The Netherlands has joined the growing group of countriesand US states that require a paper copy of each vote .
California hasbasically rejected voting computers altogether .
The UK electioncouncil wants to stop all electronic voting pilot projects .
Irelandhas rejected the Dutch voting computers for being too insecure .
Quebecand Italy decided to forego the use of voting computers .
In responseto our research into the Nedap voting computers , Germany has begun toquestion their use as well .
In many countries people are protestingagainst voting computers .

Bosses are really mean these days , or employees are really thin - skinned .
Lawmakers across the country are considering legislation that would give workers grounds to sue their superiors for being , basically , jerks .
Bookstores are stocking bad - boss advice tomes , including “ Snakes in Suits ” and “ Was Your Boss Raised by Wolves ? ”
Today the AFL - CIO will name the worst boss in the country , based on the results of an online contest .
Are relations between workers and management really in such an awful state ?
Maybe .
The ranks of bullying bosses are growing , some experts contend , as short - staffed companies tap managers with lousy people skills .
Others point out that though mean and dimwitted supervisors have been around since work was invented , baby boomers on the cusp of retirement and restless younger employees are more likely to complain or quit than suffer in silence .
It ’s easy to decide against taking the latter tack , thanks to the proliferation of venting websites , among them www.eboss watch.com .

The AFL - CIO , not surprisingly , puts the blame on management ’s shoulders .
Sure , there have always been bullying bosses , said Karen Nussbaum , executive director of the union ’s Working America lobbying arm , but today some of them “ do n’t even have good manners anymore . ”
If that does n’t sound like grounds for a lawsuit , at least four state legislatures are thinking about making it so .
A bill in New Jersey would give an individual the right to seek as much as $ 25,000 in damages if an employer created “ an abusive work environment . ”
Similar measures are pending in New York state , Vermont and Washington state .
In California , a Sacramento - based group called California Healthy Workplace Advocates is working to revive a sue - the - boss bill that died in committee in 2003 .
The bills are short on specifics , such as what exactly would constitute an abusive work environment , and their prospects are far from certain .
The wisdom of giving employees new grounds to sue is debatable , considering the threat of frivolous court - clogging suits and laws at the federal level and in many states that already protect people against , among other things , sexual harassment and discrimination based on gender , race , pregnancy , physical disability and religion .

But New Jersey Assemblywoman Linda Greenstein , a Democrat , said she was committed to seeing the Healthy Workplace Act , which she ’s sponsoring , become law .
People need protection , she said , if they ca n’t afford to quit and therefore “ have to stay and put up with poor treatment . ”
Jumping on the bandwagon , the AFL - CIO launched the My Bad Boss contest , now in it second year , to “ expose what is a growing problem , ” Nussbaum said , and to give workers an opportunity to get their bad - boss experiences “ off their chests . ”
Last year ’s winning entry was “ Dr. X , ” a dentist who took $ 100 out of each employee ’s paycheck for every canceled appointment .
This year ’s contestants -- all anonymous , of course , as they were in 2006 -- tell many horror stories .

One of the hundreds posted is about a lawyer who called the office every morning to give instructions as he brushed his teeth and conducted other business in his bathroom ; another is about a manager who refused to let an employee whose husband had a brain tumor take a day off unless she provided a note from a doctor .
“ Freezing ” in Washington says his office was so cold that the ink in his pen stopped flowing , and his boss told him to use a pencil .
A woman in Connecticut says the owner of the store where she worked invited all the employees to a bridal shower for his assistant and the next day presented them with bills for their share of his gift of a $ 500 china platter .
The contestant “ Momtimesfour ” recounts the day her boss offered to buy everyone in the office lunch and took them to a discount warehouse , where he instructed them to dine on free samples in the grocery section .
“ Melanie ” from Alabama , a cancer patient who lost her hair as a result of chemotherapy , says she overheard her boss making fun of how she looked with a bald pate .
And a pregnant pizzeria worker says her manager ordered her to complete her shift after she had gone into labor .
“ I stayed and waited on customers , ” she says , “ and made pizzas between contractions . ”
This afternoon , after the online votes are counted , the winner of the “ People ’s Choice ” grand prize will be announced and awarded a weeklong condo vacation at one of 500 locations and $ 1,000 for airfare .
And the “ Most Outrageous Story ” grand prize winner will enjoy a week at the Royal Hotel Vegas and $ 500 toward airfare .
Runners - up will receive prizes such as earplugs , for use when a bad boss is yelling , and “ The Very Best of Aretha Franklin ” on CD , featuring her hit song “ Respect . ”

Although a bad - boss contest may be fun for workers , the union , and management and employee specialists around the country , are serious about the boss problem .
This year the Employment Law Alliance , a San Francisco clearinghouse for employment and labor lawyers , conducted a survey of employees across the country , and 44 % said they had worked for an abusive supervisor .
Another poll this year , conducted by Wayne Hochwarter , a business professor at Florida State University , discovered that workers who thought their bosses were abusive reported higher rates of depression , migraines and sleep disorders than those who judged their supervisors reasonable .
Linda Viloria counts herself among the abused .
The San Francisco resident developed high blood pressure after she started working for a boss who yelled at her , she claimed .
“ Employees need some sort of protection against this type of issue , ” she said .

OK , what ’s reasonable ?
Lars Dalgaard has an idea .
The chief executive of San Mateo , Calif. , software firm Success Factors had an awakening a few years ago at another company when he reduced a staffer to tears with his abrasive manner .
Thus was born the Rules of Engagement , posted throughout the office .
“ I will not BCC ( blind copy ) anyone and never talk negatively and destructively behind someone ’s back , ” goes one rule .
The rules are a “ terrific recruiting tool , ” said Stacy Epstein , spokeswoman for Success Factors .
“ It ’s amazing how in an interview so many people will say , ‘ Gosh , I really want to work in this environment . ’ ”
In most cases , there are no posted rules , and job seekers are on their own .
Asher Adelman , who earned his master ’s in business administration at UC Irvine , thought he had it made when he went to work for an Israeli software company .
As it turned out , his boss was prone to cursing and throwing things .
So the annoyed 33 - year - old launched www.ebosswatch.com “ to level the playing field . ”

One of the most insidious effects of the neocon takeover of the Republican Party is that years and years of neocon propaganda from talk radio , neocon publications , the Faux News Channel and elsewhere , seem to have created a large , critical mass of totalitarian - minded , blind followers that comprise a large part of the Republican Party " base . "
The bloodthirsty " evangelicals " are one important example , but some recent events suggest that it is more widespread than that .
There was , for example , the loud booing of Congressman Ron Paul at the GOP " values debate " by hundreds of Republican " evangelicals " when he mentioned the fact that Jesus was known as The Prince of Peace .
At that same debate , as was recently noted on the LewRockwell.com blog , there were loud murmurings from the audience of things like , " Did he ( Ron Paul ) really say that homosexuals had rights ? ! "
It was just unbelievable to some of those Republican " values voters " that anyone would think that homosexuals should have the same constitutional rights as everyone else .
A former undergraduate student of mine , who is now a Ph.D. candidate at a prestigious east coast university , recently emailed me some responses he got when he ventured onto the " Fred Thompson Forum " online and wrote an article there arguing that Thompson is not really a " Ronald Reagan conservative , " as some have been arguing , but just another neocon .
( The pro-war Thompson has been pro-abortion , for example , and has refused to take a pledge not to raise taxes if elected president ) .
The responses to the article completely ignored the substance of the arguments that were made by my former student .
Instead , the " Fredheads , " as this group of Thompson supporters calls themselves , responded with statements like these : " [ Student ’s Name ] = GITMO . "
" You are an international terrorist , hater of freedom and liberty . "
" Homeland Security should also be made aware of his plans to overthrow the United States government . "
" Your ass better be on a plan back to New Delhi . . . or you ’ll be on a one way ticket to Gitmo . "
( The student is an American citizen who has an ethnic European surname and is not from India ) .
Sending critics of Republican politicians to " GITMO " seems to be a major theme of the " Fredheads . "
Browsing the web site , one finds additional comments such as these : " Fight Terrorism : Send Fred Thompson to the White House and Ron Paul to GITMO . "
" Keep the brilliant Bush legacy alive , " and vote for Fred Thompson .
" Anyone touting civil liberties all over the place simply does n’t realize that it ’s a new world after 9/11 . "
This of course is a constant refrain of the talking heads on the Faux News Channel , Rush Limbaugh , and the rest of the neocon electronic megaphone network .
Then there is , " We ca n’t have civil liberties right now because we ’re at war , " and " Civil liberties are Government GRANTED rights .
All your rights come from the state , thus , the state has a right to take them away . "
Hitler and Stalin could not have said it better .
" Liberty is the freedom to taser loudmouth traitors , " said another Fredhead .
Another theme of the Fredheads is that anyone who disagrees with " the brilliant Bush legacy " is a " traitor . "
This of course was the opinion of Lincoln during his regime , which is why his administration imprisoned ( without due process ) tens of thousands of Northern political dissenters .
Not surprisingly , the web site also includes talk of how Abe Lincoln would be a Fredhead if he were alive today .
The Fredhead site is probably a parody , but the only thing that makes parodies work is that they possess a large grain of truth .
All of these things have been said in one form or another by various neocons .
We have no way of knowing how many totalitarian - minded knaves like this have become blind followers of the neocon / GOP crusade for " national greatness " that is on display today in Iraq ( and coming soon to Iran , if they have their way ) .
The predominance of this mindset at the GOP - sponsored " values debate , " and the perpetual refrain of " kill , kill , kill , bomb , bomb , bomb , " that comes from the " evangelicals , " whose numbers are in the millions , suggest that it is a very large number .
Creeping Totalitarianism
In his famous 1944 book , The Road to Serfdom , Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek warned of how creeping totalitarianism could find its way into democratic societies .
First , there must be the wish on the part of political " leaders " to " unite " the entire country behind some plan for " national greatness " or " national glory , " such as the one the " National Greatness Conservatives " ( a phrase coined by Bill Kristol ) have in mind for us .
As the great 19th century economist Frdric Bastiat wrote in his masterpiece , The Law , democracy can be just as dictatorial as genuine dictatorship if it enforces laws that compel national uniformity to a sufficient degree .
Since there is never anything like unanimity of agreement over one plan for the entire society , the " leaders " must gather around them as large a group as possible that would have a uniformity of opinion and the political clout to impose that opinion on the rest of society by force .
There are several necessary characteristics of such a group , Hayek wrote in his chapter entitled " Why the Worst Get on Top . "
First , " if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook , we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and u2018 common ’ instincts and tastes prevail . "
The largest group of people whose values are similar " are the people with low standards , " the " lowest common denominator , " wrote Hayek .
Moreover , if a " numerous group " in a democracy is strong enough politically " to impose their views on the values of life on the rest , it will never be those with highly differentiated tastes — it will be those [ who are ] the least independent , who will be able to put the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals . "
The political leader will also have to recruit many others to " the same simple creed , " whatever it is .
He will succeed by being able " to obtain the support of all the docile and gullible , who have no strong convictions of their own but are prepared to accept a ready - made system of values if it is only drummed into their ears sufficiently loudly and frequently .
It will be those whose vague and imperfectly formed ideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are readily aroused who will thus sell the ranks of the totalitarian party . "
Finally , the " skillful demagogue " will be able to " get people to agree on a negative program — on the hatred of an enemy . . . the common fight against those outside the group , seems to be an essential ingredient " in " the armory of a totalitarian leader . "
In Nazi Germany , for instance , the " enemy , " wrote Hayek , was " the Jew " who " had come to be regarded as the representative of capitalism . . .
German anti-Semitism and anti-capitalism sprang from the same root . . . "
It is not surprising that the self - described " godfather " of neoconservatism , " Irving Kristol , has mocked and ridiculed what he called " the Hayekian notion that we are on the road to serfdom . . . .
Neoconservatives do not feel that kind of alarm of anxiety about the growth of the state . "
( The Weekly Standard , August 25 , 2005 ) .
As long as the neocons are in charge , and kept in power by the masses of Fredheads , Freepers , bloodthirsty " evangelicals " and other primitive and easily - swayed followers , they will continue to destroy what is left of America ’s constitutional republic .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
If good fences make good neighbors , what do bad fences make ?
Inmates -- at least in Rolling Hills Estates .
That ’s what Francisco Linares found out this week , when an L.A. County Superior Court judge sentenced him to six months in jail .
His crime ?
Erecting a 180 - foot - long fence while building his dream home in the horsy hills of the Palos Verdes Peninsula .
Never mind Paris Hilton and her 45 - day sentence for serial probation busting .
Forget about Nicole Richie and her four - day jail term for driving the wrong way on the Ventura Freeway while stoned .
( Note : She served only 82 minutes . )
Advertisement
This must be one dangerous fence , because the 51 - year - old insurance company district manager who says he has never even committed a traffic violation faces a full day in Los Angeles County Jail for every single flawed foot of it .
“ This , ” a stunned Linares said Tuesday , “ is nothing that you should be taken to court for . ”
The city of Rolling Hills Estates believes otherwise .
Two and a half years ago , officials filed misdemeanor charges against Linares , alleging that he had refused to tear down the offending white fence , that he had erected a too - tall retaining wall and that his proud stone columns just do n’t fit in around here .
Advertisement
They gave him time to get the proper permits or tear down the offending structures .
And then they threw the book at the man who says he has spent 142 hours and $ 50,000 in building and defending the fence .
City officials were n’t talking much after Linares ’ sentencing , which he has appealed .
But Roy Beall , the Rolling Hills Estates zoning and code administrator , did read from an official written statement , which outlined the steps the city had taken and rued the outcome of Linares ’ actions : “ Unfortunately , Mr. Linares chose not to comply and his decision has forced the court to act accordingly . ”
Translation : six months behind bars , starting Sept. 10 , unless Linares prevails at a hearing four days before that , which could lead to an appeal .
Advertisement
Linares ’ story began more than a decade ago .
That was when the Cuban expatriate would pile his wife , Milagros , and their three young daughters into the family car and motor through the graceful neighborhoods of the peninsula , dreaming with his wife of someday moving there from Torrance .
At the time , Crystal , now 23 , thought her mother ’s dream of owning a home in Rolling Hills Estates was “ unattainable .
And then when I got to high school , we moved here .
Now we have all these problems .
I think her dream turned into a nightmare . ”
In 1998 , the Linares family bought the nearly one - acre lot on Palos Verdes Drive North .
They tore down the original 3,000 - square - foot , Spanish - style home and replaced it with a French - accented white brick house nearly twice the size .
Advertisement
Then , Linares said , he discovered termites in the white fence that separates his eucalyptus - filled lot from the city bridle trail that borders it .
The city would n’t replace the fence , so he did it himself .
That was when the “ nightmare ” started .
On Oct. 20 , 2004 , the city wrote a letter to Linares stating that “ the new fence has reduced the width of the trail significantly , making it impossible for maintenance vehicles to pass through . ”
A city ultimatum followed : Remove the fence within 14 days or we ’ll do it and charge you for it .
In the last three years that simple letter has grown into a legal case file half a foot thick , including 11 charges of misdemeanors against the city ’s municipal codes and county building codes , as well as allegations of forged planning documents , though no such charges were filed .
Advertisement
Linares has had three lawyers .
It ’s not as if the semirural area has been otherwise immune to squabbles over standards , stories and square footage , as aging residents in one - level ranch houses have begun to give way to young families with McMansion dreams .
Rolling Hills Estates is one of the most affluent communities in Los Angeles County , with a median income of $ 123,900 and a median home price of $ 1,392,000 .
Adelaide Mealy , 81 , has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years , and she said that fights -- among residents as well as those pitting homeowners against the city -- are “ happening all over the hill . ”
The place next to hers is being remodeled and “ is going to be a massive house . ”
The one behind her lot is adding on too , she said , “ but I ca n’t fight them all . ”
Advertisement
“ What you have here is a mixed - use neighborhood , ” is Mealy ’s wry observation on her residential area , “ old people and young people . ”
Superior Court Judge Sandra Thompson saw it a little differently Monday , when she sentenced Linares to jail .
When he had appeared before the court in January , he pleaded no contest to five misdemeanor charges , and the city agreed to drop six others .
He also promised to either get final permits for the fence and other offending structures or tear them down .
And if he did n’t follow through ?
He agreed to go to jail if the judge so ordered .
Advertisement
A raft of legal back - and - forth followed , and more is to come .
But as of Monday , he had received no final permits and the fence still stands .
So he stood before the judge for a six month sentence and a scolding .
“ Imagine my disappointment to find we are no further along in resolving these issues , ” Thompson said .
“ At the rate we ’re going , we ’ll still be talking about this at my retirement party . ”
To the city , the jail term is a standard penalty for a municipal code violation .
To Linares ’ family , still reeling , it is “ bizarre , ” said his attorney , Richard Hamar .
“ It is Orwellian .
It is coming from a very dark place . ”

Dr Paul Kelley , head of Monkseaton High School in Tyneside - the first to join the government 's flagship ' trust school ' scheme - wanted to challenge the legal requirement in all state schools for pupils to take part in a daily act of worship of a broadly Christian nature .
There are only a handful of exceptions at faith schools where the daily worship can be based on a different religion .
He also wanted to change the way that religious education was taught , introducing tuition about a number of world views , some that involved faith and some that did not .
He intended to follow a ' third way ' that neither banished religion from the classroom completely nor had children attending daily worship .
' We wanted a fundamental change in the relationship with the school and the established religion of the country , ' said Kelley , talking about the proposals he put forward towards the end of Tony Blair 's premiership .
' They accepted it would be popular but said it was politically impossible . '
One senior figure at the then Department for Education and Skills , told Kelley that bishops in the House of Lords and ministers would block the plans .
Religion , they added , was ' technically embedded ' in many aspects of education .
' I feel that children have a right to not having a particular point of view , ' said Kelley .
' They should not be promoted to a political party , nor should they to a religion .
The daily act of worship is , I think , inappropriate at school . '
However , he added that moral discussions about religion and world views were appropriate and could take place in lessons .
Although many schools are not classified as being of religious character , if they do not carry out the daily act of worship they lose points during inspections by Ofsted .
Kelley said he wanted to change that .
The details of his meeting with government officials emerged when Kelley was speaking about a book he has written on the subject , entitled Making Minds , What 's Wrong with Education and What Should We Do About It ?
In it Kelley argues against the existence of faith schools .
He praises the Church of England for setting up schools in a time that the government did not offer education to all but says there is no longer a reason to maintain those schools as faith - based .
The schools , says Kelley , ' directly or indirectly influence children into a belief that a particular faith is preferable either to other faiths or to a lack of faith ' .
He adds : ' That is not , in my view , fair to a child and it is not offering them the opportunity to choose freely .
The problem we are left with is a 19th - century architecture of education in a 21st - century environment . '
He argues that there should be no legal requirement for religious education teaching , although he would still teach pupils about different religions .
Kelley said he had not given up on his plans but realised he could not change things by himself .
Instead , he is hoping other schools might join his campaign .
Jim Knight , the Schools Minister , said : ' The majority of schools do not have a religious character , and are not affiliated to any faith group .
But where the local community wants a school of a religious character , the government continues to support them as part of our commitment to enable parents , where possible , to send pupils to schools of their choice .
' All schools , faith and non -faith alike , must teach religious education as part of the basic curriculum .
In maintained schools without a religious character , this will focus on learning about different religions and the role they play in today 's world , not religious instruction . '
A spokesman for the Church of England said : ' If he is arguing for a way for individual schools to opt out of those bits of the act he does not like that is not something we would support .
Either overtly or by default , this country is still a Christian one . '
In a way , I think we all thirst for a new 2D side scrolling Mario adventure .
It ’s some sort of basic human need , along with eating , sleeping and reproduction .
Why , just last week I was about to keel over for want of Mario when , at the last minute , I found the greatest NES game hack of all time , Mario Adventure .
But this is n’t your usual game hack , mind you .
You ’ll find no giant buttocks glued onto Mario ’s forehead , no nude Mushroom Retainers , no Super Tokin ’ Brothers with Luigi replaced by a white Rastafarian with a cannabis leaf for a hat .
Nope , this is a real game — a new game , crafted with care and aplomb using the Super Mario Bros. 3 game engine .
Who executed this masterful feat ?
Look no further than intrepid homebrew coder “ DahrkDaiz , ” who completed the game over the course of sixteen months , sometimes coding on paper during his breaks while working at a fast food restaurant ( check out our interview with Mario Adventure ’s creator here ) .
Now that ’s what I call dedication .
This man deserves serious recognition for the creation of this masterpiece .
So what makes Mario Adventure so superlative in the world of lackluster and usually pointless hacks ?
Because , like I mentioned before , it ’s a completely new game .
There are new graphics , new enemies , new enemy behaviors , new power - ups , new items , new rules , and tons of all - new , completely original levels .
The game even uses SRAM , a la Zelda , ( albeit only emulated at the moment ) to save your progress in the game .
Here ’s a quick overview of the most important changes between Super Mario Bros.
3 and Mario Adventure :
1. Completely new worlds and new levels .
The level design is stellar as far as hacks go , with clever engineering and interactions between blocks , items , power - ups , and enemies .
2. Modified graphics , especially of the environments , backgrounds , coins , blocks , and some enemies .
And they all look professional , like they could be official Nintendo originals .
Notably , a few enemies were edited into shy - guys and shy - guy derivatives ( who originally appeared in Super Mario Bros . 2 ) .
The pipes and the “ ? ” blocks look a lot cooler , with a neat shading effect , and the “ P ” coin - to - brick block has been replaced with a bubbling potion .
3 . At any time , you can switch between your current power up and the last one you collected , which is stored in your “ item box ” at the bottom of the screen .
It ’s just like Super Mario World ’s item box , but switching between powers is instantaneous .
4 . New power -ups .
The following is quoted directly from the text file version of the manual , included with the hack :
Fire Fire Mario :
Fire Fire Mario is just like Fire Mario , except he throws straight fireballs that can go through walls and he can jump higher !
Invisible Mario :
From the Mario 64 era , Invisible Mario can temporarily go behind any background on a level .
Pressing [ Down ] + [ B ] activates his power for a limited time .
While behind a background , Mario is almost invulnerable to attack .
On the plus side , Invisible Mario can stomp many more enemies with this power up !
Magic Mario :
Magic Mario is one tough cookie !
He can take a punch three times before he ’s down !
He throws magic stars that are quite powerful and he can stomp a lot of enemies down !
Kuribo ’s Mario :
Not a new power up , but now Mario can use the shoe in any level and in any situation !
Beating a level does n’t steal the shoe away , looks like Mario better grow some bigger feet !
The new “ Fire Fire Mario ” power up is very common and very attractive .
The fact that you can jump higher is nice , and the straight - shooting fireballs make it much more effective as an enemy killing tool .
In the original Super Mario Bros . 3 I always stayed as “ Raccoon Mario ” and rarely used “ Fire Mario ” at all .
In this game , it ’s mostly the other way around , although the most useful combinations of power - ups to switch between that I ’ve found so far are “ Fire Fire Mario ” and “ Raccoon Mario . ”
There are many occasions where flying and destroying blocks horizontally are useful .
As far as the more fancy power - ups go , I still have n’t played with them much yet — but they sound cool !
5 . The long - lusted after “ Kuribo ’s Mario ” listed above is really worth noting .
You can get and keep “ Kuribo ’s Shoe ” throughout any level of the game .
You can even “ store ” it and “ retrieve ” ( like taking it on and off ) it at any time by pressing Up and B simultaneously .
6 . Collecting coins no longer provides extra men .
Up to 9999 are collected and used to buy chances for items at Toad ’s mushroom houses .
It costs 100 to 300 coins to play .
7 . As far as I can tell , you have an unlimited number of extra Marios .
But you ’re going to need them because this game can get really tough .
The game design rarely takes cheap shots , so the challenges seem legitimate .
The board designer (s ) seemed to want to meddle with your pre-conceived , rotely memorized Mario 3 game - play strategies , forcing you to think quickly and stay on your feet instead of just hopping along mindlessly through the levels .
8 . When you start on any board , it can be randomly sunny , raining , dark , dusk , or snowing .
The graphics ( and physics in the case of snow ) change to match the environmental conditions .
A very impressive and neat graphical touch .
9 . At the end of every level you beat a “ Boom - Boom ” to end it , instead of collecting a card .
10 .
Your goal in the game is to collect a hidden key from each of seven worlds .
Here ’s an excerpt from the manual :
Each world has 1 hidden key in it .
Mario must travel from level to level completing each and keeping an eye for any odd areas that might be a potential door way to a key !
If Mario ca n’t find it , he can always go back later on after receiving a clue after defeating the Koopa Kids .
There are keys , there are locks on the Warp Zone .
Coincidence ?
I think not !
11 . New items .
I have n’t found that many of them myself , so I ’ll quote the manual again :
Mario has a plethora of new items at his disposal !
The Spade and Heart power - ups can give twice the advantage where else the coin power - up can make the Mushroom coin currency rate sky rocket !
The Warp whistle used to take you to the Warp Zone , but what does it do now ?
Just try it and find out for yourself !
Every world has something to offer for the Warp Whistle !
One of the items that I think is mentioned here is sort of a “ money mushroom . ”
Instead of hidden 1 - ups , there are hidden brown mushrooms that give you varying amounts of coins .
The ones I ’ve seen so far usually gave me 50 coins in one ‘ shroom .
The warp whistle seems to take you to a special level on each world which contains power - ups and other bonuses .
Let Me Play it Already !
There ’s even more that ’s new to Mario Adventure than what I listed above , but it feels like too much to list out .
You ’ll just have to play it and find out yourself .
I ’ve saved you the trouble of the IPS patching and all that crud .
Just download the complete , playable game here .
It ’s in a zip file because the text manual is included , which I recommend you read through quickly before you play .
Oh , and you ’ll also need an NES emulator .
Try FCE Ultra ( 0.98.12 ) , which is my current personal favorite .
If you need a NES controller for your PC , look no further than here .
Have fun , and let us know what you think !

Mary Welsby insists she is very much alive
Mary Welsby , of Albrighton , Shropshire , was told her Abbey Isa account had been closed .
She battled for nine weeks to get the money back , but only received the apology after the BBC investigated .
The bank blamed the mistake on an accident and said she would receive the money back plus compensation .
Mrs Welsby said when she visited her branch to investigate , the cashier told her : " I do n't really know how to tell you this Mrs Welsby but according to our records , you are dead .
' My savings '
Mrs Welsby added : " It really was quite a shock to me .
I 'm 77 years old , a widow , and I simply do n't know how I got home from that interview .
" There 's no doubt in my mind what the problem is - they have given my money away .
" I just do n't want this to happen to other people - £ 3,000 may not be much to Abbey , but it 's my savings . "
When Mrs Welsby initially complained in April , the bank phoned her on 11 May to apologise and said it would investigate .
On 25 May she received a standard letter saying an inquiry would take four weeks .
But on 23 June she received another letter from Abbey saying it was not sure it " understood the problem " .
Following investigations by the BBC , the bank issued a further apology and promised compensation .
Banks should not release savings of people believed dead without a death certificate .
Google may turn over information about third - party keyword purchases after being subpoenaed by a recreational flooring company .
Santa Clara University law professor and tech law blogger Eric Goldman alerted readers to the subpoena in a recent blog post last week , warning that this sort of legal action could give businesses access to private information about the advertising habits of competitors .
" Were this to become commonplace , it could completely change the current equilibrium with respect to Google 's AdWords program , " Goldman told The Register .
The subpoena is part of an ongoing District Court case between Rhino Sports and Conner Sport Court International , two companies that sell flooring for athletic facilities , including basketball courts , tennis courts , and baseball batting cages .
In 2002 , Conner - previously known as Sport Court - sued Rhino for trademark infringement , and a year later , Rhino agreed to an injunction restricting it from using the " Sport Court " trademark " on or in connection with the Internet . "
That includes internet domain names , sponsored links , and any HTML code , " such as the title or keyword portions of a metatag . "
Then , in early May of this year , Conner accused Rhino of violating the injunction , claiming that the company had purchased the " sport court " keyword phrase on Google AdWords .
As Eric Goldman pointed out in an earlier post , Rhino had merely purchased the " broad match " terms " court " and " basketball court , " not the specific term " sport court . "
The court rejected Conner 's claim , but Conner has now issued a subpoena to Google , requesting information on " all purchases of ' sport court ' as a keyword , " " associated cost per click calculations , " " estimated ad positions for the keyword , " and " search volume trends for the keyword . "
That includes information about Rhino's AdWords account as well as the accounts of other businesses .
That 's right : Businesses not involved in the case .
Google did not respond to our request for comment , but it seems that the company will comply with the subpoena - if there are n't complaints to the court .
Goldman posted a copy of a letter Google sent to all affected businesses , explaining that information related to their AdWords accounts would be turned over to the District Court unless they file an objection to subpoena .
Now that the NY Times has discontinued their Times Select subscription program and made much more of their 150 + years of content available for anyone to read and link to , let ’s take a look at some of the more notable items that the non-subscriber has been missing .
- Access to the last two years - worth of columns from the NY Times ’ noted Op - Ed columnists , including Thomas Friedman , Maureen Dowd , David Brooks , and Paul Krugman .
- The first mention of the World Wide Web in the Times in February 1993 .
According to the article , the purpose of the web is “ [ to make ] available physicists ’ research from many locations ” .
Also notable are this John Markoff article on the internet being overwhelmed by heavy traffic and growth … in 1993 , and a piece , also by Markoff , on the Mosaic web browser .
- Early report of Lincoln ’s assassination … ” The President Still Alive at Last Accounts ” .
- A report on Custer ’s Last Stand a couple of weeks after the occurance ( I could n’t find anything sooner ) .
The coverage of Native Americans is notable for the racism , both thinly veiled and overt , displayed in the writing , e.g. a story from September 1872 titled The Hostile Savages .
- From the first year of publication , a listing of the principle events of 1851 .
- An article about the confirmation of Einstein ’s theory of gravity by a 1919 expedition led by Arthur Eddington to measure the bending of starlight by the sun during an eclipse .
- A front page report on the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , including a seismograph of the quake which the Times labeled “ EARTHQUAKE’S AUTOGRAPH AS IT WROTE IT 3,000 MILES AWAY ” .
- The first mention of television ( as a concept ) in the Times , from February 1907 .
“ The new ‘ telephotograph ’ invention of Dr. Arthur Korn , Professor of Physics in Munich University , is a distinct step nearer the realization of all this , and he assures us that ‘ television , ’ or seeing by telegraph , is merely a question of a year or two with certain improvements in apparatus . ”
- First mention of Harry Potter .
Before it became a phenomenon , it was just another children ’s book on the fiction best - seller list .
- Some of the output by prolific Times reporter R.W. Apple is available ( after 1981 , pre-1981 ) .
- A report during the First World War of the Germans using mustard gas .
Lots more reporting about WWI is available in the Times archive .
- Not a lot is available from the WWII era , which is a shame .
For instance , I wish this article about the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was available in the Times archive .
Nothing about the moon landing , Kennedy ’s assassination , Watergate , etc. etc. either . :(
- On The Table , Michael Pollan ’s blog from last summer about food soon after the publication of The Omnivore ’s Dilemma .
- Urban Planet , a blog about cities from Steven Johnson , author of The Ghost Map .
- Oddly , The Principles of Uncertainty , an illustrated blog by Maira Kalman is n’t available anymore .
Update : Kalman ’s blog is probably unavailable because it ’s due to be published in book form in October .
( thx , rafia ) Further update : Kalman ’s blog is back online and wonderful .
The culprit was a misconfiguration at the Times ’ end .
( thx , rich )
- Several other previously unavailable blogs are listed here and here .
- It looks like most of the links to old NY Times articles I ( and countless other early bloggers ) posted in the late 90s and early 00s now work .
Tens of thousands of broken links fixed in one pass .
Huzzah !
I ’ll also note that this move by the Times puts them in a much better position to win the Long Bet between Dave Winer and the Times ’ Martin Nisenholtz at the end of this year .
In a Google search of five keywords or phrases representing the top five news stories of 2007 , weblogs will rank higher than the New York Times ’
Web site .
As of the end of 2005 , the Times was not faring very well against blogs .
Update :
One more : a report on the sinking of the Titanic .
A small mention of the sinking was published in the paper the previous day .

SIRAJGANJ , Bangladesh ( Reuters ) -
With floodwater pouring in through their windows , thousands of people affected by South Asia ’s deadly deluge are being forced to share the limited high ground with venomous snakes , surrounded by filthy water .

With almost half of Bangladesh submerged , according to officials , and torrential rains pelting Nepal and India , at least 25 more people have died as a result of the weather since Saturday .
In India , at least 15 people have drowned in the eastern state of Bihar , a disaster management official said , describing it as the worst flood there in 30 years .
Adjacent West Bengal state reported another three deaths .
Torrential rains in Nepal ’s western Gulmi district caused a landslide that smothered seven farm workers .
Snakes driven out of their usual habitat fatally bit nine people in villages in Bangladesh ’s flooded northern district of Pabna in the last few days , the daily New Age reported , while hospitals across the region have reported a rush of patients with diarrhea .
Meanwhile , the lives of millions of other people in the subcontinent are simply on hold as they sit on their roofs , high ground or in relief camps , most relying on their governments to bring food , clean water , clothes and medicine .
About 4,000 people waded up with their livestock onto a river dyke in Sirajganj , 150 km ( 94 miles ) north of Dhaka , the Bangladeshi capital .
Troops nearby were trying to plug a breached embankment .
Anwar Hossain , 25 , said he had been suffering the floods for a week before deciding to evacuate his family .
“ Living there became impossible as the Brahmaputra continued to swell , raising the flood level close to the top of my house , ” he told Reuters , referring to one of more than a dozen rivers in the low - lying country that have burst their banks .
The flooding should subside over the course of the coming week , Bangladesh weather officials said on Sunday .
The seasonal monsoon weather has damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings , drowned swathes of crops , closed schools and offices , blocked roads , disrupted flights and knocked out power and telephone lines .
Around a thousand people have been killed because of the region ’s torrential rains so far this year , according to official reports , in what is an annual occurrence during the June - September rainy season .

The explosion shook buildings several kilometres away
There were no reports of deaths or injuries and officials said they did not suspect an act of terrorism .
A spokesman for the local subsidiary of the gas company Gazprom said supplies to Russian and foreign customers would not be disrupted .
The main pipeline for Russian gas lies well to the south of the blast , but a pipe supplying Finland is nearby .
Witnesses said the massive explosion , at just after midnight on Wednesday ( 2000 GMT ) in St Petersburg 's northern suburbs , shook buildings several kilometres away .
There was a traffic jam as hundreds of frightened residents fled the area but AFP news agency said the fire was put out after two hours .
SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 15 — Three federal appeals court judges hearing challenges to the National Security Agency ’s surveillance programs appeared skeptical of and sometimes hostile to the Bush administration ’s central argument Wednesday : that national security concerns require that the lawsuits be dismissed .
“ Is it the government ’s position that when our country is engaged in a war that the power of the executive when it comes to wiretapping is unchecked ? ” Judge Harry Pregerson asked a government lawyer .
His tone was one of incredulity and frustration .
Gregory G. Garre , a deputy solicitor general representing the administration , replied that the courts had a role , though a limited one , in assessing the government ’s assertion of the so - called state secrets privilege , which can require the dismissal of suits that could endanger national security .
Judges , he said , must give executive branch determinations “ utmost deference . ”
“ Litigating this action could result in exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States , ” Mr. Garre said , referring to the assessment of intelligence officials .
Scott McCausland , a convicted ex-administrator of the EliteTorrents BitTorrent tracker is going back to court to fight for his right to use Ubuntu GNU / Linux while he is home confined .
The US government is forcing him to use Windows , because that 's the only OS their monitoring software can run on .
September last year Scott pleaded guilty to ‘ conspiracy to commit copyright infringement ’ and ‘ criminal copyright infringement ’ for uploading ‘ Star Wars : Episode III ’ onto the internet hours before the theatrical release .
Scott was later sentenced five months in prison , followed by five months of home confinement .
After his release from prison Scott was told by his Probation Officer that he has to install Windows so that the government can monitor his online activities .
A cruel punishment for someone who ’s used to Ubuntu GNU / Linux , and Scott has now decided to fight this decision in court .
“ My lawyer is filing a motion to go back in front of the judge and find out what is next to happen , ” Scott writes on his blog “ It will either end in one of two ways : First , he could tell me to just suck it up and install windows , or he could say that no where in the Computer Monitoring Guidelines does it say that I have to use Windows , and it is the Probation Offices responsibility to be the Cyber Police and support all possible options . ”
The court will now have to decide whether he can be forced by the US Government to use Windows .
In the meantime , he is allowed to keep Ubuntu installed which means his online activities wo n’t be monitored .
Scott told TorrentFreak earlier : “ I think that this whole situation is just one more way that they can impose their will onto me .
It is n’t the fact that I have to be monitored that bothers me , it is the fact that I have restructure my life ( different OS , different software on that OS ) and that they would require ( force ) me to purchase software while I a currently unemployed and relatively unemployable with the 2 felonies that they gave me . ”
Not all convicts like to use Windows , let ’s hope this case will motivate the US government to develop multi-platform monitoring software .
It ca n’t be that hard can it ?
From the Cato Institute blog :
People who go to dangerous places â€¦ shouldnâ€™t expect to be rescued from danger at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer .
Absolutely .
We should end the American taxpayers ’ never - ending rescue of Israel immediately .
Oh , wait .
That post is n’t about U.S. aid to Israelâ€¦ it ’s about aid to American taxpayers who are being bombed by Israel .
John Simpson has reported from around 30 war zones
The explosion was just close by .
The windows of my hotel billowed inwards like sails in a storm , and the walls shuddered .
A pause , then the alarms and sirens started up all round .
My camera team and I got there quickly .
The stench of high explosive still hung over everything .
The screaming had mostly stopped , and the rescue workers were dealing with the still - living and collecting up bits of bodies .
The police were starting to take out their frustration and anger on the photographers .
This was in Kabul just the other day but I have seen these things dozens and dozens of times during my career .
Shock of new life
I have never been a great one for the kind of reporting that tells you how the journalist feels when something terrible happens .
To see the miracle of other people 's lives snuffed out wantonly on the streets of Baghdad or Kabul ... seems to me nothing short of blasphemy
It seems to me that we need reporters to be crisp and accurate and unexcitable , like ambulance crews .
You certainly do not want an ambulance - man leaning over you and telling you how he feels about your injuries .
You just want him to say they will get you sorted out in no time flat .
But in Kabul the other day , and in Baghdad a couple of weeks earlier , I could not help noticing a change within myself .
I tried to find out dispassionately what had happened , of course , but when I looked at the bodies on their stretchers and the injured moaning in pain I felt a new kind of anger .
I knew immediately what it was all about .
Last year , after four miscarriages over a period of some years and virtually giving up all hope of having a baby , my wife and I had a son : a healthy , active , jolly little boy we have named Rafe ( short for Ranulph ) .
With six billion people on earth , having a child is scarcely a rarity .
But in our case it was so unexpected , so gratifying , that Rafe seems to us like a miracle .
Gut anger
I already had two daughters by my first marriage and have always , fortunately , been close to them : even more so , now that we all - weirdly - have children of the same sort of age .
John Simpson has reported on both Gulf wars
But I confess that when my daughters were young I was not so aware of their uniqueness : everyone of my age seemed to have children then .
I understand things better now .
And to see the miracle of other people 's lives snuffed out wantonly on the streets of Baghdad or Kabul , or London for that matter , for some scarcely understood political or religious motive , seems to me nothing short of blasphemy .
I do not just loathe the stench of high explosive , I have come to loathe the attitudes of people who use high explosive for their own purposes : insurgents , terrorists , the intelligence services of a dozen countries , governments which target towns and cities and always have a ready apology when they kill the wrong people .
High explosive means hospitals with blood on the walls and corridors , and ordinary people like you and me , lying on the floor or on a gurney , ears ringing with the noise of the explosion , nostrils filled with the stench of it still .
The screams of others who are worse hurt than us .
The fear and despair of the small number of doctors who have to deal with so many life - or - death cases , and know that they are condemning many of them to a slow , painful death .
" The armed struggle , " said an African resistance song from the 1980s , " is an act of love . "
Try explaining that to the people lying in the hospital corridors .
Everybody hurts
The idea that some civilians are decent and righteous , while others deserve everything they get , or else should not have been in the way , seems to me to be intolerable .
I hope I never did think that attacks on civilians - any civilians - were justified but now I know for certain they are not .
Having been through the first and second Gulf Wars , and watched the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the Nato bombing of Belgrade in 1999 , I do not really care any longer what the cause is .
It is the civilians on the receiving - end who matter .
I am sorry if this sounds pious or sentimental .
I do not mean it to be .
But I have finally understood something , through the blessing of having another child late on .
It is that life itself is immensely valuable .
Not just the lives of people who think and look and maybe worship like you and me , people who are attractive or well - educated or rich , people who are the right type of Christian or the right type of Muslim .
All lives .
I realise this is terribly sententious : the moral equivalent of a motto from a Christmas cracker .
Still , just because something is obvious does not automatically mean it is totally lacking in value .
I am certainly not going to stop going to the kind of places where these things happen .
But , at the grand old age of 62 , my reaction to them has changed .
The fact is , my time reporting on violence and bombings in places like Baghdad and Kabul has shown me one essential thing : that the lives of the poor , the stupid , the old , the ugly , are no less precious to them and to the people around them , than the life of my little son Rafe is precious to me .
The Colombian government says that it will likely seek the extradition of eight unnamed people affiliated with the US banana giant Chiquita Brands International for their alleged involvement in the company 's payments to and arms trafficking with a violent right - wing paramilitary group .
The Chicago Tribune reported on Thursday that Colombia 's chief federal prosecutor , Mario Iguaran , has formally requested from the US Justice Department documents relating to Chiquita 's payment of $ 1.7 million to the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ( known as the AUC , by its Spanish initials ) a group that the United States labels a terrorist organization .
Chiquita pleaded guilty Monday in US federal court to making payments to the AUC , and agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine , payable over five years .
As part of the plea agreement , the US government will not publicly identify the senior Chiquita executives who approved the illegal payments .
Speaking in Bogotá , Mr. Iguaran denied Chiquita 's claims that the payments were made under duress .
" The relationship was not one of the extortionist and the extorted but a criminal relationship , " Iguaran told a handful of foreign correspondents in an interview .
" It 's a much bigger , more macabre plan , " he added .
" Who would n't know what an illegal armed group like the AUC does . . . by exterminating and annihilating its enemies , " Iguaran said .
" When you pay a group like this you are conscious of what they are doing . "
The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that Mr. Iguaran said in an interview with a Colombian radio station that he will demand that the United States hand over the eight suspects , whose identities have not been disclosed by the US government .
" They must be judged in Colombia , " Iguaran said .
According to the US Department of Justice , Chiquita began making payments to the AUC in 1997 through its Colombian shipping operation , Banadex .
The payments began when the AUC 's then - leader , Carlos Castaño , met with a senior Banadex executive and implied that failure to make payments would result in physical harm to the company 's workers and property .
The United States designated the AUC a foreign terrorist organization on September 10 , 2001 .
Despite warnings from lawyers who advised the company to leave Colombia , Chiquita continued to pay the group .
In April 2003 , the company 's board of directors learned of the payments , who later that month confessed to the Department of Justice , who told Chiquita to stop paying .
Nevertheless , the payments continued through February 2004 .
Additionally , according to a report by the Organization of American States , in 2001 Banadex helped divert 3,000 Nicaraguan AK - 47 rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition to the AUC .
Chiquita sold Banadex , its most profitable operation , to a Colombian buyer in June 2004 .
The news comes in the midst of a major political scandal in Colombia that has linked many members of the country 's political leadership to right - wing death squads .
Adam Isacson , an analyst at the Center for International Policy , a human rights advocacy group , sees Colombia 's extradition request as a political move to burnish Bogotá 's image domestically .
He writes :
The call for Chiquita executives ' extradition also taps into a commonly felt frustration among Colombians .
Many see their government handing over Colombian citizens to face long jail sentences in the United States , but believe that U.S. citizens accused of trafficking drugs or supporting armed groups in Colombia - including rogue U.S. military personnel who have dealt in drugs or weapons - get slaps on the wrist , such as fines or a few months in prison .
Either way , if the Colombian government wishes to begin punishing foreign executives whose corporations have paid " protection money " to illegal armed groups , it is within its rights to do so - but it may find itself extraditing a lot of people .
Such payments are widely believed to have been commonplace for decades .
Journalist Amy Goodman , however , says that Colombian authorities have every right to single out Chiquita , formerly known as United Fruit .
In her syndicated column she cites the company 's history of right - wing violence in Latin America , which includes helping to orchestrate the 1954 overthrow of Guatemala 's democratically elected president and the 1928 massacre of trade unionists in northwestern Colombia .
A $ 25 - million fine to a multibillion - dollar corporation like Chiquita is a mere slap on the wrist , the cost of doing business .
Presidents like George W. Bush and Uribe , businessmen first , while squabbling over extraditions , would never lose track of their overarching shared goal of a stridently pro-corporate , military - supported so - called free - trade regime .
...
That next organic , fair - trade banana you buy just might save a life .
The online magazine Slate points out that Chiquita pleaded guilty to the very same crime for which John Walker Lindh , the so - called American Taliban , is serving a 20 - year sentence .
Shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. rose six cents overnight to open Thursday at $ 13.92 on the New York Stock Exchange .

Ribbands Explosives has the solution !
Say hello to Bethny Libsock .
She is 36 years old , lives alone , works and has a virtually spotless driving record .
Like most of us , she has the right to vote , drink and freely associate with whomever .
But when Libsock , who has a mild mental disability , informed her social worker and a service provider that she had fallen in love and planned to marry , Sherburne County officials assumed the role of the strongly disapproving parent .
It moved in court to block the marriage as well as have a judge review the fitness of Libsock ’s legal guardian , who is her mother and a former county foster parent .
It also raised the possibility that both the mother and groom - to - be could face criminal charges if the marriage took place .
The county ’s decision to meddle into this affair of the heart touched off an intriguing , nearly yearlong court battle that pitted the civil and human rights of a mentally disabled person against the government ’s stated interest in protecting a vulnerable adult – one with the estimated mental capabilities of a 12 - year - old – from perceived or potential harm .
In the end , does Bethny Libsock have the inherent right to marry , regardless of her disability or whether the suitor turns out to be Mr. Right or a creep ?
And does the government have any authority to stop it from taking place ?
Alas , the case ’s somewhat anti-climactic ending never really provided answers .
“ The truth of the matter is that in this area , there are n’t a lot of black or white answers , ” said Barnett Rosenfield , a lawyer for the Minnesota Disability Law Center .
Still , the county , which has provided and funded limited services for Libsock for nearly 18 years , has taken a lambasting from people ranging from Libsock ’s parents and circle of friends to a state watchdog group that monitored the case .
“ When a person with a disability asks government for help with an aspect of their life , they do not expect government to take over all aspects of their life , ” said Roberta Opheim , the state ’s ombudsman for mental health and developmental disabilities .
“ When parties disagree and government brings all of its resources to bear against the individual , it risks becoming the abuser .
“ Having the government tell a person with a developmental disability that they can only date or marry another developmentally disabled person appears to me to be abusive . ”
Sherburne County Attorney Kathleen
Heaney strongly disagrees and defends her office ’s decision .
“ The issue that we were faced with was not whether a person should marry , but the statutory issue of whether an individual had the capacity to marry , ” Heaney wrote in a prepared statement .
“ ( Bethny ) had been appointed a guardian / conservator because she ‘ lacked sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible personal decisions . ’
The professionals brought this issue forward .
After an analysis based upon the facts and the law , my duty is to inform the court . ”
Lawyers on both sides agree on one thing :
They ’ve never seen a case quite like it before .
THE RELATIONSHIP
This detoured march to court instead of the altar began last summer after Libsock ’s social worker of six years , Pat Kuehn , got wind of Libsock ’s relationship with a 55 - year - old , thrice - divorced former Green Beret she met while visiting her parents in 2005 at their retirement home in Arizona .
At the time , Bethny Libsock received about five hours daily of supported living services .
Judged to have an IQ of 67 , Libsock has difficulty reading and handling finances .
“ Beth had had friends before , but she really took to him , and he was gracious , gentle and very kind with her , ” said Betty Libsock , Bethny ’s mother .
“ I had never seen Beth so happy , with such joy . ”
The relationship continued by phone after Bethny Libsock returned to Minnesota .
Her parents had several “ deep ” conversations with the man about his intent toward their daughter .
“ Like most parents you have doubts , and this was not the man that I would have chosen because he was 20 years older and divorced , ” said Betty Libsock , who also operated a treatment group home and a crisis nursery .
“ But I told her to follow her heart and not rush into anything .
She said that she wo n’t marry unless he ’s a Christian and puts the Lord first . ”
THE OFFICIAL OBJECTIONS
Where the Libsocks saw love and happiness , Kuehn and others saw red flags .
Kuehn , who now works for Ramsey County ’s human services division , expressed concerns about the man ’s past marriages and his age , and that he was a normal , functioning male , according to court documents .
She shared those concerns with Dr. Jean Rafferty , Bethny Libsock ’s therapist , and Tracy Harris , an assistant Sherburne County prosecutor .
A meeting was held Aug. 15 , 2006 , at Rafferty ’s office in Monticello , where Libsock has lived for several years .
“ We walk in there and the first thing they tell us is that the relationship has to be terminated immediately – no ‘ hello , ’ no ‘ how are you , ’ ” recalled Bethny ’s father , Bob Libsock .
“ We were stunned . ”
Rafferty , according to court papers , told the Libsocks that “ she has worked with sexual offenders in the past and reviewed with them the possibility that ( Bethny ’s fiance ) may be ‘ grooming ’ them and Beth , using religion as a tool . ”
During the meeting , Kuehn handed Bethny Libsock two sheets of paper .
One of them contained the statute on criminal neglect involving “ a caregiver or operator who intentionally neglects a vulnerable adult or knowingly permits conditions to exist that result in the abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult . ”
The other centered on third - degree criminal sexual conduct involving an offender who knowingly has sexual intercourse with someone who is “ mentally impaired , mentally incapacitated , or physically helpless . ”
“ It was like she hit me with a 2 - by - 4 , ” said Betty Libsock .
The court battle began in earnest after the Libsocks refused to voluntarily halt the marriage plans .
“ All are concerned for Beth ’s safety and risk of harm , ” Kuehn wrote in a letter to the court suggesting it stop the “ romantic relationship ” and perhaps replace Betty Libsock as her daughter ’s guardian .
THE COURT DEBATE
In court , the county argued that Bethny Libsock was at risk of harm and basically lacked the mental capacity to enter into marriage .
It produced , among other documents , a 1997 evaluation concluding that Libsock functioned “ at the level of a 5 - year - old in the area of communication , at the level of a 14 - year - old in the area of daily living skills , and at the level of a 10 - year - old in the area of socialization . ”
Lawyers for Libsock and her parents presented a radically different picture .
It was the profile of a middle - aged woman who has been living independently for more than a decade , has worked eight consecutive years at the Cub Foods store in Monticello , maintains a circle of friends and enjoys an active life that includes church , sports and taking an elderly neighbor grocery shopping .
She and her fiance also underwent pastoral and marriage counseling several times before and after the court proceedings began .
A therapist found that Libsock , contrary to county assertions , “ has a basic understanding of marriage and sexuality and … functions above her cognitive ability level in many areas in her life . ”
The Minnesota Disability Law Center also chimed in .
“ In this case , it appears as though the guardian has been particularly conscientious in balancing the need to protect Ms. Libsock from any reasonable threat of harm with the concomitant need to assure Ms. Libsock ’s basic right to make choices of her own free will – including the choice of whom to date , ” the group wrote to Sherburne County District Judge Robert Varco .
Perhaps the surprise here was that the social workers and county officials never called , questioned , investigated or apparently conducted a criminal background check on Libsock ’s fiance .
Her parents said they did on their own and found nothing .
The case took a significant turn earlier this year when the Libsocks pulled the plug on county services for their daughter .
The county argued it still had standing , but Varco ruled otherwise in late June after sitting down with Bethny and others to make sure the termination of services would not adversely harm her .
“ He found her to be coherent and quite articulate in her wishes , ” recalled her lawyer , Thomas Richards .
“ She presented herself very well . ”
THE RIGHT TO DECIDE
The county was out of the picture , but in the end , they indirectly got their wish .
Libsock ’s engagement fizzled by mutual agreement shortly before the case was dismissed .
Libsock and her parents believe the legal wrangling played a role in the eventual break - up .
Libsock says she plans to personally return the engagement ring to her former fiance when she visits her parents in Arizona during the coming holiday season .
“ He was very kind , ” Libsock told me last week .
“ He left a message on my machine saying that he was sorry that it all happened . ”
Her parents , meanwhile , spent more than $ 10,000 on legal fees and also were forced to remain in Minnesota for eight months because of the court proceedings .
“ Our daughter has been a great joy to us in our lives and we are very proud of her high moral living standards and her accomplishments , ” Betty Libsock wrote to the judge .
“ We refuse to allow the negativity of this court action to diminish Beth ’s achievements or future happiness . ”
The wedding was supposed to take place Sept. 1 . Because of it , Libsock gave up her position as an alternate member of a national Special Olympics basketball team that recently traveled to China .
I ’m no expert on these matters , but it seems to me that , given that nearly half of all marriages end in divorce , perhaps there ’s an argument to be made that many of us also lack the mental capacity to truly understand commitment .
Libsock ’s Special Olympics coach , Darlene Nichols , perhaps best summed up the bottom line in this case .
“ It is my opinion that , whenever possible , it is best to leave decisions related to the well - being of an individual up to the family rather than to a government agency , ” Nichols wrote in a letter to the judge .
“ Beth deserves all the happiness she can possibly have .
If that includes falling in love and being loved , who has the right to decide that for her ? ”

Before and after ... a collapsed and deserted honeybee colony A virus has emerged as a strong suspect in the hunt for the mystery disease killing off North American honeybees .
Genetic research showed that Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ( IAPV ) turned up regularly in hives affected by Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) .
Over the last three years , between 50 % and 90 % of commercial bee colonies in the US have been affected by CCD .
The hives are transported around the country to pollinate important crops , notably to California for almonds .
The state produces about 80 % of the world 's almonds in an industry worth $ 2.5 bn per year .
" This really highlights the value of pollinators , " said Jeff Pettis , research leader of the US government 's Bee Research Laboratory .
We 're unlikely to come up with a treatment for viruses in bees
Jeff Pettis
" We 're operating under a limited number of colonies - we had five million in the 1950s , now we have half of that number . "
Dr Pettis is one of the CCD research team that reports its initial findings in the journal Science .
Genetic trawl
The honeybee decline can be traced back at least 20 years , and the introduction of the parasitic varroa mite is one of the principal causes .
But in 2004 , beekeepers began seeing and reporting a new and serious phenomenon , in which entire colonies would desert their hives , leaving behind their brood and stocks of food - a syndrome that was later labelled Colony Collapse Disorder .
Vales of the vanishing bees Theories on what is causing it have ranged from mobile phone radiation to pesticides , from genetically modified crops to climate change .
Disease remained a strong contender though , particularly in the light of the known impact of mites such as the varroa .
And genetics offered the opportunity to analyse what organisms were living with and on the bees .
" The genome of the honeybee had just been completed , " noted Diana Cox -Foster , an entomologist from Penn State University .
" So it was possible to do the ( genetic ) sequencing and then eliminate the genetic material of the bees . "
The scientists ' trawl revealed a diverse cargo even in healthy colonies .
Eight types of bacteria appeared to be present in all bees , suggesting they perform some function useful to their hosts .
The researchers also found genes from parasites , fungi , and viruses , in both healthy hives and in those which had undergone collapse .
But IAPV only appeared in samples from CCD populations .
Prime suspect " This virus appears to be strongly associated with CCD , " commented Dr Cox - Foster , " but whether it 's the causative agent or just a very good marker ( of the syndrome ) is the next question we need to address . "
And if it is a cause , it might not be the only one .
" I still believe that multiple factors are involved in CCD , " said Jeff Pettis , " and what we need to do is look at combinations such as parasites , stress and nutrition ( together with the virus ) . "
Collapse of the bee industry would be grave for US agriculture Meanwhile , theories connected with mobile phones , climate change and GM crops can probably be discounted , the researcher suggested .
As its name would suggest , IAPV was first identified in Israel , but the symptoms it produces in bees there are quite different .
Whether this is down to a small genetic difference in the virus between continents , or whether IAPV is acting in concert with different environmental factors , is an open question .
Also open is the question of how the virus arrived in the US .
One finger of suspicion points to Australia , from where the US began importing honeybees in 2004 - the very year that CCD appeared in US hives .
The researchers found IAPV in Australian bees , and they are now planning to go back through historical US samples to see if the Antipodean imports really were the first carriers .
If they were , the US might consider closing its borders to Australian bees .
If IAPV does turn out to be a major factor causing CCD , there may be little that scientists or beekeepers can do about it .
" We 're unlikely to come up with a treatment for viruses in bees , " said Dr Pettis , " and so beekeepers are likely just to have to keep the other things that might affect CCD , such as mites , under control . "
With commercial honeybees worth an estimated $ 14bn to US agriculture , the political pressure on scientists to come up with some answers is considerable .

Last winter , the New York City Department of Health released figures that told a surprising story : New Yorkers are living longer than ever , and longer than most people in the country .
A New Yorker born in 2004 can now expect to live 78.6 years , nine months longer than the average American will .
What ’s more , our life expectancy is increasing at a rate faster than that of most of the rest of the country .
Since 1990 , the average American has added only about two and a half years to his life , while we in New York have added 6.2 years to ours .
In the year 2004 alone , our life expectancy shot up by five months — a stunning leap , because American life spans normally increase by only a month or two each year .
When these figures came out , urban - health experts were impressed and slightly dazed .
It turns out the conventional wisdom is wrong :
The city , it seems , wo n’t kill you .
Quite the opposite .
Not only are we the safest big city in America , but we are , by this measure at least , the healthiest .
The “ average life expectancy ” of a city is a statistically curious number .
It ’s not really a prediction about how long you ’re going to live .
It ’s an average of how long everyone here lives — and thus it forms a good barometer of the overall health of the city .
In particular , a city ’s average life span is sensitive to the rates at which people die too young .
Since the average New York life expectancy is now 78.6 years , anytime someone dies younger than that , it drags the city ’s overall average down slightly .
The math works like this .
Imagine that one man dies of AIDS at age 25 .
Since he was statistically supposed to live to 78.6 years , he ’s died about 50 years too early , so he shaves 50 years off the city ’s overall pool of life .
If one Wall Street guy collapses of a heart attack at age 65 , he shaves only ten years off .
You ’d have to have five Wall Streeters die at that age to equal the impact of one AIDS victim .
By the same logic , one infant ’s dying during childbirth — 77.8 years too early — is equal to ten people ’s succumbing to lung cancer at age 70 .
It is a very weird form of horse trading .
The more you ’re able to prevent young people — folks in their twenties and thirties — from dying , the more rapidly you boost a city ’s overall life expectancy .
And this is precisely what the city has done , through a combination of smart public policy and sheer luck .
All the boons of the nineties — the aggressive policing , the dramatic drop in crime , the renaissance of the city ’s parks and street life , the freakish infusion of boom - time wealth — played a part .
Take the miraculous evaporation of the homicide rate .
In 1990 , a stunning 2,272 New Yorkers were murdered ; in 2005 , that number dropped to 579 .
Since a majority of those being killed were younger men , the reduced murder rate alone added tens of thousands of years to New York ’s life - expectancy pool .
Another big drop was in HIV mortality rates .
In 1994 , deaths from AIDS peaked at over 7,100 , but the arrival of better drugs and health care began to whittle that number by 80 percent — so in 2005 , only 1,419 died of AIDS .
Again , the majority of the lives saved here were those of younger men , resulting in a disproportionately big upward leap in our city ’s life span .
In 1989 , the infant - mortality rate was 13.3 babies per 1,000 , and by 2004 , it had been halved , to 6.1 , both because medical treatment improved and because alcohol and drug addictions eased .
To top it off , drug - related deaths , another arena with disproportionately younger victims , tapered off , too .
Homicide , AIDS , and drugs are characteristically New York ways to die young , of course , so it ’s no surprise that when we sharply decreased the fatalities they caused , we caught up with the rest of the country .
But here ’s the thing :
It ’s not just that we ’ve conquered these urban blights .
Cancer and cardiac arrest are down , too .
The number of people in the city dying from heart disease has dropped by a third in the last twenty years , and cancer rates have slid by nearly a fifth .
And again in these cases , New York is getting healthier faster than the rest of the U.S .
In essence , there is a health gap emerging between our massive metropolis and the rest of the country — some X factor that ’s improving our health in subtle , everyday ways .
In fact , a back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that once you take out those uniquely New York ways to die — AIDS , homicide , etc. — we ’ve still added at least 200,000 extra years onto the city ’s life - expectancy tables since 1980 , making crucial advances in the same health areas the rest of the country struggles with .
Like many New Yorkers , I ’d moved here with some trepidation — always figuring that the stress , pollution , and 60 - hour workweeks would knock about five years off my life .
I was wrong — precisely wrong .
But where , exactly , is our excess life coming from ?

I take this question to Thomas Frieden , New York ’s commissioner of public health .
Frieden is a wonk ’s wonk — a handsome , energetic doctor who has gained a nationwide reputation for his aggressive effort to push New York ’s average - life - expectancy figure ever higher .
The smoking ban of 2003 ?
The trans - fat ban of last year ?
You can thank Frieden for both .
These measures have already begun to lengthen life spans in the city .
The smoking ban had an immediate effect :
The number of deaths attributable to smoking has decreased from 8,960 in 2001 to 8,096 in 2005 , a drop of 10 percent .
Lung - cancer rates should begin to see the same effect a few decades from now , since it takes longer for the body to repair smoking - related lung damage .
But even Frieden admits that public policy can’t account for all the gains .
When I ask what the X factor is — where the “ excess life ” is coming from — Frieden goes over to his desk and returns with a clear plastic statuette .
It ’s from the American Podiatric Medical Association and Prevention magazine : BEST WALKING CITY , 2006 .
“ We ’ve won it a couple of years in a row , ” he tells me with a grin .
He ’s got a bunch of them kicking around .
Walking ?
This is n’t quite as facile an explanation as it sounds .
Scientists who study urban health argue that it ’s not just that we walk more — it ’s the way we walk that has a surprising spillover effect on life spans .
Researchers have long known that people here walked fast — far faster than anyone else in the country .
Indeed , the easiest way to tell a New Yorker from an out - of - towner is by walking speed :
The natives blast down the sidewalk at blitzkrieg pace , and the visitors mosey along like pack mules .
Eleanor Simonsick , a Baltimore - based epidemiologist , knew that regular walking is a powerful way to maintain your health .
But she began to wonder , a question very germane to us in New York :
Does the speed at which you walk also affect your health ?
Researchers have long known New Yorkers walk faster than anyone else in the country .
But epidemiologist Simonsick wondered , does walking speed affect health ?
She decided to conduct an experiment to find out .
She and a group of scientists assembled 3,075 seniors in their seventies and asked them to traverse a 400 - meter course , walking as fast as they could .
They monitored their subjects ’ health over the next six years , during which time 430 of the geriatrics died and many more fell ill .
When Simonsick crunched the data , she found that the ones who were dying and getting sick were the ones who walked the slowest .
For every minute longer it took someone to complete the 400 - meter walk , he had a 29 percent higher chance of mortality and a 52 percent greater chance of being disabled .
People who walk faster live longer — and enjoy better health in their later years .
“ Walking speed absolutely reflects health status , ” Simonsick says .
So when you irritatedly blow past a trio of ambling visitors from Ohio or Iowa on the subway platform , you ’re not just being an obnoxious New Yorker .
You ’re demonstrating that you ’re going to outlive them — and enjoy better health while they slowly degrade .
The thing is , as Simonsick points out , New York is literally designed to force people to walk , to climb stairs — and to do it quickly .
Driving in the city is maddening , pushing us onto the sidewalks and up and down the stairs to the subways .
What ’s more , our social contract dictates that you should move your ass when you ’re on the sidewalk , so as not to annoy your fellow walkers .
( A recent ranking of cities found that New York has the fastest pedestrians in the country . )
As Simonsick sees it , the very structure of the city coerces us to exercise far more than people elsewhere in the U.S. , in a way that is strongly correlated with a far - better life expectancy .
Every city block doubles as a racewalking track , every subway station , a StairMaster .
Seen this way , the whole city looks like a massive exercise machine dedicated to improving our health while we run errands .
This idea of the city as a health club is fairly revolutionary .
Back in the beginning of the industrial revolution , cities were regarded , quite correctly , as lethal places to live .
London and other newly ballooning industrial centers did not yet have sanitary or pollution laws , and the sudden influx of crammed - together citizens — living cheek by jowl with smoke - belching factories downtown — produced spectacular outbreaks of disease .
Public - health experts somberly wrote about an “ urban health penalty ” — the idea that cities were dark , satanic mills that inherently cut us down in the prime of life .
In the first decades of the twentieth century , cities began to clean up their acts drastically , when sanitation standards emerged and inoculations began to aggressively squelch infectious diseases ; the actual life spans in cities began to catch up to and exceed those of people in rural areas .
But the idea of urban rot remained strong , so the cultural bias against urban life lived on .
It did n’t help when the seventies and eighties ushered in waves of urban crime , recession , and drug epidemics , and cities like New York and Detroit and Chicago sharply curtailed public - health services .
Cities , more than ever , seemed like cesspools of dread and early death .

By 2000 , though , the perspective looked altogether different .
With a sharply reduced crime rate , runaway gentrification , and a geyser of boom - time dough , Manhattan had largely conquered the homicide , AIDS , and overdose problems that were pulling down the average life - expectancy figure .
A trio of New York–based urban - health academics — Nicholas Freudenberg , David Vlahov , and Sandro Galea , professors at Hunter College and the New York Academy of Medicine — began to wonder if the “ urban health penalty ” still made sense .
As they examined the most recent data about health in cities versus health in rural and suburban areas , they noticed that the cities were , contrary to theory , pulling ahead .
This was n’t merely because cities tend to have richer citizens .
In fact , they found that people are almost equally likely to be poor — and to lack health insurance — in urban and rural areas .
Yet the percentage of rural people who ranked their health as “ fair / poor ” is much higher than in urban areas .
And people are more likely to die young in the sticks : Death rates for 1 - to - 24 - year - old males are 60 per 100,000 in cities , versus 80 in rural areas .
Perhaps worst of all for the suburbs , obesity is rising far more rapidly than in cities .
“ We were just walking around New York and thinking , Wait a minute , ” Vlahov says .
“ People in New York are in better shape than ever .
So there ’s obviously got to be something about cities that ’s good for you . ”
The urban health penalty , they decided , had inverted itself .
The new reality was that living in the suburbs and the country was the killer .
In January 2005 , Vlahov and his colleagues penned a manifesto they cleverly called “ The Urban Health ‘ Advantage , ’ ” and published it in the Journal of Urban Health .
Cities , they posited , were now the healthiest places of all , because their environment conferred subtle advantages — and guided its citizens , often quite unconsciously , to adopt healthier behaviors .
Three years ago , Lawrence Frank , a professor of urban planning at the University of British Columbia , set out to measure this effect , examining 10,858 people in Atlanta and the type of neighborhood they lived in .
Some were in purely residential suburban neighborhoods , where you had to get in your car to buy a carton of milk ; others lived in “ mixed ” downtown areas with shops within walking distance .
When he checked the results , the health difference was shockingly large : A white man who lived in a more urban , mixed - use area was fully ten pounds lighter than a demographically identical guy who lived in a sprawling suburb .
“ The more you drive , the more you weigh , ” Frank tells me after I call him to talk about it .
He was unsurprised when I described New York ’s increases in life expectancy .
“ You put people in an environment where public transportation is rational and driving is almost impossible , and it would be shocking not to see this outcome , ” he says .
Other scientists suggest that New York ’s benefits do not occur merely because the city is walkable .
It ’s also because New York is old and filled with attractive architecture and interesting street scenes — since , as it turns out , aesthetically pretty places lure people out of their homes and cars .
A 2002 study by the National Institutes of Health found that people living in buildings built before 1973 were significantly more likely to walk one - mile distances than those living in areas with newer architecture — because their environments were less architecturally ugly .
At the same time , New Yorkers are also more likely to visit parks than people who live in sprawl , because the parks are closer at hand .
And proximity matters , as a study by Deborah Cohen , a senior natural scientist at the rand Corporation , discovered .
When she examined the use of several parks in Los Angeles , she found that almost half the people using any given park lived no more than a quarter - mile away .
In contrast , only 13 percent of the people using the park had come from more than a mile away .
“ The farther you are , the less willing you are to go to the park , ” she notes .
Interestingly , urban theorists believe it is not just the tightly packed nature of the city but also its social and economic density that has life - giving properties .
When you ’re jammed , sardinelike , up against your neighbors , it ’s not hard to find a community of people who support you — friends or ethnic peers — and this strongly correlates with better health and a longer life .
Then there are economies of scale : A big city has bigger hospitals that can afford better equipment — the future of medicine arrives here first .
We also tend to enjoy healthier food options , since demanding foodies ( vegetarians and the like ) are aggregated in one place , making it a mecca for farm - fresh produce and top- quality fish , chicken , and beef .
There ’s also a richer cultural scene than in a small town , which helps keep people out and about and thus mentally stimulated .

Of course , the built environment would n’t have done New Yorkers ’ health any good if it had n’t been catalyzed by the city ’s economic bonanza .
The nineties were so lush they actually lifted some of the city ’s poorest out of poverty .
But gentrification cut both ways .
A more cynical — and possibly clear - eyed — explanation for New York ’s life - expectancy gains is that gentrification drove many of the city ’s poorest people out of town .
Though no figures exist to accurately calculate it , what social scientists can measure is the effect of gentrification on the health of the poor who have stayed put :
It turns out to be — unexpectedly — benevolent .
One study by Ming Wen , a sociologist at the University of Utah , crunched data on 8,782 residents of various neighborhoods in Chicago .
She expected to find the typical bleeding - heart conclusion : Poverty is bad , income inequality is bad , and the two together are worse yet .
But in reality , income inequality at the neighborhood level paradoxically seemed to mitigate the bad effects of poverty .
In neighborhoods that mixed affluent people alongside poor ones , the poorer residents were statistically healthier than those in non-mixed neighborhoods .
That ’s because , Wen concluded , the presence of relatively wealthy people has a spillover effect on the immediate neighborhood : safer streets , cleaner environments , better food in stores .
( Indeed , another study found that poor teenagers in mixed - income neighborhoods ate more leafy green vegetables than poor teenagers in non-mixed ones . )
Wen is careful not to say that all income equality produces trickle - down effects ; if the poor and wealthy are completely sealed off from each other in different parts of a city , the effect does n’t occur .
And this , as it turns out , helps explain the one troubling chapter in New York ’s life - expectancy success story : the Bronx .
Alone among the five boroughs , the Bronx ’s average life expectancy has actually declined in the last twenty years .
And it is the only one that saw very little financial uptick from the nineties boom years , and virtually no gentrification .
The effect on everyday health becomes pretty apparent to me when I take a trip up to St. Barnabas , the Bronx ’s largest acute - care hospital , to meet with Jerry Balentine and David Perlstein , the chief medical officer and associate medical director , respectively .
They urge me to wander around a bit and look at the local bodegas , where the food options are pretty lousy — mostly fatty canned foods and virtually no fresh vegetables .
The new reality is , the Bronx is ballooning .
“ You walk along here and you almost never see an actual supermarket , ” Balentine says with a shrug .
“ So people ca n’t eat healthily even if they want to .
It ’s all fast food .
That ’s what ’s cheap — Chinese food , pizza . ”
The life - expectancy revolution destroys one of New York ’s most cherished self images — our mean streets .
Health is our new urban stereotype .
Perlstein takes me for a stroll through one of St. Barnabas ’ clinics , and it ’s hardly a picture of good health .
Virtually everyone is overweight , many enormously so :
One white - haired woman poured over the edges of a small chair as she sat knitting ; she looked as though she could easily crack 300 pounds .
“ This is our biggest problem , ” he says .
There ’s an ethnic component ;
Hispanics tend to be stockier to begin with , he notes .
But there ’s also a cognitive drift among his patients .
Since they ’re surrounded all day long by people who are huge , they lose the ability to recognize what it means to be overweight .
People who are healthy look creepily skinny .
“ I get mothers coming in with their kids , and the kids are already looking a little too heavy , right ? ” Perlstein says .
“ But the mothers are going , ‘ He ’s not gaining enough weight !
Give me a pill that makes him gain more weight !’
They see being heavy as being healthy — you ’re growing .
It ’s completely the opposite of what people think in Manhattan . ”
Granted , New York is pushing various policies to affect the “ food environment ” in poorer areas of the city .
In a pilot program in central Brooklyn , the South Bronx , and Harlem last winter , the city subsidized bodegas to carry one percent milk in addition to the unhealthier full - fat variant .
And Frieden recently passed a law that will require most fast - food chains to prominently post the calorie content of their meals .
But you ca n’t get past the sheer difficulties of being broke .
Perlstein has female patients who schedule mammograms but then skip them — “ because they ’ve got three kids , and who ’s going to look after them while they ’re getting screened ? ”
At times , talking to Frieden and some of the other scientists , I wondered if all the talk about how healthy cities had become might be the latest species of boosterism , of civic mythmaking , partly because he ’s staked his legacy on such aggressive policies as bad - food bans .
And urban theorists have begun a fierce beat - down on the suburbs , castigating them endlessly for being the epicenter of the obesity epidemic .
As it happens , this is the argument of Matthew Turner , an economist at the University of Toronto .
Last year , he decided he was a bit sick of hearing about the health benefits of cities .
The “ urban health advantage ” sounded to him like mere self - congratulation — the skinny , attractive folks in the megalopolises crowing about their innate superiority , and recoiling at the barbarisms of the SUV - driving , Wal - Mart - shopping exurban masses .
It seemed too much like blue - state snobbery .
So Turner devised a new experiment to test the power of the urban health advantage .
If it ’s true that cities impose inherently healthier behavior on you , Turner reasoned , then people who move from cities to suburbs should get fatter — and vice versa .
He began hoovering up data on 6,000 young Americans in their twenties to forties , tracking where they lived over a six - year period .
He used satellite imagery and tallies of shops and churches to determine the level of sprawl in each subject ’s neighborhood , then gathered information on each one ’s weight .
When he examined the data , he discovered something surprising : People who moved between dense and sprawling neighborhoods did n’t change weight .
Despite the claims of the new urbanists , Turner saw no evidence that one ’s built environment has an impact on one ’s health .
“ This idea that the built environment affects how much you weigh , ” he told me , “ is just wrong . ”
But then why do cities harbor slimmer people who live longer and healthier than those in sprawl ?
Because , Turner argues , the populations are self - selecting .
Highly active people who do n’t like to drive — and who crave to make boatloads of money — naturally gravitate to places like New York , because that suits their chosen lifestyle .
If we walk a lot here , it ’s because we ’re drawn to cities that force us to do so .
The converse is also true : People who are heavier and less fit gravitate to suburbs precisely because that ’s where they wo n’t need to walk — where nothing is possible without getting in a car .
( Mind you , Turner ’s rival scientists are not convinced by his argument .
As one pointed out to me , moving to a differently dense area might take years to change your weight — longer than Turner ’s time frame . )
In Turner ’s view , the logic of the urban health advantage is not only wrong , it ’s backward .
It ’s not that New York makes us healthier .
We make it healthier , by flocking here to live .
Ultimately , I ’ve come to believe that Turner is likely correct — but so are the proponents of the urban health advantage .
The two theories are not mutually exclusive .
A city can be good for your health and , at the same time , attract healthy people .
The life - span miracle in New York — the X factor I ’ve been searching for — is not one single cause , but a feedback loop .
There ’s no doubt that when New York cleaned up its crime in the nineties , it coasted to health as well as wealth in the high - tech boom : Wealthier people always live longer .
But prosperity also wrought a cultural shift .
New York once again became the city for young , ambitious strivers — precisely the sort that demand the cutting edge of healthy - living perks : an organic - food store on every corner , a yoga studio down the block , unreasonable amounts of sushi , clean parks in which to jog .
In a sense , the life - expectancy revolution challenges one of New Yorkers ’ longest - held and oddly cherished self - mythologies : that our kinetic , aggressive city is a grim physical challenge , and we ’re the Darwinian winners of the American race merely for surviving the mean streets .
The truth is that the dystopic , self - destructive seventies are as gone as the days of the Bowery Boys .
Health has become our new urban stereotype .
If New York City were still a raw , ungovernable failure , Frieden ’s invasive nanny - state laws like banning smoking in bars or trans - fats would have made him a laughingstock .
But the new New York has come to expect such measures ; we probably even take a masochistic joy in being forced to behave ourselves .
Hey , we ’d been looking for an excuse to quit smoking anyway !
And trans - fats — well , everyone knows that stuff ’ll kill you , right ?
This is why Frieden will likely have no problem slapping another 50 cents onto the taxes for a pack of cigarettes this fall , either .
The urban health advantage is here , all right .
And it is us .
