Cook married former Radio 1 DJ
Zoe Ball in 1999 DJ Norman Cook has checked himself into rehab to battle an alcohol addiction , his manager has confirmed .
The star , who is better known as Fatboy Slim and had a number one with the hit Praise You in 1999 , admitted himself to a specialist facility on Monday .
" Norman is voluntarily seeking help for his alcohol problem but he's in good shape , " manager Garry Blackburn said .
The 45 - year - old married former Radio 1 DJ and presenter Zoe Ball in 1999 and have a seven - year - old son called Woody .
Blackburn said Cook , who has recently performed under the Brighton Port Authority moniker , had the full support of his wife and the rest of his family .
In the past , the DJ , who in 2007 won an Ivor Novello award for his contribution to music , has never made a secret of liking a drink .
He once said : " Sometimes it feels a little undignified but I never seem to get tired of getting drunk .
I 've tried going on stage sober and it was n't much fun .
" It takes a lot of alcohol to stop me thinking ' What are you doing whirling that towel above your head ? " '
In an interview with the Guardian last week to promote the Brighton Port Authority 's album , Cook admitted he could not remember some recording sessions due to the amount of alcohol consumed .
" I 'd find myself looking at tape boxes going , ' Martha Wainwright ?
I did a tune with her ? ' ... you know , time passes , alcohol was involved .
It 's all a bit sketchy , " he said .

Boris Epstein is the CEO and Founder of BINC , a Professional Search Firm that specializes in the Software Marketplace .
Boris shares his thoughts about the recruitment industry , job hunting and career advice at AskBinc.com .
With the emergence of social media sites like LinkedInLinked In reviews , Facebook Facebook reviews , and TwitterTwitter reviews , and their user bases growing by the millions , one would think that a headhunter ’s job just got much easier .
I mean let ’s face it ; nowadays we can find anybody whether it ’s on one of these social networking sites , on a blog , discussion board , alumni list or via true and tried headhunting techniques .
But it ’s not that simple .
In the golden days of recruiting we would hunt for days to find a candidate with a degree from a top university who worked for a top notch company who of course was considered priceless and absolutely worth contacting .
Today however , we run a simple search on LinkedIn and find hundreds that match that exact profile .
Or we run a quick search on Twitter for anybody discussing a specific keyword and we now have hundreds more to contact .
But with only a set number of hours in a day , we just do n’t have the bandwidth to contact everybody .
The problem of today completely flipped from the one of yesterday where we went from candidate scarcity and limited information to an overabundance of candidates and even more information available on each one .
So in today ’s world of information overload where talent is literally available by the truckloads , I thought it would be relevant to write a post about how we evaluate a candidate ’s social media footprint to determine ( when all else is equal ) which candidates we would contact and which ones get left by the wayside .
I posed the following question to make it simple :
If all else were equal , like education , work history and general skill set , and I had to evaluate the social media footprints of two candidates to determine which one of them I would contact , which one would I contact and why ?
In my experience , I would contact the one who :
On LinkedIn
1 . Has genuine recommendations from peers , managers and colleagues 2 .
Has the more complete profile 3 .
Is a member of more groups pertaining to their respective field 4 .
Has a picture 5 . Lists interests , hobbies and other information related to their life outside of work 6 .
Participates and highlights their involvement in non-paid projects related to their field ( open - source , community , volunteer , conference ) 7 .
Updates their status more often 8 .
Asks and answers more questions 9 . Links to their employer , blog and other projects of interest 10 .
Has the larger network
On their blog
1 . Has interesting things to say about their respective profession and industry 2 .
Provides glimpses into their life outside of work – family , friends , hobbies , etc. 3 . Does not bad - mouth their current or previous employer 4 .
Provides links to their other social networking profiles 5 .
Includes a link to their current resume 6 .
Updates with new posts regularly 7 .
Keeps it non-controversial – minimal discussion of sex , politics , religion and other such controversial topics .
8 . Is more genuine and honest 9 .
Has a blogroll with link to other interesting blogs
On Facebook
1. Respects the overlap between their personal and professional lives 2 . Updates often 3 .
Posts pictures of friends and family but keeps them pg -13 4 .
Keeps it non-controversial – does n’t take extreme positions on sex , drugs , religion , politics or other topics that could cause an employer to be wary of hiring 5 .
Is a member of groups relevant to their profession
On Twitter
1. Tweets often ( between 2 - 10 times per day is considered reasonable ) 2 .
Has a healthy followers / following ratio 3 .
Has the biggest network 4 . Keeps a healthy balance between personal and professional tweets 5 . Does n’t just update , but also responds to others and generally seems to get Twitter
When Googled
1 . Does not lead to something controversial like arrests 2 . Leads to profession - related discussions and commentary on other social media sites 3 .
Leads me to their online blog , webpage or social media profiles 4 .
Does n’t come up blank
Why it matters
Now you might be asking yourself , if somebody has the skills that an employer requires , why are all of the above criteria important ?
The short answer is that nowadays employers rarely hire just skills and are looking for much more of a complete package - skills plus a well - rounded individual that fits well with their team and company .
And a person ’s social media footprint gives employers ( and others ) the best insight into your passions , interests , communication styles , work habits , work / life balance and all sorts of other valuable information .
Simply put , it helps an employer get to know you and get comfortable with you before a single word has even been exchanged .
So think about it , if you had the choice to consider a cold bland resume or an actual person with common interests , passions and work / life style , would n’t the choice be obvious ?
New to social media ?
But what happens if you ’re new to the world of Social Media and are n’t quite at the same pace as some of the veterans out there .
Not to worry , just follow a few easy steps and you ’ll be right into the thick of the game in absolutely no time .
1. Start ASAP !
2 . Create fully completed LinkedIn , Facebook and Twitter profiles .
3 . Shed your preconceived notions of keeping your work and home life separate .
Companies want people , not resumes .
Start portraying yourself as the well - rounded individual that you are .
4 . Use social media to its fullest – update often , connect with others and stay active .
5 . Do n’t stop ever ( even if you ’re happily employed and are n’t looking for new work ) .
Establishing and maintaining a social media footprint is not an act , it ’s a process .
Just like your career evolves , so should your Social Media Footprint .

April 20 , 2009 Scientists at the Singapore - based Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology ( IBN ) have made an unprecedented breakthrough in transforming carbon dioxide , a common greenhouse gas , into methanol , a widely used form of industrial feedstock and clean - burning biofuel .
Using " organocatalysts " , researchers activated carbon dioxide in a mild and non-toxic process to produce the more useful chemical compound .
The " hot paper " report , published recently in the international chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie , has been described by reviewers as " very important " , an classification only given to 10 % of the journal 's manuscripts .
This is because carbon dioxide emissions remain a hotly debated global issue , and are widely blamed for causing irreversible climate change .
Carbon dioxide emissions produced by human activity are predominately due to the consumption of fossil fuels and , although figures vary , its concentration in the earth ’s atmosphere are estimated to have risen by more than 30 % since the industrial revolution .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimates that a 60 % reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions is needed if carbon dioxide concentrations are to stabilize at present - day levels .
At the IBN , scientists have been able to make carbon dioxide react with a stable organocatalyst called N - heterocyclic carbene ( NHC ) under mild conditions in dry air .
“ NHCs have shown tremendous potential for activating and fixing carbon dioxide , " says Siti Nurhanna Riduan , senior lab officer at IBN .
" Our work can contribute towards transforming excess carbon dioxide in the environment into useful products , such as methanol . ”
A combination of silica and hydrogen – called hydrosilane – is added to the NHC - activated carbon dioxide , which is transformed into methanol through hydrolysis .
" Hydrosilane provides hydrogen , which bonds with carbon dioxide in a reduction reaction .
This carbon dioxide reduction is efficiently catalyzed by NHCs even at room temperature .
Methanol can be easily obtained from the product of the carbon dioxide reaction , " explains Dr Yugen Zhang , IBN team leader and principal research scientist .
" Our previous research on NHCs has demonstrated their multiple applications as powerful antioxidants to fight degenerative diseases , and as effective catalysts to transform sugars into an alternative energy source .
We have now shown that NHCs can also be applied successfully to the conversion of carbon dioxide into methanol , helping to unleash the potential of this highly abundant gas . ”
Scientific research becomes increasingly important to find solutions that curb global warming .
Current research is focusing on green chemistry , which aims to eliminate the use of hazardous substances to prevent environmental pollution .
IBN 's research aims to make the mass production of methanol more cost - effective , in the process reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released in the earth 's atmosphere .
“ We are innovating effective methods of generating clean energy using green chemistry and nanotechnology , " explains Professor Jackie Y. Ying , IBN executive director of the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology .
" In the face of environmental pollution , global warming and increasing demands on diminishing fossil fuel resources , we hope to provide a viable alternative energy option for industry , and effective sequestration and conversion of carbon dioxide . ”

Cuba has launched its own Linux variant , dubbed Nova .
The Nova project has been cooking away for the past year , and it was formally unveiled this week at the annual International Conference on Communication and Technologies in Havana .
At last year 's conference - a Microsoft - bash - fest - open source luminary Richard Stallman convinced attendees to take open source software not only to their heart , but to their computers .
The Cuban government , under the auspices of the Universidad de las Ciencias Informáticas ( UCI ) , created Nova by spinning its own rev on the Gentoo variant of Linux .
English speakers will no doubt have fun with that catchy Nova name , which has turned up in urban mythology involves other products in Spanish speaking countries , including a Chevy sedan and some Mexican gasoline .
The country missed the perfect opportunity to call it Fidelix , and if they wanted to be technically correct and give a bow to Stallman - the founder of the Free Software Foundation - they could have called it GNU / Fidelix .
A forward thinking Cuban IT industry might have opted for Raulix as well .
But open source projects do n't seem to be any better at naming products than the marketeering departments at corporations .
Linux and the free and open source applications that run on it would seem to be a natural fit for a communist country , and considering that commercial - grade open source operating systems and applications have been available for decades , it is more than a little surprising that Cuba has n't long since abandoned Windows on its PCs and servers .
But despite trade embargoes , Windows still runs on most of the computers on the island nation , according to a report from Reuters .
That report says that Cuban citizens have only been able to buy PCs for the past year ( before then , they had access to them in PC clubs , akin to Internet cafes but apparently without the coffee ) .
And in that time , according to Hector Rodriguez , dean of the School of Free Software , about 20 per cent of the computers shipped in the country are running Linux .
The hope is that the advent of Nova will boost the share Linux holds .
" I would like to think that in five years our country will have more than 50 percent migrated , " Rodriguez told Reuters .
Cuba is also jumpy about the potential security issues that Microsoft 's Windows and other operating systems pose - and not the kind of security issues that most of us think as we use our PCs and systems in our day - to - day work and home lives .
" Private software can have black holes and malicious codes that one does n't know about , " Rodriguez said .
" That does n't happen with free software . "
The Cuban Nova Linux is not to be confused with the Linux variant of the same name that Palm is developing for PDAs and other mobile devices .
It is not clear where to get Nova or what packages it has .
It is also not clear how the Cuban government plans to offer tech support for the product .
Presumably , it will be done through free community support .
And they appear to need some tech support fast .
The UCI Web site , which appears to be running on Nova and which is where you can get Nova ( if my reading of Google cached pages is correct ) , is down as we go to press because it is being barraged by too much traffic .
Maybe Cuba should start an indigenous server business . ®
A week ago I removed a list ( something I very seldom do ) which had caused quite a stir ; it was a list of the most powerful families .
This new list is designed to replace the original and to give a broader view of some of the most powerful historic families while not excluding royal houses ( who dominate this list as one would expect ) .
Let us hope this is received better than the original ( which I should add , was not without its merits ) .
10 Rothschild Family
The Rothschild family ( often referred to simply as the Rothschilds ) , is an international banking and finance dynasty of German Jewish origin that established operations across Europe , and was ennobled by the Austrian and British governments .
The family ’s rise to international prominence began with Mayer Amschel Rothschild ( 1744 –1812 – pictured above ) , whose strategy for future success was to keep control of their businesses in family hands , allowing them to maintain full discretion about the size of their wealth and their business achievements .
Mayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages between closely related family members .
Nathan Mayer Rothschild started his London business , N. M. Rothschild and Sons in 1811 at New Court in St Swithin ’s Lane , City of London , where it still trades today .
In 1818 , he arranged a £ 5 million loan to the Prussian government , and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank ’s business .
He gained a position of such power in the City of London that by 1825 – 6 he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a market liquidity crisis .
9 Plantagenets
In the toss - up between including the Plantagenets or the Tudors , the Plantagenet ’s won because much of the development of the English culture and political system ( which remains to this day ) arose under their rule .
Under the Tudors , the Church of England was formed and some say a golden age occurred , but the significance of the Plantagenet line is far greater ( and furthermore , Henry VIII was descended matrilineally from the Plantagenet family anyway ) .
The House of Plantagenet was a royal house founded by Henry II of England , son of Geoffrey V of Anjou .
The Plantagenet kings first ruled the Kingdom of England in the 12th century .
In total , fifteen Plantagenet monarchs , including those belonging to cadet branches , ruled England from 1154 until 1485 .
A distinctive English culture and art emerged during the Plantagenet era , encouraged by some of the monarchs who were patrons of the “ father of English poetry ” ; Geoffrey Chaucer .
The Gothic architecture style was popular during the time , with buildings such as the Westminster Abbey and York Minster remodeled in that style .
There was also lasting developments in the social sector , such as John I of England ’s signing of the Magna Carta ( pictured above ) .
This was influential in the development of common law and constitutional law .
Political institutions such as the Parliament of England and the Model Parliament originate from the Plantagenet period , as do educational institutions including the University of Cambridge and Oxford .
8 Nehru -Gandhi family
The Nehru - Feroz Gandhi family is an Indian political family which has been dominant in the Indian National Congress for most of India ’s early independent history .
Three members of the family ( Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi ) have been Prime Minister of India , two of whom ( Indira and Rajiv Gandhi ) have been assassinated .
A fourth member of the family , Sonia Gandhi , is currently Congress President , while her and Rajiv ’s son , Rahul Gandhi , is the youngest member of the family to enter active politics when he contested and won a seat in the lower house of the Parliament of India in 2004 .
The Nehru - Feroz Gandhi family is not related to Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi .
The Nehru - Gandhis are the most prominent example of the tradition of dynastic leadership in Asian democratic countries .
7 Khan Family
Genghis Khan ( pictured above ) was the founder , Khan ( ruler ) and Khagan ( emperor ) of the Mongol Empire , the largest contiguous empire in history .
He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast Asia .
After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed “ Genghis Khan ” , he started the Mongol invasions and raids of the Kara - Khitan Khanate , Caucasus , Khwarezmid Empire , Western Xia and Jin dynasties .
During his life , the Mongol Empire eventually occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia .
Before Genghis Khan died , he assigned Ogedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons .
He died in 1227 after defeating the Tanguts .
He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at a location unknown .
His descendants went on to stretch the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering and / or creating vassal states out of all of modern - day China , Korea , the Caucasus , Central Asian countries , and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe and the Middle East .
6 Claudia and Julius Families
These two families are combined in one item as they were two of the most important families in Ancient Rome and eventually joined together to form the Julio - Claudian Dynasty that provided the most famous emperors : Caligula , Augustus ( pictured above ) , Claudius , Tiberius , and Nero .
These five emperors ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to AD 68 , when the last of the line , Nero , committed suicide .
These five rulers were linked through marriage and adoption into the familial gens Julio and gens Claudia .
Julius Caesar is sometimes inaccurately seen as its founder , although he was not an emperor and had no Claudian connections ; Augustus is the more widely accepted founder .
The reigns of the Julian - Claudian emperors bear some similar traits :
All came to power through indirect or adopted relations .
Each expanded the territory of the Roman Empire and initiated massive construction projects .
They were generally loved by the common people , but were resented by the senatorial class – a sentiment reflected by ancient historians .
Ancient historians describe the Julio - Claudians as self - aggrandizing , mad , sexually perverse and tyrannical .
5 Zhu Family
“ Zhu ” was the family name of the emperors of the Ming Dynasty .
The first Ming Emperor , Hongwu ( Zhu Yuanzhang – pictured above ) opted to use the name Ming for the dynastic name .
Ming means “ Brilliant ” .
The Ming Dynasty was the ruling dynasty of China from 1368 to 1644 , following the collapse of the Mongol - led Yuan Dynasty .
The Ming , “ one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history , ” was the last dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Hans .
Although the Ming capital Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng , which was itself soon replaced by the Manchu- led Qing Dynasty ( the last Chinese imperial family ) , regimes loyal to the Ming throne ( collectively called the Southern Ming ) survived until 1662 .
Ming rule saw the construction of a vast navy and a standing army of one million troops .
There were enormous construction projects , including the restoration of the Grand Canal and the Great Wall and the establishment of the Forbidden City in Beijing during the first quarter of the 15th century .
Estimates for the late - Ming population vary from 160 to 200 million .
The Ming dynasty is often regarded as both a high point in Chinese civilization as well as a dynasty in which early signs of capitalism emerged .
4 Habsburgs
The House of Habsburg was an important royal house of Europe and is best known as supplying all of the formally elected Holy Roman Emperors between 1452 and 1740 , as well as rulers of Spain and the Austrian Empire .
Originally from Switzerland , the dynasty first reigned in Austria , which they ruled for over six centuries , but a series of dynastic marriages brought Burgundy , Spain , Bohemia , Hungary and other territories into the inheritance .
The dynasty is named after their seat of origin , the Habsburg Castle in the Swiss Canton of Aargau .
The dynasty ’s motto is “ Let others wage wars , but you , happy Austria , shall marry ” , which indicates the talent of the Habsburgs to have their members intermarry into other royal houses , to make alliances and inherit territory .
Empress Maria Theresa ( pictured above ) is recognized quite notably for it and is sometimes referred to as the ‘ Great - Grandmother of Europe ’ .
3 Ptolemy Family
The Ptolemaic dynasty was a Hellenistic Macedonian royal family which ruled the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt for nearly 300 years , from 305 BC to 30 BC .
Ptolemy , one of the seven bodyguards who served as Alexander the Great ’s generals and deputies , was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander ’s death in 323 BC .
In 305 BC , he declared himself King Ptolemy I , later known as “ Soter ” ( saviour ) .
The Egyptians soon accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt .
Ptolemy ’s family ruled Egypt until the Roman conquest of 30 BC .
The most famous member of the line was the last queen , Cleopatra VII ( pictured above ) , known for her role in the Roman political battles between Julius Caesar and Pompey , and later between Octavian and Mark Antony .
Her suicide at the conquest by Rome marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Egypt .
2 Medici Family
The Mèdici family was a powerful and influential Florentine family from the 13th to 17th century .
The family had three popes ( Leo X – pictured above , Clement VII , and Leo XI ) , numerous rulers of Florence ( notably Lorenzo the Magnificent , patron of some of the most famous works of Renaissance art ) and later members of the French and English royalty .
Like other signore families they dominated their city ’s government .
They were able to bring Florence under their family ’s power , allowing for an environment where art and humanism could flourish .
They led the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with the other great signore families of Italy such as the Visconti and Sforza families of Milan , the Este of Ferrara , and the Gonzaga of Mantua .
The Medici Bank was one of the most prosperous and most respected in Europe .
There are some estimates that the Medici family were for a period of time the wealthiest family in Europe .
From this base , they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe .
1 Capetian Family
The Capetian dynasty is the largest European royal house .
It includes any of the direct descendants of Hugh Capet of France .
King Juan Carlos of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg are members of this family , both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty .
Over the course of the preceding centuries , Capetians spread throughout Europe , ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors .
Besides being the most numerous royal family in Europe , it also is one of the most incestuous , especially in the Spanish Monarchy .
Many years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe , however they still remain as kings , as well as other titles .
Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg .
In addition , seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil , France , Spain , Portugal , Parma and Two Sicilies .
The current legitimate senior family member is Louis Alfonso ( pictured above ) , the Duke of Anjou , who also holds the Legitimist claim to the French throne .
Overall , dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe .
Notable Omissions : Merovingians , Qin family , Bhutto family , Tudors , Romanovs , Stuarts , House of Orange , Berenguer family , Kennedy family , Vanderbilt family

A maths teacher who invented the deaths of three girlfriends to take time off work has been banned from teaching .
David Flinn , who skipped school to attend their fictitious funerals , was suspended from Hartlepool 's Manor College of Technology in 2006 .
A General Teaching Council misconduct panel heard the evidence on Monday .
Flinn told colleagues that his " girlfriends " had died of Aids , in a car crash and of an unspecified fate in America .
The panel , sitting in Birmingham , found Mr Flinn had misused his sick leave entitlement , and taken days off for the fabricated funerals .
He engaged in systematic and wilful deceit over a long period of time
Martin Robson , deputy headteacher
They heard Mr Flinn also falsified claims of ill health , inventing elaborate stories about his misfortunes .
He came into school with a walking stick , telling colleagues he had been injured by a car during a hit - and - run incident .
On another occasion , Flinn appeared at work with his arm bandaged , explaining to staff that he had been given an implant to control his adrenalin levels .
The college 's deputy headteacher , Martin Robson , told the hearing : " There was a suspicion that something was n't right , but we continued to support him .
" He engaged in systematic and wilful deceit over a long period of time . "
' Endangered the profession '
Karen Cork , presenting officer for the General Teaching Council , said Flinn had also communicated in an over - familiar and sexual manner with pupils , asking them details of their sex lives and encouraging them to confide in him .
She said that several pupils had reported feeling uneasy in his presence .
Mrs Cork said : " His behaviour endangered the reputation of the profession , and of himself .
" He was not a young and inexperienced teacher , he was a role model . "
Mr Flinn had admitted inventing the stories about the death of girlfriends , funerals , illnesses and sleeplessness .

The panel ruled that although Mr Flinn was adamant he would not return to the profession , he could apply to regain permission to teach in 2014 .
The torch was nearly snatched from TV presenter Konnie Huq in London International torch relays ahead of the Olympics have been scrapped by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
It follows the controversy that surrounded the Beijing Olympic relay which was dogged by protests as the torch made its way around the world .
The 2008 relay 's London leg was hit by several incidents and criticism over China 's ' torch police ' security staff .
Organisers of the 2012 London Olympics have already said they had no plans to take the torch outside Britain .
" We have always said the primary focus would be on a domestic torch relay whose main purpose is to excite and inspire the UK in the build - up to the games , " said a London 2012 spokeswoman .
" We planned to take our lead from the IOC and are very happy with this decision as it mirrors what we were intending to do . "
I think when the torch relay is inside the host country there is more control
IOC executive director Gilbert Felli Instead of representing a symbol of hope and inspiration , the Olympic torch became a magnet for protesters in 2008 en route to Beijing , sparking sometimes violent protests over China 's human rights record .
IOC executive director Gilbert Felli said : " After the ( 2004 ) relay in Athens , which was the first international relay , we came to the conclusion it was easier for the torch to stay inside the ( host ) country .
" There were difficulties with the NOCs ( National Olympic Committees ) , and we also saw the risk with a torch relay going around the world .
" Beijing had planned an international torch relay and we accepted it .
We saw in the debrief that the risk was there and the IOC decided not to do it ( again ) .
" I think when the torch relay is inside the host country there is more control . "
The IOC confirmed its decision to scrap international torch relays applies to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and onwards .
London 's plans will see the torch tour the country in 2012 with the aim of 95 % of the UK 's population being no more than an hour away from seeing it at some point during its journey .

“ There ’s no question that from a very limited start , she mastered an incredible amount of material , became quite expert and quite sophisticated , ” said Bruce Vladeck , who was Mr. Clinton ’s Medicare chief .
“ Maybe this is the story of her life .
Now that health care is achievable , that the political moon and stars are lined up to do it , she ’s no longer there . ”

Some who know Mrs. Clinton predict she will not be able to stay entirely out of the debate .
Among them is Senator Max Baucus , the Montana Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee , who said he last spoke with Mrs. Clinton about health care before she took her cabinet post .
“ Oh , Hillary ’s very smart , she ’ll figure out a way to sidebar with the president , ” Mr. Baucus said .
“ I have a hunch that she ’ll give a word or two of advice to the president and to me , and I intend to talk to her . ”
Others , like Donna E. Shalala , who was health secretary to Mr. Clinton , say Mrs. Clinton does not need to advise Mr. Obama on the lessons of the past ; she already did so when she ran for president by laying out a plan far different than the complicated proposal , heavy on government intervention , that flopped so badly when she was first lady .
“ The way she laid out the issue during the campaign is a clear indication that they learned something over the last decade , and her proposal was very close to Senator Obama ’s , ” Ms. Shalala said .
“ That reflects what we learned  that people do n’t want to lose the health insurance they currently have , that they are desperately concerned about cost , that they want evidence based medicine and prevention .
I think in many ways she ’s done her work . ”
For Mr. Emanuel and other Clinton veterans who now work for Mr. Obama  among them Lawrence H. Summers , the chief economics adviser ; Peter R. Orszag , the budget director ; and Neera Tanden , a longtime policy aide to Mrs. Clinton who is now a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services  Mr. Obama ’s effort to remake the nation ’s health system is something of a do - over .
It began with the economic recovery bill Mr. Obama recently signed , a measure that included $ 20 billion to modernize medical records and $ 1.1 billion for research on the cost effectiveness of drugs and medical treatments , initiatives that the White House says are critical to helping to bring down the cost of care .

Google has released an experimental browser plugin that will make it possible to display rich 3D graphics in Web content .
Google hopes that the plugin will stimulate discussion within the Web development community and contribute to a nascent effort headed by the Khronos group to bring 3D graphics to the Web .
The plugin provides an implementation of O3D , a new API conceived by Google that facilitates the development of interactive 3D Web applications .
It can be used to programmatically create and manipulate 3D graphics with the JavaScript programming language .
It 's far more sophisticated and ambitious than some of Google 's previous experiments with 3D Web content , such as the ill - fated Lively service .
The source code of the plugin is distributed under the open source BSD license , which broadly permits third - party developers to study , modify , and redistribute the plugin software .
The Khronos group , the organization behind the OpenGL standard , announced plans last month to bring 3D graphics to the Web in collaboration with Mozilla .
Khronos and Mozilla have encouraged other browser vendors and Web standards stakeholders to participate in the effort and contribute to the process .
Mozilla has already released its own experimental 3D plugin , which closely mirrors the standard OpenGL APIs .
Google 's O3D API takes a different approach and is not directly compatible with Mozilla 's plugin .
The significant differences between the two APIs articulate alternate perspectives and illuminate different paths to solving the same problem .
Although this fragmentation might seem troubling , it 's important to remember that the process of standardizing 3D Web APIs is still at an extremely early stage .
The availability of two different APIs with their own respective open source implementations will help to shed light on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches .
I spoke with Google product manager Henry Bridge and engineering director Matt Papakipos about Google 's interest in 3D graphics and the purpose of the plugin .
They contend that enabling interactive 3D Web applications will help to advance Google 's chief goal , which is to make information more useful and accessible .
Specifically , they would like to bring applications like Google Earth and SketchUp into the browser and lay a strong foundation for facilitating future innovation .
The technology could be put to use in a wide variety of contexts , they say , ranging from 3D games to powerful data visualizations .
The initial implementation is being delivered as a plugin so that it can be put to use right away in all mainstream browsers .
The plugin is fully cross-platform compatible and all of the platforms are supported in a single code base .
When the technology matures and the standardization process is complete , the technology will arrive in browsers and will be supported natively alongside other Web content .
Google believes that the standardization process will take several years , during which the APIs will change considerably and evolve based on feedback from the Web development community .
The work done in this space by Google and Mozilla will likely converge along the way .
Google says that their work complements Mozilla 's and that the projects should not be viewed as competitors .
On a technical level , the most noteworthy difference is that Mozilla 's plugin is designed around immediate mode rendering whereas Google 's is designed to provide retained mode .
The O3D plugin leverages hardware accelerated rendering , which means that it is powered by the GPU and can deliver strong rendering performance .
The API supports loading 3D models , much like Mozilla 's high - level C3DL library .
Google has published several open source demos which show how the API can be used to build interactive 3D Web applications with JavaScript .
One of the demos even features a JavaScript physics engine .
The plugin is primarily being made available for software developers and is generally not intended for production use .
Because the APIs are subject to considerable change , it is still far too early for the technology to be adopted outside the scope of testing and experimentation .
At this stage , Google is very eager to receive constructive feedback from developers and see what people will do with the APIs .
Third - party experimentation will provide insight into which aspects of the technology work and which need improvement .
In that sense , the O3D plugin is being released in much the same spirit as Google 's Native Client plugin , which we looked at last year .
Google 's participation in the effort to build 3D Web standards is a promising sign that the concept is gaining traction .
As HTML 5 imbues browsers with native support for video and raster graphics , it is becoming increasingly clear that standards - based rich media will play a major role in the future of the Web .
Delivering accelerated 3D graphics seems like the next logical step for empowering the open Web .

The rest of the nation may be getting back to basics , but on Wall Street , paychecks still come with a golden promise .
Workers at the largest financial institutions are on track to earn as much money this year as they did before the financial crisis began , because of the strong start of the year for bank profits .
Even as the industry ’s compensation has been put in the spotlight for being so high at a time when many banks have received taxpayer help , six of the biggest banks set aside over $ 36 billion in the first quarter to pay their employees , according to a review of financial statements .
If that pace continues all year , the money set aside for compensation suggests that workers at many banks will see their pay  much of it in bonuses  recover from the lows of last year .
Op - Ed : Pakistan - Failed state in the making , or the new war zone ?
By By Paul Wallis Feb 26 , 2009 in World
One thing ’s for sure :
If there ’s been a real loser in the War On Terror , it ’s Pakistan .
The long suffering , faction - ridden country is in serious trouble .
A hideous alignment of simultaneous problems is starting to break the structure of the country .
Pakistan ’s real problem is having far too many factions and opposing forces inside a country which ca n’t afford the constant polarizations and mutual obstruction .
Some people may have forgotten that Pakistan was at one stage on its way to becoming a modern nation , with a miniature version of India ’s middle class , and some prosperity .
Currently , Pakistan is basket case territory , in terms of economic conditions .
Since the original Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban , the nation has been going straight backwards .
It ’s difficult and dangerous to do business in a war zone , and that , in effect , is the problem .
The massive splits in the society have made a bad situation a lot worse .
The insurgency in the north , which former President Musharraf attempted to suppress with military force , has exposed all the gaping wounds of a nation at war with itself .
Pakistan ’s military is simply not up to doing the military work required to win a war in the north .
Its outdated Soviet era forces have tried hard .
But against the terrain , the huge area , and veteran mujihadin and the local tribes , famous North West Frontier warriors themselves like the Pashtun , the shot ’s not really on the board .
The war in Afghanistan is spilling over into Pakistan , whether the Pakistanis like it or not , and they do n’t .
The CIA says that The problem with that idea is that these weapons come with a severe level of requirements for increased technical capacity and training , and that ca n’t be done overnight .
Nor is the US noticeably enthused , although the new administration is taking on board the obvious fact that Pakistan ’s capacity to fight terrorism does have to be drastically improved .
Afghanistan and Pakistan are mutually suspicious of each other .
Afghanistan does n’t trust Pakistan because of Pakistan ’s support of the Taliban .
Pakistan believes Afghanistan to be too friendly with India , according to some sources , although there does n’t seem to be a lot of evidence of any overt alliance .
Which is the setting for the “ failed state ” scenario .
Aid , however , is n’t likely to be the answer to the social dysfunction .
You ca n’t glue a country back together with the equivalent of a Social Security check .
Some sort of workable relationship among the factions , and de-polarization of the country , has to occur , before any normality can be achieved .
Having done which , Pakistan can start trying to undo the damage done by the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
The north is likely to become a desert , with these forces now at work enforcing their bogus Islam on the inhabitants , some of whom are already starving .
The Taliban have already demolished many schools in the province of Swat , where “ Sharia for peace ” is the basis of the agreement .
Have a look at the Australian documentary by The administration is talking about “ limited ” objectives in simply making sure Afghanistan is n’t used as a base for attacks on the US .
I would suggest that only if you apply the standards of 2002 does that objective makes sense .
If you apply the facts of 2009 , it ’s far more likely that a failed Pakistan would be a base for any future attacks .
I doubt if it really matters where an attack comes from , if it hits .
The Taliban are using the tried and trusted “ Border War ” scenario , which has protected criminals and terrorists for centuries .
It ’s a well known tactic , where guerrillas make raids and then scuttle back across a border , any border .
The only cure for that is action on both sides of the border .
Pakistan is theoretically protecting its own most likely destroyers .
If Pakistan becomes a failed state , the Taliban and Al Qaeda have all the materials they need , including nukes .
Which would mean total failure of the War on Terror , and perhaps a major war , in the event of an attack on the US or India .
This is the scenario to avoid at all costs .
Either that , or start working on the Happy World War Three commemorative mugs .
The situation in Pakistan has been developing in ways even dedicated professional pessimists would have tried to avoid thinking about .
The “ Sharia for peace ” initiative ( see Subhabrata Das ' previous DJ article ) has been variously described as a victory for the Taliban , and a defeat for Islamabad .
In practice , it ’s likely to be a defeat for Pakistan as a whole .
Pakistan ’s real problem is having far too many factions and opposing forces inside a country which ca n’t afford the constant polarizations and mutual obstruction .

As Employment Increases in Response to a Fall in Wage Rates , the Rate of Profit Rises , Not Falls
This is the third in a series of articles that seeks to provide the intelligent layman with sufficient knowledge of sound economic theory to enable him to understand what must be done to overcome the present financial crisis and return to the path of economic progress and prosperity .
With his usual astuteness , Mises observed that it is common for one and the same doctrine to circulate in more than one version , typically , in its original , scholarly version and then also in a greatly simplified version designed for popular consumption .
He illustrated how this applied to doctrines as diverse as Catholicism , Darwinism , and Freudianism ( Money , Method , and the Market Process , pp. 301f ) .
Not surprisingly , his observation also applies to Keynesianism and its claim that a free economy is incapable of eliminating unemployment , because its method of doing so , namely , a fall in wage rates , is allegedly unable to increase the quantity of labor demanded .
Popular Keynesianism
The popular version of the Keynesian doctrine , which is championed above all by the labor unions , is simply that a fall in wage rates , in reducing the incomes of wage earners , causes a fall in consumer spending , which allegedly serves to worsen the problem of unemployment .
This doctrine can be disposed of fairly simply , before proceeding to the scholarly version of Keynesianism , which is known as the IS - LM doctrine .
First of all , it overlooks the fact that at lower wage rates more workers will be employed .
The effect of this is to enable total wage payments and consumer spending in the economic system to remain the same or even increase while the wages of the individual worker decline .
For example , 10 workers each employed at 90 percent of the wages earn the same total wages and can spend just as much in buying consumers ' goods as could 9 workers each earning the original wage .
( It 's as simple as the fact that 10 times .9 equals 9 times 1 . )
And , of course , more than 10 workers employed at 90 percent of the wage per worker would earn more collectively and spend more for consumers ' goods collectively than was possible before .
The popular version of the Keynesian doctrine also overlooks the fact that even if total wage payments and consumer spending did decline , business sales revenues would not decline insofar as reduced wage payments made possible increased expenditures for capital goods .
Indeed , to the extent that additional spending for capital goods took the place of wage payments and the consumer spending supported by wage payments , not only would sales revenues in the economic system remain the same , but , what is particularly important for the process of economic recovery , the amount of profit earned on those same total sales revenues would actually increase .
This result follows because wage payments as a rule show up fairly quickly — usually within a matter of weeks or months — as equivalent costs that must be deducted from sales revenues in calculating profits .
In contrast , expenditures for machinery will not show up as equivalent costs deducted from sales revenues for several years or more , in accordance with the depreciable life of the machines .
And expenditures for construction materials and the services of construction equipment will not show up as equivalent costs deducted from sales revenues for several decades , in accordance with the still longer depreciable lives of buildings and other highly durable assets .
Because of these considerations , if a sum such as $ 100 billion , say , could be shifted away from wage payments in the economic system and to the purchase of machinery and plant , profits in the economic system might well increase on the order of $ 90 to $ 95 billion dollars in the year in which this shift of spending occurred .
This is because the $ 100 billion of spending for capital goods that would now take place would represent fully as much spending for goods , and thus fully as much business sales revenues , as the $ 100 billion of spending for consumers ' goods that the wage earners would otherwise have made .
At the same time , while $ 100 billion of wage payments would have shown up in the same year as $ 100 billion of costs to be deducted from sales revenues , $ 100 billion of spending for capital goods with a depreciable life ranging from several years to several decades , may well show up perhaps as a mere $ 5 to $ 10 billion of depreciation cost in any given year .
The replacement of $ 100 billion in wage costs with $ 5 to $ 10 billion of depreciation cost implies a rise in economy - wide profits of $ 90 to $ 95 billion .
Spending for Capital Goods Can Rise at the Same Time that Spending for Consumers ' Goods Falls
Some readers may wonder how it is possible for more to be spent for capital goods at the same time that less is spent for consumers ' goods .
Less spending for consumers ' goods , it would seem , should imply less spending for the capital goods required to produce the consumers ' goods .
The answer lies in the fact that while this may well be true , the spending for capital goods to produce consumers ' goods declines in a lesser degree than does the spending to buy consumers ' goods .
This means that it now stands in a higher proportion to the spending for consumers ' goods .
In turn , the spending to buy the capital goods to produce those capital goods comes to stand in a compounded higher proportion to the spending for consumers ' goods , and so on , with the spending for capital goods further compounded at every succeeding stage of production .
The following series of numbers will help to illustrate what is involved .
Thus imagine that initially spending for consumers ' goods in the economic system was 500 units of money , the spending for the capital goods to produce those consumers ' goods was 250 units of money , the spending for the capital goods to produce those capital goods , 125 units of money , and so on , with each succeeding amount of spending for capital goods being half of the spending for the capital goods it helps to produce .
Now imagine that spending for consumers ' goods falls from 500 to 400 units of money .
Here is how at the same time spending for capital goods can increase from 500 ( i.e. , the sum of 250 + 125 + 62.50 +… ) to 600 units of money .
The mechanism is that the spending for the capital goods required to produce consumers ' goods falls from .5 x 500 to .6 x 400 , i.e. , from 250 to 240 .
The spending to produce the capital goods required to produce those capital goods will now be .6 x 240 rather than .5 times 250 .
Inasmuch as .6 x 240 = 144 , while .5 x 250 = 125 , the spending for capital goods at this stage has actually risen .
Its rise will be relatively greater at each succeeding stage , e.g. , 86.4 versus 62.50 , 51.84 versus 31.25 , and so on .
Hoarding and the Rate of Profit
Finally , it should also be realized that the effect even of a decline in total wage payments that was not accompanied by any increase in spending for capital goods , would soon be very positive for profits .
It would not increase profits in absolute amount , but it would increase them as a percentage of sales revenues and costs .
Here it must be kept in mind that wage payments are not only a source of funds for wage earners to spend in buying consumers goods , but they also show up equivalently as business costs , which must be deducted from sales revenues in computing profits , and do so fairly soon .
Thus a decline in wage payments would quickly result in equal reductions in sales revenues and costs .
To whatever extent sales revenues were greater than costs to begin with , the amount of that excess would remain unchanged , because equals subtracted from unequals do not affect the amount of the inequality .
However , the same amount of inequality , i.e. , of profit , would now represent a larger percentage of the reduced sales revenues and costs .
The same amount of profit in the economic system would also represent a rise in the rate of return on capital invested in the economic system .
This would be the result not only of the monetary value of the capital invested shrinking in consequence of reduced spending for labor ( and capital goods ) , but also , and far more immediately , of the write - down of the value of existing capital assets to correspond with their lower level of replacement costs made possible by widespread declines in wage rates and prices .
In addition , purchases of assets at fire - sale prices following bankruptcies contribute to the same result .
What this implies is that to the extent that savings in the economic system might be unduly held in the form of cash , i.e. , " hoarded , " the effect is to raise the rate of return on capital invested and thus to provide a greater incentive for savings being invested rather than being hoarded .
In other words , " hoarding " is always a self - limiting phenomenon .
It follows that even if a decline in wage rates was initially accompanied not only by a fall in total wage payments but also by a fall in total business spending for labor and capital goods combined , the subsequent rise in the rate of return on capital would operate to restore total wage payments and the spending for capital goods .
Consequently , once the underlying aspects of a process of financial contraction have come to an end , a fall in wage rates operates at least fairly soon to increase the quantity of labor demanded .
100 Percent Hoarding and an Infinite Rate of Profit
An implication of this discussion that may appear startling to many readers is that if it were ever the case that people kept all of their savings in the form of cash holdings and spent absolutely nothing for labor or capital goods , the rate of profit and interest in the economic system would become infinitely high .
This is because while there would still be some amount of sales revenues in the economic system , resulting from consumption expenditures by those who possessed money , there would be no money costs of production to deduct from those sales revenues , since no expenditures giving rise to money costs would have been made .
Thus the amount of profit in the economic system would equal 100 percent of the sales revenues generated by whatever consumer spending existed .
At the same time it would equal an infinite percentage of the zero money costs of production and an infinite percentage of the zero money value of capital invested .
These conclusions are confirmed by the fact that the rate of profit and interest is far higher in countries that lack the security of property and developed financial markets and institutions and where , as a result , a far larger portion of savings takes the form of precious metals and gems rather than investments in business .
More on Hoarding and the Rate of Profit
" Hoarding , " or more precisely an increase in the demand for money for cash holding , has two effects on the rate of profit .
One is its longer - run effect , which can take place within a period as short as a few months , and which is to raise the rate of profit , as I have just shown .
Its other , more immediate effect , however , is to reduce the rate of profit , even to the point of wiping it out entirely and replacing profits with losses throughout the economic system .
This is the effect with which everyone is familiar and in the name of which they desire to do everything possible to avoid reductions in spending of any kind .
The reason that hoarding first reduces profits is merely the fact that reductions in spending for labor and capital goods exert their effect on business sales revenues to a more or less substantial extent before they exert their effect on the business costs deducted from sales revenues in arriving at profits .
Business sales revenues decline immediately when spending for capital goods declines : for example , less spending for steel sheet by an automobile company is less sales revenue for steel companies at the very same moment .
Sales revenues decline almost immediately when spending to employ labor declines , i.e. , as soon as reduced wage payments show up in reduced consumer spending .
Now some costs deducted from sales revenues also decline immediately in response to reduced business spending , notably , such costs as typically come under the heading of selling , general , or administrative expenses .
But other costs , namely , those which come under the headings of " cost of goods sold " and " depreciation cost " are not immediately affected by declines in current business spending .
They are determined historically , that is , by business spending for inventories and plant and equipment that has taken place in the past , and which cannot retroactively be reduced .
Current spending on account of inventories and plant and equipment shows up as costs to be deducted from sales revenues only in the future , a future that ranges from days to decades .
Of course , in a major recession or depression , long - term investment spending falls to a far greater extent than spending required to carry on current operations , and as a result , further declines in business spending , notably for labor and materials , almost all show up fairly quickly as declines in costs deducted from sales revenues .
Long - term investment spending falls disproportionately in large part because the wage rates of construction workers and of workers producing construction materials and the various kinds of machinery have not fallen or have not fallen to the point to which it is believed they will fall .
In that case , it pays to postpone such investments and hold cash instead , because they would be at a major disadvantage in competition with investments made in the future .
And when these wage rates and prices do finally fall , permitting current long - term investment to be worthwhile once again , the monetary value of existing plant and equipment can be written down commensurately , as previously indicated .
The effect of the write - downs is to reduce depreciation cost on existing plant and equipment .
( For example , the annual depreciation charge on plant with an asset value of $ 1 billion and a remaining depreciable life of 20 years is $ 50 million .
But if the value of that plant and equipment were written down to $ 500 million , the annual depreciation charge incurred would also fall by half , to $ 25 million . )
Along with a fall in wage rates and prices , an essential condition of economic recovery from a major recession or depression is simply the end of further financial contraction , i.e. , further economy - wide declines in spending .
Further financial contraction stops when bank failures and their accompanying declines in the quantity of money stop ( or , better still , do not start in the first place ) and when the demand for money for cash holding has risen sufficiently to satisfy the need to operate without access to loans created on a foundation of credit expansion .
The additional demand for money for cash holding also includes whatever temporary further component may be necessary to allow for a failure of wage rates and prices to fall and the consequent postponement of long - term investments .
At this point , the short - run negative effect of less spending on the amount and rate of profit begins to come to an end .
Its final end is greatly accelerated by the write - downs of assets that accompany reductions in wage rates and prices and hence in the replacement cost of existing business assets .
( As indicated , purchases of assets at fire - sale prices following bankruptcies contribute to the same result . )
These write - downs not only serve to reduce costs deducted from sales revenues earned with existing assets , thereby increasing current profits , but also serve to reduce the money value of the capital invested , thereby further increasing the rate of profit on existing assets in the economic system .
In effect , they serve to increase the size of the profit numerator while reducing the size of the capital - invested denominator .
More profit earned on less capital is a two - sided increase in the rate of return on capital .
In this environment , reductions in wage rates not yet accompanied by the employment of more workers or by the purchase of more capital goods quickly result in improvement in the rate of profit .
They do so not only by reducing costs as much as sales revenues , but by reducing them by more than sales revenues when the effect of write - downs is taken into account .
The write - downs , as just shown , also raise the rate of profit by reducing the money value of the capital invested in the economic system .
This rise in the rate of profit , and consequently also in the rate of interest , operates to reduce the demand for money for cash holding , by virtue of making the investment of money relatively more attractive in comparison with the holding of money .
The reduction in the demand for money for cash holding is greatly furthered by the restoration of the profitability of long - term investment that accompanies the necessary fall in wage rates and prices and also by the rise in the rate of profit that takes place pursuant to the putting of funds into longer - term investments .
The net upshot is that the necessary fall in wage rates and prices serves to increase the quantity of labor demanded disproportionately , by virtue of calling back into the market funds that had been withheld in anticipation of the fall in wage rates and prices .
At the same time , the increase in the quantity of labor demanded and the corresponding movement of the economic system toward " full employment " is accompanied by a rise in the rate of profit in the economic system .
The Keynesian IS - LM Doctrine
The doctrine of Keynes himself is far more complex than the popular variant .
It is so complex that it calls to mind a popular song from years ago called " Dem Bones " that described the connection of one bone to another , from toe to head .
The song went ,
Toe bone connected to the foot bone ,
Foot bone connected to the ankle bone ,
Ankle bone connected to the shin bone ,
Shin bone connected to the knee bone .…
Neck bone connected to the head bone .
My reason for associating Keynesian economics with this song is that just as one bone is connected to another in the song , so in textbooks expounding the Keynesian system , each separate but connected piece of the anatomy of that system — a bone , if you will — is presented in a series of successively connected diagrams totaling as many as eleven in all .
Each one of the diagrams repeats an axis of the one before it .
Thus , in the Keynesian system , the " production function " is connected to the " IS curve " ; the " IS curve " is connected to the " saving function " ; the " saving function " is connected to the " saving - equals - investment line " ; the " saving - equals - investment line " is connected to the " marginal efficiency of capital schedule " ; the " marginal efficiency of capital schedule " is connected back to the " IS curve " ; the " IS curve " is connected to the " aggregate demand curve … "
The diagram below , which is from the first edition of Joseph P. McKenna 's Aggregate Economic Analysis , depicts all the various relationships involved .
Anatomy of the Keynesian System
Just as in the case of the highly simplified labor - union version , the ultimate conclusion drawn from this extensive series of connections is that full employment cannot be achieved in a free market , because , once again , a fall in wage rates allegedly turns out to be incapable of increasing the quantity of labor demanded .
Even though the two versions of Keynesianism reach the same conclusion , they differ profoundly in the complexity of their explanations .
And as a result , they require separate critiques .
In the textbook version , the reason that a fall in wage rates allegedly cannot reduce unemployment is not that it automatically reduces spending in the economic system .
Keynes is willing to concede that initially spending might remain the same or even increase and that at the lower wage rates it would in fact employ additional workers .
He writes :
Perhaps it will help to rebut the crude conclusion that a reduction in money - wages will increase employment " because it reduces the cost of production " , if we follow up the course of events on the hypothesis most favourable to this view , namely that at the outset entrepreneurs expect the reduction in money - wages to have this effect .
It is indeed not unlikely that the individual entrepreneur , seeing his own costs reduced , will overlook at the outset the repercussions on the demand for his product and will act on the assumption that he will be able to sell at a profit a larger output than before .
( General Theory , p. 261 )
The basic problem , Keynes contends , lies in what would happen next , if the fall in wage rates did in fact manage to increase the volume of employment .
Continuing in the very same paragraph , he argues that the effect of the greater employment would be a fall in the rate of profit ( which he usually calls " the marginal efficiency of capital " ) below the lowest rate that is sufficient to induce investment .
This would serve to make the employment of additional workers no longer worthwhile and result in employment being pushed back to its previous figure .
In his words ( to which I 've taken the liberty of adding explanatory comments , which appear in brackets ) :
If , then , entrepreneurs generally act on this expectation , will they in fact succeed in increasing their profits ?
Only if the community 's marginal propensity to consume is equal to unity , so that there is no gap between the increment of income and the increment of consumption [ i.e. , there is no additional saving ] ; or if there is an increase in investment , corresponding to the gap between the increment of income and the increment of consumption , which will only occur if the schedule of marginal efficiencies of capital has increased relatively to the rate of interest [ i.e. , either the mec schedule must somehow move to the right , which there is allegedly no reason for its doing , or the rate of interest must fall , which it can't do , because it is allegedly already at its lowest acceptable rate , which is usually assumed to be 2 percent ] .
Thus the proceeds realised from the increased output will disappoint the entrepreneurs and employment will fall back again to its previous figure , unless the marginal propensity to consume is equal to unity [ i.e. , there is no additional saving ] or the reduction in money - wages has had the effect of increasing the schedule of marginal efficiencies of capital relatively to the rate of interest and hence the amount of investment [ Keynes means , of course , increase the amount of investment that is worthwhile — i.e. , yields 2 percent or more ] .
For if entrepreneurs offer employment on a scale which , if they could sell their output at the expected price , would provide the public with incomes out of which they would save more than the amount of current investment , entrepreneurs are bound to make a loss equal to the difference ; and this will be the case absolutely irrespective of the level of money wages .
I have italicized the last sentence because , if any single sentence of Keynes can express the theoretical substance of his doctrine , that is the one .
Here is the line of argument Keynes is presenting in the passage above and which is depicted in the graphical analysis .
The employment of more workers results in more production , which at the same time means more real income .
By a process of equivocation , which I note here , but will not make a major issue of , real income suddenly becomes interchangeable with money income , out of which saving and cash hoarding can potentially take place .
Saving , according to Keynes and his followers , is a mathematical function of income , such that more income results in more saving , e.g. , 20 percent of each additional dollar of income is saved , while 80 percent of each additional dollar of income is consumed .
The extra saving relative to extra income is called " the marginal propensity to save , " while the extra consumption relative to extra income is called " the marginal propensity to consume . "
The names of the full mathematical functions are " the saving function " and " the consumption function . "
As the quotation indicates , the existence of saving allegedly creates a problem .
If there were no additional saving as employment and income increased , there would be nothing to stop the additional employment achieved as the result of a fall in wage rates from being maintained .
But saving creates the potential for cash hoarding .
Cash hoarding , in the Keynesian system need not automatically and necessarily occur every time there is saving .
Potentially , additional saving might be offset by equivalent additional investment .
If it were , that would put the money saved back into the spending stream .
In this case too , the additional employment achieved as the result of a fall in wage rates could be maintained .
The problem that arises , according to Keynes and his followers , is that the additional investment required is the cause of a fall in the " marginal efficiency of capital , " i.e. , the rate of profit or rate of return on capital .
The effect of achieving full employment , believe the Keynesians , would be an increase in the volume of saving to such an extent that it would require an offsetting increase in the volume of investment of such a magnitude that the rate of return on capital would allegedly be driven to an unacceptably low level .
( Below 2 percent is the figure usually assumed . )
In response to a rate of return less than the minimum acceptable rate , funds would be withdrawn from investment and hoarded .
This would reduce spending throughout the economic system and cause the return of unemployment .
The fundamental problem , say the Keynesians , is that the existence of full employment would impose an unacceptably low rate of return on capital and therefore could not be maintained if it were achieved .
The return of unemployment would be necessary because by reducing output / income , it would reduce the volume of saving , since less income results in less saving .
With saving reduced , less investment is required to offset it in order to prevent hoarding .
And with less investment , the rate of return on capital will be higher .
Keynes 's whole argument depends on the rate of profit falling as the end result of the increase in employment and output .
If the rate of profit did not fall , if it stayed the same or rose as employment and output increased on the foundation of a fall in wage rates and prices , there would be absolutely nothing standing in the way of the achievement of full employment by means of a fall in wages and prices .
Clearly , it is essential to examine Keynes 's argument that the rate of profit ( mec ) declines as investment increases .
For his whole analysis depends on it .
In explaining it , he writes :
If there is an increased investment in any given type of capital during any period of time , the marginal efficiency of that type of capital will diminish as the investment in it is increased , partly because the prospective yield will fall as the supply of that type of capital is increased , and partly because , as a rule , pressure on the facilities for producing that type of capital will cause its supply price to increase . …
Thus for each type of capital we can build up a schedule , showing by how much investment in it will have to increase within the period , in order that its marginal efficiency should fall to any given figure .
We can then aggregate these schedules for all the different types of capital , so as to provide a schedule relating the rate of aggregate investment to the corresponding marginal efficiency of capital in general which that rate of investment will establish .
We shall call this the investment demand - schedule ; or , alternatively , the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital .
( General Theory , p. 136 )
Keynes 's reference to the prospective yield on capital falling is usually divided into two related aspects : a decline in the prospective selling prices of products as stepped up investment increases their supply , and also a decline in the physical amount of additional product produced per successive equal increment of additional investment .
Thus , for example , each additional $ 10 billion of investment in the economic system might be imagined to result in increments of product that would sell for less and less because of increases in the supply of products and that would also bring in less and less because the physical size of the increases was smaller and smaller .
Thus the first $ 10 billion of additional investment might be imagined to result in 1 million units of additional product that would sell at a price of $ 100 each .
The second $ 10 billion , however , would supposedly result only in an additional 900 thousand units of product , which would sell at a price of , say , $ 95 each .
By the same token , the third $ 10 billion of additional investment might result in only 800 thousand units of additional product that would sell for $ 90 per unit , and so on .
Clearly , the extra revenue accompanying equal extra increments of investment would fall under these conditions .
And since that extra revenue is the source of the profit on the investment , it seems to follow that the rate of profit would decline as investment increased .
In addition , of course , Keynes refers to a rising " supply price " for the various types of capital goods as their production expands in response to the additional demand constituted by additional investment .
Thus , in his view , the rate of profit declines as investment increases because more investment both raises the prices of capital goods and at the same time operates to reduce their yields in terms of revenue .
Keynes 's Bait and Switch
When Keynes 's explanation of the falling " marginal efficiency of capital , " just quoted , is taken in conjunction with his previously quoted explanation of why a fall in wage rates allegedly cannot succeed in overcoming unemployment , it turns out that what is present is something similar to the technique of a dishonest salesmen who begins by appearing to offer something that is very different from what he actually ends up offering , i.e. , the technique known as " bait and switch . "
When Keynes tries to explain the alleged impossibility of full employment being achieved by virtue of a fall in wage rates , he is clearly talking about the alleged impossibility of a fall in wage rates achieving full employment .
But when all is said and done , what this alleged impossibility turns out to rest upon is not at all consistent with a fall in wage rates .
To the contrary , in the last analysis Keynes 's argument against the ability of a fall in wage rates to achieve full employment depends on the absence of a fall in wage rates , indeed , on their rise .
The fall in the " marginal efficiency of capital " / rate of profit that supposedly results from investment having to be pushed beyond its worthwhile limit in order to offset all of the saving taking place out of the level of income resulting from full employment , and which allegedly prevents full employment from being achieved more than very temporarily — that fall turns out to depend on wage rates not falling , indeed , rising .
Consider .
Why should a fall in the selling prices of products serve to reduce profitability if that fall has been preceded by a fall in wage rates and in the prices of existing capital goods , i.e. , in the costs of production , which is the situation under discussion ?
It would be reasonable to argue that a fall in selling prices serves to reduce profits if it were not preceded by a fall in wage rates and the prices of existing capital goods , but not when it is so preceded .
What Keynes has done here is to substitute the effects of a fall in selling prices on the rate of profit in the absence of a preceding fall in wage rates and the prices of existing capital goods for its alleged effect in the presence of such a preceding fall .
The same point applies even more strongly to the alleged decline in yields based on declines in physical increments of product accompanying additional increments of investment .
Here Keynes and his followers take for granted the supply of labor and consider the effects on output merely of successive equal increments of investment .
But this too is a total contradiction of the situation under discussion .
That situation , recall , is whether or not the re-employment of masses of previously unemployed workers can be maintained following a fall in wage rates and the prices of existing capital goods .
Keynes and his followers say no , in part because of alleged diminishing physical returns to additional increments of capital investment .
Here they ignore the fact that the situation under discussion implies an increase in the supply of labor employed far in excess of any secondary , derivative increase in the supply of capital goods that might come about as the result of additional saving taking place as the by - product of full employment .
Going from a state of mass unemployment to full employment implies a correspondingly large reduction in the ratio of accumulated capital to labor .
The supply of existing capital goods is what it is .
But going from , say , an unemployment rate of 25 percent , such as existed in the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s , to full employment , implies in increase in the supply of labor employed in the ratio of 4:3 .
This , in turn , implies a fall in the ratio of capital to labor to ¾ of its previous level .
Thus , if in the state of mass unemployment there were 12 units of capital in existence for every 3 workers employed , giving a ratio of capital to labor of 4:1 , now , with the employment of 4 workers for every 3 previously employed , the ratio of capital to labor falls to 3:1 .
With capital now less abundant relative to labor , i.e. , scarcer relative to labor , successive equal increments of investment should have substantially higher physical yields than they did in the state of mass unemployment .
Thus , if it were the case that physical increments of output accompanying increments of investment had a connection with the rate of profit , the rate of profit would have to be expected to rise as the accompaniment of the economic system going from a state of mass unemployment to full employment .
Even if at some point , after many years of full employment and accompanying additional saving , the ratio of capital to labor ultimately came to surpass what it had been in the period of mass unemployment , it would still be far less than it would be in the face of fresh mass unemployment .
Always , the employment of more labor serves to reduce the ratio of capital to labor and to have a correspondingly positive effect on physical yields to capital , all other things being equal .
The third alleged reason for the rate of profit falling as employment increases turns out to be no less bizarre and contradictory .
This is Keynes 's claim that pressure on the facilities for producing capital " will cause its supply price to increase . "
Since when do the prices of capital goods rise on a foundation of falling wage rates and costs of production ?
They would rise in a situation of rising wage rates and costs of production , but not falling wage rates and costs of production .
This is just another aspect of the switch Keynes has pulled off .
Further Problems with Keynesianism
The Keynesian argument is actually absurd on its face .
If one looks at its so - called IS curve , one sees a relationship purporting to show that as output and , implicitly , employment increase along the horizontal axis , the " marginal efficiency of capital " / rate of profit falls on the vertical axis .
The economic system is allegedly locked into a state of permanent mass unemployment because the rate of return is already as low as it is possible for it to go consistent with investment being worthwhile , while full employment would result in an even lower rate of return .
What this means is that the economic system cannot achieve full employment and recovery , because if it did , the rate of profit would be lower in the recovery than it is in the depths of the depression .
There is another problem .
A leading doctrine of the Keynesians is the " investment multiplier . "
According to this doctrine , every additional dollar of investment results in an induced rise in consumption spending and thus in substantially more than a dollar of additional spending overall , perhaps $ 2 or $ 3 .
This additional spending is held to be synonymous with additional national income .
While national income is composed essentially of profits and wages , the Keynesians seem to overlook the fact that additional national income implies additional profits .
If profits were just 10 percent of national income , and the multiplier were just 2 , every additional dollar of investment would imply 20 cents of additional profits in the economic system .
What this in turn implies is that the rate of profit in the economic system must be rising in the direction of 20 percent , i.e. , that more investment has a powerful positive effect on the rate of profit .
In a Recovery , Investment and Profits Move Together
The Keynesian claim is that the additional investment that accompanies additional employment reduces the rate of profit .
The strongest argument against this claim is the fact that in the context of a business cycle , investment and profits move together , virtually dollar for dollar .
Profit in the economic system is the totality of business sales revenues minus the totality of the costs deducted from those sales revenues .
Net investment is the totality of business productive expenditure , i.e. , wage payments plus purchases of newly produced capital goods , minus the very same costs that are deducted from sales revenues in arriving at profits .
Since productive expenditure is the source of the great bulk of the sales revenues of the economic system , the only difference between net investment and profits in the economic system is the extent to which sales revenues exceed productive expenditure .
The reason that net investment equals productive expenditure minus costs is that productive expenditure represents additions to the value of accumulated assets , while costs represent subtractions from the value of accumulated assets .
For example , productive expenditures on account of inventory are added to the value of inventory accounts on the balance sheets of the firms making the expenditures .
Productive expenditures on account of plant and equipment are added to the gross plant accounts on the balance sheets of the firms making the expenditures .
In these ways , productive expenditures increase the value of accumulated assets on the books of business firms .
By the same token , when firms make sales out of inventory , the value of inventory accounts is reduced by the cost value of the goods sold , which cost value enters into the income statements of firms , under the heading " cost of goods sold . "
Similarly , as time passes , plant and equipment undergo depreciation .
Depreciation allowances are accumulated in depreciation reserves , which are subtracted from the gross plant accounts , leaving net plant accounts .
The same amount of depreciation that is deducted from gross plant — and thereby reduces net plant — enters into the income statements of firms as depreciation cost .
If " cost of goods sold , " is subtracted from productive expenditure for inventory , the difference is the net change , i.e. , the net investment , in inventory .
If depreciation cost is subtracted from productive expenditure on account of plant and equipment , the difference is the net change , i.e. , the net investment , in net plant and equipment .
There is a third major component of productive expenditure and costs , namely , productive expenditures that are not additions to any asset account and which are thus costs deducted from sales revenues in the very instant in which they are made ; selling , general , and administrative expenses are can be taken as examples .
When productive expenditures that constitute selling , general , or administrative expenses are added to the productive expenditures on account of inventory and plant , the result is total productive expenditure .
When these productive expenditures are added as costs to cost of goods sold and depreciation cost , the result is the total costs deducted from sales revenues in calculating profits .
Since this is a matter of equals being added to unequals , the amount of net investment equals the totality of productive expenditure minus the totality of business costs .
In the context of recovery from a depression , a rise in productive expenditure should be expected to constitute a virtually equivalent rise in business sales revenues .
If costs in the economic system remained the same , profits and net investment would obviously rise to exactly the same extent .
The additional productive expenditure in its capacity as the source of additional sales revenues would raise profits equivalently .
In its capacity simply as additional productive expenditure , it would raise net investment equivalently .
Thus the rise in profits and the rise in net investment would be equal .
Insofar as total business costs might increase at the same time that productive expenditure and sales revenue rose , the rise both in net investment and profits would be equivalently diminished .
In any event profits and net investment would increase together , dollar for dollar .
The implication of this is that the economy - wide average rate of profit rises in the direction of 100 percent .
This is the ratio found by dividing equal additions to profits and to capital invested .
Capital invested rises to the exact same extent as net investment and additional net investment .
In the same way , as was shown very early in this article , if costs in the economic system could be made to fall , say , by virtue of productive expenditure being shifted from wage payments to purchases of durable capital goods , profits and net investment would both rise equally .
The upshot is that to the extent that additional net investment accompanies the additional employment made possible by a fall in wage rates , the rate of profit increases , and increases the more , the greater is the increase in net investment .
Keynes and his followers simply could not be more wrong about this subject .
In a Depression , Saving and Net Investment Are Negative
Closely related to the above , is another major error .
This is the belief of Keynes and his followers that in the depths of depression and its accompanying mass unemployment , saving and investment are at their maximum tolerable limits .
Allegedly , they are already as great as it is possible for them to be consistent with the rate of return on capital still being high enough to make investment worthwhile .
The problem , say the Keynesians , is that full employment would result in still more saving , which would require still more investment to offset it , and which in turn would drive the already barely acceptable rate of return still lower , below the minimum acceptable rate .
Contrary to Keynes and his followers , the truth is that so far removed are saving and investment from being at their maximum tolerable limits in the conditions of depression and mass unemployment , that in reality they are both negative .
For example , in the Great Depression of the 1930s , corporate saving ( undistributed corporate profits ) was negative in every year from 1930 to 1936 and again in 1938 ; personal saving was negative in 1932 and 1933 and barely more than zero in 1934 ; net investment was negative in the years 1931 to 1935 and again in 1938 .
There should be nothing surprising in this .
In a depression , business firms suffer widespread losses .
What they are losing is a portion of their accumulated savings .
Even many firms that manage to earn profits consume accumulated savings in a depression .
This is the case to the extent that their profits are insufficient to cover the dividends they pay .
Similarly , unemployed wage earners deplete their previously accumulated savings in consuming without the benefit of wages to provide the necessary funds .
Net investment becomes negative as the result of the exact same process that wipes out profits , namely , a sharp decline in productive expenditure , which results from the need to rebuild cash holdings in the aftermath of the end of the credit expansion of the preceding boom .
The decline in productive expenditure wipes out profits insofar as it serves to reduce business sales revenues in the face of depreciation costs and costs of goods sold that reflect the higher levels of productive expenditure of the past .
The decline in productive expenditure in the face of those same depreciation costs and costs of goods sold equivalently reduces net investment .
As explained previously , the demand for money for cash holding is also increased by a failure of wage rates to fall .
And the decline in productive expenditure becomes greater still insofar as banks fail and the quantity of money is reduced .
The effect is to further reduce productive expenditure , sales revenues , profits , and net investment .
In the light of such knowledge , it is difficult to imagine a theory that is more at odds with economic principles and obvious facts of reality than Keynesianism .
Conclusion
The essential conclusions to be drawn from this lengthy analysis is that once the process of financial contraction in a depression comes to an end , and existing business assets have been re-priced to reflect the deflationary aftermath of credit expansion — once this has occurred , a fall in wage rates will in fact serve to achieve the reemployment of the unemployed .
Moreover , it will do so in such way that the increase in employment is more than proportionate to the fall in wage rates .
At the same time , as part of the same process , the decrease in the demand for money for cash holding that occurs in response to the necessary fall in wage rates , manifests itself in a rise in productive expenditure not only for labor but also for capital goods .
As the result of the rise in productive expenditure , sales revenues , profits , and net investment in the economic system all rise together .
The fall in wage rates thus serves as an essential component of a full and complete economic recovery , one that entails full employment and the achievement of a substantially increased rate of profit that will be more than sufficient to make investment worthwhile .
The economic policy that is implied by these findings of economic theory is one of a fully free labor market .
That is , a labor market free of coercive labor - union interference , free of minimum - wage laws , and free of all other laws that mandate expenditures by employers on behalf of the workers they employ .
All legal obstacles in the way of wage rates falling , counting as part of wages the cost of so - called fringe benefits , must be swept aside .
This is the policy that will allow the cost of employing labor to fall and thus the quantity of labor demanded to increase , and will thereby achieve the employment of everyone able and willing to work , i.e. , full employment .
Beyond Keynesianism : Marxism
While essential , the overthrow of Keynesianism is insufficient for being able to implement the policy of a free labor market .
It is insufficient because Keynesianism constitutes merely the outer ring of the defenses of the policy of government interference in the labor market .
The inner ring , which Keynesianism has served to protect up to now , is the errors and contradictions of Marxism .
Marxism holds that a free market in labor is a vehicle for the exploitation of labor .
It claims that in the absence of government intervention in the form of pro-union and minimum - wage and maximum - hours legislation , employers would be free to drive wage rates to or even below the level of minimum subsistence , while lengthening the hours of work beyond the limits of human endurance , and imposing conditions of work that are nightmarish .
Because of Keynesianism , the immense majority of economists have been able to avoid having to confront Marxism .
They have been able to hide behind the Keynesian doctrine that even if a free market in labor existed , it would not be able to eliminate mass unemployment .
And thus they have been able to believe that there is simply no point in fighting for a free market in labor .
Being able to believe this , I 'm convinced , has been a source of great comfort and relief for most economists and thus a major source of their readiness to accept Keynesianism despite the obviously absurd nature of some of its claims , such as that " Pyramid - building , earthquakes , even wars may serve to increase wealth , if the education of our statesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the way of anything better " ( General Theory , p. 129 ) .
Keynesianism has spared them from having to do battle with practically the entire rest of the intellectual world , which has accepted Marxism as constituting a full and accurate description of what happens under laissez - faire capitalism .
In the absence of Keynesianism , economists who understood such elementary propositions as that quantity demanded rises as price falls would be obliged to argue for the repeal of pro-union and minimum - wage legislation .
They would perceive such interferences as causing and perpetuating mass unemployment .
But to do this , they themselves would have to understand why laissez - faire capitalism does not in fact result in any exploitation of labor and how , indeed , it is the foundation of progressively rising real wages , shortening of hours , and improvement in working conditions .
The immense majority of today 's economists — and those of the past several generations — has lacked both this essential knowledge and any will , or even mere willingness , to acquire it .
They lack the will because they have no philosophical commitment to the value of individual rights and individual freedom and thus no basis for being prepared to challenge claims that these must be sacrificed for the sake of avoiding poverty .
They are light years from understanding that it is precisely respect for individual rights and individual freedom that is the essential foundation of prosperity , including , as leading examples , full employment and high and progressively rising real wages .
Keynesianism has been a refuge for masses of economists badly deficient in understanding of economics and equally lacking in essential aspects of moral character , namely , in abhorrence of the use of physical force for any purpose but that of self - defense , and in an equal abhorrence of blatant irrationalism , such as manifested in Keynes 's claims about the economic value of wars and earthquakes .
Content with the unchecked growing use of physical force by government in all aspect of the life of the individual , and often taking delight in the ability to confuse the minds of students by convincing them that the absurd is true , they are completely at home in Keynesianism .
Hopefully , the overthrow of Keynesianism will set the stage for the appearance of a body of intellectuals with a far better understanding of economics than that of today 's economists , an understanding which they will join to a philosophical commitment to the values of Freedom and Reason .
Thus armed , there will be a group of intellectuals able to take on the rest of the intellectual world and start to overcome the ideas that have made today 's colleges and universities more into centers of civilization - destroying intellectual disease than centers of knowledge and education .

It is unfortunately a common human reaction to respond to criticism by attacking those leveling the criticism , rather than addressing the points being made .
This is especially true if the criticism is legitimate and one cannot reasonably counter it .
Substantive criticism is also a central part of the scientific endeavor , and so the culture of science has developed a tolerance for harsh criticism and a general understanding that the only proper response is with logic and evidence .
Examples of exceptions are legion , human frailty being what it is , but you cannot live in the world of science for long without learning the rules of the game .
Peers are expected to pull no punches when criticizing the errors or countering the arguments of their colleagues .
Everyone is expected to be their own harshest critic ( criticize your own data before someone has a chance to ) .
And when criticized yourself , acknowledge what is legitimate and make appropriate corrections , but feel free to defend yourself against weak criticisms by pointing out additional data , interpretations , or errors in the arguments of your critics .
This meat grinder approach to scientific discourse works .
Slowly , bad ideas and claims are beaten down , and only good ideas have the stamina to persist .
But here at science - based medicine we engage not only with the scientific community , but also with the public , and with those on the fringes of science .
This means we often engage with those who do not play by the rules of science .
A recent example is that of J.B. Handley from Age of Autism .
David Gorski and I ( and later Mark Crislip ) wrote blog entries criticizing their 14 studies website with a detailed analysis .
Handley responded with a full frontal personal assault sprinkled with irrelevant accusations .
He ignored the vast majority of our actual criticisms , and those few he took on he completely botched .
Sometimes the targets of scientific criticism respond with another tactic – the diversion .
Rather than make an obvious ad hominem attack , they try to distract the public ( often the real target of the exchange ) from the points of the criticism with a series of non sequiturs .
They try to “ re - frame ” the discussion to make it about something other than the scientific evidence .
Creationists recently have been masters of this latter tactic .
On scientific grounds , there is no debate about evolution .
The overwhelming majority of the scientific community agrees that evolution happened , there is common descent , and natural selection is a dominant mechanism .
Creationists cannot win this fight scientifically ( though they keep trying ) , and so they try to distract from the science by trying to make it a political debate .
So they accuse scientists of being dogmatic , of trying to exclude creationists from the debate , or for unfairly eliminating supernatural explanations from consideration .
First they tried “ teach the ( fake ) controversy , ” and now they are trying “ teach the strengths and ( fake ) weaknesses ” of evolution .
Those who promote unscientific claims in medicine are no different .
When scientists bother to examine their claims and level the sort of criticism typical of the scientific community at them , they often respond with some combination of personal attacks and distraction .
Last week I criticised the Huffington Post for running a series of blogs and articles that are promoting dangerously pseudoscientific medical claims .
I specifically commented on an outrageous article by Kim Evans , promoting the absurd claim that all cancers are caused by fungal infections , which in turn are caused by antibiotics .
Evans has responded ( sort of ) with this week ’s column , in which she addresses her critics , without naming anyone in particular .
Her response is right out of the pseudoscientific health claim play book , under “ how to distract from legitimate criticism with logical fallacies and misdirection . ”
We have literally heard it all before , and have even answered much of it in detail .
I will therefore not reiterate points that have been made before but will link to them .
She begins :
In a recent post I got a lot of flack for not speaking like a scientist .
Something in that rubs me the wrong way because it presumes that only by a very narrow method can we come to any valid conclusions or make any new discoveries about the world we live in – while also presuming that only a tiny portion of the population , with a very specific set of skills and communication methods , has the ability to do so .
Here she is combing two common tactics – the claim that her critics are being elitist and that science it too narrow to encompass her wisdom ( and she goes much further on these themes in the following paragraphs ) .
Rather , she was criticized for promoting a dangerous health scam and not even attempting to justify it with anything resembling acceptable scientific evidence .
In response to this criticism she did not either acknowledge the lack of evidence or provide references to such evidence – instead she “ reframed ” the criticism as being equivalent to saying that she is not in the club – an obvious appeal to elitism .
( Handley , by the way , pulled the exact same ploy . )
She might as well have written that we were trying to “ expel ” her from the scientific discussion , because what she is doing is exactly the same as the Intelligent Design proponents tactics used in the movie by that name .
First she states that she was criticized for not behaving like a scientist , then she states , essentially , that science is not all its cracked up to be anyway .
At least she is being openly anti-science .
This attitude derives from the premise that the methods of science are optional – just one way of knowing how nature works .
This is , in my opinion , the core of the struggle between science - based medicine and everything else .
But which rules of science , I wonder , would Evans recommend we abandon when it suits us ?
Should we ignore inconvenient evidence rather than take a systematic approach , use ambiguous criteria that are susceptible to bias , or not control for confounding variables ?
There is nothing magical or arbitrary about the methods of science – they are merely careful observation and intellectual honesty rigorously applied .
To say this is a “ narrow ” approach is to misunderstand science or a deliberate distraction .
Next she launches into the toxin gambit :
A study in 2005 found that newborns are being born with literally hundreds of chemicals in their bloodstream , many of them known to cause cancer .
Most people eat pesticides and herbicides in their every meal .
I do n’t need to tell you that these substances are designed to kill living organisms , because you already know that , but might I remind you that you , too , are a living organism .
Rocket fuel has been found in milk .
Drugs and birth control have been found in the water .
The only evidence she provides to support her claims is a link to a Newsweek article .
This is acceptable form in general for a blog , but does not do much to bolster her claims .
The referenced article does site several studies that found detectable levels of various chemicals in the general population , but it also cites two NIH reviews of this data .
The first found that there was little cause for concern , and the second that , based on animal data , there may be cause for concern and further study is necessary .
This hardly supports the alarm bell Evans is ringing .
First , this does not have anything to do with the criticisms of her original article , which was about antibiotics and cancer .
But that aside , her hysterical warnings about toxins , like most health care pseudoscience , has a kernel of truth .
There are toxins in the environment , and it is plausible that some of them may reach levels that have health effects .
We should be eternally vigilant about what substances we put into our environment and our bodies and monitor their health effects .
On the other hand – toxicity is always about dose .
Most substances decried as toxins are in such low doses that they likely do not have any health effects .
For some we do need more evidence , and maybe even changes in policy .
This is likely to be forever a moving target as technology and industry advances .
Policy should be based on evidence – not vague fears .
Also , her use of the word “ chemical ” is misleading .
The environment is loaded with naturally - occurring chemicals .
We are made of chemicals .
It is not enough to say that chemicals exist in our environment .
And keep in mind all of this is to promote her health claims – that cleansing toxins has health benefits .
That is an entirely separate claim that is not supported by evidence or much plausibility .
Next up is the claim that doctors and mainstream medicine kill patients .
So , while all of this looms and is largely unaccounted for in the standard health care equation , critics judge harshly alternative views and hail a system that ’s been found to kill almost 200,000 people a year due to preventable errors .
The same system has been found to kill another 100,000 annually with drugs , and seriously harm another 2.1 million each year by the same means .
They hail “ proven ” methods for cancer that are known to cause significant damage to the immune system , and are even known to be carcinogenic , which means to cause cancer .
So , I ask , “ Is this rational ? ”
Harriet Hall has already dealt with this claim .
First , it is a tu quoque logical fallacy .
We all want better safer medicine .
Failing to meet that goal in one arena does not justify pseudoscience in another .
Further , these numbers are highly misleading ( and almost certainly overstated ) because they only consider the harm of intervention .
But medical decision - making is about risk vs benefit .
We need to know if the interventions in question save more people than they harm .
The standard in mainstream medicine is that each intervention should be backed by high quality evidence that its benefits outweigh its risks .
Further , we are always trying to minimize risk whenever possible .
And the principle of informed consent dictates that we give that information to patients and let them decide if the benefits outweigh the risks for them .
Evan ’s claimed treatments do not meet that standard , but she tries to distract from that criticism with the above non sequitur .
She concludes :
Oh wait , that ’s exactly where we are now …
So , in light of the numbers above and all of the proof that ’s literally walking around next to us , maybe it ’s time we started looking at and thinking about things a little differently .
Because if a reliance on proven demonstrated science has gotten us exactly to the situation I describe above , perhaps a shift of focus to rational is the best move we can make .
Many of the commenters for this entry pointed out that science - based medicine has doubled the human life expectancy – that is also part of the situation .
But again – at least she is flying her anti-scientific flag high and proud .
Evans wants us to abandon science at our whim , certainly long enough to buy her book .
She somehow twists logic to argue that this is “ rational ” , but she gets there only by abusing the evidence – by exaggerating risks and ignoring benefits .
Evan ’s rant , typical of those in her camp , is once again just another long rationalization for not wanting to play by the fair and honest rules of science because logic and evidence does not support her claims .
Web Developing in Linux
Linux is an excellent platform for web development since most web development tools such as , Apache , MySQL , PHP , SVN , and SSH were created for Linux .
This advantage gives us an edge over developing in other operating systems ; however , many people make the switch to Linux not knowing which apps to use .
In this post we will try to remedy this .
Text editor
Vim/emacs
I recommend Vim / Emacs because they are a console based text editor .
This means you can connect to a remote machine and use it to edit files .
Your configuration never changes and almost every distribution includes Vi / Vim by default including popular web hosts like Dreamhost .
This allows you to hop on a friends Windows / Mac computer and be up and running in your same exact development environment that you normally use .
In addition , once learned , vim / emacs has the potential to increase your productivity over even the best text editors and IDEs .
Ubuntu systems come with a limited version of Vim to get the complete version click here .
or use this command :
sudo apt - get install vim-full
If you want to know more about Vim I wrote an article on Eric Wendelin ’s site .
Aptana Studio
Aptana Studio is another option for those of you that just ca n’t get away from an IDE style editor .
You can download Aptana from their website .
The standalone package is about 110 mb , which is quite large to just do some simple web editing but I am a bit biased on editor size as Vim including the source code is less than 7 mb .
If you do decide to go with Aptana you will need to follow these instructions .
Other Options
So , you do n’t have the time to learn Vim or already used to a specific editor and looking for something else ?
No problem , Linux comes with tons of different options for editors from the Windows WYSIWYG clones , simple text editors , to even familiar editors like jEdit .
Web Server : Apache , MySQL , PHP
Apache MySQL , PHP combination web servers are by far the most prevalent and it is always better to develop in an environment that is as close to the production as possible .
This makes Linux a particularly good OS choice for web development as it does n’t get any closer .
Developing on a Linux system makes utilizing these applications easier as they were originally designed for this operating system .
This will get you up and running fast : Installing Apache Mysql and PHP on Ubuntu 8.10
FTP
Lets face it you need an FTP client if you are doing web development .
You will find yourself needing to upload an image or upload that fresh copy of Wordpress ; although , lately I have been using SVN to transfer development files to production and FTP is cut out of the loop entirely .
gFTP
FileZilla
Another option is FileZilla .
I use this FTP in Windows and you might not want to migrate to gFTP if you are already used to FileZilla .
Version Control
When I was talking about using SVN above this is what I was talking about , version control .
Version control is an awesome way for developers to collaborate on projects while limiting the risk of work being written over .
It also stores past versions ( hence version control ) in case you decide to switch back to a previous version or abandon terribly written code that just broke your website .
Subversion - Currently seems to be the most popular version control
Git - Gaining popularity and initially developed by Linus Torvalds
Image Manipulation
Well , websites just are n’t the same without images .
Fortunately there are quite a few apps at our disposal .
Because Adobe Photoshop ’s save for web feature does n’t cut it .
Gimp -
This is like the all in one photo manipulation suite .
You could compare this to Adobe Photoshop .
Inkscape - Vector based image program that totally rocks !
Compare this to Adobe Illustrator
ImageMagick -
This is one of those swiss army knifes for image manipulation .
It is the basis of many Windows , Linux image programs and can be embedded in PHP .
You can use it to create batch scripts that convert many images at once , the possibilities are endless .
pngcrush - I have found that Photoshop ’s save for web feature does n’t fully compress images .
Pngcrush eliminates this inefficiency .
jpegtran - Jpeg does the same as pngcrush only for jpg images .
But I HAVE to have Photoshop what can I do ?
Photoshop is n’t the most simplistic program around and I understand you have put a lot of working learning its features and getting used to the way it works .
For this reason we can run Photoshop under Linux using either Virtualization or Wine .
Since Adobe has n’t released a Linux version of Photoshop we can’t run it natively but we get close using a program called Wine .
Google has recently helped out and made Adobe Photoshop CS2 work reasonably well under Wine .
If Adobe CS2 is n’t good enough and you want to run bleeding edge Adobe products unfortunately you are going to have to take a performance hit and install VirtualBox or another virtualization application .
The good news however , is that you can run any “ Windows only ” app you want along side your Adobe Photoshop .
Using this to our advantage we might as well have IE7 or IE6 installed on the virtual machine for testing .
Firefox Extensions
Firebug -
What can I say , when it comes to debugging JavaScript and finding CSS tags fast firebug is simply an amazing plugin .
ColorZilla -
This is a handy plugin to get colors from various sources .
YSlow - If you care about your site ’s load time ( and you should ) YSlow is an awesome plugin .
Compression
Speaking of making your site load fast , Linux has some great compression tools available .
YUI Compressor -
An awesome CSS minifier and also works with JavaScript
CSSTidy - Although I like the YUI Compressor this one does pretty much the same thing
Miscellaneous
Even those these are filled under Miscellaneous does n’t mean they are n’t entirely awesome !
wget - Create scripts and downloaders , wget can download everything .
LinkChecker -
This is similar to wget but it checks for broken links
curl -
If you are working wtih online XML APIs curl can retrieve it .
For example you can interact with google data services using curl following this guide or communicate via twitter .
Python - Great scripting language at your disposal that often comes with most Linux distributions .
Perl -
Great scripting language at your disposal that often comes with most Linux distributions .
Microsoft ’s TrueType Core Fonts for Linux - I would stay away from these for the most part as you are going to want to code your site to look good even on Linux ( free as in freedom ) fonts although they are nice to have .
If you really want to gain an edge you can always learn how to use sed and awk .
A reader writes :
I 'm getting tired of the self - congratulatory notes from potheads .
Sure , probably marijuana should be legalized .
But how is this issue a major priority ?
In a world where we have climate change , peak oil , species extinction , geopolitical instability , nuclear proliferation , economic collapse , religious extremism , not to mention the issues of education and health care to concern ourselves with , should n't we try to focus on things at that level first -- the really important things ?
Then stuff like gay marriage and the poor whiny pot smokers .
The first is one of the most basic civil rights enumerated in Constitutional history , and civil rights , in my book , are far more important than the economy .
The second is a core freedom - the right to grow a frigging plant in your own backyard .
For me , freedom is always primary .
It is the core political value .
The Dish will continue to cover the economy , climate change ( my last column was on the subject ) , Iraq , Afghanistan , and all sorts of other issues .
But the attacks on core freedoms in America are my priority and covering them is my prerogative .
And I 'm tired of hearing that the basic rights of Americans are unimportant - just because those Americans are gay or , God forbid , smoke a little weed .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

' I was shocked to be diagnosed with a malignant melanoma after visiting sunbeds twice - weekly '
By Sadie Nicholas for MailOnline and Alison Smith Squire for MailOnline
From the age of 16 , Jenna Gurney 's twice - weekly visit to the tanning salon - spending 14 minutes ( the maximum allowed ) on a sunbed , costing 50 p a minute - was something of a ritual .
For £ 14 a week , she managed to keep her bronzed glow , adding to it with regular holidays in the sun where she would console herself that if she did get a little sunburned , that it would soon ' go brown anyway ' .
When , at 21 , Jenna noticed that a large , flat mole on her stomach had grown and become flaky , she was concerned enough to go to her GP .
But she never dreamed she would be told she had skin cancer .
Regrets : Jenna Gurney , left , and Darina Mulligan , right , were determined to maintain a year - round tan but now regret their addiction after Jenna developed a potentially deadly malignant melanoma and Darina too had a melanoma removed
Experts say a ' binge - tanning ' epidemic is to blame for increased rates in skin cancer cases
In fact , the cash administrator had the deadliest form , a malignant melanoma , which is the most common form of cancer affecting women in their 20s .
Jenna , who today is as zealous in her determination to protect herself in the sun as she once was to get a tan , describes how the prospect of a death sentence has made her wish she never used a sunbed .
' When I was a teenager , my friends and I used sunbeds all the time .
It was important to have a tan all year round and to top it up for nights out .
' I would always go somewhere sunny on holiday and getting a tan was my main aim .
Then , when I got home , I wanted to keep the tan , so I started using sunbeds .
' I would use them twice a week on average .
When I used sunbeds , I used an intensifier cream instead of any kind of protective sun lotion .
' On holiday , I did put on sun lotion , but never worried about reapplying it regularly or using a high factor . '
But then came a trip to her GP that changed everything .
Only one in four tanning salons have agreed to a voluntary ban on allowing under - 16s to use the booths
The doctor was immediately concerned when he saw the mole , advising that it should be removed .
' I still did n't think much of it , ' she says .
' Even though the risks were at the back of my mind , I 'm just one of those people who think it will never happen to me .
' But then the results came back and a nurse told me I had been diagnosed with a malignant melanoma .
It was a shock because I just had n't been expecting it .
As soon as someone says cancer , you think : " Am I going to die ? "
It 's scary . '
Jenna had to go into hospital to have an area of skin around the mole removed , along with lymph nodes from under her arm .
She then endured a nerve - racking wait to find out if the cancer had spread .
Fortunately , it had n't .
Since then , she has had to undergo six - monthly check - ups .
Today , the 28 - year - old still loves a tan , but prefers to fake it than run any risk of harming her skin in the sun or on a sunbed .
' If I could go back and have my time again , I would never use sunbeds , ' she says .
' I would n't want to go through the stress and worry of having cancer for the sake of a tan .
' I 've always liked the look of a healthy glow , but I am now really careful in the sun , stay in the shade and religiously apply sun lotion .
' I hope my story will make others aware of the risks of melanoma from using sunbeds . '
' Heavy price '
Darina Mulligan was another young woman determined to preserve a year - round golden tan .
She started using sunbeds 13 years ago because she wanted to improve her look , but today she is paying a heavy price for her vanity .
' The irony is that , probably as a result of using them , I have a three - inch scar on the inside of my right knee where I had a melanoma removed last August , ' says Darina , 31 , who runs her own event contracting company and lives in Balham , South London .
' As a teenager , I loved to get a tan on family holidays and associated looking well with having a golden glow .
It was purely a vanity thing , but was naive considering I have fair skin and freckles .
' The year I went to university , I 'd just returned from a holiday in Spain and a friend suggested that since I had such a lovely tan , I should keep it topped up by having a few sunbed sessions .
' I remember thinking : " Great , now I do n't even have to go on holiday to get a tan and I 'll still be brown at Christmas . "
' Unfortunately , after a couple of visits to the tanning salon , I was lured by an offer to buy a block of ten sessions at a reduced price .
' Even though I did n't use sunbeds every week , I used them regularly until I was 23 , going through phases of intensive use .
' Particularly before and after holidays , I 'd go on the sunbed in the belief that it would help build up a tan in the first instance , so that I had a head start when I hit the beach abroad and then maintain my colour when I returned home .
' When I look back at the logic I used it horrifies me , but the awareness about the risks of sunbeds and skin cancer was n't the same at that time .
I was no different to my friends - we all liked to look tanned .
' The only reason I stopped using sunbeds was because I went to Australia after university and met a friend who told me I really should n't be out in the sun .
' When I asked why not , she pulled down her T - shirt - I suddenly realised I 'd never seen her with her decolletage exposed - to reveal a frightening - looking chest covered in dark pigmentation marks and lines .
Shaken
' She explained that she 'd been a surfer in her 20s with a constant tan , and this damage had appeared only in recent years . '
Darina adds : ' After that , I stopped using sunbeds and took more care in the sun .
But a year ago I noticed that a freckle I 've always had on the inside of my right knee had changed shape , size and colour .
' It had always been dark and circular , but the edges had lightened and spread to give it a rugged outline .
' I 'd done some work helping to launch three mobile cancer awareness units with Cancer Research , and had taken more notice of my moles as a result .
Thank goodness I did .
' By August , I was concerned enough about my mole to see a nurse at a mole clinic , who advised me to have it removed immediately .
' My GP referred me to a specialist and , thanks to private healthcare , within a week I 'd had the mole removed under local anaesthetic .
As the surgeon excised it , he said he was certain it was a melanoma , and when the biopsy results confirmed this , I had to have another operation to remove the surrounding tissue . '
Luckily for Darina , the cancer had n't spread , but she was shaken by what had happened .
' There 's no proof that using sunbeds or sunbathing caused my cancer , but there 's every chance that it contributed to it .
If I knew 13 years ago what I know now , I would never have used a sunbed at all . '
Wow , if there were more such tennis players , I would go to see all their tennis matches .

You remember Wayne Osmond , do n't you ?
I hope I 'm writing to people who actually remember The Osmonds , the clean - cut , conservative , Mormon rock sensation that now personifies the ' 70s ; the band of brothers that got women screaming like they had n't since The Beatles .
To most people , Wayne Osmond would seem like someone who had it all : sitting on a pile of money , the adoration of his hyper - sexed female peers , and everything else that accompanies being at the height of popular culture .
Well , according to this documentary , Wayne really wanted to be a flight surgeon in the military .
Imagine that .
He was ready to give up money , fame , rock - and - roll , sex ... well , the promise of sex after all , if he wanted to violate his own religion 's stringent rules , and his parents ' even more stringent daily regimen of rehearsal .
But that 's just it .
He did n't .
Or rather , he could n't .
Wayne simply could not stand up to his parents and leave The Osmonds to pursue any other interests .
Exactly how does a son go against a father who gets him up every morning at the break of dawn with a bugle ?
His worldview is skewed by having a camera in his face before he reaches pre-pubescence , then add to that the pressure of being a Mormon , a lifestyle that puts tremendous demands on his personal behavior with a judgmental God peering down from above , topped off with authoritarian parents who have already take away childhood and freedom .
What 's left ?
An Osmond boy has to be obedient to his agent , the family business , his father , his mother , his church leaders , his fans , and the God of the Old Testament , whose anger gets kindled rather quickly sometimes , and with little warning .
Medical school is out ; obedience is in ...
Or else !
And the rewards , the incentives for giving up one 's interests , one 's very liberty , were in the millions for Wayne .
But the end result is the shocking information that is in that documentary I linked to above .
Most of this trouble in the Osmond household is probably new to you , if you 've only seen the show - biz side of them .
But then there 's Marie , a twice - divorced middle - aged woman who was molested as a child .
Like her brothers , she was stuck in front of the cameras at a very young age , and made to give up her girlhood in a slightly less horrible but equally appalling , unnatural fashion .
By her " God- fearing " parents .
Egged on by a theology that teaches , as so many of them do , that one of the biggest commandments is to " Honor thy father and thy mother " ( Exodus 20:12 ) , even if they are unavailable as confidants so that a molested girl can seek protection , even if they shove her in front of millions of strangers and tell her to smile .
An extreme example , no doubt .
After all , few of us get to live the extraordinary lives that The Osmonds did .
But it is a very high - profile example of the Culture of Obedience that permeates into one 's most private thoughts .
That family , to this day , even with the death of both authoritarian , fame - seeking parents , continues to perform and sell themselves as the smiling , wholesome entertainment alternative , probably because that 's all they know .
Even panic attacks can't stop the momentum of it .
This is our culture , yet oddly enough , we are a culture that still celebrates The Boston Tea Party .
Modern - day America could never handle a hoe - down like that .
Imagine if the government gave special tax breaks to , let 's say , Wal - Mart , and owners of mom-and - pop stores in one local area were feeling the squeeze especially hard .
They band together in secret one night , in a gymnasium at the local school where one of them works part - time as a janitor , just to pay the government 's extortion fees .
The leader of the group coordinates their efforts to trash the local Wal - Mart after closing time , destroying every last item in the store , burning the building to the ground .
Though not condoning it , I would certainly understand the root causes .
The rest of the country probably would n't understand , and would condemn it outright .
( Hell , they may even advocate more police protection from " mom- and - pop terrorists . " )
But that 's exactly what The Boston Tea Party was : a violent and destructive raid on a company that got preferential treatment from a loathsome government .
As a believer in property rights and as a non-violent man , I cannot recommend such activity .
Besides , local police , state troopers , and the federal government are far better equipped than colonial British soldiers were .
There was no Culture of Obedience instructing these men to do what they did ( at least , there was no Culture of Obedience to Government Authority ) .
I do not lament the inability of modern - day Americans to vandalize at the slightest sign of governmental injustice .
I do not believe that violence is the answer .
What I lament is that the government has barfed up the words " freedom , " " liberty , " and " justice " so much that all our popular culture can produce at this point is the inanity of Britney Spears 's political views .
( God , another child prodigy who lost her innocence far too early ! )
Just watch soldiers go through boot camp .
These men are not being taught to use their intellects .
Watch them toe the line .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is unity ...
Or else !
I do n't believe in this anymore ; I believe in individuality .
Obedience is not about doing what 's right ; it 's about control .
Parents who think it 's the moral duty of the child to obey them do n't understand this .
I shudder to think what kind of parent does understand , yet still demands obedience !
On the other hand , we 've all seen spoiled brats in action .
I knew a girl who had her freedom as a teenager .
Well , some freedom anyway .
She and I were stuck all day long in the same government school .
She used her mother 's car without permission to go somewhere she was n't permitted to go .
She carefully covered her tracks , including filling the gas tank to the exact level it had been prior to her escapade .
Once discovered , all her mother had to say to her was , " How clever of you ! "
I 'm not saying that her mom should have punished her or given her a guilt trip by going on about how her feelings were hurt .
With real love in her heart , her mother should have realized that there was a troublesome situation brewing here .
Did she not see that her daughter was sneaking around rather than being forthright and confident , and trying to hide her actions through deception ?
What about confronting her young adult daughter , as an equal , and asking her ( since it obviously was n't that important that she had borrowed the car without permission and gone to some forbidden place ) why she felt the need to be dishonest ?
That , after all , would be striking at the root of the problem , which has little to do with cars or " dens of iniquity . "
Most likely , her mother was raised in the same Obedience Culture as my parents , where children were to be seen and not heard .
Perhaps thinking she was a modern woman who should give her daughter more freedom than she had had when she was young , her feeble compliment was supposed to sound like love and freedom .
I seriously doubt her daughter understood it that way .
Kids ( especially kids who are aware that they 're not really kids anymore , but merely treated as such ) can see right through that .
A reply like that is a sign of weakness and ineptitude as a parent .
It is also a copout , from a woman who would rather not deal with the pain of her own failure , and the hurt she is carrying from her own childhood .
George and Olive Osmond were no less inept as parents .
The ability to make tons of money off of your enslaved children , then coat the crime with pretty colors of religious moral conviction and material success , is no better than casually saying , " How clever of you ! " and ignoring the real issue .
It is the ugly determination of an adult to get what he 's always wanted , at the expense of a future adult .
Now , how would this play out if that adult - to - be finally obtained power over others , enshrined in a pseudo - sacred bureaucracy sustained by intellectuals and authority figures of all political and religious persuasions as valid and permanent ?
It plays out with a president , steeped in law and brought up in the Culture of Obedience , narrowly defining the word " is . "
Because of the dichotomy between the requirement of obedience and the desire to escape punishment , a man raised in this harmful way will desperately search for any loophole to be set free .
That 's when the most desperate of men will suddenly discover that the word " is " has a separate , legal , even jaded definition .
God told Eve not to eat the forbidden fruit .
No explanation .
Just obey ...
Or else !
In disobeying , Eve did what anyone else raised in such a culture would do :
She hid .
It would have made little difference if , once He had discovered her , God had merely said , " How clever of you ! "
If God had to actually stop for a moment and think about Eve and her actions ,
He might realize that there is deeper trouble in the relationship than He knew .
What would happen to our Judeo - Christian heritage if such enlightenment occurred ?
Would God realize
He is not infallible , or would we realize He does n't exist ?
Probably most of us can think of times when we skirted getting permission from some authority simply because we did n't want to hear the word " no , " as if its utterance somehow magically prevented us from acting upon our desires .
Yet from someone as despicable and untrustworthy as ex-President Clinton , to the more respectable yet mythological Eve and the slightly less mythological Osmonds , the notion that it is easier to obtain forgiveness than permission is borne of the cynicism that is nurtured in the Culture of Obedience .
May we leave this rotten , poisonous culture behind as we disobediently walk away from the state , in any quiet and peaceful manner we can .

Merrick lives in the Northeast , is proud to be a classical music reviewer at Amazon.com and iTunes , and in spite of the poisonous nature of television , God Himself will have to pry his DVDs of " Monty Python 's Flying Circus " out of his cold , dead hands , under threat of eternal damnation .
The Culture of Obedience ... Or Else !

Michael F. Morin says he has cutting - edge technology in the fight against that growing scourge of city life , bedbugs .
His cutting - edge technology is : dogs .
Two of them , Ruby and Pasha .
Ruby is a beagle .
Pasha is a basenji “ and maybe part terrier , ” said Donald Frey , Mr. Morin ’s partner in a four - month - old company that dispatches them to root out the speck - sized parasites in apartments and schools .
And also four - star hotels ( and three - and two - star ones ) that worry about being mentioned in the same breath as “ fleabag . ”
Alas , a bedbug - free place is not necessarily flea - free .
Ruby and Pasha have a nose for Cimex lectularius , the common bedbug , and only Cimex lectularius , Mr. Morin said .
Fleas are different .
Ruby and Pasha act mild mannered and well behaved , not like fang - baring attack dogs that want to sink their teeth into whatever is close by .
When Ruby and Pasha smell a bedbug , they do n’t lap it up ; they simply sit down .
As the national economic crisis has deepened and social services have become casualties of budget cuts , libraries have come to fill a void for more people , particularly job - seekers and those who have fallen on hard times .
Libraries across the country are seeing double - digit increases in patronage , often from 10 percent to 30 percent , over previous years .
But in some cities , this new popularity  some would call it overtaxing  is pushing libraries in directions not seen before , with librarians dealing with stresses that go far beyond overdue fines and misshelved books .
Many say they feel ill - equipped for the newfound demands of the job , the result of working with anxious and often depressed patrons who say they have nowhere else to go .
The stresses have become so significant here that a therapist will soon be counseling library employees .
“ I guess I ’m not really used to people with tears in their eyes , ” said Rosalie Bork , a reference librarian in Arlington Heights , a well - to - do suburb of Chicago .
“ It has been unexpectedly stressful .
We feel so anxious to help these people , and it ’s been so emotional for them . ”
Urban ills like homelessness have affected libraries in many cities for years , but librarians here and elsewhere say they are seeing new challenges .
They find people asleep more often at cubicles .
Patrons who cannot read or write ask for help filling out job applications .
Some people sit at computers trying to use the Internet , even though they have no idea what the Internet is .
We ’ve all seen arguments in the design community that dismiss the role of beauty in visual interfaces , insisting that good designers base their choices strictly on matters of branding or basic design principles .
Lost in these discussions is an understanding of the powerful role aesthetics play in shaping how we come to know , feel , and respond .
Article Continues Below
Consider how designers “ skin ” an information architect ’s wireframes .
Or how the term “ eye candy ” suggests that visual design is inessential .
Our language constrains visual design to mere styling and separates aesthetics and usability , as if they are distinct considerations .
Yet , if we shift the conversation away from graphical elements and instead focus on aesthetics , or “ the science of how things are known via the senses , ” we learn that this distinction between how something looks and how it works is somewhat artificial .
For starters , aesthetics is concerned with anything that appeals to the senses — not just what we see , but what we hear , smell , taste , and feel .
In short , how we perceive and interpret the world .
As user experience professionals , we must consider every stimulus that might influence interactions .
Perhaps more importantly , “ aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon ” ( according to Wikipedia ) .
In other words , aesthetics is not just about the artistic merit of web buttons or other visual effects , but about how people respond to these elements .
Our question becomes : how do aesthetic design choices influence understanding and emotions , and how do understanding and emotions influence behavior ?
Aesthetics and cognition #section3
Cognition is “ the process of knowing . ”
Based on patterns and experiences , we learn how to understand the world around us :
What happens if I push that ?
What does this color suggest ?
Cognitive science studies how people know things and aesthetics plays a critical role in cognitive processing .
In the example below , which one of these is clearly a button ?
And why ?
Here , aesthetics communicates function .
The example on the right resembles a physical button .
The beveled edges and gradient shading remove any doubt about its function .
In this case , these are characteristics of affordance , which are aspects of design that help a user to discover how they might interact with an object .
Translation : if it looks like a button , it must be a button .
Similarly , there ’s a reason good confirmation screens have a check mark and are likely to involve some shade of green : Green is good .
Red is bad .
Yellow is something to think about .
When designing , we must consider how our brain interprets the meaning of color , shadow , and shading .
We rarely notice these aesthetic choices , except when people get them wrong :
In this example , the visual language confi‚icts with the intent of the message .
What we are discussing here is how our brain interprets the meaning of things such as color , shadow , shading , and other natural occurrences .
Just pick up a piece of paper and watch how the shadow changes as you bring the page closer to you .
It ’s these kinds of natural occurrences our brains observe every day in the real world .
When we use these cues on a screen , they carry with them the same real world properties .
But , there ’s more to aesthetics than just communicating function , and more to styling than mere enjoyment .
Aesthetics and affect#section4
When we talk about “ affect , ” we ’re talking about feelings and emotions — not about the “ I feel positive about your brand ” sense of feelings and emotions , but about the ways in which they influence perceived and actual usability .
Let ’s revisit our button example , with a slight change :
Cognitively speaking , both of these are obviously buttons .
Neither button is “ wrong ” as in our previous example .
However , research into attention , persuasion , choice , happiness , learning , and other similar topics suggests that the more attractive button is likely to be more usable by most people .
To get an idea of where this perspective might come from , consider this comment on emotions from neurobiologist Antonio Damasio :
“ …emotion is not a luxury : it is an expression of basic mechanisms of life regulation developed in evolution , and is indispensable for survival .
It plays a critical role in virtually all aspects of learning , reasoning , and creativity .
Somewhat surprisingly , it may play a role in the construction of consciousness . ” [ 1 ]
In many design conversations , there is a belief that applications are made enjoyable because we make them easy to use and efficient ( interestingly , whether it ’s stated or not , these conversations value the role that aesthetics plays in cognition ) .
However , when we talk about how emotions influence interactions , it ’s closer to the truth to say things that are enjoyable will be easy to use and efficient .
Allow me to explain .
You remind me of …#section5
Product personality influences our perceptions .
Think about how quickly we form expectations about someone simply based on how they dress or present themselves .
This is something the automobile industry has known for years , as they spend money to create products that express a specific personality people might identify with .
Why does a Dodge Ram seem more durable ?
What makes a Mini Cooper seem zippy and fun ?
While there are certainly performance features to support these mental claims , we can also see these attributes expressed in the car ’s form .
Similarly , the UI design decisions we make affect the perceived personality of our applications .
In the example below , which window is friendlier ?
Which one looks more professional ?
Products have a personality .
Why should we care ?
Consider this :
People identify with ( or avoid ) certain personalities .
Trust is related to personality .
Perception and expectations are linked with personality .
Consumers “ choose ” products that are an extension of themselves .
We treat sufficiently advanced technology as though it were human .
… and so on .
By making intentional , conscious decisions about the personality of your product , you can shape positive or negative responses .
Take a look at Sony and how they applied this knowledge in the Sony AIBO .
Let ’s consider why they made this robot resemble a puppy .
Here , you have a robotic device that is n’t perfect .
It wo n’t understand most of what you say .
It may or may not follow the commands it does understand .
And it does n’t really do all that much .
If this robot was an adult butler that responded to only half our requests and frequently did something other than what we asked , we ’d consider it broken and useless .
But as a puppy , we find its behaviors “ cute . ”
Puppies are n’t known for following directions .
And when the robot puppy does succeed , we are delighted .
“ Look , it rolled over ! ”
What a great way to enter the robotics market .
Consider :
What kind of personality are you creating with your application ?
And what expectations does this personality bring with it ?
Can you trust me on this ?
#section6
According to a 2002 study , the “ appeal of the overall visual design of a site , including layout , typography , font size , and color schemes , ”  is the number one factor we use to evaluate a website ’s credibility .
This makes sense .
Think about how our personal appearance ( our personal aesthetic ) affects how people perceive us ; or how product packaging infi‚uences our perception of the product inside .
Below is a gas pump near my house .
Contrast that with the station shown on the right .
I ’ve stopped filling up at the gas station on the left , even though it ’s closer to where I live .
Why ?
This kind of maintenance ( or lack of maintenance ) leaves me unwilling to trust them with my credit card information .
Clearly , appearance does affect trust .
So , how do we create trust in our application interfaces , aside from providing the basics , such as reliable information and uptime ?
By being attentive to visual design , for one thing .
Attention to design details implies that the same care and attention has been spent on the other ( less visible ) parts of the product — which implies that this is a trustworthy product .
I ’ve seen many great design comps get butchered during development .
Things such as inconsistent fonts , odd padding , line - heights , and over - compressed images plagued the final release .
While this may never come out during functional testing , how might these sloppy UI details affect perceptions of your product ?
Put it all together and …#section7
Why should we really care about perceptions ?
Consider these findings from research presented at CHI 2007 :
“ …users judge the relevancy of identical search results from different search engines based on the brand … Participants in the study indicated that the results from Google and Yahoo were superior to identical results found through Windows Live or a generic search engine . ” 
What is a brand but perceptions ?
In this study , functionally identical results were perceived as better due to brand attributes such as trust , personality , and perception .
What ’s rational about that ?
Hold that thought .
Attractive things work better #section8
Okay , so maybe perceptions are important to product design .
But what about “ real ” usability concerns such as lower task completion times or fewer difficulties ?
Do attractive products actually work better ?
This idea was tested in a study conducted in 1995 ( and then again in 1997 ) .
Donald Norman describes it in detail in his book Emotional Design .
Researchers in Japan setup two ATMs , “ identical in function , the number of buttons , and how they worked . ”
The only difference was that one machine ’s buttons and screens were arranged more attractively than the other .
In both Japan and Israel ( where this study was repeated ) researchers observed that subjects encountered fewer difficulties with the more attractive machine .
The attractive machine actually worked better .
So now we ’re left with this question : why did the more attractive but otherwise identical ATM perform better ?
Norman offers an explanation , citing evolutionary biology and what we know about how our brains work .
Basically , when we are relaxed , our brains are more fi‚exible and more likely to find workarounds to difficult problems .
In contrast , when we are frustrated and tense , our brains get a sort of tunnel vision where we only see the problem in front of us .
How many times , in a fit of frustration , have you tried the same thing over and over again , hoping it would somehow work the seventeenth time around ?
Another explanation :
We want those things we find pleasing to succeed .
We ’re more tolerant of problems with things that we find attractive .
Stitching it all together #section9
Recent studies into emotions are finding that we can’t actually separate cognition from affect .
Separate studies in economics and in neuroscience are proving that :
“ affect , which is inexplicably linked to attitudes , expectations and motivations , plays a significant role in the cognition of product interaction … the perception that affect and cognition are independent , separate information processing systems is flawed . ” [ 2 ]
In other words , how we “ think ” cannot be separated from how we “ feel . ”
This raises some interesting questions — especially in the area of decision making .
In short , our rational choices are n’t so rational .
From studies on choice to first impressions , neuroscience is exploring how the brain works — and it ’s kind of scary .
We ’re not nearly as in charge of our decisions as we ’d like to believe .
Consider what you ’re doing with your interfaces to speak to people ’s emotions ?
Industrial product design , automobile manufacturing and other more mature industries get this — with tools such as Kano modeling that have been used for decades .
But user interface development is still maturing and catching up to what these other disciplines already know : the most direct way to influence a decision or perception is through the emotions .
When we think about application design and development , how do you think of visual design ?
Is it a skin , that adds some value — a layer on top of the core functionality ?
Or is this beauty something more ?
In the early 1900s , “ form follows function ” became the mantra of modern architecture .
Frank Lloyd
Wright changed this phrase to “ form and function should be one , joined in a spiritual union , ” using nature as the best example of this integration .
The more we learn about people , and how our brains process information , the more we learn the truth of that phrase : form and function are n’t separate items .
If we believe that style somehow exists independent of functionality , that we can treat aesthetics and function as two separate pieces , then we ignore the evidence that beauty is much more than decoration .
Our brains can’t help but agree .

MONTREAL , April 7 ( UPI ) --
An appellate court says a Canadian father was wrong to ground his 12 - year - old daughter for disobeying his order that she stay off the Internet .
An attorney for the Gatineau man says they may appeal Monday 's Quebec Superior Court ruling affirming a lower court 's decision in favor of the girl to Canada 's Supreme Court , the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Tuesday .

Kim Beaudoin , the father 's lawyer , told the CBC his client was " flabbergasted " by the latest setback .
" Either way , he does n't have authority over this child anymore , " Beaudoin said .
" She sued him because she does n't respect his rules .
It 's very hard to raise a child who is the boss . "
The father grounded his daughter last year after finding her visiting Web sites he had blocked .
He alleged his daughter was posting " inappropriate pictures " of herself online , the CBC reported .
Grounding her meant she could n't attend her Grade 6 graduation trip to Quebec City , for which her mother had already granted permission .
The couple are divorced and the father had custody at the time .
The punishment prompted the girl to seek the legal remedy .
The lower court ruled in her favor .
She made the class trip and now lives with her mother .
" Going to court was a last resort , " said Lucie Fortin , a legal aid attorney who represented the girl .
" The trip was very important to her . "

DALLAS -- Yao Ming and the Houston Rockets were well on their way -- to a sixth straight win , their first division title in 15 years and perhaps the second seed in the Western Conference .
Then it all fell apart .
After Yao put Houston up by 14 early in the third quarter , he did n't score again , letting Jason Kidd and the Dallas Mavericks rally for a 95 - 84 victory Wednesday that helped mix up the conference standings .
The teams left the court not knowing where they stood , mainly because the San Antonio - New Orleans game went into overtime .
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban asked for that game to be shown on the overhead scoreboard , and by the time it came on the Spurs were finishing off a win that gave them the No. 3 seed and the Southwest Division title the Rockets let slip away .
Dallas landed the No. 6 seed and a first - round matchup with San Antonio .
Houston has to deal with the agony of going from the cusp of No. 2 all the way down to No.
5 . The Rockets knew they were playing the Trail Blazers when the Spurs ' game finished .
Houston had a chance at home - court advantage in that series , but -- making this night a total loss -- Portland won its finale 104 - 76 against Denver to move up to the No. 4 seed .
" We 're still in the playoffs , " Houston forward Ron Artest said .
" We still have a chance when the chips fall .
...
We got better as the season went on and our team should get better throughout the playoffs . "
The Rockets led 76 - 75 with 7:21 left , but by then the Mavericks already were on a serious roll .
They 'd used an 18 - 4 burst to tie it late in the third quarter and Jason Terry had just hit a 3 - pointer ; Kidd would follow with another 3 that put Dallas ahead for good .
Houston scored only 14 points in the final period .
Yao took just one shot in eight minutes , all while being guarded by Brandon Bass -- who is 10 inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter .
" The big fella was rolling and we sort of got away from him , which is probably the dumbest thing we can do , especially when the big fella gets it rolling , " Rockets forward Shane Battier said .
" We started to look elsewhere and started to take long , contested jumpers , which fed into their game plan of getting out and running .
They had a couple of 3s and got back in the game .
After that , it was tough to slow them down . "
Yao finished with 24 points , with 19 coming in the second quarter .
He did n't score in the final 21 minutes , 25 seconds .
His stats the rest of the way : two missed shots , four personal fouls .
" We had a ball - movement problem and I did n't hold my post well , " Yao said .
" It 's my problem . "
Bass made it tough for
Yao to catch the ball , mainly by camping out in front of him .
" He did it with his legs , his body and his heart , " Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said .
" I mean he really , really worked out there and made Yao work , and just our activity defensively as a team took a quantum leap when you 've got a guy working like that . "
Said Bass : " When you go up against a guy that big , you 've got to be physical . "
Kidd had 11 points , 12 assists and 10 rebounds for his third triple - double of the season and 103rd of his career .
Terry scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter , making his first six shots ; the only one he missed was a long 3 after the outcome had been decided .
Dirk Nowitzki had 30 points and 15 rebounds .
" We 're as confident as we 've been all season , " Nowitzki said .
" Hopefully we can carry it into the playoffs . "
By winning five of their last six games overall , the Mavs vaulted from the No. 8 seed to No. 6 .
Dallas started this season 2 - 7 , but this final victory was No. 50 of the season .
Terry left the court making a 5 and an 0 with his hands to celebrate the ninth straight season reaching that mark .
The Mavericks also started the season 0 - 4 at home , but this made them 15 - 1 in Dallas since the All - Star break .
" It 's good to have momentum going into the playoffs , " Carlisle said .
" It does n't guarantee anything but I really feel like it 's good for our team to be winning heading in . "
Game notes
Kyle Lowry scored 15 for Houston and Artest had 10 . ...
Mavs swingman Josh Howard returned from a one - game rest of his sore left ankle to miss his first seven shots .
He finished with 15 points .
... Nowitzki cracked 20 points for the 25th straight game .
... Houston had won two straight in Dallas .
... Only LeBron James ( seven ) and Chris Paul ( six ) had more triple - doubles this season than the 36 - year - old Kidd .
...
The high stakes of this game were obvious from the start .
On the opening possession , Nowitzki shoved Luis Scola just for the heck of it , then Artest hooked an arm around Nowitzki to twist him out of the way and was called for a foul .
Harlan Ellison ANGRILY
Sues Paramount Over His Old " Star Trek " Script
Harlan Ellison has launched a lawsuit against Paramount and the Writer 's Guild West for residual rights to his famous , Hugo - award winning " Star Trek " teleplay entitled : " City on the Edge of Forever .
" You can watch the whole episode here .
Many " Star Trek " fans consider Ellison 's episode the finest episode ever , and one of television 's finest moments , whatever that means .
Television 's other finest moments include the last episode of " ALF " and the time in 1974 that news anchor Christine Chubbuck killed herself live during a news broadcast .
You get the feeling that Ellison has launched this lawsuit because it will provide a good time .
In fact , while he seeks every penny in damages from Paramount , he is only suing the Writer 's Guild for one dollar , merely to be vindicated by the Federal Court system and to prove that the Writer 's Guild has failed to protect his interests .
Ellsion is suing Paramount for money based on the toys , novels , and other nostalgic memorabilia that Paramount has sold over the years : memorabilia that directly references " City on the Edge of Forever " and characters specific to it .
Ellison 's lawsuit comes snug against author Clive Cussler 's recent legal loss to Crusader Entertainment regarding breach of contract on the movie " Sahara .
" Here 's what Ellison had to say at great length on the subject of author 's rights in his press release : " To quote Gandhi : ' First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you , then you win .
'" And please make sure to remember , at the moment some Studio mouthpiece calls me a mooch , and says I 'm only pursuing this legal retribution to get into their ' deep pockets , ' tell 'm Ellison snarled back , ' F[ uck ] in ' - A damn skippy !'
I 'm no hypocrite .
It ai n't about the ' principle , ' friend , its about the MONEY !
Pay Me !
Am I doing this for other writers , for Mom ( still dead ) , and apple pie ?
Hell no !
I 'm doing it for the 35 - year - long disrespect and the money !
" The arrogance , the pompous dismissive imperial manner of those who ' have more important things to worry about , ' who 'll have their assistant get back to you , who do n't actually read or create , who merely ' take ' meetings , and shuffle papers -- much of which is paper money denied to those who actually did the manual labor of creating those dreams -- they refuse even to notice ... until you jam a Federal lawsuit in their eye .
To hell with all that obfuscation and phony flag - waving : they got my money .
Pay me and pay off all the other writers from whom you 've made hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars .. from OUR labors .. just so you can float your fat asses in warm Bahamian waters .
" The Trek fans who know my City screenplay understand just exactly why I 'm bare - fangs - of - Adamantium about this .
" They maintain fortresses staffed and insulated with corporate and legal Black Legions whose ability to speak fluent bullshit is the ramadoola of gyrating , gibbering numbers via which they cling to every dollar .
And when you are n't getting paid for the marvels you helped bring forth -- fine , hard , careful artifacts that are making others pig-rich -- at some point any sane person knows he has three , and only three choices : the first is to sit around dinner parties and ceaselessly whine over your sushi about how they screwed you , boo hoo , but you can't beef about it Out There in the World or they 'll blacklist you ; the second is to pick up an Uzi somewhere , crash your SUV through a Studio gate , and just run amok ; and the third , last , choice is this one -- to act like an adult , to take 'em on in Federal Court and to make the greedy , amoral bastards blink blood out of their eyes .
What they do is tantamount to common street - thug robbery ... just add the pig-rich Madoff - style smoothyguts attorneys .
" And I learned today that the Actors Guild is having to fight , right now , just to maintain the very concept of residuals as part of their agreement with the Producers .
So I am happy as a centipede - with - track - shoes that this infamous behavior , arrogantly ignored for too damned long , is timed to call attention to the degree to which the creative cadres in this business are getting parboiled and served up in a dog - dish !
The part of this imbroglio that truly dismays me , is that my once - tough , beloved Guild -- my UNION -- that got massively screwed when it let the Alliance scare the slacker - gen dolts into thinking not losing a job meant ' just bend over and grin , ' -- if one 's own damn Guild wo n't help you , Ã ¢ÂÂ " when you 've entreated them for months -- then hell , you 've got no choice but to raise the skull and crossbones , hone the edge of your demon attorney , and just start cutting off noggins and nuts .
" Cowardice is like parrot fever in this town ; I think there are writers and other artists who revel in being bitch - slapped , in being pilfered on a regular basis , as if they were artistic trailer - trash !
And if the WGAw is n't going to watch my back -- and I 've been their loyal hit - man , pit bull , and go - to guy for 47 years -- I dread the possibility that the timorous Guild wo n't raise the bloody axe for other artists , writers , actors ... saner and less pissed - off than I .
So you can tell 'em I 'm coming !
" Here are some facts about Harlan Ellison , if you do n't know who he is or why he is so angry .
While I agree that Ellison should be compensated for his work , I think it is a falsehood to call himself an artist ( even a " trailer - trash artist " ) for the work he did for " Star Trek . "
In fact , under the terms that the Writer 's Guild negotiated during their bid for consolidation in the fifties , people who write for television and film CAN'T be considered artists , which is why they are entitled to union representation in the first place .
Artists always own their own work , and sell the rights to copy it or reprint it .
Those who work for television and film are instead workers -- corporate cells without liability for their products -- which means they can collectively bargain like teachers or cops .
This also goes for actors and directors .
The work of people who write for television and film is wholly owned and managed by the corporations to which they have sold their time and creativity .
Which is why Mr. Ellison is so irate .
He can see the stamp of his individual talent on the work he has done , and every cell in his tyrannical writer 's body calls out to have his work returned to him , to be compensated and remembered as its creator .
He gave his baby up for adoption and now he wants it back .
Ellison would hate to admit that he was one of the figures who was most instrumental in selling out literature in the first place ; in creating an entire generation of people who view television and film as the apotheosis of creativity , as opposed to a throbbing pustule up creativity 's ass - crack .
Ellison tossed aside a difficult life as a short - story writer and novelist in New York to move to California and write bad television shows and bad movies .
He once even worked for Disney for one famous day , a day he did n't spend honing his craft as creator or " pit - bull " for literature .
I respect him as a writer , and I appreciate his lawsuit here , but future writers and artists will have to work long and hard to undo the damage that Ellison and other members of his generation did for literature and fiction .
I do n't blame them : they were duped , conned , jumped , and mugged .
I think Ellison is just now waking up to what has been done to him and others , and may even come around to pointing his finger in the right direction : not at corporations who are only doing what corporations were designed to do , but at New York publishers who built such a doomed and belly - crawling industry that writers had no choice but to turn to film and television in order to eat food , pay bills , and live decent lives .
I wonder if Ellison will repent his TV work before he dies and insist that every bit of celluloid crap that he penned be emblazoned with his famous pseudonym " Cordwainer Bird ?
"
It would be nice to have Ellison on the side of real , broke , risk - taking fiction writers for a change , and not self - loathing television writers who whine and beg for their name to be bigger on products created to sell more advertising , toys , and little ideas .
" PAY ME , " sure .
But " pay me " for writing , and not for temporary plastic sculptures of my eternal dreams , fugues , and passions .
You can't hurt Paramount .
You can't make them notice , or make them blink .
You can't even hurt their image .
They have a whole file cabinet full of methods for dealing with people like you , and they will win , settle , make you look bad , or make you owe them more money than you 've got .
You can make money writing TV and movies .
Easy money .
Good money .
But then age catches up , and you look back over your life , and you wonder what it all means , and you wonder if you would have done better work if you had chosen to reign rather than to serve , even if your life would have been uglier , angrier , shorter , and more desperate .
You would have done better work down on Skid Row instead of up on the Paramount .
That 's the answer .
If you want to write good stories , you first have to own your own mind .
No amount of lawsuits against Paramount will give you back the time you wasted working for them .
Harlan Ellison = object lesson for the rest of us .

The spread of MRSA both in and out of hospital is a big problem that we have been warned about since 2005 by the physicians at Doctors Opposing Circumcision .
It is now making headlines and it is only going to get worse .
Beth Israel Hospital in Boston is affiliated with Harvard .
I think we can safely guess that , if there is lax infection control in this institution , it ’s probably the “ canary in the coal mine ” for other institutions .
With economic cut backs we know that cleaning services are not going to improve .
It ’s time to bring an end to the unnecessary cutting of baby genitals .
The writing has been on the wall for a long time but a moratorium on circumcision can no longer be delayed .
Physicians are well aware that babies are dying from this antibiotic resistant strain of staph infection but it has not been publically displayed so they have been able to perpetuate the circumcision ritual .
It ’s now time for the AAP to take decisive action to protect families from the nightmare of MRSA in circumcision wounds .
These are some of the news stories coming out of Beth Israel Hospital .
http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/04/11/state_details_safety_lapses_at_beth_israel/
Quote : And , on several occasions , the investigators observed worrisome lapses related to circumcisions , including an instance when a nurse did n’t change gloves before tending to the dressings of a baby .
Of the 19 infants who have become ill with the drug - resistant staph infection , 15 have been boys , according to Dr. Anita Barry , who is overseeing the investigation of the cases by the Boston Public Health Commission .
“ I think the circumcision dressing example was one we found particularly problematic , ” Dreyer said .
“ You ’ve got examples of contamination that may be in the context of kids with open wounds from circumcision .
The danger is spread of infection . ”

The father , who asked to remain anonymous to protect his family ’s privacy , said his son was born in January , after the hospital was aware that there was a problem involving the MRSA bacteria .
He said he wished he had been told what symptoms related to MRSA to look for when they were discharged , rather than be “ kept in the dark . ”
The pediatrician alerted them to a problem after noticing several red marks the size of a pencil point on his son ’s genital area , he said , and within days , the tiny marks turned into “ blisters filled with pus . ”

Pains of an imminent NYC transit fare hike and a recent article in the New York Times on bike theft / vandalism defeatism inspired me to validate the overwhelming perceived economic benefits of commuting by bike versus transit , despite the occasional theft .
If frugal is the next big thing and green is the new black , then hop on a crappy old bike if you want to be hip .
In the chart below , I compare the costs of commuting by transit assuming the regular purchase of a 30 - day unlimited metro pass ( $ 81 in NYC as of April 2009 , but not for much longer ) to commuting by beater - bike assuming the occasional theft .
I checked the beloved craigslist for used bicycles and determined that one can find an acceptable replacement for $ 150 on average ( lower if you 've got the knack ) .
I would say that used bikes in NYC are a bit pricey , but if you buy through a local community bike program ( or start your own ! ) such as HoBiken in my hometown of Hoboken , NJ , you can smash this analysis .
Anyway , if you think you can manage to keep your losses to less than 5 bikes per year , surrender your metrocard and start riding :
$ ./Hello.dyn Hello World ! $ ls - ogh Hello Hello.dyn 411 K 2009-04-28 21:59 Hello 11 K 2009-04-28 21:55 Hello.dyn
On Linux x86-64 with GHC using shared libraries a " Hello World " program is now only 11 k compared to 411k previously .
By comparison , JHC manages 6.4 k and an equivalent C program is 6.3 k .
( All sizes after running strip on the binary . )
As I mentioned earlier , the IHG has asked us to work on improving GHC 's support for shared libraries .
I 've been updating the new GHC build system to support -- enable - shared and I 've just now managed to get the build to go through .
I 'll clean up my patches and send them in tomorrow .
There are still a number of things to do .
I 've got to run the testsuite with everything built for shared libs .
Clemens had this working before so I 'm not expecting too many test failures .
We also need to set up a GHC buildbot to use -- enable - shared so that we do not get regressions .
The next task will be to test that it works to make a Haskell library that exports a C API and to use it as a plugin for some other program .
Anyone got any good suggestions for a simple demo plugin ?
What programs have nice simple plugin APIs ?
The memos may justify CIA techniques used at sites like Guantanamo Bay The US has published four secret memos detailing legal justification for the Bush - era CIA interrogation programme .
Critics of the programme say the methods used amounted to torture .
President Barack Obama has also issued a statement guaranteeing that no CIA employees will be prosecuted for their role in the interrogation programme .
Some in the CIA wanted parts of the memos to be blacked out , fearing full disclosure could trigger lawsuits against agents , reports suggest .
The release of the memos stems from a request by civil rights group the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Harsh techniques
Three of the documents were written in May 2005 by the then acting head of the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , Stephen Bradbury .
They gave legal support for the combined use of various coercive techniques , and concluded that the CIA 's methods were not " cruel , inhuman or degrading " under international law .
Those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice ... will not be subject to prosecution
US President Barack Obama
The fourth document , dating from 1 August 2002 , was written by OLC lawyer John Yoo and signed by his colleague Jay Bybee .
It contained legal authorisation for a list of specific harsh interrogation techniques , including pushing detainees against a wall , facial slaps , cramped confinement , stress positions and sleep deprivation .
The memo also authorises the use of " waterboarding " , or simulated drowning , and the placing of a detainee into a confined space with an insect .
Announcing the publication of the memos , Mr Obama said : " I believe that exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release .
" Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time , " he explained .
But he also gave an assurance that " those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice ... will not be subject to prosecution . "
Interrogation critics
The memos show for the first time the extent and the substance of the Bush administration 's assurances to its intelligence operatives that what they were doing was not torture , and not against the law , says the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington .
Mr Obama has outlawed the CIA 's use of harsh interrogation techniques Critics of the Bush administration 's interrogation programme say the memos provide evidence that many of the methods amount to torture under US and international law .
There was a rift within the Obama administration about whether the documents should be made available to the public in full or should be partially redacted .
Attorney General Eric Holder and White House Counsel Greg Craig were vocal supporters of full publication of the memos , according to reports .
But CIA chief Leon Panetta and deputy director John Brennan called for portions of the memos to be blacked out , or redacted , the New York Times reported .
The intelligence officials were concerned that full disclosure would set a precedent for future exposure of the agency 's sources and methods , and would threaten America 's relationship with allied intelligence services .
But civil liberties campaigners said anything short of full publication would undermine President Obama 's attempts to paint himself as more transparent than his predecessor .
During his first week in office , President Obama issued an executive order officially outlawing the use of harsh interrogation techniques by the CIA , and forcing the agency to adhere to standards laid out in the US Army Field Manual .

WASHINGTON 
At the prodding of the White House , Democratic Congressional leaders have agreed to pursue a plan that would protect major health care legislation from Republican opposition by shielding it from last - minute Senate filibusters .
The aggressive approach reflects the big political claim that President Obama is staking on health care , and with it his willingness to face Republican wrath in order to guarantee that the Democrats , with their substantial majority in the Senate , could not be thwarted by minority tactics .
While some Democratic senators were reluctant to embrace the arrangement , Mr. Obama made clear at a White House session on Thursday afternoon that he favored it , people with knowledge of the session said .
Mr. Obama has given way in some battles with Congress , but the new stance suggests he may be much less willing to compromise when it comes to health care , his top legislative priority , even if it means a bitter partisan fight .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail sales suffered an unexpected big decline in March which broke two straight months of improving sales , the government reported Tuesday .
The Commerce Department said total retail sales fell 1.1 % last month , compared with February 's revised gain of 0.3 % .
Sales in February were originally reported to have dipped 0.1 % .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had been expecting an increase of 0.3 % in March .
Sales excluding autos and auto parts fell a surprising 0.9 % compared to a revised 1 % increase in the measure for February .
February ex-auto sales were originally reported to have increased 0.7 % .
Economists had forecast March sales , excluding auto purchases , to be unchanged from the previous month .
" We 're struggling a bit to interpret these numbers , " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics for Moody 's Economy.com .
For one thing , Hoyt said improving sales both in January and February " gave us reason to believe that retail sales were starting to head in a positive direction . "
Also , Hoyt and others said the yearly shift in the Easter holiday means that March and April sales really should be looked at together .
To his point , Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) and other big chain stores last week reported slower - than - expected March same - store sales , blaming a late Easter for pushing holiday - related purchases into April .
Same - store sales , another important gauge of a merchant 's performance , measure sales at stores open at least a year .
" As always in March - April we have to be suspicious of the seasonal [ factors ] , which struggle to cope with Easter , " Ian Shepherson , chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics , wrote in a report Tuesday .
" Still , for now this looks like something of a reality check after a run of upside data surprises , " he said .
At the same time , the latest government numbers are likely to re-ignite concerns that consumer spending , which fuels two - thirds of economic activity , has not yet rebounded in light of accelerating job losses .
" We 're not sure yet how much of the [ sales ] weakness is real and how much is based on the Easter shift , " Hoyt said .
" There are still lots of weights on consumer spending .
The housing market is still weak and we 're losing 600,000 or more jobs every month . "
Last month 's sales erosion was broad - based .
Autos led the decline , registering a 2.3 % drop in sales last month .
Sales at electronics stores tumbled 5.9 % , furniture sellers logged a 1.7 % drop in their sales while clothing purchases declined 1.8 % , the report showed .
Elsewhere , department store sales slipped 0.3 % , building material sales dropped 0.6 % in the month and gasoline station sales declined 1.6 % .
Only one of these images of a penny is correct .
Which one is it ?

However , she was quick to deny a link between China 's growing wealth , and income inequality , and its mental health issues .
" As a society develops , it is only natural for government and people to pay more attention to the mental health , but it is not necessarily related to our rising social problems .
People nowadays are less crazy than they were during the Cultural Revolution , that 's for sure .
People are definitely happier now than in that special period , " she said .
I had a couple of hundred messages lying around in the depths of my work e-mail account .
They were old Majordomo subscribe / unsubscribe alerts for a mailing list I managed ( until we switched over to Mailman ) .
I had kept them around because one of these days I figured I ’d load the information into a database to track the evolution of the subscriber base .
I have n’t managed to get around to doing that yet , but I did want to get rid of the messages .
All I needed was the subject line of the mail ( which contained all the necessary info ) and the date the message was received .
The idea of doing it manually would have been a nightmare .
I searched around a bit for a way of automating the task , and discovered that it could be done through OLE .
So I wrote a quick Perl program to do it .
It went like this :
use strict ; use warnings ; use Win32::OLE ; my $ Notes = Win32::OLE->new ( ' Notes.
NotesSession ' ) or die " Cannot start Lotus Notes Session object .
" ; my $ db = $ Notes -> GetDatabase ( " MyServer / MyDomain " , " mail/mymail.nsf " ) or die " Could not open database .
" ; my $ all = $ db -> AllDocuments ; foreach my $ n ( 1 .. $ all -> Count ) { my $ doc = $ all -> GetNthDocument ( $n ) ; my $ item = $ doc->GetFirstItem ( ' Subject ' ) ; if ( ! $item ) { warn " doc $n has no subject
" ; next ; } my $ subject = $ item - >
{ Text} ; next unless $ subject =~ /^(?:UN ) ?
SUBSCRIBE my - mailing - list / ; print $ doc->GetFirstItem (' DeliveredDate ' )->{ Text} , " $ subject
" ; }
and presto , the deed was done .
This saved me I do n’t know how many hours of mind - crushingly boring and RSI - inducing cutting and pasting .
It ’s so trivial it ’s not even worth bundling up , so this is probably the best place for other people to stumble across it in a search ( hi ! ) .
I ’m not sure if Strawberry Perl is bundled with Win32::OLE , but this works straight out of the box with ActivePerl .
The reigning champ of most Earth - sized planets yet is a world called Gliese 581 e , which circles a star that has four planets total .
It is called the smallest because of its mass , which is just 1.9 times the mass of Earth , making it the lightest known alien planet to date .
The other planets range in mass from 5 to 16 times the mass of Earth .
Thelightest exoplanet yet discovered ?
only about twice the mass of Earth ?
hasbeen detected , astronomers announced today .
" Withonly 1.9 Earth - masses , it is the least massive exoplanet ever detected and is , very likely , a rocky planet , " said Xavier Bonfils of Grenoble Observatory inFrance , a member of the team that made the discovery , which was announced atthe European Week of Astronomy and Space Science at the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom .
The planetwas found in the famous system Gliese 581 and has been dubbed " Gliese 581e . "
It was detected using the low - mass - exoplanet hunter HARPS spectrographattached to the 3.6 - metre ESO telescope at La Silla , Chile .
Measurementswith the telescope also helped to refine the orbit of the new planet 's solarsystem sibling , a planet called Gliese581 d , placing it well within the habitablezone , where liquid water oceans could exist .
" Theholy grail of current exoplanet research is the detection of a rocky , Earth - like planet in the ? habitable zone ? ?
a region around the host star withthe right conditions for water to be liquid on a planet ?s surface , " saidMichel Mayor from the Geneva Observatory , who led the European team that madethe finding .
PlanetGliese 581 e orbits its host star ?
located only 20.5 light - years away in theconstellation Libra ? in just 3.15 days .
Being so close to its host star , theplanet is not in the habitable zone .
With thediscovery of Gliese 581 e , the planetary system now has four known planets , with masses of about 1.9 Earth - masses ( planet e ) , 16 Earth - masses ( planet b ) , 5 Earth - masses ( planet c ) , and 7 Earth - masses ( planet d ) .
" Gliese581 d , which orbits the host star in 66.8 days , is probably too massive to be made only of rocky material , but we canspeculate that it is an icy planet that has migrated closer to the star , " said team member Stephane Udry of Geneva University in Switzerland .
??D? could even be covered by a large and deep ocean ?
it is the first serious ' water world ' candidate .?
Low - massred dwarf stars such as Gliese 581 are potentially fruitful hunting grounds forlow - mass exoplanets in the habitable zone .
The gravitational pull of orbitingexoplanets introduces a slight wobble to the star 's motion .
Because thehabitable zone of cool stars like Gliese 581 is so close to the star , theplanets within this zone exert a stronger pull , and so the wobble of the staris more pronounced , though detecting the signal is still a challenge .
Over thelast two decades , scientists have spotted more than 300 extrasolarplanets circling other stars in our Milky Way galaxy .
Most of these planetshave been about the size of Jupiter or larger .
" It isamazing to see how far we have come since we discovered the first exoplanetaround a normal star in 1995 ?
the one around 51 Pegasi , ? said Mayor , whohelped find that planet .
?
The mass of Gliese 581 e is 80 times less than thatof 51 Pegasi b.
This is tremendous progress in just 14 years . "
The teamplans to continue looking for Earth - like , rocky planets around other stars .
? Withsimilar observing conditions an Earth - like planet located in the middle of thehabitable zone of a red dwarf star could be detectable , ?
Bonfils said .
?
Thehunt continues .?
And HARPSis n't the only instrument looking for low - mass , Earth - like planets .
NASA 's new Keplerspace telescope will also be peering through the galaxy in search ofsmaller alien worlds .
It was launched on March 6 and sent back its first imageslast Thursday .
Adobe AIR counts already with over 100 million deployments which represents the importance of this development tool nowadays .
Nevertheless still some to get introduced to it and start creating their own applications .
In this tutorial you will learn how to create an AIR application a bit different on what we have shown before .
I mean , we will be showing how to create a RSS Reader with AIR and PureMVC .
As this a very extensive tutorial , due to the several files used in this example , we have opted to use the comments on code to explain it .
Requirements :
Prerequisites
This tutorial is meant for intermediate to advanced developers that already have a reasonable grasp of AS3 and have a small idea about meta- patterns , specifically the MVC meta- pattern .
This is n’t for beginners and designers that are now starting with AS3 or do n’t have a reasonable grasp of AS3 yet .

1 – Goals
The main goals for this tutorial are to guide you in the development of an AIR application using , and taking advantage of , PureMVC .
Also it will try to cover some of the most common changes , and modules , in PureMVC .
2 – Introduction
In this tutorial we will build a simple RSS Reader with AIR using PureMVC .
PureMVC is a framework based on the the Model - View - Controller Meta - Pattern for AS3 ( amongst other languages ) , and although there many others PureMVC seems to be setting itself as the most common choice for medium to large projects due to it ’s incredible community , flexibility and utilities ( a concept we wo n’t discuss here but that you can check over at PureMVC wiki ) .
As PureMVC comes in many flavors and it ’s worth checking them out before you start your project as they have different aims and can greatly ease your development process .
3 – First Steps
After downloading the PureMVC framework and setting up your Flex AIR Project we can copy the PureMVC to the source folder and start coding , but before we dig into the code we ’ll go over the package ( folder ) structure and essential classes of a PureMVC project and what each package means and does .
Default application package ( in our case com.techlabs.puremvc )
It should contain the ApplicationFacade.as
The concrete facade acts as a single place for mediators , proxies and commands to access and communicate with each other without having to interact with the Model , View , and Controller classes directly .
All this capability it inherits from the PureMVC Facade class .
This concrete Facade subclass is also a central place to define notification constants which will be shared among commands , proxies and mediators , as well as initializing the controller with Command to Notification mappings .
Controller ( com.techlabs.puremvc.controller )
The purpose of the controller package is to store the command concrete classes and we ’ll delve into their types further down .
The concrete commands are meant to be used as actions in the application and often include commands like Application Startup that takes care of initializing the model and views in the PureMVC framework .
Model ( com.techlabs.puremvc.model )
The model contains the proxies and further sub - packages that relate to data .
The function of the proxies is to handle all data interactions and to keep that data .
Some people prefer to use a command to actually perform the operation and have it affect the proxies , but again this is mostly a question of preference and of the type / size of application .
Business ( com.techlabs.puremvc.model.business )
Business usually holds specific service actions that are often referred to as delegates , these take care of making the actual interaction with the webservices and pass the results to the calling proxy , they should n’t however do any data handling or parsing .
Helpers ( com.techlabs.puremvc.model.helpers )
Helpers are meant for simple classes that perform tasks related to the data that the proxies require such as parsing the xml or doing some data handling .
These are useful if several proxies need to do that one same thing ( as parsing xml )
VO ( com.techlabs.puremvc.model.vo )
Value Objects are the specific types of data that your application will use , think of them as a class that you make so that you can strong type and cast your data .
And they can be anything from a CostumerVo to a BookVo or even a ResourceVo .
View ( com.techlabs.puremvc.view )
The view package will hold all the classes that relate to the interface of your application and it ’s workings , to that effect it ’s common to separate the actual MXML files from their logic using a sub - package called components and using the view package for the mediators .
The mediators will be the gateway between the actual MXML interface and the rest of your application , they manage , listen and interact with all things visual and make sure that all those interactions are sent to the frame work .
There are some nuances that we ’ll cover further down .
Components ( com.techlabs.puremvc.view.components )
The components sub - package holds all the MXML files and visual elements but it does not contain any non-required logic .
Ideally it should be a simple description of the user interface .
Note that this is just one way to arrange your classes and most programmers choose to organize it a bit differently to personal taste , so consider this to be a guideline instead of a rule .
4 – Code !
TheTechLabsRssReader.mxml
Let ’s initialize the application facade , this is where the framework get ’s booted and the fun begins .
There different ways of instantiating the facade , like having it on an onInitialize method , or some even more drastic that hack into the Flex initialization process .

5 – Other frameworks and considerations
As a final note I would like to point out that there are several alternatives to Pure MVC and all have their strong and weak points , I ’ve written a small article about them at Dreaming In Flash .
Also I would like to point out that Pure MVC is a very dynamic and flexible framework that allows a great deal of customization also that the code in this tutorial is a mere guideline , there are different ways of achieving the same results .
6 – Conclusion
That concludes our tutorial , and I would like to take the time to tell you about some other aspects of Pure MVC and Flex :
You can also get the Pure MVC as a SWC file and just drop it in the libs folder of your Flex project , this has advantages and disadvantages that I will not cover here but that you can find out in the Pure MVC forums , there is also a multitude of different flavors and utilities available at the plugin page .
I sincerely hope that this tutorial will help you get started with Pure MVC and will gladly answer any questions you might have .
I would also like to thank to Scalenine for the skin , and Daniele Ugoletti for his great work on the PureMVC AS3 Demo – Flex Application Skeleton .
Technology.am ( Apr. 27 , 2009 ) — Samsung Electronics has launched its first Google Android - based handset , I7500 phone .
The I7500 will be available in major European countries starting from June , the company said .
The I7500 phone is 11.9 mm thick , which sports a 3.2 - inch touchscreen , a 5 - megapixel camera and 8 GB of internal memory .
The mobile phone joins two Android handsets already on the market , the T - Mobile G1 and the HTC Magic .
The I7500 supports unspecified HSDPA 3G bandwidth , GSM / GPRS / Edge connectivity , Bluetooth 2.0 and 802.11b/g Wi -Fi .
Android is a smartphone operating system developed by Google , which is meant to make Web browsing on YouTube and Google Maps .
The company neither says about pricing for the handsets nor when it will be found in other parts of the world .
Last year David Friedman published on his blog Ironic Sans an interesting design concept for something that he called The Bulbdial Clock .
That ’s like a sundial , but with better resolution– not just an hour hand , but a minute and second hand as well , each given as a shadow from moving artificial light sources ( bulbs ) .
We ’ve recently put together a working bulbdial clock , with an implementation somewhat different from that of the original concept .
Rather than using three physically moving light sources at different heights , we use three rings of LEDs at different heights .
Within each ring , we only turn on one LED at a time , so that we only have a single effective light source– it can light up at different places from within the ring .
The three rings are located above one another so that they each project light onto the rod in the middle , making shadows of different lengths .
Additionally , for fun and clarity , we used red , green , and blue LEDs for the three rings , making each shadow hand of the clock a different color .
Each ring has 12 LEDs , and the 36 LEDs are efficiently multiplexed by an AVR microcontroller that also handles the timekeeping part of the project .
This clock is mostly built out of laser - cut plywood .
This is 1/4 ″ ( 6 mm ) plywood , which holds remarkable precision with the laser cutter .
There are three rings , shaped spacers that keep the rings above the base with the clock face , and a hardwood dowel rod .
It ’s really quite a three - dimensional project !
The rings each have pairs of small holes in them to mount the LEDs in place .
Each of the rings gets stuffed with 12 LEDs , with the correct orientation and spacing – long enough leads– that they can point towards the rod ( and make good shadows ) once they are in place .
Since each LED is only supposed to be on one at a time , we can drive the whole array pretty easily , and directly from the microcontroller , Here we are turning this array of LEDs into a single common - anode unit , by hooking all of the LED anodes together .
Likewise , after we stack these , we connect the cathodes — vertically for the three rings– and hook those up to the microcontroller as well .
For three rings ( colors ) and 12 cathodes , that means that we need 15 pins to control the array .
And the stack up is complete .
The next step is to add the control electronics .
I used one of our business card boards , an ATmega168 microcontroller ( programmed through a USBtinyISP ) , along with a 16 MHz crystal oscillator , a 3xAA battery box with switch and three tactile button switches .
Not to mention a snarl of wire .
There are also three resistors , two 50 - ohm and one 100 - ohm , which are used when driving a red LED , or blue or green , respectively .
Because only one LED is on at a time , we only need one resistor for each color .
Of the three buttons , two are used for setting the time– one is fast advance , one is slow advance .
The other button turns on or off the LED , but does not turn off the microcontroller .
When the LED is on , the circuit uses about 26 mA of current .
When the LED is off– just timekeeping , not displaying — it uses about 11 mA .
These could both be reduced by using larger resistors and reducing the speed of the microcontroller .
( Aside :
These parts were chosen principally for being the ones lying around .
However , they ’re mostly the right kinds of thing .
The microcontroller is about the right size for the number of pins that are needed for this project , but we probably could have gone with one that had less memory – the control program is pretty small .
A quartz crystal oscillator is nice because it ’s * a clock * and should n’t lose much time .
But 16 MHz is much faster than is needed , and the power consumption of microcontrollers depends on clock speed , so I ’d pick ( maybe ) a 1 MHz crystal next time .
The battery box is actually just right– 4.5 V provides comfortable headroom for driving blue and green LEDs , but not too much , and AA cells give sufficient capacity to make a non-annoying battery powered device , once we tweak that power consumption a bit more . )
As we have noted , it ’s pretty tricky to get good photos of LEDs , but you can kind of get the idea here – just imagine that the colors are bright and vibrant .
In this photo the time is about 6:20:40 .
( Like many clocks , it ’s hard to read with high precision .
Even so , the seconds help to create the sense that something is happening . )
The short hand , the hour hand , is created by the shadow of the red LED , and points to 6 , indicating 6 o’clock .
The medium hand , the minutes hand , is created by the shadow of the green LED , and points to 4 , indicating 20 minutes past the hour .
The seconds hand , the longest one , is created by the shadow of the blue LED , and indicates about 40 seconds past the minute .
What ’s * really * neat about this is how the colors interplay .
Where all of the LEDs hit , a white color ( additive RGB ) is produced .
Then , as you subtract one of those three colors– as in the shadow of a single LED , the results are subtractive colors , and the hands on our clock face are in the colors cyan , magenta , and yellow .
It ’s just magical .
So that ’s our new bulbdial clock ; you can see additional a few photos in our flickr photo set here .
One more thing :
We are thinking about making a kit version of this project ( under license from David Friedman ) – and we ’d really like to have your feedback before we go further .
There are a few obvious things that we ’ll take care of– like a circuit board with dedicated ( and labeled ) buttons , a lower - frequency crystal oscillator to reduce power consumption , and holes to hang it on the wall .
But we ’d like to hear your other suggestions as well . :)
Update ( December 2009 ) :
We ’ve listened pretty extensively to all of the feedback here ( Thanks ! ) and reworked the project from the ground up .
Amongst other changes , the new version has a plug - in power supply and classy outer case .
We have just released the kit version , and you can read more about it here .
( CNN ) -- Bea Arthur , the actress best known for her roles as television 's " Maude " and the sardonic Dorothy on " The Golden Girls , " has died of cancer , a family spokesman said Saturday .
Bea Arthur , right , with " Golden Girls " co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008 .
She was 86 .
Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles , her family by her side .
She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet , he said .
No funeral services are currently planned , Watt said , adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers .
Arthur 's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear 's " All in the Family " as Edith Bunker 's cousin , and was so popular that Lear created a spin - off series .
In the ' 70s , " Maude " was ahead of the social curve , tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography , race relations and , in an episode titled " Maude 's Dilemma , " abortion .
That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter ( Bill Macy ) decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child .
But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women 's liberation -- a big deal for the shy , Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City .
During the Depression , Arthur 's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge , Maryland .
By the time she was 12 , Arthur was nearly 5 feet , 10 inches tall , and self - conscious about her height .
But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting .
Along the way , she had a short - lived marriage she never spoke about , but she kept the last name -- Arthur .
The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off - Broadway .
Critics delighted in her haughty , serpent - tongued deliveries .
Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long - forgotten series called " Once Upon a Tune , " but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on " Studio One , " " Kraft Television Theatre " and " The Sid Caesar Show . "
Arthur drew attention in " Threepenny Opera " on Broadway with Lotte Lenya , but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in " Fiddler on the Roof . "
In 1966 , Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play " Mame , " playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role .
Eight years later , she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball , but by then she was already well - established as Maude .
Arthur left " Maude " in 1978 , making television and some film appearances afterward .
She starred in a short - lived series , " Amanda's , " in 1983 and then joined the cast of " The Golden Girls " in 1985 with Betty White , Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty .
Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida .
( Getty played Arthur 's mother ) .
The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for " Maude . "
Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991 - 92 season .
White , McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show , renamed " The Golden Palace , " but the show lasted only one season without Arthur .
Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992 , returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts .
In the early part of this decade , Arthur appeared in several one - woman shows .
Her last stage appearance was in 2006 .
Her last television appearance was on " The View " in 2007 .

The Witcher : Rise of the White Wolf developer WideScreen has confirmed to VG247 that the game has been suspended as CD Projekt has failed to meet financial obligations .
“ After having a payment being broken by CD Projekt – a big payment that we were supposed to receive – and after having committed to the project but not being covered financially on it for three months , I hold no choice but to put the team on hold , ” said Widescreen boss Olivier Masclef in a phone interview this afternoon .
Masclef also said CD Projekt ’s deal with Atari was out of kilter with Widescreen ’s agreement with CD Projekt in terms of milestones .
The suspension came after a meeting between the three parties , called by Masclef .
Staff have not been laid off , said the exec .
“ We have be reallocating people onto other projects and work for hire jobs at the moment , ” he said .
“ I will try to find any solution for the fans .
The Witcher on console is an extremely promising title that ’s awaited by a lot of people .
We have it running here , and I can tell you that if it hits the shelves one day it ’s going to be great …
I feel sorry for the fans and I feel sorry for Namco Bandai . ”
Masclef said he “ appreciated ” Namco , who has signed a distribution deal with Atari of which Rise of the White Wolf formed a large part , but said he was n’t sure if the game would ever been completed .

“ I do n’t know .
I ca n’t find a financial solution by myself , ” he said .
“ I do n’t own the IP – CD Projekt owns the IP and Atari owns the distribution rights . ”
First news of the game ’s cancellation came from Polish site Polygamia yesterday .
For all the gloomy headlines we ’ve absorbed since the fall , we still ca n’t quite accept the full depth of our economic abyss either .
Nicole Gelinas , a financial analyst at the conservative Manhattan Institute , sees denial at play over a wide swath of America , reaching from the loftiest economic strata of Wall Street to the foreclosure - decimated boom developments in the Sun Belt .
When we spoke last week , she talked of would - be bankers who , upon graduating , plan “ to travel in Asia and teach English for a year ” and then pick up where they left off .
Such graduates are dreaming , Gelinas says , because the over - the - top Wall Street money culture of the credit bubble is n’t coming back for a very long time , if ever .
As she observes , it took decades after the Great Depression  until the 1980s  for Wall Street to fully reclaim its old swagger .
Not until then was there “ a new group of people without massive psychological scarring ” from the 1929 crash .
In states like Nevada , Florida and Arizona , Gelinas sees “ huge neighborhoods that will become ghettos ” as half their populations lose or abandon their homes , with an attendant collapse of public services and social order .
“ It will be like after Katrina , ” she says , “ but it ’s no longer just the Lower Ninth Ward ’s problem . ”
Writing in the current issue of The Atlantic , the urban theorist Richard Florida suggests we could be seeing “ the end of a whole way of life . ”
The link between the American dream and home ownership , fostered by years of bipartisan public policy , may be irreparably broken .

Pity our new president .
As he rolls out one recovery package after another , he can’t know for sure what will work .
If he tells the whole story of what might be around the corner , he risks instilling fear itself among Americans who are already panicked .
( Half the country , according to a new Associated Press poll , now fears unemployment . )
But if the president airbrushes the picture too much , the country could be as angry about ensuing calamities as it was when the Bush administration ’s repeated assertion of “ success ” in Iraq proved a sham .
Managing America ’s future shock is a task that will call for every last ounce of Obama ’s brains , temperament and oratorical gifts .
The difficulty of walking this fine line can be seen in the drama surrounding the latest forbidden word to creep around the shadows for months before finally leaping into the open : nationalization .
Until he started hedging a little last weekend , the president has pointedly said that nationalizing banks , while fine for Sweden , would n’t do in America , with its “ different ” ( i.e. , non-socialistic ) culture and traditions .
But the word nationalization , once mostly whispered by liberal economists , is now even being tossed around by Lindsey Graham and Alan Greenspan .
It ’s a clear indication that no one has a better idea .
The Obama White House may come up with euphemisms for nationalization ( temporary receivership , anyone ? ) .
But whatever it ’s called , what will it mean ?
The reason why the White House has been punting on the new installment of the bank rescue is not that the much - maligned Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , is incapable of getting his act together .
What ’s slowing the works are the huge political questions at stake , many of them with consequences potentially as toxic as the banks ’ assets .

Why , then , do some libertarians reject anarchism ?
Under anarchism , people freely choose their own protection agency ; but the minarchist variety of libertarianism forbids them to do so , so long as they remain on the territory controlled by the minimal state .
How can libertarians justify coercing people in this way ?
Skoble finds the answer in what he calls the " Hobbesian Fear . "
Hobbes famously argued that people in a state of nature could not trust one another to keep agreements to refrain from force .
In a state of perpetual war ( including both actual fighting and readiness to fight ) life would be " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short . "
To escape this fate , it would be rational for everyone to surrender his arms to a sovereign , who would then have the power to assure that people kept their agreements .
In this circumstance , people could benefit from society .
Hobbes did not welcome the loss of liberty as a good in itself , but he argued that only by the drastic surrender of liberty he specified could the peace be preserved .
Libertarians of course reject Hobbes 's Leviathan .
Nevertheless , Skoble thinks , minarchists in part embrace the Hobbesian Fear .
They do not think that people , or the protection agencies that they designate to enforce their rights , would be able to come to peaceful agreement , in the absence of a monopoly state .
Hence they think it necessary to allow more coercion than would be ideally desirable .
No doubt it is bad that people cannot always be defended by the protection agency of their choice ; but this sacrifice of freedom is necessary for the existence of society .
Has Skoble accurately diagnosed the motivations of minimal statists ?
He endeavors to support his contention through an analysis of three noted libertarian philosophers : Robert Nozick , Tibor Machan , and Jan Narveson .
As Skoble points out , Narveson abandoned statism after the publication of The Libertarian Idea ; and even there , he displayed considerable dissatisfaction with the state .
Nevertheless , Skoble rightly thinks it important to examine the contractarian argument for the state presented in that book .
His account of Nozick seems to me not fully to have grasped the elusive argument of Part I of Anarchy , State , and Utopia .
Skoble maintains that Nozick favors the minimal state on grounds of efficiency .
Competing protection agencies would fear preemptive attacks by other agencies .
To prevent this outcome , a dominant agency would be justified in forcing everyone in the territory it controls to make use of its services .
Not only could the dominant agency legitimately forbid competition ; it could compel even those who would prefer a different agency to pay for its protective services .
Taken this way , Nozick 's account makes use of just the Hobbesian Fear that Skoble has postulated .
But Nozick does not say that the dominant agency can compel those who prefer other agencies to join it .
Neither can it compel people to pay for its protective services .
Further , although Nozick does discuss preemptive attacks , he does not at all assume that agencies will fear such attacks by other agencies .
Skoble himself quotes a passage from Nozick that appears to undermine his thesis .
[ But we ] have rebutted the charge we imagined earlier that our argument fails because it " proves " too much in that it provides a rationale not only for the permissible rise of a dominant protective association , but also for the association 's forcing someone not to take his patronage elsewhere or for some person 's forcing someone not to join any association .
Our argument provides no rationale for the latter actions and cannot be used to defend them ( p. 68 , emphasis removed , quoting Nozick , Anarchy , State , and Utopia , p. 129 . )
Faced with this passage , how can Skoble maintain his interpretation of Nozick ?
He responds in this way :
If the argument does not provide a justification for the dominant protective association forbidding individuals from opting out , then Nozick has no argument for the state beyond that one could arise without violating anyone 's rights .
However , he views the development as more than simply a logical possibility … he must believe that no competitive set of such agencies could be fair and feasible .
( pp. 68–9 )
Skoble has allowed his conception of what a minimal statist must believe to govern his interpretation of Nozick .
In Nozick 's system , the dominant agency can successfully forbid other agencies from imposing risky decision procedures on its clients .
Because in doing so it disadvantages these independents , it must provide them with low cost or free protective services .
These features , in Nozick 's view , suffice to make the dominant agency a minimal state .
If Skoble does not agree that this is enough for a state , he may well be right ; but that is Nozick 's contention .
He does not say , as Skoble thinks , that preservation of society necessitates rights - violating coercion .
Even if I am right about Nozick , though , does not Skoble still have a good point ?
The reason Nozick thinks that the dominant agency can prohibit risky decision procedures is that knowledge that these procedures may be applied evokes fear .
Do we not have here a type of Hobbesian Fear ?
But this is just the crucial point .
In Skoble 's framework , Hobbesian Fear leads libertarians to accept coercion they would otherwise deem unjustified .
Nozick does not think this : he thinks that the dominant agency acts perfectly within its rights in forbidding risky decision procedures to its clients .
Skoble , if I have understood him , thinks that the dominant agency can de facto shut down all competing agencies by declaring their decision procedures unacceptably risky .
But this is not correct : the dominant agency cannot forbid other agencies from applying such procedures to nonclients .
Nozick does not contend that agencies would be unable , without a minimal state , peacefully to resolve their differences about decision procedures : he thinks that they are under no obligation to do so .
Skoble misses this when he says ,
Do we have any reason to think that companies would seek this ( co-operative ) type of solution , rather than resorting to violent conflict ? …
Nozick can only rule out this possibility by appeal to a Hobbesian Fear . ( p. 69 )
Skoble 's schema also does not fully fit Tibor Machan 's argument .
Machan does raise an objection to competing protection agencies that supports Skoble 's analysis .
Machan envisions a situation in which an agency convicts a client of another agency of a crime .
What then happens ?
If Machan considers this a difficulty for anarchism , must he not think that the agencies would find it difficult , if not impossible , to reach agreement ?
If so , does he not favor a single protection agency in a given territory on grounds of efficiency , precisely as Skoble 's model suggests ?
Machan does indeed raise the problem of competing agencies , but he does not handle it in the way that Skoble 's account would suggest .
He does not argue that because competing agencies would find agreement difficult in this type of case , a monopoly state therefore may out of necessity restrict rights .
Quite the contrary , his contention is that a protection agency of the type he supports violates no one 's rights .
It is not a matter of surrendering rights out of necessity , as Skoble would have it .
My objection to Skoble can be clarified if one considers how a supporter of Robert LeFevre might evoke the Hobbesian Fear against standard libertarian anarchism .
He might claim that conventional anarchists allow the use or threat of force in defense of property .
Such concessions to necessity , he would say , rest on a quasi-Hobbesian view that society could not function without such reliance on force .
Only a system that renounces force altogether , as described e.g. , in LeFevre 's book This Bread Is Mine , qualifies as fully libertarian .
Would not the response of the standard anarchist be obvious ?
People who use force in the indicated circumstances have not violated any rights : the standard anarchist does not agree with LeFevre 's contrary position .
In like fashion , the minarchist does not , I suggest , normally view himself as compromising rights .
He thinks that his system accords with rights .
Skoble of course disagrees , and I think he is correct to do so ; but , once more , it does not follow that , from his own point of view , the minarchist accepts violations of rights .
That said , Skoble 's discussion of the Hobbesian Fear is of great value .
Many people do dismiss libertarian anarchism just because they think that it would lead to chaos .
Skoble argues that the Hobbesian Fear lacks adequate grounds : people can resolve disputes without a monopoly state .
Like many libertarians , Skoble adduces historical examples of societies without a state , Iceland , Ireland , and the American West chief among them .
But he does not stop with this .
He confronts the Hobbesian Fear on its own ground of theory .
The Hobbesian argument may be put in this way .
A group of people may recognize that if all of them refrained from initiating violence , they would all be better off .
No longer would life be nasty , brutish , and short : people could now live peacefully .
Unfortunately , this recognition will fail to generate the required agreement .
Each person will also recognize that he would be still better off if he himself resorted to violence whenever he deemed it advantageous .
If others keep their agreement , so much the better , and if they do not , one clearly is worse off by being the sole person to observe the agreement .
Of course , everyone will reason in the same fashion and no one will keep the agreement .
In brief , we have here a classic Prisoner 's Dilemma .
Skoble brings to bear important work by Robert Axelrod and later writers that undercuts the analysis just presented .
The argument that keeping the agreement , despite its recognized advantages to the group , is irrational applies only in a special case .
If people do not expect to have further dealings with one another , then defection is the rational course .
But people in a society do not find themselves in such a " one- shot Prisoner 's Dilemma . "
Quite the contrary , they must deal with one another repeatedly .
In such an " iterated Prisoner 's Dilemma , " cooperation , not defection is rational .
[ D]efecting is the dominant strategy , only if you play the game just once .
It is not the dominant strategy , the research [ of Axelrod and later writers such as Martin Nowak and Karl Sigmund ] shows , if you play the game in series , that is , over and over again .
It turns out in that case that the most effective strategy is responsive cooperation … ( p. 63 ) Objections can no doubt be raised to this argument ; e.g. , can one directly apply the argument for cooperation to a situation where actors do not repeatedly confront identical payoffs ?
But Skoble 's argument is immensely suggestive .
The assumption that people need a state to survive as a society must confront a powerful challenge .
The book contains much else , e.g. , excellent discussions of how a libertarian anarchist society would handle disasters and whether disagreements between libertarians and advocates of other political views are " incommensurable . "
But I have thought it best to concentrate on Skoble 's central argument .
Deleting the State is an outstanding contribution to libertarian political theory .
The Garbage Collector is really strange business in the Ruby land .
For me , it is the major performance drain currently .
If you are not aware of the limitations here 's a list :
The GC is mark and sweep , it needs to scan the whole heap for each run .
It is directly affected by heap size O( n ) .
The GC can not be interrupted and hence all threads must wait for it to finish ( shameful pause on big heaps ) .
The GC marks objects in the objects themselves destroying any value of copy on write .
The GC does not ( edit : usually ) give memory back to the system .
What goes in does not ( edit : usually ) go out .
It is a bit on the conservative side .
Meaning garbage can stay because it is not sure that it is so .
Needless to say , some of these are being addressed , specially 3 and 5 .
But the patches are not yet accepted in the current Ruby release .
I believe though that they will find their way to 1.8.x which is being maintained by Engine Yard .
The EY guys are really working hard to solve the issues of Ruby as a server platform which is the most popular use for it today thanks to Rails .
Alas , my issue today involves Ruby 1.9.1 ( it does not affect 1.8.x ) .
See I have built this toy server to experiment with multi process applications and some Unix IPC facilities .
I did make the design a bit modular to make it easier to test and debug different aspects of the stack .
So I have these tcp , http handler modules that extend the connection object ( a socket ) whenever a connection is accepted .
Here 's a sample :
conn = server_socket.
accept
conn.extend HttpHandler
..
..
This worked really great and I was even able to chain handlers to get more stack functionality ( a handler will simply include those that it requires ) .
This worked great , until I looked at memory usage .
I discovered that after showering the server with requests it will start to grow in size .
This is acceptable as it is making way for new objects .
But given the way the GC works it should have allocated enough heap locations after a few of those ab runs .
On the contraty , even when I am hitting the same file with ab the server keeps growing .
After 10 or more ab runes ( each doing 10000 requests ) it is still consuming more memory .
So I suspected there is a leak some where .
I tested a hello world and found that the increase was very consistent .
Every 10 K requests the process gains 0.1 to 0.2 MB. ( 10 to 20 Bytes per request ) .
So I started removing components one after another till I was left with a bare server that only requires socket and reactor .
When I tested that server the process started to gain memory then after like 3 or 4 ab runs it stabilized .
It would no longer increase its allocated memory no matter how many times I run ab on it .
So the next logical move was to re-insert the first level of the stack ( the tcp handler module ) .
Once I did that the issue started appearing again .
So the next test was to disable the use of the tcp handler but still decorate my connections with it .
The issue still appeared .
Since the module is not overriding Module .
extended to do any work upon it extending an object it became clear that it is the guilty party .
Instead of Object #extend I tried reopening the BasicSocket class and including the required module there .
After doing that memory usage pattern resembled the bare bones server .
It would increase for a few runs and then remain flat as long as you are hitting the same request .
To isolate the problem further I created this script :
# This code is Ruby 1.9.x and above only
@extend = ARGV[ 0 ]
module BetterHash
def blabla
end
end
unless @extend
class Hash
include BetterHash
end
end
t = Time.now
1_000_000.times do
s = {}
s.extend BetterHash if @extend
end
after = Time.now - t
puts " done with #{GC.count} gc runs after # {after} seconds "
sleep # so that it does n't exit before we check the memory
351 GC runs , 9.108 seconds , 18.7 MB
117 GC runs , 0.198 seconds , 2.8 MB
using extend : using include :
Besides being much faster , the resulting process was much smaller .
Around 16 MB smaller .
I am suspecting that the leak is around 16 bytes or a little less per extend invokation .
This means that a server that uses a single extend per request will increase around 160 KB in size after every 10 K requests .
Not that huge but it will pile up fast if left for a while and the server is under heavy load .
A quick grep in Rails sources showed that this pattern is being used heavily throughout the code .
But it is used to extend base classes rather than objects .
Hence it will not be invoked on every request and the effect will be mostly limited to the initial start size ( a few bytes actually ) .
You should avoid using it dynamically at request serving time though , till it gets fixed .
Renewable energy supporters say a proposed “ solar credit scheme ” will artificially inflate renewable energy figures , potentially limiting investment in large - scale projects , and may actually hurt the renewable energy industry .
In a joint statement from the Alternative Technology Association ( ATA ) , Greenpeace and the Moreland Energy Foundation , they said it is imperative the federal government stops its inconsistent and confusing solar power policies , or risk Australia ’s solar future .
From mid-year , households installing solar panels will receive “ phantom ” credits worth five times the amount of energy generated at home .
If they are cashed in , these phantom certificates ( issued for energy that has not been generated ) will be counted towards the Federal Government ’s renewable energy target of 20 per cent of power coming from green sources by 2020 .
Brad Shone , Moreland Energy Foundation energy strategy manager , said it would be worse if people cashed in certificates issued for solar panels than if they did nothing .
“ People installing solar are actually reducing the amount of renewable energy installed in Australia , ” he said .
“ We would have to recommend that people not claim the rebate available to them for solar , or just not install solar at all .
And that is a horrible situation for an organisation like ours to be in . ”
Alternative Technology Association energy advocate Damien Moyse said based on today ’s figures about 15 per cent of certificates issued for renewable power generation would effectively be fake .
The policy experts also criticised the Government ’s decision to include solar hot water systems — which reduce energy consumption , but do not generate power — towards the renewable target .
About one in five renewable energy certificates issued in 2007 were for solar water heaters .
The solar credit scheme was a late addition to the renewable target proposal .
It was announced in December as a cheaper replacement for the Government ’s $ 8000 solar panel rebate .
The number of certificates issued per kilowatt - hour generated at home will be gradually reduced , ending in 2015 .
But a Moreland Energy Foundation analysis found the phantom certificates would remain in the system .
It found that by 2020 the 20 per cent target would in real terms equate to only 17 per cent of the nation ’s energy coming from green sources .
Climate Change Minister Penny Wong ’s spokeswoman , Ilsa Colson , said Government modelling showed otherwise — that it would reach the 20 per cent target by 2020 .
And she said the inclusion of solar water heaters was justified as they displaced gas and electrical heating that uses fossil fuels .

How did Arizona get in ?
ESPN ’s Mark Schlabach discusses the bubble teams that got in , along with several that did n’t .
Clearly , the biggest surprise is the Arizona Wildcats , who lost to Arizona State in the the Pac - 10 tournament and finished 19 - 13 on the season .
Certainly , the Wildcats are the most surprising team in the 65 - team field .
I thought Arizona ’s 24 - year streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances would end after USC won the Pac - 10 tournament title and claimed the league ’s NCAA auto bid .
Arizona lost to Arizona State for the third time this season , 68 - 56 , in the quarterfinals of the Pac - 10 tournament .
The Wildcats lost five of their last six games and went 2 - 9 in road games .
But they played 16 games against RPI top - 50 foes , winning six of them , and were 8 - 12 against the top 100 .
Obviously , the NCAA selection committee rewarded Arizona for playing a very difficult schedule .
And because Arizona beat teams such as Kansas , Washington , UCLA and USC , it ’s really hard to say there ’s no reason it should n’t be in the field .
Arizona certainly had an argument , but so did several other teams .
Schlabach lists Auburn , Creighton , Penn State , Saint Mary ’s and San Diego State as the five biggest snubs .
Dick Vitale insists that the mid-majors ca n’t get the type of non-conference competition that the major conference teams can get .
They might be able to schedule a big conference team , but they have to play them twice ( in consecutive seasons ) on the road .
Jay Bilas disagrees and says the mid-majors can get the games they want .
Who ’s right ?
Who knows .
I ’d like to hear what some current mid-major coaches have to say about the subject .
Certainly , Gonzaga was able to schedule a ton of challenging games , but Gonzaga is a different animal .
So are Memphis and Xavier .
These mid-majors have a long tradition of great basketball , so it ’s probably easier to get the games that they want .
The thing that gets me is that the Wildcats lost five of their last six games in the Pac - 10 , which is down this season .
They finished 9 - 9 in conference .
Sure , they have the players to compete with anyone , but they ’ve underachieved all season .
Why reward them ?

Janey Antoniou coaches ambulance staff in dealing with mental illness Janey Antoniou has schizophrenia .
She regularly hears voices and has paranoid delusions .
But when the emergency services try to help her , or others like her , they can end up making things much worse .
In a bid to try and prevent misunderstandings , Janey , with the use of a tape filled with competing voices , has been coaching ambulance service staff on the world of schizophrenia .
" I see the world differently from other people .
I have delusions which can lead me to do strange thing such as walking around London all night trying to get away from a Filipino army .
Hospital stays " At the moment I am ending up in hospital once or twice a year and if I am stressed and uncomfortable it is more difficult to cope with the illness . "
Hearing her talk about her illness , Phil Alexander , of the East of England Ambulance Trust , said he wanted her to explain to his staff the problems those with mental health problems can suffer .
I tell them that they can't turn down the cassette because I can't turn down my voices
Janey Antoniou
" She brings a Walkman with about seven voices on it talking at different volumes .
" One person wears the headphones , while another asks questions and a third observes .
" It gives the observer the opportunity to see what it is like for the person hearing the voices to try and have a conversation .
" We then get Janey to talk about mental health problems .
The tapes help people experience what it is like to hear voices " We say if you have a broken leg and in pain you can see it , but unless someone tells you that a patient has mental health problems you have no way of knowing without trying to interpret what is happening .
" It gives them a little more empathy with patients . "
He estimated that up to 9 % of call - outs involved someone with a mental health problem .
Improving empathy Janey , who has been schizophrenic for 23 years , says efforts like this do improve empathy .
" I talk about mental health problems to them and give them some personal advice such as moving away from the radio when they talk to me , because to me that is just another voice .
" I tell them that they can't turn down the cassette because I can't turn down my voices . "
Ambulance man Chris Perry said his time with Janey had helped .
" It was brilliant , very good , and it gave us an understanding of what people go through when suffering from these disorders that has stayed with me ever since , " he said .
" I am quite confident now asking what would have been tricky questions such as , ' Are you hearing voices ? ' "
He added : " There was a case where a patient 's medication did not seem to be working as well as it should and he was hearing voices telling him to do things .
" It was quite a nasty area of the town and we were on edge but I approached him and , once we were sure we were safe , I thought back to the session and talked to him .
He was quite open and talked about the problem .
" Before I would have tried to avoid all contact with the patient , which would have only alienated him more . "
The idea has been so successful that it has been highlighted , by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement , as one of the country 's best examples of how a patient 's experiences can be used to improve the health service .
Other schemes which have been praised by the institute include a renal unit that created a " wish wall " , allowing patients to highlight problems or issues via Post - it notes , and a stroke team which has put toilet roll holders on both sides in all toilets to help patients who have lost the use of an arm .

In the week that ex-MI5 head Stella Rimington warned that Britain is becoming a police state , we offer one ray of light : a coalition from left and right determined to uphold our hard - won civil liberties and rights .
Robert McCrum reports
What do you see ?
A thriller writer , a Tory candidate and a rebel peer ?
Three middle - aged men ?
A well - known academic and a Pakistani journalist scurrilously said to be dating George Clooney ?
The front line in the peoples ' ancient war with the power of the state ?
The defence of our island freedoms can seem as paradoxical as those freedoms themselves .
Consider the record .
Here is a country with no written constitution , one that has always believed passionately in the rights of the individual , a society whose first assertion of the citizen 's liberties , Magna Carta , was negotiated in a field outside Windsor and recorded in Latin .
More perplexing still , our parliamentary democracy is famous for an act of regicide but still pays allegiance to the crown .
Our Bill of Rights followed a foreign invasion led by a Dutchman .
Today , one of our best protections , the European Convention on Human Rights , is run from Strasbourg .
Defending this heritage is what separates a democracy from a tyranny , but the champions of our liberty hardly fit a mould either .
Wat Tyler ?
A retired military man and poll - tax rebel .
John Milton ?
A blind poet and author of the classic defence of press freedom in the English language , Areopagitica .
John Wilkes ?
A notorious rake and author of the pornographic " Essay on Woman " .
Tom Paine ?
The author of those 18th - century bestsellers Common Sense and The Rights of Man was a drunk , a failed tobacconist and a designer of corsets .
Freedom has many expressions , but it is , finally , indivisible .
Today , a wide spectrum of citizens from Stella Rimington , ex-head of MI5 , to the columnist and Oxford academic , Timothy Garton Ash , accuses the government of exploiting fear of terrorism to infringe our civil liberties .
in what Garton Ash calls " death by a thousand cuts " , a silent but deadly accumulation of police powers .
What animates these new libertarians is a passionate belief that the equilibrium between individual and state has become dangerously skewed , as in the increase of detention time limits to 42 days .
Rimington says the war on terror risks making people " live in fear and under a police state " .
At the heart of the photograph above are two men of sharply contrasting experience who have united to launch the Convention on Modern Liberty out of a shared distrust of what they see as New Labour 's sinister agenda .
Henry Porter is a journalist , a thriller writer and London editor of Vanity Fair .
He has long campaigned in the Observer against the rise of the secret state under New Labour and the government 's assault on our rights and freedoms , the issue on which David Davis resigned his Commons seat last June .
Anthony Barnett has rich experience of fighting injustice .
He was a founder member of Charter 88 , a group that campaigned for a democratic , written constitution .
He says : " We are now faced by some kind of a system crisis .
There 's a generation that 's grown up under New Labour which has known nothing else .
We have to address people in their twenties . '
Barnett had been following Henry Porter 's columns in the Observer when they met at the funeral of Anthony Sampson , author of The Anatomy of Britain .
At the graveside , they decided they had to do something and needed a media partner .
There was only one place to go .
Porter volunteered to approach the Guardian Media Group , which owns the Observer , while Barnett began to mobilise his Charter 88 network .
If Barnett provided the rocket fuel , then Porter is the self - guided missile .
He has marshalled a persuasive attack on CCTV surveillance , the government 's DNA database and its ID card legislation .
For Porter , the state is the enemy , a conventional Tory position .
But left and right labels are n't helpful here because New Labour 's assault on civil liberties has also galvanised the old left .
So the Convention on Modern Liberty unites an informal opposition to New Labour in a big , baggy tent that includes Amnesty International , the Countryside Alliance , English Pen , History Today , Human Rights Watch , Private Eye , Red Pepper and the TUC .
Underlying all this is a passionate defence of the English tradition of common law , uniting the likes of Joanne Cash , the media barrister specialising in libel and privacy , with New Labour rebel Helena Kennedy .
Cash , a prospective Tory candidate for John Stuart Mill 's old seat of Westminster , says she is motivated by the threats to freedom of expression .
Kennedy , who was a chair of Charter 88 , has been worrying about our laws for a decade and more .
In 2004 , she published Just Law , a polemical defence of our civil liberties , and brings many of these arguments to the convention : " You must defend the foundations , " she says .
" English common law , in which I passionately believe , is based on a healthy scepticism about the exercise of power . "
Thanks to Barnett 's international savvy , the convention has avoided Little Englander provincialism , securing the support of Fatima Bhutto , an outspoken critic of Pakistan 's state corruption .
Another lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , comes to the convention from a global perspective .
He has led the field in securing the release of British detainees in Guantánamo Bay .
Half - American by birth , he can see the weaknesses of the English position and comments that , compared with Americans , " the English have never really internalised the notion of free speech " .
He salutes Porter 's leadership and hopes the campaign will adopt a positive , possibly more American , spirit of optimism .
" The left has a tendency to complain , " he says .
" We should at least focus our energies on a new Bill of Rights . "
There is a profound cultural dimension too , involving questions of education , women 's rights and pornography .
These have drawn Marina Warner , one of the most subtle analysts of contemporary cultural transactions , into Porter 's tent .
She will lead a convention session on " Love and Liberty " .
She says : " I always welcome it when political gatherings place anything cultural at the heart of their thinking .
Justice and equality need to be shaped philosophically before they can take a precise form .
It 's a brilliant idea to think about love and liberty .
Let 's hear it for co-operative species ! "
Barnett says the Convention on Modern Liberty has studied the Obama campaign , and is " inspired by , but not modelled on , it . "
The convention will deploy video links and internet communications to conduct a simultaneous programme of consciousness - raising on 28 February .
Porter resists the suggestion that it 's just a giant , middle - class seminar .
" It 's a call to action , " he says , " a call to arms . "
How long do we have before it 's too late ?
" Two years . "
Barnett has a less urgent perspective , based on fighting old battles , but still talks of a crisis .
" This feels very different from Charter 88 .
We 're looking at a process that will take five to 10 years and it will be led by people in their twenties .
A new generation must drive this convention . "
His inspiration ?
The Levellers .

I was reminded of this as I was reading the NY Times ' piece on netbooks today .
It was this part that stirred the memory cells in my brain :
for just $ 50 if they signed up for an Internet service plan — an offer
the phone company may introduce elsewhere after a test period .
AT&T announced on Tuesday that customers in Atlanta could get a type of compact PC called a netbook for just $ 50 if they signed up for an Internet service plan — an offerthe phone company may introduce elsewhere after a test period .
Ten years ago , my prior firm Flatiron Partners " incubated " a company called Internet Appliance Network ( or IAN as it became known ) .
The idea was championed inside our firm by Seth Goldstein and also by our good friend Russ Pillar .
We came up with a plan to build cheap internet appliance devices and partner with brands to give them away .
The idea was that we could build a large user base and make money through advertising , marketing , and e-commerce .
It was 1999 of course .
We invested something like $ 10 mm in the business and built a team of talented engineers and business people and launched a device which we partnered with Virgin Entertainment to take to market .
This is what the device looked like :
Needless to say , this was not a successful investment .
The device worked but it had a number of fatal flaws outlined in this PC World review from 2000 ( you gotta love the internet , history is retrievable in a nanosecond ) .
Tom Spring said the following about the IAN device :
Disappointment began with slow connection speeds .
About 70 percent
of the time I tried to connect to the Web I had trouble logging on .
Sometimes
Web pages took nearly 10 minutes to load .
Prodigy ,
responsible for connectivity , says slow and failed connections have
less to do with its network and more to do with compatibility between
the appliance 's modem and the Prodigy modems I dial into .
Worse ,
Bill Kirkner , Prodigy 's chief technology officer , tells me that
updating software on any appliance with a " nonstandard operating system
and nonstandard hardware is a very tricky proposition . "
There were other problems wtih the device , but honestly the business model and the implosion of the internet bubble had as much to do with IAN 's failure as the shortcomings of the device .
But another reason this failed is that we were ten years too early .
We knew that cheap hardware and connectivity , the emerging era of web based apps , and the value of a one to one relationship with a consumer was a winning proposition .
We did n't know it would take ten years to become viable .
Beware of " way too early " .
It hurts and it keeps hurting .
Which is good .
Because no pain , no gain .

A dental crown is one of the highly utilized dental restoration techniques .
More than 15 million individuals in the country have bridge or crown replacements .
If you are interested to obtain dental crowns treatment , you should consider fixing an appointment with a leading dentist in estobicoke .
Also , learn the benefits and types of dental crowns as a full list here before fixing an appointment .
A dental crown is the fixed prosthetic device fixed to an implant or tooth .
It is mostly referred to as crowns and helps in covering a damaged tooth .
It is mostly utilized to restore the confidence and smile , enhance the appearance and strength of the tooth , and restore the size and shape of the tooth .
After the crown is placed , it will be cemented .
The problem tooth will be enclosed by the permanent implant .
Thus , your smile will be restored and you can also be confident again .
Dental crowns are suggested for several purposes such as :
To safeguard the week tooth .
There are chances for the teeth to get the chip , crack , break , and decay .
When the cap is placed , the tooth will be strongly fixed .
When you have a protected tooth , you can be sure of a healthy smile .
To reinstate the broken tooth .
If the tooth is severely worn or affected , caps can be utilized to restore the tooth .
To enhance the smile .
The smile looks better by covering a misshapen or discolored tooth .
To offer support for the dental ridge .
When it comes to a dental bridge , you need to have two healthy and strong teeth on both sides .
A dental crown will be planned if in case , the dental bridge requires extra support .
Kinds of crowns :
There are several materials to create a permanent crown .
It includes ceramic , resin , porcelain bonded to metal , stainless steel , and metal .
Metal can hold pressure from constant biting and chewing and is durable .
They are highly resilient to breakage or chipping and are long - lasting .
Color is the only major drawback of metal crowns .
It is recommended for molars that are not seen .
If you are looking for a temporary option , stainless steel crowns serve best .
It is used for adults to preserve the tooth .
In some cases , the crown will be made using a different material and stainless steel crown will be applied like a stop - gap .
It is mostly used for children .
It is because they need one procedure and are cost - effective .
For children , the crown will be set up on the primary tooth .
It means the crown will fall when the permanent tooth develops into the gums .
Another cost - effective option is resin .
But these resin crowns have chances to wear .
They can also crack due to pressure .
The cost of dental crowns depends upon the treatment planned and material used .
Some of the important factors considered for deciding the crown ’s cost includes geographic location , the material used , and dental insurance coverage .
If you have serious tooth decay or damage , you should get extra dental procedures .
The dentist may suggest you get a root canal , dental x-rays , professional cleaning , or bridge along with the dental crown .
Not long to wait now , until Doctor Who : Planet of the Dead is unleashed upon us .
Here 's the official blurb from the BBC for the special starring David Tennant , Michelle Ryan and Lee Evans that broadcasts at 6.45 pm on Saturday .
When a London bus takes a detour to an alien world , the Doctor must join forces with the extraordinary Lady Christina .
But the mysterious planet holds terrifying secrets , hidden in the sand .
And time is running out , as the deadly Swarm gets closer ...
Sounds exciting , eh ?
I have deliberately found out as little about his one as possible , as I find that adds to the enjoyment .
I will come back on Saturday evening sometime and post a proper review , but in the meantime feel free to add your comments .
It looks like our ninja took it personally yesterday when we mentioned how eager we were for more info on Motorola ’s Verizon - bound handsets .
That said , consider us shut up .
He swooped in with a few big updates that will definitely tide us over for a while — some good news and some bad — so let ’s get right to it …
First and foremost , the Calgary will indeed be Motorola ’s first Android - powered handset .
Some suspected it when rumors of a QWERTY - sliding Google phone from Moto emerged and it looks like that was a good call .
The handset will likely focus on social networking to some extent and we ’re pretty confident this could be a winner .
The G1 and Magic are a bit , err , ho-hum and Samsung ’s I7500 is basically just another full touchscreen phone .
Moto could really knock it out of the park by introducing a unique , well - designed Android beast and the Calgary looks to be just that .
We ’re not yet able to confirm whether or not the Calgary is slated for Q2 as had been rumored regarding Motorola ’s first Android offering .
More after the jump .
Now some bad news :
The Flash and Inferno , each pictured above , have been canned .
While the Inferno was n’t really shaping up to be much of a stunner , we really wanted to see what Moto had in store for the Flash .
The design is fantastic and it could definitely have translated to reality very , very well .
Such is life however , and Moto is right to focus on the handsets it determines to have the most potential .
Que sera sera .
Last up for the time being are a few tidbits surrounding a new handset in development at Moto — the Rolex .
While little is known about it for the time being , our ninja tells us the Rolex is made almost entirely of hardened glass and it will sport the same display as the Aura .
Sick .
We ’re not sure if this will be a mass - production unit or another pricey short run like the Aura but either way , we ca n’t wait to see it .
A quick shot of the Rolex screen while we wait with bated breath for more :
This is Holy Week .
It started yesterday with Palm Sunday and continues through Holy Thursday , Good Friday and culminates this Sunday with Easter Day .
One can no longer assume most people will be aware of this , let alone the events these days mark ; in a recent UK poll , only 22 % could identify what Easter was celebrating .
What other system of belief has collapsed at such spectacular speed as British Christianity ?
One can only presume that the New Atheists are organising a fabulous party to celebrate .
Richard Dawkins could stump up for the crates of champagne out of his sumptuous royalties from The God Delusion .
But I 'm curious as to how many of the country 's finest minds would join the celebrations .
Increasingly , one hears a distaste for the polemics of the New Atheist debate and its foghorn volume , and how it has drowned out any other kind of conversation about religion : what it is , the loss of it , whether it matters , and what happens in a post - religious society ?
From sometimes surprising quarters there is an anxiety about the evangelical fervour and certainty of the New Atheists : they are so sure they are right , but there are plenty of people - and many of them would not count themselves as believers - who can't share their contempt for religion .
Just this week , AN Wilson announces in a thoughtful cover article for the New Statesman that he has apostated , abandoning his fellow atheists .
Or take another example : in the Third Way , a Christian magazine , the poet Andrew Motion reflects wistfully , " I do n't believe in God - though I wish I did , and I can't stop thinking about it so who knows what might happen one day ? "
Wilson and Motion talk of uncertainty , doubt and faith in terms that are probably far more familiar to the vast majority of the British - many of whom still describe themselves as believing in God , whatever they mean by that - than the certitudes used by Dawkins .
New Atheism may come to be regarded as winning a battle but losing the war .
What many argue is that the New Atheist debate has ended up down an intellectual dead end ; there are only so many times you can argue that religion is a load of baloney .
Ask a philosopher like John Gray or a historian of religion like Karen Armstrong and they are simply not interested in the debate ; they bin the invitations to speak on platforms alongside New Atheists .
Gray dismisses them as offering " intoxicating simplicity " ; Armstrong is appalled by their " display of egotism and arrogance " .
Both are deeply frustrated by a debate inflated by the media that generates heat but no light .
They see the New Atheists mirroring a particular strain of fundamentalist Christianity with no knowledge of the vast variety of other forms of religious faith .
In common with their Christian opponents , they share " the inner glow of complete certainty " - as Wilson describes his atheist conversion .
Armstrong and Gray converge again on where they pinpoint the key mistake .
Belief came to be understood in western Christianity as a proposition at which you arrive intellectually , but Armstrong argues that this has been a profound misunderstanding that , in recent decades , has also infected other faiths .
What " belief " used to mean , and still does in some traditions , is the idea of " love " , " commitment " , " loyalty " : saying you believe in Jesus or God or Allah is a statement of commitment .
Faith is not supposed to be about signing up to a set of propositions but practising a set of principles .
Faith is something you do , and you learn by practice not by studying a manual , argues Armstrong .
" We need to get away from the endless discussion about wretched beliefs ; religion is about doing - and what every faith makes clear is that the doing is about compassion , " she argues .
To try and shift the debate about faith into more fruitful territory , Armstrong came up with the idea of a global Charter on Compassion for all faiths ( and none ) , which she is drafting and planning to launch later in the year .
From a different perspective , Alain de Botton , the philosopher and writer , has also been trying to broaden the conversation .
He has founded a School of Life in London , which runs courses and events reflecting on how to live .
He describes himself as " definitely an atheist " , but readily admits he borrows plenty from religions .
His team have instituted the idea of Sunday sermons , and organise contemporary " pilgrimages " .
" Even if you 're an atheist , there are a huge number of insights in religion , " he says .
" We 're in danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater . "
De Botton argues that the decline of religious faith has left behind a real and widespread need for wisdom and insight ; the media offers only a " cruel sentimentality " and gives little space to the most difficult of our life experiences , such as failure , death or envy , nor does it offer ways to deal with them .
The author Mark Vernon teaches on some School of Life courses .
A former priest and atheist , he now advocates a principled agnosticism rooted in an understanding of the limits of human knowledge .
He argues that the most interesting conversations about faith are among those just outside religious traditions and those just inside - along the borders of belief , if you like .
It 's a perspective that Gray shares .
Describing himself as a sceptic , he looks to another border of belief for deeper insight into the nature of faith : the dialogue between the theistic and non-theistic .
Intriguingly , where Gray , Armstrong and Vernon all end up is with the apophatic tradition of theology .
Apophatic is a word no longer even in my dictionary , but it 's a major tradition of Christian thought , and central to the thinking of St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas : it is the idea that God is ineffable and beyond powers of description .
S/he can be experienced by religious practice , but as Armstrong puts it : " In the past , people knew we could say nothing about God. Certain forms of knowledge only come with practice . "
It makes the boundary between belief in God and agnosticism much more porous than commonly assumed .
But the modern distortion was to make God into a proposition in which you either did or did not believe .
He was turned into an old man in the sky with a long white beard or promoted as a cuddly friend named Jesus .
Arguing about the existence of such human creations is akin to the medieval pastime of calculating how many angels could fit on the head of a pin .
So the media has been promoting the wrong argument , while the bigger question of how , in a post - religious society , people find the myths they need to sustain meaning , purpose and goodness in their lives go unexplored .
What worries Gray is that we forget at our peril that all systems of thought rely on myth .
By junking the Christian myths , the danger is that the replacements are " cruder , less tested , less instructive " .
At times of crisis - such as the economic recession - the brittleness of a value system built on wealth and a particular conception of autonomy becomes all too apparent , leaving people without the sustaining reserves of a faith to fall back on .
The consequences of that will certainly not be cause for celebration , he warns .

King George VI was discovered dead in bed in the early morning of 6 February 1952 .
He was 56 .
A few hours later I was walking home at lunchtime with a few classmates from primary school .
" Look at that flag ! " one of them said , and we looked across the playing fields towards a cotton mill that had a flagpole on its roof .
The flag was only halfway up the mast : " It means the king has died . "
This is my earliest memory of public death .
A period of severe public mourning followed .
Cinemas and theatres closed , BBC broadcasts were restricted to news bulletins and solemn music .
It would be impossible to live in Britain then , even as a six - year - old , and not recognise that a serious mood had been imposed and was , for many people , being fretfully endured .
For every one of us this week who could n't bear to read or hear another word about Jade Goody - we were absolutely up to here ( the gullet ) with her and her alleged significance - there would be somebody in 1952 angrily wondering when Abbot and Costello would resume at the Odeon .
The difference then was that the grievous instructions arrived from above , by fiat , and not , as now , through a media anxious to feed and develop what it sensed to be a public appetite .
As to what the king died of and why he died of it , these things to most people remained more or less unknown .
The king had long been known to have " a lung condition " .
Like his brother , grandfather and younger daughter , he was a great smoker and by 1952 the link between smoking and lung cancer had already been established - but not until several decades later were " lung cancer " and " cigarettes " and " the king " connected in the same sentence .
This can partly be explained by the respectful reticence once shown towards the royal family , but with that explanation comes a more general and now faded idea of good behaviour involving stoicism , privacy and never mentioning the most dreaded disease by name .
Consider this scene from July 1952 .
The new Queen is staying with her uncle , David Bowes - Lyon , and hears that Kathleen Ferrier , the celebrated contralto , is spending the weekend nearby .
She has 15 more months to live .
The Queen sends word inviting Ferrier to sing for her .
Ferrier obliges .
After the recital , the Queen sits next to her on a sofa and , in the words of Ferrier 's sister " knowing the true nature of her illness " , asks her how she is .
" Just the odd ache , Ma'am " , is the reply .
" You have to expect these things . "
The contrast between Ferrier and Goody in terms of talent and achievement needs no spelling out .
The second was an awkward , graceless , shouty woman who liked appearing on TV .
The first had one of the most beautiful voices among classical singers in the last century .
The conductor Bruno Walter said that the two greatest musical experiences in his life had been knowing Ferrier and Mahler - " in that order " - while to the critic Neville Cardus not since Ellen Terry had any artist " been so universally loved " ; by the time of her death aged 41 in 1953 she may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen .
But the more interesting contrast between Ferrier and Goody , and between then and now , is how the process of suffering has become a public act .
Ferrier had feared cancer ever since childhood , when she saw a neighbour in Blackburn die slowly of it .
Throughout the 1940s she 'd worried about pains in her breasts .
In July 1950 , she went to a doctor and emerged shouting to her voice teacher , waiting outside , " Look , Prof !
He 's given me a clean bill of health . "
A wrong diagnosis , however .
The next March she asked her assistant , who happened to be trained nurse , to have a look at a lump .
A mastectomy followed .
Ferrier wrote cheerfully to close friends about a " rather formidable op " to remove a " bump on mi busto " , but then heavy doses of radium therapy began to exhaust her and in any event the cancer had already metastasised .
She collapsed during a recording of Mahler 's Das Lied von der Erde in Vienna .
The femur in her left leg snapped during the second performance of Orpheus at Covent Garden in February 1953 - her last public appearance .
She vomited in the wings , but with the aid of morphine took several curtain calls .
She was dead seven months later .
And what did the public know of her disease during the years between diagnosis and death ?
Almost nothing .
Ferrier spoke of her " rheumatics " and wrote to friends in America that they should ignore any " malicious rumours " , behaviour probably motivated by a combination of subconscious denial and a fear for the truth 's effect on her career .
In May 1953 , the Sunday Times wrote that during her last Covent Garden performance she had concealed from the audience " the fact that she was suffering most painfully from arthritis " .
It took death to prize out the forbidden word , and at first not extensively ; " cancer " is hard to find in her anthology of tributes .
Her friends remembered , however , that she 'd promised that when she recovered she would give a fundraising recital for the radiotherapy department at University College hospital , which had treated her kindly .
A charity was established , the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund .
All kinds of people sent money ; newspapers reported £ 5 notes in envelopes from pensioners in Huddersfield .
Ferrier ( like Goody ) had touched the British public , but ( unlike Goody ) through her superb art rather than the depiction of her dying ; through Blow the Wind Southerly and Gluck 's What is Life ?
rather than a shaved head and a white wedding dress , though after her death those same songs took on a more resonant melancholy .
And yet in the end what does the difference matter ?
Ferrier was perhaps the first well - publicised female victim of cancer in this country .
University College hospital now has both a Kathleen Ferrier professor and reader of Oncology .
Thanks to Jade Goody , more young women are aware of cervical smear tests than ever before .
This week I tried to find the plaque to Ferrier that her biographers said had been placed in UCH 's radiotherapy department - unsuccessfully because the hospital has been rebuilt .
Watching people come and go through reception on those urgent errands that sooner or later we shall all be the object of , I thought of how many lives might have been prolonged , perhaps including Ferrier 's , if so much earlier cancer had stopped being taken like a shaming secret to the grave .
A scene from " Night of the Living Dead "
Braaaains !
Including the mediation of subcortical fear by the anterior cingulate gyrus !
On Monday night , Science on the Screen at the Coolidge Corner Theatre will sponsor a showing of the classic zombie film " Night of the Living Dead , " preceded by a talk by Dr. Steven Schlozman -- zombie enthusiast and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
George Romero , the man behind " Night of the Living Dead , " may not be a neuroscientist , but he and the zombie - auteurs who followed him have an uncanny understanding of the brain works , according to Schlozman .
The first part is fairly intuitive .
Zombies are humans whose own brains have regressed to the level of a crocodile 's , the filters between primal urges and action entirely erased .
( See flesh , eat flesh . )
In contrast , the protagonists in zombie films , the survivors , retain the brain functions that tamp down primal reactions before passing them on to the higher cortical regions .
They think before they act -- at first .
And that 's the crux of one of Schlozman 's arguments :
The story changes as the situation grows grimmer .
Here , the professor draws on " mirror neuron " theory , which holds that humans are hard - wired to reflect the psychological states of the people around them .
( Show a test subject a short film of a face displaying disgust , or pleasure , and regions of the brain associated with those feelings activate in the subject . )
Unable to relate to the hordes of undead , the survivors in zombie films enter a spiral of despair , feeding off the panic and hopelessness of the uninfected people around them .
At the bottom of the spiral comes a crucial psychological moment , Schlozman tells Brainiac , one that you 'll find in most zombie flicks :
The protagonists rush out of whatever symbolic structure they happen to be walled up in ( churches , malls , etc ) and rather than letting the Zombies simply devour them , they try to kill as many Zombies as they can even though they know it 's useless !
They fully expect to die .
Since not even Romero has a bleak enough vision to annihilate all of his characters * , the psychological bottoming - out is followed by a shameful reawakening .
Schlozman will present the fully - fleshed - out version of his zombie spiel at 7 p.m. , at the independent Brookline theater .
Why Food Prices will go through the Roof in coming Months
A deadly fungus , known as Ug99 , which kills wheat , has likely spread to Pakistan from Africa according to reports .
If true , that threatens the vital Asian Bread Basket including the Pu nj ab region .
The spread of the deadly virus , stem rust , against which an effective fungicide does not exist , comes as world grain stocks reach the lowest in four decades and government subsidized bio-ethanol production , especially in the USA , Brazil and EU are taking land out of food production at alarming rates .
The deadly fungus is being used by Monsanto and the US Government to spread patented GMO seeds .
Stem rust is the worst of three rusts that afflict wheat plants .
The fungus grows primarily in the stems , plugging the vascular system so carbohydrates can't get from the leaves to the grain , which shrivels .
Ug99 is a race of stem rust that blocks the vascular tissues in cereal grains including wheat , oats and barley .
Unlike other rusts that may reduce crop yields , Ug99 - infected plants may suffer up to 100 percent loss .
In the 1950s , the last major outbreak destroyed 40 % of the spring wheat crop in North America .
At that time governments started a major effort to breed resistant wheat plants , led by Norman Borlaug of the Rockefeller Foundation .
That was the misnamed Green Revolution .
The result today is far fewer varieties of wheat that might resist such a new fungus outbreak .
The first strains of Ug99 were detected in 1999 in Uganda .
It spread to Kenya by 2001 , to Ethiopia by 2003 and to Yemen when the cyclone Gonu spread its spores in 2007 .
Now the deadly fungus has been found in Iran and according to British scientists may already be as far as Pakistan .
Pakistan and India account for 20 percent of the annual world wheat production .
It is possible as the fungus spreads that large movements could take place almost overnight if certain wind conditions prevail at the right time .
In 2007 a three - day wind event recorded by Mexico 's CIMMYT ( International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ) , had strong wind currents moving from Yemen , where Ug99 is present , across Pakistan and India , going all the way to China .
CIMMYT estimates that from two - thirds to three - quarters of the wheat now planted in India and Pakistan are highly susceptible to this new strain of stem rust .
One billion people who live in this region and they are highly dependent on wheat for their food supply .
These are all areas where the agricultural infrastructure to contain such problems is either extremely weak or non-existent .
It threatens to spread into other wheat producing regions of Asia and eventually the entire world if not checked .
FAO World Grain Forecast
The 2007 World Agriculture Forecast of the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) in Rome , projects an alarming trend in world food supply even in the absence of any devastation from Ug99 .
The report states , “ countries in the non-OECD region are expected to continue to experience a much stronger increase in consumption of agricultural products than countries in the OECD area .
This trend is driven by population and , above all , income growth – underpinned by rural migration to higher income urban areas ... OECD countries as a group are projected to lose production and export shares in many commodities …
Growth in the use of agricultural commodities as feedstock to a rapidly increasing biofuel industry is one of the main drivers in the outlook and one of the reasons for international commodity prices to attain a significantly higher plateau over the outlook period than has been reported in the previous reports . ” ( my emphasis — w.e. ) .
The FAO warns that the explosive growth in acreage used to grow fuels and not food in the past three years is dramatically changing the outlook for food supply globally and forcing food prices sharply higher for all foods from cereals to sugar to meat and dairy products .
The use of cereals , sugar , oilseeds and vegetable oils to satisfy the needs of a rapidly
increasing bio - fuel industry , is one of the main drivers , most especially the large volumes of maize in the US , wheat and rapeseed in the EU and sugar in Brazil for ethanol and bio -diesel production .
This is already causing dramatically higher crop prices , higher feed costs and sharply higher prices for livestock products .
Ironically , the current bio-ethanol industry is being driven by US government subsidies and a scientifically false argument in the EU and USA that bio-ethanol is less harmful to the environment than petroleum fuels and can reduce CO2 emissions .
The arguments have been demonstrated in every respect to be false .
The huge expansion of global acreage now planted to produce bio-fuels is creating ecological problems and demanding use of far heavier pesticide spraying while use of bio-fuels in autos releases even deadlier emissions than imagined .
The political effect , however , has been a catastrophic shift down in world grain stocks at the same time the EU and USA have enacted policies which drastically cut traditional emergency grain reserves .
In short , it is a scenario pre-programmed for catastrophe , one which has been clear to policymakers in the EU and USA for several years .
That can only suggest that such a dramatic crisis in global food supply is intentional .
A plan to spread GMO ?
One of the consequences of the spread of Ug99 is a campaign by Monsanto Corporation and other major producers of genetically manipulated plant seeds to promote wholesale introduction of GMO wheat varieties said to be resistant to the Ug99 fungus .
Biologists at Monsanto and at the various GMO laboratories around the world are working to patent such strains .
Norman Borlaug , the former Rockefeller Foundation head of the Green Revolution is active in funding the research to develop a fungus resistant variety against Ug99 working with his former center in Mexico , the CIMMYT and ICARDA in Kenya , where the pathogen is now endemic .
So far , about 90 % of the 12,000 lines tested are susceptible to Ug99 .
That includes all the major wheat cultivars of the Middle East and west Asia .
At least 80 % of the 200 varieties sent from the United States can't cope with infection .
The situation is even more dire for Egypt , Iran , and other countries in immediate peril .
Even if a new resistant variety was ready to be released today it would take two or three years ' seed increase in order to have just enough wheat seed for 20 percent of the acres planted to wheat in the world .
Work is also being done by the USDA 's Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) , the same agency which co-developed Monsanto 's Terminator seed technology .
In my book , Seeds of Destruction I document the insidious role of Borlaug and the Rockefeller Foundation in promoting the misnamed Green Revolution as well as patents on food seeds to ultimately control food supplies as a potential political lever .
The spreading alarm over the Ug99 fungus is being used by Monsanto and other GMO agribusiness companies to demand that the current ban on GMO wheat be lifted to allow spread of GMO patented wheat seeds on the argument they are Ug99 stem rust resistant .

Pyongyang insists its launch carried a communications satellite North Korea has started to reprocess spent fuel rods at its nuclear plant , says the country 's state media .
The reprocessing is a possible move towards producing weapons grade plutonium and comes after Pyongyang 's launch of a long - range rocket in April .
Earlier , the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on three North Korean companies in response to the launch .
Pyongyang said it would ignore the sanctions , describing them as " a wanton violation of the UN charter " .
" The reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the Foreign Ministry statement dated 14 April , " North Korea 's Central News Agency ( KCNA ) quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying .
That was the date that Pyongyang announced it was pulling out of talks on its nuclear programme and would restart its Yongbyon reactor .
The official said the reprocessing would " contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self - defence in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces " .
Fresh concern
Satellite view of nuclear site
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says this announcement is confirmation that - for now at least - North Korea is serious about turning its back on the six - party talks , the long - running nuclear disarmament negotiations involving its four closest neighbours and the United States .
North Korea had already partially dismantled its nuclear reactor - the source of material for a 2006 atomic test .
But it now says it is reprocessing remaining spent fuel rods , which experts say could provide material for at least one more nuclear bomb .
The country is already thought to possess enough reprocessed plutonium for between six and eight nuclear weapons - so in the immediate term the announcement does not significantly alter the strategic balance , our correspondent says .

Engage , appease , oppose ?
N Korea a problem for Obama Timeline : North Korea
But there will be deep concern in Washington and Seoul that the nuclear talks process , which began in 2003 , seems to be unravelling fast and a defiant North Korea is arming itself once again , he adds .
Pyongyang 's announcement came only hours after the UN imposed sanctions on three companies it said had supported North Korea 's controversial rocket launch , as well as updating the list of goods and technologies already banned .
The North says the launch put a satellite in orbit broadcasting patriotic songs , but critics say it was a long - range missile test that crashed into the Pacific .
The sanctions mark the first concrete steps against Pyongyang since the UN officially condemned the launch .
The UN's Sanctions Committee head said the new sanctions aimed partly at denying North Korea access to some of the latest technologies relevant to ballistic missile programmes .
' Inalienable right ' North Korea 's Deputy UN Ambassador Pak Tok Hun said the decision was " a wanton violation of the United Nations charter " .
" It is the inalienable right of every nation and country to make peaceful use of outer space , " he said .
" That is why we totally reject and do not recognise any sort of decision which has been made in the Security Council . "
The debate over sanctions has been complicated by opposition from Russia and China , a major trading partner , over how to respond to North Korea 's actions .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , who has been in Pyongyang in an attempt to persuade the North to return to the nuclear talks , said earlier that sanctions were " not constructive " .
But US diplomats said the new sanctions were " a serious and credible response " to the launch .
The UN Security Council council unanimously condemned North Korea 's rocket launch on 13 April , saying it was a cover for a long - range missile test and as such contravened a 2006 resolution banning such tests .

If insomnia is derailing your sleep , a prescription sleeping pill may not be the best cure .
Here are some options to explore :
Practice good " sleep hygiene . "
This does not mean making sure your bedding is clean !
It means following good sleep habits , especially ensuring the bedroom environment is conducive to sleep .
Among experts ' recommendations :
Use the bedroom only for sleep and sex ; keep regular sleep and wake times ; eliminate afternoon caffeine ; banish pets ( and snoring partners ) from the bedroom ; ensure the bedroom is a dark , cool , quiet place ; and get computers and TVs out of the sleep environment , because they stimulate the brain and their light tells the body " it 's daytime , " disrupting the internal clock .
Break the rules when necessary .
While experts ' common - sense recommendations about sleep hygiene should be the first line of defense against insomnia , selectively breaking them can sometimes help , too .
TV is n't recommended , for example , but a DVD or show ( make it a boring one ) may put some people to sleep .
" Listen to experts ' rules ; do n't throw them out , " says Gayle Greene , 65 , a lifelong insomniac who has learned to cope .
But " bend them , make them work for you . "
Develop a pre-bed relaxation ritual .
" Adults need these rituals , too , " says Meir Kryger , director of sleep research and education at Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford , Conn .
" You 'd be amazed at how helpful they can actually be . "
To develop a nonstimulating evening ritual , you might recall what your parents did when you were young to get you in sleep mode .
Or try taking a hot bath or sipping a warm cup of chamomile tea ; either will raise your core body temperature , which leads to a drowsy feeling as you cool down , says Lisa Shives , medical director of Northshore Sleep Medicine in Evanston , Ill .
Try not to self - medicate .
" I personally do n't recommend that people just go out and treat themselves with over - the - counter medications , " says Kryger .
" They never solve the problem ; they 'll just help you get through . "
Pharmacies certainly offer lots of sleep remedies .
There are antihistamines , like Benadryl , which have a sedative side effect .
( The ingredient that causes drowsiness is also found in products like Tylenol PM and Advil PM . )
But those medications can induce next - day grogginess — what some patients call " sleep hangovers " — and they can actually have an alerting or a disorienting effect on the elderly , says Shives .
Other OTC options include melatonin supplements and valerian extracts , although evidence of the effectiveness of either is slim , a National Institutes of Health insomnia consensus panel concluded in 2005 .
And , as Shives says of melatonin , valerian , and similar substances , " Nobody 's regulating this stuff . "
Do n't drink to sleep .
Sure , sloshing down a little Pinot Noir will put you to sleep , but as the alcohol is metabolized by the body , it fragments sleep , which tends to cause nighttime awakenings and next - day tiredness .
" People have the misconception that alcohol helps , " says Ralph Downey III , chief of sleep medicine at the Loma Linda University Medical Center in California .
" It does n't . "
Create a barrier between work and sleep .
You want to have some sort of break from the day 's stress before sleep , advises Lawrence Epstein , medical director of Sleep HealthCenters in Boston and coauthor of The Harvard Medical School Guide to a Good Night 's Sleep .
If you know you 're going to bed at 10:30 , stop your day at 10:15 , or sooner if you can .
Shortchanging that break can be a recipe for insomnia .
Write down all the things you need to worry about on a piece of paper , and do your best to leave them behind .
Whether asleep or awake , there 's likely nothing you can do about them until tomorrow , anyway .
Do n't " catastrophize . "
People who can't sleep tend to compound the problem by fretting about the consequences of their sleeplessness , like the possibility that they 'll do a bad job at work and get fired .
Catastrophizing a sleep problem , however , tends to further engrain it , says Shives .
" I try to get [ people ] to calm down , " she says .
" But that 's kind of like telling a depressed person to perk up . "
Retreat to a " safe room . "
Do n't stew in bed .
Create a " safe room " to retreat to when sleep escapes you , Downey advises .
If awake for more than 20 minutes after your head hits the pillow , get out of bed and go to that room .
Do n't turn on a light , do n't go on the Internet , do n't read a book ; just relax , he says , for 20 minutes , or until sleepy .
Repeat as necessary , all night long .
This process is called conditioning .
You want to prevent your bedroom from becoming associated with frustration .
If you live in a dorm or a studio apartment , Downey says , use a screen to carve out a sitting nook away from the bed .
Exercise .
While experts advise against vigorous exercise too close to bedtime , a morning or evening workout can be beneficial .
" We know that it promotes the slowest waves of sleep , " says Mary Susan Esther , president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine .
Colorify colors input by converting the text to a number and then performing modulo 7 on it .
This resulting number is used as the color escape code .
This can be used to color the results of commands with complex outputs ( like " 482279054165371 " ) so if any of the digits change , there 's a good chance the color will change too .
I say good chance because there 's only 7 unique colors here , so assuming you were watching random numbers , there would be a 6/7 chance that the color would change when the number changed .
This should really only be used to help quickly identify when things change , but should not be the only thing relied upon to positively assert that an output has not changed .

An international team of scientists led by researchers at the London Centre for Nanotechnology ( LCN ) at UCL have discovered a novel one dimensional ice chain structure built from pentagons that may prove to be a step toward the development of new materials which can be used to seed clouds and cause rain .
Although the structure of regular ice is well known at the macroscale , its structures are much more mysterious and less well understood at the nanoscale - particularly when ice forms at an interface with matter as is the case in the higher atmosphere on particles of dust .
" For the first time , we have shown that ice can build an extended one dimensional chain structure entirely from pentagons and not hexagons " says Dr Michaelides .
" This discovery leads to fundamental new understanding about the nature of hydrogen bonding at interfaces ( there is no a priori rule that hexagons should form ) and suggests that when people are searching for new ice nucleating agents which can be used to seed clouds and cause rain , they do not necessarily need to focus on materials that have hexagonal surfaces - other types of surfaces may be good too . "
Ice structures are usually built out of simple hexagonal arrangements of water molecules and this hexagonal building block motif is easily observed in the structures of snowflakes .
However , during their studies Dr Angelos Michaelides and co-workers from the Fritz Haber Institute , Berlin , and the University of Liverpool have discovered a natural nanoscale ice structure formed of pentagons .
" It is important to understand the structure of ice on the nanoscale , and in particular up against solid surfaces because this is how ice crystals form , " explains the paper 's first author Dr Javier Carrasco .
" We need to understand the structure of ice crystals in the upper atmosphere because they play an important role in the formation of clouds and precipitation . "
The formation of nanoscale ice crystals ( i.e. nucleation ) plays a key role in fields as diverse as atmospheric chemistry and biology .
Ice nucleation on metal surfaces affords an opportunity to watch this process unfold at the molecular - scale on a well defined , plane interface .
A common feature of structural models for such films of ice is that they are built from hexagonal arrangements of molecules .
In order to address the challenge of characterising ice on the nanoscale , the team from the LCN joined up with a team of experimentalists from the University of Liverpool ( lead by Professor Andrew Hodgson ) to examine ice formation on a very well defined , atomically flat copper surface .
The Liverpool group performed scanning tunneling microscopy experiments and the LCN and Berlin teams carried out ab initio calculations to predict what the microscopy results would be .
Only through the combination of these two state - of - the - art approaches were they able to definitively show that the ice structures that form are made from pentagons .

' All banks are evil , ' says money management guru Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday March 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Money management websites promising to save the Internet generation from financial disaster have made their case to technology trendsetters .
" All banks are evil , " Mint.com founder Aaron Patzer said Monday while taking part in a ' Finance 2.0 ' panel discussion at the South By Southwest Interactive ( SXSW ) gathering here .
" Banks are self - serving .
Banks are slow moving ... the websites they put out are crap compared to the things we can do online .
No good engineer wants to work for a bank ; it 's no fun . "
Mint launched in a test , or beta , form in September of 2007 and the number of users eclipsed one million a day before Patzer took part in the discussion here .
The website 's free service securely compiles data from people 's accounts in US banks , credit card companies and other financial institutions and then shows people how smart or dumb they are being with their money .
Mint sends users email or mobile telephone text messages if it notices upcoming bills , unnecessary fees , unusual account activity , or other possible money problems .
It also recommends ways for people to save cash .
" Our mission has always been to help people save and do more with their money , " Patzer said .
SmartyPig.com on Monday launched software that lets its " social banking " service be added to money management websites Buxfer , Mint , Wesabe , Yodlee , MoneyStrands , Thrive , and Microsoft Money .
SmartyPig is designed as an Internet - age piggy bank and its service provides people Web tools to " leverage the age - old idea of saving up for purchases before buying . "
A social component of the website lets friends in communities such as Facebook put cash in friends ' cyber piggy banks to help them reach goals .
" We recognize how important it is to securely manage your finances , set goals and help change the credit card mindset of ' buy now , pay later , ' that has contributed to the current downturn , " said Smarty Pig co-founder Michael Ferrari .
SmartyPig launched in the United States and Australia in 2008 .
The Internet savings application appeals to " younger , plugged - in " people seeking fun and easy ways to save for specific goals , such as holiday travel or college tuition , according to Smarty Pig .
" With all the tools here , the community of people who buy things can be bank agnostic , " said Keeping Nickels blogger Nichelle Williams , who was a member of the SXSW panel .
" We can just find the services we want at the cheapest cost .
There is a community on Mint.com , and we can galvanize everyone around something like a bank charging crazy fees . "
Patzer says US banks will reap tens of billions of dollars in fees on accounts this year .
" A bank is not necessarily there looking out for you , " said Murali Subbarao .
founder of online service Billeo that enables users to make certain that they pay monthly bills on time , avoiding late fees and damaged credit scores .
Williams said she is bombarded with questions about money from readers of her posts at the personal finances blog .
The sign - up rate at Mint has tripled since the financial crisis began , according to Patzer .
SmartyPig has also seen its popularity climb .
" Our business continues to do better as the economy does worse , " said Ferrari , who was on the SXSW panel .
" It has taken this economy to get people to start thinking about the resources that are out there in the blogosphere and start being smarter with their money .
I felt the love pouring from Twitter during the last couple days . "
Operators of money management websites say they are obsessive about security , shielding computers with " Mission Impossible " like defenses and undergoing rigorous auditing .
" Online applications are still charting new ground , " Stephens said .
" Do n't be afraid .
I 'm not saying banks are the enemy , but if you are smart you can beat the bank . "

Getting a phone contract with bad credit can be an uphill task .
Many phone companies operate with the main target of optimizing profits .
Clients applying for contracts with poor credit are considered risky parties and phone companies do not want to work with them .
However , you can still get no credit check mobile phones using the following ways ;
Selecting a cheaper phone
Settling for a SIM - only phone
Raising some deposit
Liaising with the phone company directly
Once you have gotten the phone of choice , your attention should shift to raising your credit score as fast as possible .
While many people express the difficulty of improving their credit rating , it does not have to be that way .
The following are four simple ways of boosting your credit score
Correct your credit score report
Financial institutions and phone companies use credit agency reports to know your credit score .
Because the credit report is prepared by agencies , there is a risk of errors because they are third parties .
They gather reports from banks , insurance , mortgage , and other institutions to get data to calculate your score .
Therefore , if one of the parties such as a bank or a mortgage company delays or gives incorrect information , the report will reflect incorrect credit scores .
Accordingly , you should get the credit report and correct all errors .
Borrow small personal loans
One of the major factors that contribute to your credit score is how you clear debts .
To get more points from this , consider borrowing small personal loans and repaying them as fast as possible .
If you can raise some deposit , some banks can even allow you to borrow from your own account .
Pay off your debts
Outstanding debts pull your credit score down with a very great margin and must be reduced and cleared as fast as possible .
One of the best methods of paying off your debts is reviewing them to know the least amount that can be paid on each of them .
Then , commit the overhead amount to clearing the debt that has the smallest balance .
Within a very short period , the small loans will be cleared completely as you continue paying others .
Avoid being a victim of credit card fraud
Credit scores can nose - dive if thieves steal your identity and create new accounts running up huge debt in your name .
To prevent this , it is important to review credit card reports every month to check for errors and raise an alert in case of suspicious activities .
You should also set a hard - to - crack passwords , keep them safe , and avoid sharing on social media or SMS .
Maintain bank accounts and credit cards in your name
For spouse using partner ’s names , learners using parents ’ money or group members without personal accounts , building a good credit history can be difficult .
It is important to open and run personal accounts with your name and details .
Accounts with monthly bills and utilities will help to build a positive history over time .
Last but not least , if you want to understand the benefits you get from applying for a bad credit mobile phone or the different deals at your disposal , visit http://www.phonesworld.co.uk/ for all the comprehensive information you need .
European criminal gangs are paying top euro to get old Nokia 1100 mobile phones according to a report from research firm Ultrascan .
A lot of 1100s were made , but the gangs , which specialize in card and on - line banking fraud , are only interested in the ones made in Germany .
They claim one recently sold for 25,000 euro .
What 's with the outrageous premium ?
Ultrascan says that the gangs " ... were able to hack this model to insert any mobile phone number and use it for criminal purposes , especially to intercept the mobile ( sms ) TAN code during on - line banking fraud . "
It 's common , according to F - Secure 's blog on this matter , for European banks to require a confirmation code in order to complete online banking transactions .
They used to do this by giving customers a list of numbers on paper to use sequentially , but recently banks have moved to using SMS to deliver a one - time code to the customer on their mobile device .
This is the code that Ultrascan says the German Nokia 1100s can intercept .
Presumably they are being used to clone other phones without the SIM card , but exactly what is happening is not at all clear .
F- Secure adds that they 've searched the hacker forums and other such places for verification and further data and found nothing .
But if the story is true it's a serious problem .

Layoffs in the city have spread from the piggy traders on Wall Street to the animals at the Bronx Zoo .
The institution is closing four exhibits and shipping hundreds of creatures to zoos and aquariums around the country , officials told the City Council Cultural Affairs Committee yesterday .
Scientists Create Glow - in - the - Dark Puppies
Deer , bats , porcupines , foxes , lemurs , caimans and antelopes will be pink - slipped as part of the 114 - year - old zoo ’s effort to cope with a $ 15 million budget shortfall .
“ We plan to close four exhibits , four areas of the zoo . . . and we will have to reduce our collections in order to handle the cuts that we already know about , ” said Bob Cook , executive vice president of the Wildlife Conservation Society , which runs the zoo .
Councilman Domenic Recchia ( D - Brooklyn ) , who chairs the committee , was incredulous when Cook told him the loss of “ hundreds ” of animals would be permanent — not a temporary fix during the recession .
“ It ’s much , much more serious than what I even thought it was going to be , ” Recchia said .
“ When I heard that the animals were going to be impacted and that we are going to have to ship our animals off to other zoos , I ’m devastated by this .
We are losing our zoos and wildlife . ”
The Bronx Zoo — the country ’s largest urban zoo , which 2.1 million people visited last year alone — is shutting its World of Darkness , Rare Animal Range and exhibits of the Arabian oryx and blesbok , two types of antelope .
The World of Darkness houses bats , caimans , porcupines and primates , including lemurs and night monkeys .
The Rare Animal Range is home to deer and guanaco , a South American relative of the llama .
The shuttered displays were chosen based on maintenance costs and popularity among visitors , zoo officials said .
Mayor Bloomberg ’s budget cuts will slash the city ’s contribution by $ 1.7 million .
Another $ 13.3 million is being lost because of reduced donations and cuts from other levels of government .
This will mean human layoffs also .
“ I think the Bloomberg administration has to wake up and say it ’s time that we save the animals , ” Recchia said .
“ Corporate donations are down .
This is going to be devastating to the institutions of New York City . ”
Councilwoman Helen Foster ( D - Bronx ) said that during hard times , families who cannot afford summer vacations come to the zoo in droves .
“ We have to do these cuts so they make sense , ” she said .
Fighting poverty with business has become very popular .
Organizations from the environmental think tank World Resources Institute ( WRI ) , to the World Bank , to the United Nations Development Programme are promoting business strategies to increase poor people ’s1 consumption and entrepreneurship .
Business schools such as those at the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have set up centers to find out how businesses can better involve the bottom of the pyramid ( BOP ) — that is , the 2.5 billion people worldwide who live on less than $ 2 per day .
Meanwhile , books such as John Weiser ’s Untapped , Craig Wilson and Peter Wilson ’s Make Poverty Business , and Vijay Mahajan and Kamini Banga ’s The 86 % Solution suggest how serving the BOP can reap profits .
Multinational corporations , including Unilever and S.C. Johnson & Son , offer products and services that both appeal to and purportedly aid the BOP .
The world ’s top CEOs discussed strategies for targeting the BOP at the most recent World Economic Forum .
Even the term “ bottom ( or base ) of the pyramid ” has become common usage in both development economics and business .
Proponents of these market solutions assume that poor people are fully capable and willing participants in free market economies .
For example , in the first paragraph of his best - selling book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid : Eradicating Poverty Through Profits , University of Michigan business professor C.K. Prahalad urges readers to recognize the poor as “ resilient and creative entrepreneurs and value - conscious consumers . ”
2
On its Web site Nextbillion .net , WRI emphasizes the “ potential of the world ’s poorest citizens as entrepreneurs , employees , and discerning consumers . ”
The United Nations ’
Web site declares that microentrepreneurs are using small loans “ to grow thriving businesses … leading to strong and flourishing local economies . ”
Beneath these beliefs in the market readiness of poor people lies a more basic assumption : people in dire straits are well - informed and rational economic actors .
Yet this view denies the fact that poor people often act against their own self - interest .
Of course , wealthier people sometimes do so , too .
But poor people face far worse consequences for their bad choices than do more affluent people .
And so romanticized views of BOP people as value - conscious consumers and resilient entrepreneurs are not only false , but also harmful .
These views lead states to build too few legal , regulatory , and social mechanisms to protect the poor , as well as to rely too heavily on market solutions to poverty .
I do not advocate sprawling governments , high taxes , or tightly regulated private sectors .
For decades , such statist policies stifled economic growth in countries like India and China , and contemporary economic history clearly demonstrates that the free market system is the best way to achieve overall growth and development .
I do believe , however , that states must impose some limits on free markets to prevent the exploitation of the poor .
( As the recent collapse of U.S. financial markets shows , they also need regulation to prevent the self - destructive tendencies of free markets . )
Another vital role of the state is to provide basic services such as infrastructure , public health , and education .
More broadly , businesses , nonprofits , and governments must recognize that poor people face fundamentally different social , psychological , physical , and economic realities than do their wealthier counterparts .
BAD CHOICES
Many advocates of market - based solutions to poverty view poor people as rational consumers who , if given more options , would make better choices — that is , choices that would increase their economic welfare .
They see no problem with encouraging the poor to spend their already meager incomes on low - priority products and services .
They further argue that the poor have the right to determine how to spend their limited income and are in fact the best judges of what is in their best interests .
Yet these advocates do not acknowledge that the poor lack the education , information , and other economic , cultural , and social capital that would allow them to take advantage of — and shield themselves against — the vagaries of the free market .
More generally , they do not recognize how strongly people ’s backgrounds and experiences shape their desires and actions .
As Amartya Sen , the Nobel Prize - winning economist , noted in his 2000 work , Development as Freedom : “ Deprived people tend to come to terms with their deprivation because of the sheer necessity of survival , and they may , as a result , lack the courage to demand any radical change , and may even adjust their desires and expectations to what they unambitiously see as feasible .
The mental metric of pleasure or desire is just too malleable to be a firm guide to deprivation and disadvantage . ”
In other words , poor people — even more than wealthy people — do not necessarily do or want what is truly in their best interests .
Even
The Economist , a stalwart advocate of neoliberal policies , agrees that the choices poor people make “ are not always the best ones . ”
3
All people have moments of weakness when they make bad decisions — say , because they lose self control and yield to temptation .
But poor people seem to lose control more often , for reasons that reflect the realities of their daily lives .
For example , poor people typically do not have bank accounts , and so they are more likely to spend their readily available cash on impulse purchases , find economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo .
4
Some mundane temptations — such as giving their children a treat — prove especially difficult for poor people to resist because so many other people take them for granted .
In addition , poor people more often encounter stressors — including hunger , pollution , crowding , and violence — that lead them to act in ways that may alleviate suffering in the short term , but hinder economic prosperity in the long term .
Take bad behaviors such as smoking , drinking to excess , and eating fatty and sugary foods , for example .
People everywhere smoke , drink , and eat “ comfort foods ” to take the edge off the hardships they encounter in their daily lives .
Tobacco , after all , is an antidepressant , alcohol is a sedative , and comfort foods dampen the release of stress hormones in the body , as well as increase the production of dopamine — a brain chemical that produces feelings of pleasure .
5
Accordingly , research documents that the less income people have , the more likely they are to smoke , binge drink , and eat a sugary , fatty diet .
6
These behavioral patterns are reflected in people ’s spending patterns : poor people spend a larger portion of their incomes on alcohol and tobacco than do more affluent people .
7
Indeed , a recent field study in Sri Lanka reveals that more than 10 percent of poor male respondents regularly spend their entire incomes on alcohol .
8
The world ’s poorest people also spend a surprisingly large part of their budgets on ceremonies and festivals — which , in the absence of television and movies , are often the best distractions available .
In Udaipur , India , for example , more than 99 percent of extremely poor people — that is , people living on less than $ 1 per day — had spent money on a wedding , a funeral , or a religious festival in the previous year .
9
The median expenditure on festivals among these extremely poor households was 10 percent of their annual budget .
Mounting evidence suggests that just being poor hinders people ’s ability to make good decisions .
Dozens of psychological studies find that , compared to wealthier people , poorer people feel more powerless , depressed , and anxious , and believe that they have less control , mastery , and choice .10 “ Perhaps at some level this avoidance is emotionally wise , ” write Banerjee and Duflo : “ Thinking about the economic problems of life must make it harder to avoid confronting the sheer inadequacy of the standard of living . ”
Similarly , almost 100 years ago George Orwell observed in his book Down and Out in Paris and London : Poverty “ annihilates the future . ”
DIRE CONSEQUENCES
The consequences of bad choices are bad for everyone , but even worse for the poor , who lack the resources — financial , psychological , social , and political — to compensate for their errors .
Consider the story of Hasan , a rickshaw puller in Bangladesh who spends 20 cents per day on tobacco .
When public health experts Debra Efroymson and Saifuddin Ahmed asked Hasan whether his three children ever eat eggs , he exclaimed : “ Eggs ?
Where will the money come from to buy them ? ”
But if Hasan did n’t buy tobacco , each of his children could eat an egg a day , and be healthier as a result .
11 More generally , poor people “ could easily save more without getting less nutrition by spending less on alcohol , tobacco , and food items such as sugar , spice , and tea , ” Banerjee and Duflo conclude .
For example , the typical poor household in Udaipur could spend up to 30 percent more on food if it did not spend money on alcohol , tobacco , and festivals .
Consuming alcohol and tobacco not only takes money away from a family ’s nutrition , but also sets off a cascade of other problems that poor people more frequently encounter .
Alcohol abuse , for instance , reduces work performance while increasing accidents , domestic violence , and illness .
Because many indigent people earn their livelihoods through physical labor , falling ill means not earning money .
Once sick , these people have no insurance or unemployment benefits to restore their health or to prevent their families from sliding even further into poverty .
If they are lucky enough to live close to doctors and medical facilities , they rarely have the money to pay for these services .
Even in the United States , poor people lack money for and access to high - quality medical services .
NO PROTECTION
Another reason that poor people suffer disproportionately for their bad choices is that corporations , governments , and nonprofits offer them fewer services and protections than they offer richer people .
The annual report of virtually every large company claims its mission is to serve some larger social purpose besides making profits .
Yet in a recent article about corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) , The Economist concludes that for most large public companies , “ CSR is little more than a cosmetic treatment . ” 12 Even nonprofits and foundations skew their offerings to better - off people , finds Stanford University political scientist Rob Reich ( see “ A Failure of Philanthropy ” in the winter 2005 issue of the Stanford Social Innovation Review ) .
In addition , many corporations exploit poor people ’s vulnerabilities , such as their lack of education and their desire for cheap relief from chronic distress .
For example , in Malaysia , bottles of samsu— cheap spirits that poor people favor — claim to be “ good for health [ and to ] cure rheumatism , body aches , low blood pressure , and indigestion . ”
Labels also claim that samsu is good for the elderly and for lactating mothers , finds Australian public health expert Mary Assunta .13
In an ironic twist on the BOP strategy of selling goods in single servings so that poor people can afford them , samsu is available in small bottles of about 150 milliliters and is sold for as little as 40 cents .
“ It is obvious that these potent drinks are packaged to especially appeal to the poor , ” writes Assunta .
Local alcohol producers are not the only ones exploiting indigent people ; multinational corporations are also getting in on the act .
DOM
Benedictine , a French liqueur that contains 40 percent alcohol , touts its health - giving and medicinal properties to poor people in Malaysia .
United Kingdom - based Diageo likewise assures Malaysian consumers that Guinness Stout promotes virility .
Although laws in the European Union ban advertisements that claim alcohol improves health , African nations either do not have or do not enforce these laws .
Advertisers therefore capitalize on the reputed aphrodisiac qualities of beer to promote it heavily to poor people .
It is not only tobacco and alcohol companies that exploit the weaknesses of the poor : Even Unilever , a consumer products company , preys on the anxieties of disadvantaged people .
The multinational corporation markets a highly profitable skin- whitening cream called Fair & Lovely to women in 40 countries across Asia and Africa , especially India .
Allen L. Hammond , former vice president of WRI and a leading advocate of marketing to people at the bottom of the pyramid , says that Fair & Lovely is a positive example of BOP strategy because it makes poor women “ feel empowered ” and think that they have choices .
14
Although Fair & Lovely is doing well for Unilever , it probably is not doing much good for its purchasers or for society .
Fair & Lovely ’s commercials typically depict a depressed woman with few prospects who gains a brighter future by attaining either a husband or a job after making her skin markedly fairer .
Several nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) and government officials say that the ads are racist and sexist , and that they entrench women and darker - skinned people ’s disempowerment .
15 Nevertheless , Unilever still claims to be socially responsible .
Corporations not only work around existing protections to sell poor people things that they do not need , but also work with governments to rewrite laws in their own favor .
For example , SABMiller has enjoyed great success in Africa with Eagle , a cheap beer made from locally grown sorghum rather than imported malt , reports The Economist .
In Uganda , Zambia , and Zimbabwe , SABMiller can price the beer lower than mainstream clear beers because governments reduced the taxes the corporation has to pay .
Meanwhile , these countries pass up valuable alcohol taxes that other countries would likely use to support public education and rehabilitation programs .
Tobacco companies are similarly notorious for persuading governments to relax restrictions on the production and promotion of tobacco products ( see , for example , “ Smoke and Mirrors ” in the summer 2008 Stanford Social Innovation Review ) .
Should poor people have the right to consume alcohol , tobacco , and other unneeded products ?
Yes .
Should companies have the right to profit from the sale of these products to the poor ?
Of course .
But in rich , capitalist economies , governments put some constraints on these rights , such as “ sin taxes , ” advertising restrictions , and prohibitions of sales to minors .
Yet in many developing countries , these constraints are either poorly enforced or missing entirely .
Governments have a responsibility to guard their most vulnerable citizens from unsavory practices .
Yet governments in all countries have problems regulating markets .
This is all the more true in developing countries with corrupt governments that are in cahoots with firms .
And even when governments in poor countries have good intentions , they often lack the resources and competence to design and administer appropriate regulations .
Other social mechanisms for protecting consumers are likewise very weak in developing countries , and even more so with regard to poor people .
Emerging economies often do not offer Alcoholics Anonymous , residential detox programs , or the nicotine patch .
The civil society organizations that do exist in these economies usually lack the resources to offer much protection to anyone .

Despite the many disadvantages that indigent people face in the marketplace , nonprofits , governments , and businesses are flocking to market - based poverty alleviation programs .
For instance , microcredit , the newest silver bullet for reducing poverty , has attracted many billions of dollars in funding .
Microcreditors make small loans to poor individuals or groups of borrowers — called microentrepreneurs — whom mainstream financial institutions have traditionally snubbed .
Many people have made grand claims about the impact of microcredit , including Muhammad Yunus , founder of Grameen Bank and winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize , who said , “ We will make Bangladesh free from poverty by 2030 .
” 16
As I argued in an earlier article in this magazine , however , microcredit does not signifi cantly alleviate poverty ( see “ Microfinance Misses Its Mark ” in the summer 2007 issue of the Stanford Social Innovation Review ) .
The problem with microfinance is that it romanticizes poor people as creative entrepreneurs .
Most microcredit clients are not entrepreneurs by choice ; they would gladly take a job at reasonable wages if one were available .
This should not be too surprising .
Most people do not have the skills , vision , creativity , and persistence to be an entrepreneur .
Even in developed countries with high levels of education and access to financial services , about 90 percent of the labor force is employees , not entrepreneurs .
Meanwhile , as borrowers struggle to repay loans that are unlikely to lift them out of poverty , some microfinance institutions earn handsome returns — such as the 100 percent compounded annual rate of return that investors in Banco Compartamos received ( see “ Microloan Sharks ” in the summer 2008 issue of the Stanford Social Innovation Review ) .
Another BOP strategy for alleviating poverty is to create , package , and market products to poor people .
Not only will these BOP businesses bring the world ’s most isolated , impoverished people into the fold of the marketplace , the thinking goes , they may also make multinational companies a fortune .
Prahalad argues that the poor , defined as people living on less than $ 2 per day , represent a market size of $ 13 trillion .
Other economists make even grander assertions ; Hammond once asserted that the BOP harbored $ 15 trillion in commerce .
Yet these estimates of market size are gross exaggerations .
Using calculations from World Bank data available in 2006 , I estimated elsewhere that the BOP market was $ 300 billion in 2002.17
And then once again , using data from a 2007 report coauthored by Hammond and called The Next Four Billion ,18 I estimated a global BOP market size of only $ 360 billion , which is quite close to my earlier estimate .
My calculations suggest that the BOP market is far smaller than Prahalad and other BOP proponents estimate .
Their assumptions are problematic in many other ways as well ( see sidebar “ The Mirage at the Bottom of the Pyramid ” ) .
And as I argued earlier , poor people are often not in a position to take advantage of market opportunities — and might even be vulnerable to exploitation .
Consequently , many BOP programs currently on the ground are not likely to improve the lot of poor people .
MORE GOVERNMENT , PLEASE
I have found little evidence suggesting that poor people are particularly discerning consumers or creative entrepreneurs .
Instead , and on many counts , they are worse consumers and entrepreneurs than their wealthier counterparts , and they suffer the worse for it .
Yet corporations , governments , and NGOs romanticize the poor .
As a result , they continue to rely too heavily on market solutions to poverty .
This is not to deny that free markets can help reduce poverty .
In fact , the private sector must play a critical role .
Rather than viewing the poor primarily as consumers , people interested in economic development should approach the poor as producers .
The best way to alleviate poverty is to raise the real income of the poor by creating opportunities for steady employment at reasonable wages .
Firms can do this by creating more employment opportunities in labor - intensive industries and investing in upgrading the skills and productivity of poor people , thus increasing their income potential .
For their part , governments need to help create and grow private enterprises in labor - intensive sectors of the economy through appropriate policies ( such as deregulation ) , infrastructure ( such as transportation ) , and institutions ( such as capital markets ) .
They must also protect poor consumers through legal and regulatory mechanisms .
NGOs and social activists can help by exerting pressure on governments and companies .
Poverty cannot be defined only in economic terms ; it is also about a much broader set of needs .
But many market approaches to reducing poverty focus solely on economic ends , viewing social , cultural , and political benefits as by - products .
In contrast , I think that social , cultural , and political benefits are desirable in and of themselves .
We should emphasize the role of governments and public policies in cultivating and safeguarding these other noneconomic ends .
By emphatically focusing on the private sector , market - based poverty alleviation programs distract people from correcting the frequent failures of governments to fulfill their traditional and accepted functions of ensuring safety , providing education , protecting health , and building infrastructure .
No alternative to government has proven able to serve these functions .

The Republican party ’s presumptive presidential nominee John McCain is engaged in a delicate dance , distancing himself from US President George W. Bush while courting the conservative ideals of the outgoing president ’s party .
Few of McCain ’s top advisors are well known to the general public , and even fewer are directly linked to the highly unpopular Bush administration .
However neoconservatives , whose thinking has directed Bush ’s foreign policy following the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , are ever - present and powerful in McCain ’s inner circle .
Randy Scheunemann , McCain ’s chief foreign policy spokesman , in 2002 founded the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , which agitated for the US invasion that was launched in 2003 .
Scheunemann and Robert Kagan , another McCain advisor , head the neoconservative Project for a New American Century , which takes a hawkish line on foreign policy issues .
Their influence helps explain McCain ’s hardline stance on Iraq , where he has vowed to keep American troops for " as long as it takes , " as well on Iran , Cuba , North Korea and even Russia , which he wants tossed out of the Group of Eight industrialized nations club over an erosion of democracy .
McCain , who has a reputation for being more independent - minded than most right - wing Republican leaders , is also close to independent Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman , the 2004 nominee for vice president , alongside failed presidential contender Al Gore .
Lieberman ’s support for the Iraq war has put him starkly at odds with liberal Democrats .

Perl makes use of an implicit scalar variable , $ _ .
The $ _ variable is assigned a value whenever you write code that requires a scalar value to be passed to something without actually passing it explicitly .
For instance , if the first line of your foreach loop looks like this :
foreach ( @foo ) {
. . . you ’re going to get each element of @foo being available to the code executed inside the loop , one iteration at a time , in the $ _ variable .
As such , you might write code like this :
foreach ( @foo ) { print $ _ ; }
Let ’s ignore for the moment that you could , with a very simple loop like that , put the print part before the foreach part , all on one line , and skip the braces entirely .
It ’s just a bit of very simple example code .
Anyway . . . a lot of people find $ _ ugly and even obfuscatory .
The answer for most is to always avoid $ _ at all costs .
Some even take that to the unreasonable extreme of avoiding Perl , as if the entire language is tainted by their personal distaste for the $ _ variable .
In the case of continuing to use Perl while avoiding $ _ , however , you might end up with code like this :
foreach $ bar ( @foo ) { print $ bar ; }
This way , you can name your iterator scalar descriptively , clarifying the code .
I absolutely agree that this is an excellent approach to take — but I also believe there are times that the inclusion of the $ _ variable in the Perl language can provide some benefits , not only for the coder , but for whoever has to read the code again later .
The key is that you should never have to actually type the dollar and underscore characters to access that variable ’s contents .
You could , for instance , do this :
foreach ( @foo ) { print ; }
That is the sort of behavior that makes it possible for a Perlist to do things like print foreach @foo ; , in fact — which can add even more clarity to your code when the contents of your loop consist of a single ( short ) line of code .
Just remember , when dealing with Perl , that $ _ is an implicit variable , and should only be used implicitly if at all possible .
When the code in your loop ( or wherever else you are using $ _ , whether you use it explicitly or implicitly ) is brief enough , consider whether implicit use of $ _ would clarify your code .
If it would n’t , or you basically ca n’t use it with your code as written , consider whether one of the following is true :
You should probably avoid using $ _ there , and use a different , explicit variable instead .
Your code might benefit from a little refactoring so that use of an implicit variable would help clarify things .
In other words , the rule of thumb for $ _ in Perl is as follows :
If you have to use it explicitly , use something else instead .
That rule of thumb is not just “ never use it ” .
It ’s there for a reason .

Rep. Samuel E Rohrer
The Tenth Amendment Center
March 10 , 2009
The danger of being number 10 is that no one really knows who you are .
George Washington was our first president ; but how many can name number 10 off the top of their head ?
And Sir Edmund Hillary was the first person to climb Everest , but does anyone know who the tenth person was to reach the summit ?
And then consider our amendments to the United States Constitution : most of us know the 1st Amendment verbatim , but do you know what the Tenth Amendment says ?
“ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
Sometimes thought of as an afterthought , to “ sweep up ” anything the Founders may have forgotten , the 10th Amendment today is taking on monumental importance as increasing federal intrusion into state affairs threatens to completely destroy the balance between state and federal power .
In the Federalist Papers , authors Jay , Madison , and Hamilton labored to convince a monarch - shy colonial population that they needed a strong government to preserve a free , cohesive nation .
The authors took pains to outline how the Constitutional structure of the government would prohibit the federal government from becoming big enough to overwhelm the powers of both the states and the democratic process .
The 10th Amendment was foundational to this system of checks and balances , constitutionally restricting the federal government to covering issues related to commerce , national defense , the postal system , and the like .
“ Power begets power , ” though , as the saying goes , and the federal government slowly began expanding its powers .
One of the most effective and insidious ways that the federal government has taken over control of state affairs is by first passing a mandate and then offering federal money to states with significant strings attached .
[ efoods ]
Whether the issue is welfare , Real ID , No Child Left Behind , or health insurance programs , tantalizing packages have been dangled in front of state governors and legislators , promising to stop the budget gap or expand a politically successful program .
States have taken the money and over time , the requirements and restrictions on those state funds have slowly but surely changed the direction of state policy .
Instead of developing programs to fit the needs of state citizens and altering them to best use the state resources , programs are instead clumsily built around the federal funding requirements , so the state does not lose a single available dollar .
This significant paradigm shift should be a wake - up call to every citizen not only in Pennsylvania , but also across the nation .
Therefore , because the Supreme Court allowed the federal government to offer funds on conditions , states have subjected themselves to Washington .
This submission completely distorts the checks and balances inherent in our Constitution , and enshrined in the 10th Amendment .
In order to raise awareness of this improper delegation of power , I have joined with representatives , senators , Democrats , and Republicans from over 30 states and introduced a resolution into the Pennsylvania General Assembly that reaffirms Pennsylvania ’s constitutional powers under the 10th Amendment .
This 10th Amendment Resolution ( House Resolution 95 ) is little more than a restatement of the last amendment to the Bill of Rights , reminding state legislatures that the federal government must no longer be allowed to commandeer our rightful authority .
As difficult as it is to believe someone could oppose a resolution as plain as reaffirming a basic tenet of our Constitution , sadly , opposition is too often the case in our state legislatures .
This issue , however , is gaining traction among American citizens who are unwilling to sit back while Washington blatantly ignores their voices .
Supporting the 10th Amendment Resolution is a grassroots effort if ever there was one .
I encourage you to spread the word and contact your family , friends and relatives , in and out of Pennsylvania , and encourage them to speak up .
This issue will not go away — and it gives a voice to those who have grown frustrated and disillusioned with our federal government .
The 10th Amendment Resolution simply yet powerfully affirms our belief in the constitutional structure of our government .
Join me today in that affirmation .
Rep .
Rohrer will be holding the “ 10th Amendment Rally for the State of Independence ” on Monday , March 16 at noon in the Rotunda of the State Capitol .
Please make plans to join him there .

The most immediate expense will come in the next several weeks , when federal bank regulators complete “ stress tests ” on the nation ’s 19 biggest banks .
The tests are expected to show that at least several major institutions , probably including Bank of America , need to increase their capital cushions by billions of dollars each .
The change to common stock would not require the government to contribute any additional cash , but it could increase the capital of big banks by more than $ 100 billion .
The White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , alluded to the strategy on Sunday in an interview on the ABC program “ This Week . ” Mr. Emanuel asserted that the government had enough money to shore up the 19 banks without asking for more .
“ We believe we have those resources available in the government as the final backstop to make sure that the 19 are financially viable and effective , ” Mr. Emanuel said .
“ If they need capital , we have that capacity . ”
If that calculation is correct , Mr. Obama would gain important political maneuvering room because Democratic leaders in Congress have warned that they cannot possibly muster enough votes any time soon in support of spending more money to bail out some of the same financial institutions whose aggressive lending precipitated the financial crisis .
The administration said in January that it would alter its arrangement with Citigroup by converting up to $ 25 billion of preferred stock , which is like a loan , to common stock , which represents equity .
After the conversion , the Treasury would end up with about 36 percent of Citigroup ’s common shares , which come with full voting rights .
That would make the government Citigroup ’s biggest shareholder , effectively nudging the government one step closer to nationalizing a major bank .

metinkaplan on Dec. 28 , 2009 at 15:10:00 I have a question : I could n't find a meaning about the place of unicorn and yeti ?
Is there a secret humour that I could n't catch ?
rafael.eti.br on Oct. 10 , 2010 at 08:18:10
I am also trying to figure out if there is a secret ( extra ) humor behind it .
Nonetheless it is still funny even without a history behind it .
WASHINGTON -- According to the U.S. government , I am an extremist .
I am a Christian and meet regularly with other Christians to study God 's word .
My faith convinces me the prophecies in the Holy Bible are true .
I believe in the sanctity of human life , oppose abortion , and want to preserve marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
I am a veteran with skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat .
I own several firearms , and I frequently shoot them , buy ammunition , and consider efforts to infringe on my Second Amendment rights to be wrong and unconstitutional .
I fervently support the sovereignty of the United States , and I am deeply concerned about our economy , increasingly higher taxes , illegal immigration , soaring unemployment , and actions by our government that will bury my children beneath a mountain of debt .
Apparently , all this makes me a " rightwing extremist . "
At least , that 's what it says in the April 7 " Assessment " issued by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security .
The nine - page report , titled " Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment , " is full of warnings about American citizens who share any part of my background or subscribe to the beliefs above .
It is one of the most alarming documents produced by our government that I ever have read .
Evidently , neither you nor I ever was supposed to read this " Assessment . "
At the bottom of the cover page is a warning that it is " not to be released to the public , the media , or other personnel who do not have a valid need - to - know . "
We 're Americans .
We have a need to know what 's going on in our government , especially in an administration that promised to be " transparent . "
A full copy of the report is posted at http://www.FreedomAlliance.org.
The " Assessment " purports to alert law enforcement officials that " rightwing extremists " -- the term is used more than 35 times -- are intent on exploiting Americans who have strongly held beliefs on everything from Christian faith to rising unemployment , U.S. sovereignty and the Second Amendment .
It vilifies those of us in these categories by references to neo -Nazis , racists , militias , white supremacists and other " hate groups . "
Notably , the report includes a warning that right - wing extremism " may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration . "
Though the report proffers a passing reference to the First Amendment , it is replete with bias against conservative thought , writing and communications .
On Page 3 , law enforcement authorities are warned , " Rightwing extremist chatter on the Internet continues to focus on the economy , the perceived ( emphasis added ) loss of U.S. jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors , and home foreclosures . "
That is a frightening acknowledgment that political speech is being monitored in America .
It is also wrong .
It 's not " perception . "
It is fact .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the manufacturing and construction sectors have lost 161,000 jobs and 126,000 jobs , respectively , last month alone .
In its " Key Findings , " the DHS manuscript boldly charges that " rightwing extremists may be gaining new recruits by playing on their fears about several emergent issues " and offers this warning : " The possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks . "
Under the heading " Disgruntled Military Veterans , " the report alleges : " Rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat .
These skills and knowledge have the potential to boost the capabilities of extremists -- including lone wolves or small terrorist cells -- to carry out violence . "
These unsubstantiated claims are followed by reminders that Timothy McVeigh , who bombed the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 , was a military veteran .
Omitted is any reference to the fact that McVeigh was simply one of more than 40 million veterans of the U.S. armed forces .
Thirteen lines after this egregious , unconscionable slander against those of us who are military combat veterans , DHS makes the stunning charge that " lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent rightwing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States . "
According to this DHS " Assessment , " the most dangerous threat we face here at home is n't from radical imams preaching violence in U.S. mosques and madrassas , Islamists recruiting in our prisons , Somali terrorists enticing young immigrants to become suicide bombers , or Hamas , Hezbollah or al - Qaida operatives plotting mass murder .
No , according to DHS , the real threat comes from what our government labels " rightwing extremist ideology . "
Mr. Obama should disavow this report publicly and fire the officials responsible for issuing it .
Those who prepare his remarks for the occasion should insert in the teleprompter former Sen.
Barry Goldwater 's words on the subject : " Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . "
In our hyperconnected world , getting away from it all is easier said than done .

SO YOU’VE hitch - hiked through Central America , stalked rare beasts in Madagascar and trekked your way through northern Chile .
You ’re pretty well travelled , even if you do say so yourself .
Before you get ideas about being an intrepid explorer , however , consider this .
For all their wide open spaces and seeming wildernesses , none of these places can be described as remote in 2009 .
In fact , very little of the world ’s land can now be thought of as inaccessible , according to a new map of connectedness created by researchers at the European Commission ’s Joint Research Centre in Ispra , Italy , and the World Bank .
Explore the maps
The maps are based on a model which calculated how long it would take to travel to the nearest city of 50,000 or more people by land or water .
The model combines information on terrain and access to road , rail and river networks ( see the maps ) .
It also considers how factors such as altitude , steepness of terrain and hold - ups like border crossings slow travel .
Plotted onto a map , the results throw up surprises .
First , less than 10 per cent of the world ’s land is more than 48 hours of ground - based travel from the nearest city .
What ’s more , many areas considered remote and inaccessible are not as far from civilisation as you might think .
In the Amazon , for example , extensive river networks and an increasing number of roads mean that only 20 per cent of the land …

This is What Your Tax Dollars are Going To .
The County of Los Angeles is Broke Yet The District Attorney ’s Office Will Spend Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars Trying to Maliciously Prosecute Innocent People on Misdemeanor Offenses !
*** Hopefully You Noticed Above that on June 4 , 2010 Steve Cooley ’s Daughter , Shannon Cooley , came to the Court to Represent the People .
Is n’t it Strange that Out of All the Cases Going on in Los Angeles County , Cooley ’s Daughter Appears on Behalf of the People on this Particular Case ?
It was Already Stated on the Record by the People at the May 5 , 2010 Hearing that the Defendant Felt the District Attorney ’s Office was Full of Corruption , when Referencing the Batteredbypd Blog & Then Magically Steve Cooley ’s Daughter Appears a Month Later as if to be Sending a Personal Message .
If You Put that Together with the Fact that the Main Deputy Involved in this Case has a High Ranking District Attorney for a Mother who is Close Partners with Steve Cooley , it just puts the Icing on the Cake .***

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - The United States on Friday slammed as “ reckless ” and “ callous ” Khartoum ’s decision to expel more than a dozen aid groups , saying it put millions of people ’s lives at risk in Sudan ’s western Darfur region .
“ The United States is gravely concerned by the reckless decision of the Sudanese government to expel international aid groups working to ease the suffering of Sudan ’s citizens , ” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters .
“ The humanitarian situation in the country is already dire and this callous step threatens the lives of innocents already suffering from years of war and upheaval , ” she said in a conference call .
The move by Sudan came after the International Criminal Court charged President Omar Hassan al - Bashir with war crimes in Darfur .
Khartoum ordered 13 high - profile aid agencies out of Darfur , including Oxfam and Save the Children , accusing them of passing evidence to the court .
Rice spoke shortly before the U.N. Security Council held closed - door discussions on Sudan .
Diplomats said council members could not agree on a statement because of differences over whether it should mention the ICC arrest warrant .
“ Millions of civilians , including untold thousands of children and elderly people , will be left even more vulnerable to starvation , disease , despair and death if the government of Sudan does not immediately change course , ” Rice said .
“ The government of Sudan at its own choosing is now heading down a path toward even greater international isolation . ”
SECURITY COUNCIL TAKES NO ACTION
Rice said she had a “ forceful ” conversation with Sudan ’s U.N. ambassador , Abdalmahmoud Abdalhaleem , in which she told him the decision was counterproductive and an “ enormous escalation ” that would exacerbate the situation on the ground and harm Sudan ’s relations with the international community .
Abdalhaleem told reporters the expulsion of nongovernmental organizations was a “ storm in a teacup ” and denied it had anything to do with the ICC indictment .
He said Khartoum had ample evidence of wide - ranging treachery by NGOs in Sudan , although the only examples he gave had to do with NGOs providing information to the ICC .
“ The evidence is there , I can bring it over , ” he said .
British Ambassador John Sawers was skeptical .
“ I certainly am not aware of any evidence to back that up , ” he told reporters after the Security Council meeting .
Rice was asked if Washington was still considering the possibility of imposing a no- fly zone over Darfur as the new Obama administration indicated previously .
She said that option was being “ considered and discussed ” as part of a policy review the administration is undertaking .
The council adjourned without action on Sudan .
France had drafted a statement urging Khartoum to reverse its decision on the NGOs , but Sawers said one of the five permanent members -- the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China -- had blocked it .
He left no doubt he was referring to China .
“ One delegation insisted on a reference , which we thought was unwarranted and not relevant , to the ICC decision , ” he said .
“ I think the Russians would have been able to agree to a reasonable statement . ”
China says it wants the council to use its power to halt the ICC case against Bashir .
Russia is with China , but Britain , France and the United States oppose deferring the proceedings .
Microsoft 's Tellme subsidiary announced their first app for Windows Mobile , a downloadable program that lets users dictate text messages , dial phone numbers , or search the Internet by voice .
Microsoft 's Tellme subsidiary announced their first app for Windows Mobile , a downloadable program that lets users dictate text messages , dial phone numbers , or search the Internet by voice .
The new app will be available for free in the upcoming Windows Marketplace for Mobile , Microsoft 's app store for Windows Mobile 6.5 phones , and the company will also make it available for manufacturers and carriers to build into their devices .
Microsoft did n't say whether it would be available for existing Windows Mobile 6.1 phones .
Tellme is best known for its automated voice service reached by dialing 1-800 - 555 - TELL .
By calling that number , you can get news tidbits , weather , movie showtimes , or even play Blackjack with a Sean Connery impersonator .
Since they were bought by Microsoft two years ago , Tellme turned its attention to developing smart phone apps , and released a BlackBerry app last year .
In a meeting with Appscout , Tellme executives said they were aiming to refine the app's interface in the future to let you perform entire tasks without looking at your phone .
For instance , you could check e-mail , or check and reply to text messages without looking at or touching your phone .
They 're also working to integrate the Tellme software with the voice - command button on most Bluetooth headsets .
" Voice search " is a hot area in mobile phone apps right now , but the available applications come well short of totally voice - enabling your phone interface .
Typically , apps like Yahoo's OneSearch with Voice require you to press a physical button , speak your search terms , and then use the phone 's interface to navigate through results .
This post originally appeared on AppScout .
It is a testament to the world 's catastrophic levels of inertia that when it comes to dealing with climate change , a relatively simple physical phenomenon , " geo-engineering solutions " are now being seriously looked at by scientists .
The ideas on show today range from the distant but interesting to the outright dangerous .
However , the wider point is not the pros and cons of particular technologies , but that the scientific community is becoming so scared of our collective inability to tackle climate emissions that such outlandish schemes are being considered for serious study .
We already have the technology and know - how to make dramatic cuts in global emissions - but it's not happening , and those closest to the climate science are coming near to pressing the panic button .
Politically , the West needs to lead the climate fight .
Most of our emissions come from fossil fuels used in the production of energy - but there should be no shortage of power .
The amount of energy that the Sun beats down onto the Earth 's surface each year is more than 10,000 times greater than our annual energy use .
And we 're not short on clean technology - solar photovoltaics , concentrated solar thermal power stations , wind , biomass and increasingly tidal technologies are all demonstrated and available .
These could be deployed rapidly if we were able to muster the kind of political will and serious levels of finance that were necessary to perpetrate the Iraq war .
So why do we find ourselves seeking geo-engineering solutions as some kind of magic bullet to counter the climate problem ?
While signs of panic emerge from the science community , decisions are made in the UK that will entrench new greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come .
Those who oppose these decisions face the wrath of a lethargic state .
Over the summer a grassroots , climate camp protest about new coal - fired power stations saw as many police deployed as protestors .
While the real climate solutions are blocked by vested interests seeking big bucks from coal , runways and forest destruction , our government tells us that it is taking " tough decisions " by cosying up to them .
The scientist 's focus on tinkering with our entire planetary system is not a dynamic new technological and scientific frontier , but an expression of political despair .

Posted in Guest Author , Politics on March 26th , 2009 by Guest Author | 20 Comments
My name is Robert Barr , and I voted for Barack Obama .
I voted for President Obama because the Republican Party of today is not representative of the Republican Party I grew up with .
You see , I was a Republican , and I voted for Bush – once .
But somewhere along the way the GOP stopped caring about my vote .
Maybe because I am a conservative that believes in a strong military but also thinks that a woman has the right to chose , or that there is much to be gained from stem cell research and we should fund it with the full throated support of the U.S. government .
Maybe it ’s my northeast liberal upbringing , but I could care less if a man wants to marry another man , for we should all know the trials and tribulations of love and marriage .
And I think the GOP knows that they need to be a bit more progressive too , but they also know that that can never happen as long as the face of the party remains that of Rush Limbaugh’s .
Because Limbaugh and his ilk and their never ending rants against anyone who is n’t so far right that they fall over is what has pushed me into the loving arms of the Dems .
I mean , it ’s easy to say you believe in everything one party believes in right ?
You do n’t have to think , you can just say , hey , I ’m a Republican , so I have to think this way .
But to come out and say you are for bombing Iran back into the 12th century but that you also want your daughter to have the right to have an abortion takes some logical , rational thought does n’t it ?
And in the end , it may very well be the wrong way of thinking , and I will be judged by my creator just like you will , and some of us are going to be right , and some of us are going to be wrong .
But I do n’t think the likes of Rush Limbaugh should be telling me I am wrong , considering his own checkered past .
Which leads me to my question , on the heels of some of Limbaugh ’s most controversial statements , I want to know from the Republicans out there , is Limbaugh the voice of the Republican party and does he represent your point of view ?
Or , in perfect Jealous Brother parlance , is Rush Limbaugh good for the Republican Party ?

MisVampyre : i'm so outta questions .... i'm horrible at asking them
rhys_rhaven : questions are cute
rhys_rhaven : but the real way to understand a person is simple
rhys_rhaven : you wind a cord around the top of the biggest pair of stairs you can find
rhys_rhaven : and then you wait till a person is about to walk down the stairs , where they will obviously trip and have horrible things happen to them
rhys_rhaven : and then you walk 20 feet way .
and you put a thing of frozen bacon in a skillet
rhys_rhaven : and you make the skillet so it can only be heated by a locked drum underneath it , which can be lit only by a single pilot light , which you then line with det cord trailing to a small mortar next to it .
which you fill with kittens
rhys_rhaven : hungry , meowing kittens
MisVampyre : oh. my . god .
rhys_rhaven :
And lastly you put a timer on the on the propane for the bacon .
So they have a choice
rhys_rhaven : save the person
rhys_rhaven : save the kittens
rhys_rhaven : or eat the bacon
MisVampyre : you 're awesome
MisVampyre : omg ..eat the bacon
rhys_rhaven :
Thats it .
I love you
School Bus Conversion Project :
In 1982 I was a sophomore at a small college in the Midwest .
It was the beginning of second term and I was again standing in line at the on - campus book store waiting to pay for a too - heavy stack of text books .
The line was not moving at all so I put my books down on the floor and started flipping through the coffee table books on display .
The book I chose to pick up first was titled Rolling Homes - Handmade House on Wheels by Jane Lidz .
Thus the seed was planted .
Sometime in late August , 2004 this seed suddenly germinated and I started researching and preparing for this project .
I located several good on - line sources of information , ordered a copy of Ben Rosander 's Select and Convert Your Bus Into a Motorhome on a Shoestring , made some sketches of floor plans , started collecting materials and fittings , and researched the cost of insurance and registration .
Above left you see the raw material for my school bus conversion project it 's a 1989 Thomas Saf - T - Liner MVP with a rear mounted CAT 3208 engine .
It was originally built for 75 Passengers with a GVWR 30,000 lbs .
It 's got about between 80 and 100 K miles on it and originally came from Montrose , NY .
The interior dimensions are 35 ' x 7.5 ' x 6.5 '.
I bought it on eBay for $ 2031.00 .
Over the next several months I will be converting this old school bus into a family camper and documenting each step of the conversion process here .
Now the project has begun !
Herein you will find the details of each step of the process of my school bus conversion into a family camper .
This is a low - budget project , wherever possible materials will be re-used and recycled .
Some of the tools that are particularly useful for bus conversion .
Step one , have a party and remove the seats !
Preliminary floor plan .
Insulation and framing .
Building bunks and a double bed in the master bedroom .
Cabinetry fore and aft .
Installing the shower and fitting out the bathroom .
Hanging the tanks and general plumbing .
Cooking with gas !
Lighting , 12 volt and kerosene .
Dinette and convertible spare bed .
Electric supply and wiring .
Converting an ATX power supply to be a 12 volt bench supply .
Building the kitchen .
Painting the bus with True Value XO - Rust .
Body work , screen , seat mounting .
Radiator replacement .
Wheel chocks , backup monitor , fire extinguishers , CO & smoke detectors .
Interior painting and finish

We sold the Town Car and retired the mini-van and bought a pair of 2007 Toyota Yarii one of which ( probably the black one due to the diesel soot ! ) we will tow behind the motorhome .
Here are some pictures of the Yaris and some notes on towing the Yaris and a short article about installing a Short Shifter Kit .

At age 21 , while still a student at Bennington College in Vermont ( a school thinly disguised as Camden College in his books ) , Bret Easton Ellis made a considerable splash with his 1985 debut novel Less Than Zero , about the drug - addled nightlife of wealthy young Los Angelenos .
Four novels and a short - story collection later , Ellis remains one of the most polarizing figures in the literary world , a moralist and satirist whose vision of upper - crust excess and spiritual vacancy has been criticized by some as indulgence in same .
Still others have rallied around him and earned him a considerable cult following , particularly in the wake of American Psycho , a book that so controversial that it was dropped by its original publisher , and The New York Times dispatched two different critics to pan it mercilessly .

Ellis ’ other novels — The Rules Of Attraction , Glamorama , and Lunar Park — have proved similarly divisive , as have the ambitious film versions of American Psycho and The Rules Of Attraction .
( Everyone , including Ellis , seems to agree that Less Than Zero made for a very bad movie . )
Ellis is currently readying Imperial Bedrooms , a sequel to Less Than Zero , for publication in 2010 .
Adapted from his short - story anthology of the same name , The Informers peeks into the interconnected lives of characters in early - ’80s Los Angeles , with an ensemble cast including Billy Bob Thornton , Kim Basinger , Mickey Rourke , Jon Foster , Winona Ryder , Brad Renfro ( in his final turn ) , Chris Isaak , and Amber Heard .
For the first time , Ellis had a direct hand in the production , adapting the script with co-writer Nicholas Jarecki .
Ellis recently spoke to The A.V. Club about adaptations of his work , his blunt feelings toward people who do n’t like his characters , and the American Psycho stage musical .

The A.V. Club :
You wrote a draft of American Psycho for David Cronenberg , but The Informers is the first time you ’ve scripted an adaptation of one of your books and had it made into a movie .
How did that happen ?
Were you shut out of the process in previous adaptations ?
Bret Easton Ellis : I was n’t .
I just was n’t particularly interested in terms of casting decisions , being on the set , things like that .
The Informers came together because this young filmmaker [ Nicholas Jarecki ] who just graduated from NYU got in touch with my agent and wanted to meet me .
He had just finished a really interesting documentary about James Toback [ 2005 ’s The Outsider ] that I liked quite a bit .
I agreed to meet with him because he was looking to do his first feature .
So he had an idea for the film , and I had also been wanting to do [ an adaptation ] for a long time , and just could never figure it out .
He chose the stories from the collection that he thought would work best as a film , and we sat down and we wrote a script .
Then it got very complicated .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : How so ?
BEE : Because it was a two - hour - 40 - minute movie , this kind of sprawling , 30 - character story based in L.A. in 1983 .
Both of our agents politely read the script and said , “ Okay , this is never going to get made .
Move on to something else . ”
But Nick was very persistent , and he found someone who loved the script and got the money to make the movie , because it was fairly expensive to make .
So that ’s how it happened .
Marco
Weber produced the film , got the money to make the film , and got a great cast .

AVC : Did n’t Jarecki want to direct ?
BEE : Yes , he always intended to direct it .
AVC : What happened there ?
BEE : What happened was , the people with the money became very worried that this movie could not be directed by a first - time guy .
And also in terms of getting the cast that they wanted , I guess a lot of actors were skittish about working with a first - time director on a movie like this .
So he was replaced by Gregor Jordan .
But it was always his intention to direct the film .
Advertisement
AVC : How did you go about solving the problem of adapting this material ?
BEE : You know what ?
It really was n’t that much of a problem .
It seemed more daunting at first than it ended up being .
We found one guy that appeared in a lot of the stories and we decided to build a movie around him , the Jon Foster character .
We ’d already decided which six or seven stories to focus on , and once we sat down with the book , it was n’t really that hard .
Everything kind of fell into place , and every story started to tell itself .
It was actually a really fun experience writing the script .

AVC : You ’ve said that Jarecki came to you with an idea on how to crack it .
BEE : Definitely .
I ’d always wanted to make The Informers into a movie , and Nick really was the catalyst for making it happen .
When we initially sat down to talk , he said , “ What six or seven stories are you interested in turning into a movie ? ” I told him mine and he told me his , and we overlapped on like two or three .
He was more interested in stories I did n’t want to go to .
I really just wanted to concentrate on the family stories and stories about the son , the daughter , the mom , the dad , etc .
He was more interested in the criminal , the vampire , the rock star .
Once we figured out how they could all be intertwined , it became fun .
It was a very loose adaptation .
There ’s a lot of stuff taken from the book that one character says that ’s given to another in the movie .
There ’s a lot of freedom to it , because it was n’t a novel , and we did n’t really have to stick to any particular story .
We could run around through these 13 stories and do with them what we want .
There was n’t any kind of fixed narrative there , so we had to create one ourselves .
It was a very enjoyable experience writing the script .
AVC : You ’ve had some experiences with writing screenplays in the past , including a monster movie you tried to do for DreamWorks .
What did you take away from those experiences ?

BEE : I learned that you really do n’t have any control as a writer .
Waah , waah , waah .
[ Laughs . ]
Big deal .
Unless you ’re the director on the movie , or putting up the money for the movie , you really do n’t have a lot of control .
As someone who ’s just writing scripts , you just kind of have to shrug .
I have no problems or issues with screenwriting in general .
It is what it is .
It seems that I ’ve had some issues about this particular project .
I think it stems from the fact that I ’m much more sensitive because it ’s based on a book of mine .
And also , it is the first script I ’ve written that has actually made it to the screen .
I ’m very touchy about it .
Someone told me yesterday , “ Oh , you know , it ’s on the ’net that you really hate The Informers , and you ’re really down on it . ”
And I had to look this thing up .
The headline was , “ Does Bret Easton Ellis hate The Informers ? ”
Because of some online interview I did , there ’s this suggestion that I ’m not truly happy with the movie .
But no , that ’s not true at all .
I ’m friendly with Gregor and the producers and …
I ’m getting off the topic .
You asked me what did I learn about my screenwriting ?
Nothing .
[ Laughs . ]
I did n’t really learn anything at all .
I learned that if you want to do it , you should do it and be polite .

AVC : How much does the finished film resemble the script ?
BEE : Very little .
[ Laughs ]
Gregor would have to admit that too , and so would Marco .
This is not me complaining .
That ’s the fact .
The 95 - minute version of The Informers is very different from this sprawling , epic movie that Nick and I had in mind when we wrote the script .
For some people , that probably sounds like its own kind of hell , but there ’s a lot more resolution in our script , and it was also kind of lighter , funnier , more Altman - esque .
This is a very different creature .
I like the movie .
It is very different in terms of tone and style from the movie we were thinking of when we were writing the script .
There ’s also literally 40 or 50 minutes missing from it in terms of stories being resolved , and …
Advertisement
AVC : So you had still handed them the much longer script .
BEE : They shot it .
They just cut 40 minutes out of it .
They shot the script after there were some cuts made for budgetary concerns .
One of the stories , about a vampire — actually , it ’s about a guy in L.A. who thinks he ’s a vampire — was cut before shooting even began .
But no , they shot it , but then Gregor decided to find his movie in the editing room .
Really , what is being shown now is a Gregor Jordan film .
And it ’s interesting .
I guess I ’m the person who has to promote the movie .
I would love it if Gregor was the one , because I really do think it ’s his film .
I was just the writer on it .
I feel awkward , in a way , being interviewed about this movie , because it ’s not exactly what I intended , even though — and again , I ’m not just being diplomatic about it — there are a lot of things about it I do like a lot .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : But you wrote something more like Short Cuts .
BEE : More Short Cuts - like , only much more somber .
By the way , every scene in the movie was in some way or another in the script , and there ’s a lot of dialogue from the script , which is from the book .
But yeah , we were thinking of something funnier .
Nick and I wanted to do …
His main influences were Pulp Fiction , Magnolia , Boogie Nights .
And we agreed : Short Cuts , Nashville , we were thinking of movies along that line .

AVC : It seems like previous adaptations of your books that have worked , like American Psycho or The Rules Of Attraction , have benefited greatly from comedy .
BEE : Completely .
AVC : The tone of The Informers is really funereal .
This is n’t a terribly funny movie .
Advertisement
BEE : No , and the script was really funny .
[ Laughs . ]
So what do you do ?
This is why the screenwriter should never be interviewed when a movie ’s premièring .
This really should be the director ’s job , because it ’s a director ’s medium .
It ’s not a screenwriter ’s medium .
And actually going through this , being on the set and meeting the actors , you ’re even more aware that it ’s an actor ’s medium , much more than it is a screenwriter ’s medium , because they change so much of what you ’re doing in terms of how they interpret it .
Personally , I always think a lot of my work is funny — at least , I think it ’s funny , I ’m amused by it .
Certainly I think in Rules Of Attraction that comes through , and in American Psycho .
I think a lot of the work is funny , and in the script for The Informers , there was a lot of comedy in it .
I wrote the script , it was made , and now it ’s not funny .
What do you do ?
What do I do ?
Do I sit around and complain about it ?
Not really .
This is how [ Gregor ] read the script and interpreted it , and this is how he decided to shoot it , and this is also how he decided to cut the movie .
And again , I ’m on the same page with Gregor and Marco in terms of …
Well , in terms of being friendly and social with each other .
I said , “ Look , you know I have issues about this cut of the movie .
There were cuts of the movie I thought were much better . ”
And they said , “ This is the cut we like .
This is what we want to go out with .
There are DVDs .
Maybe you can do a cut , Bret . ” [ Laughs . ]
Which I ’m not particularly interested in doing .

AVC : What do you make of the timing of this movie ?
The problems of wealthy people in the ’ 80s may not be as resonant now that so many people are struggling financially .
Or is that the wrong way of looking at it ?
BEE : [ Laughs . ]
It ’s a very suggestive way of looking at it .
It ’s a theory , but it has nothing to do with why we made the movie .
But the movie coming out in this particularly troublesome time , I do n’t know .
Quite honestly , I have n’t even really thought about that .
This is just a movie that people wanted to make .
I do n’t really think we were thinking about now so much as the past and the end of the ’ 70s , the beginning of the ’80s .
We were just trying to make a good movie .
The people who the movie is about , in terms of today …
Will they want to see the movie ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe .
I have no idea .
I really do n’t .
I ’m not even thinking about that .

AVC : How protective are you over the way your books are adapted ?
BEE : Obviously not a lot .
[ Laughs . ]
AVC : Does it bother you to see what happens to them , or do you just let them go ?
BEE : If I really , really cared so much , I would not let them be made .
Writers can do that .
They can say , “ I ’m not signing the papers .
I ’m not selling the rights to my book . ”
I think of it as a completely different medium , and it does n’t really worry me or bother me when people adapt a work .
I think the books are the books .
They were conceived as books .
They were n’t conceived as movies .
When I write scripts , that ’s an idea and a situation that I think is a really good idea for a movie .
When I ’m writing a book , I ’m not thinking , “ Oh , this would be a great movie . ”
This would be a very interesting book .
And I think the books are things that cannot really be adapted into another medium .
Advertisement
AVC : And yet your books keep getting made into movies .
BEE : What do you think about that ?
What ’s going on there ?
I mean , why ?
I just got an e-mail this morning about Lunar Park and its progression ; they seem very serious on doing it .
What is your theory on that ?
Why do you think these books keep getting made into movies ?
I do n’t know .
Advertisement
AVC : I always felt that the worlds you create in the books are so evocative that filmmakers want to try and capture that .
It ’s just a matter of trying to solve them on a narrative level , and some have been more successful at doing it than others .
Really only Rules Of Attraction —
BEE : Fully works .
AVC : What was your working relationship with director Roger Avary on that movie ?
BEE : Actually , there was no working relationship .
I had written a script originally for Breck Eisner , who was the first director attached to that .
I got to know Breck really well , and I thought that was going to happen .
And then , of course , in the usual fashion , it fell apart and the producers were looking for another director , and they found Roger .
I only met with Roger a couple of times .
Then he went and made the movie , and I remember seeing a longer rough cut of it about eight months before it was released .
Kind of preparing myself for the worst , I skimmed his script — and I had a lot of other things going on in my life at that point — but I remember very clearly going to the screening of it in Culver City and just realizing “ Yes , someone has finally captured my sensibility in a way that had n’t been done before in the previous two adaptations . ”
There ’s a lot missing from the book , sure .
But I was kind of excited by it .
It ’s something that , whenever it pops up , I can watch over and over .
Roger and I did become very friendly after that .
I sold the rights to Glamorama to him , because he wanted to make that into a movie .
That was a very happy experience , I thought .
I do n’t know why Roger was the one — maybe it was an easier book .
Maybe because it was something he could play around with more .
Advertisement
AVC : Based on Killing Zoe and Pulp Fiction , he seems like a guy who was n’t going to shy away from the material in the book , or apologize for it .
You ’ve said the film version of American Psycho was sort of done in quotation marks .
There ’s a kind of a reticence to really tackle the material as it is .
BEE : I think Roger was pretty fearless about it .
But he ’s also dealing with kind of a college movie , where it does n’t seem on the surface that a lot ’s at stake , and then by the end of it , you realize that there was quite a bit at stake .
He took this material from a book of mine that I think is flawed in a lot of ways , but I thought he elevated it to another realm .
And maybe it was because he did n’t feel he needed to be so careful with the material , which I ’m sure [ American Psycho co-writer / director ]
Mary Harron definitely felt she had to be .
I do n’t know about Gregor .
I think that he felt he was doing a very honest job .
Advertisement
And on a surface level , I think The Informers is very beautiful , and I think he did do a really good job visually .
It has this very cold , gleaming , surface -y quality to it that I like .
But why did some of them work and some of them not ?
I have nothing more to say about that .
Prod me into something else .
I do n’t know why Roger ’s worked so well .
Less Than Zero is obviously bad , and we do n’t need to talk about why that did n’t work .
And American Psycho — that is , I think , an impossible book to adapt .
But whatever , it was the greatest hits from the book , more or less .
Mary did a very good job of keeping that movie together , as did Christian Bale , and I think Roger did a terrific job .
And with The Informers , I think there is really an outstanding movie floating out there somewhere , and I hope one day people might be able to see it .
But it ’s very interesting .
I am not comparing The Informers to The Godfather on any level , but there ’s that famous story where Paramount asked Coppola to cut like an hour out of the movie , because they did n’t want to release a three - hour movie .
And Coppola did , and showed it to the executive , and it was terrible .
It moved very slowly at two hours .
And then when he put the other hour back in , it moved very quickly .
And that ’s all I want to say about The Informers .

Did you see Hunger , by Steve McQueen ?
Hunger is probably the most impressive movie I ’ve seen in ’09 , in the first quarter .
It ’s the one that put me most in awe .
But it ’s also going to be a battle between aesthetics and morality .
If you come at movies with your own sense of morality and not your own sense of aesthetics , I think you ’re screwed .
I think that ’s not a way to look at movies .
If you start looking at movies on a moral level — “ I do n’t like that , that hurts , that ’s mean , that ’s bad ” — then I do n’t even want to talk to you .
Or like , someone that says “ I do n’t like science - fiction movies , ” or “ I do n’t want to sit through a Western , ” or “ I do n’t like violence in movies , ” then I completely tune out .
AVC : That ’s kind of the main line of criticism of your work : “ Why should we care ?
We should we even engage with the people in the story , when they ’re so unlikeable ? ”
Advertisement
BEE : If people think that , that ’s their problem .
The makers are not thinking that .
That ’s not a reason why you go to a movie .
I mean , hang out with your friends instead .
Do n’t go to a movie to get that — that ’s pure narcissism .
That ’s saying , “ I want to get my ego reflected in the film that I ’m watching . ”
Then what are you going go see ?
The best filmmakers know to put that aside and just wrestle with their own obsessions , more or less .
But yeah , I ’m sure one complaint about The Informers is “ Why should I care ? ”
The rallying cry of the narcissist !
I think you should care for a number of reasons , if you are inclined to do so .
Look , on a certain level , I think it ’s fantastic that a movie like The Informers gets made on such a huge budget .
And it is an attempt at a throwback to a kind of movie that is barely ever made anymore .
And that it ’s being released in 500 theaters on April 24 is a testament to the sheer will of the makers of the movie .
AVC : When we last interviewed you back in 1999 [ http://www.avclub.com/articles/bret-easton-ellis,13586/], you said , “ I ’ve never written a single scene that I can say took place , I ’ve never written a line of dialogue that I ’ve heard someone say or that I have said . ”
So with that in mind , what is the source of your observations ?
Advertisement
BEE : My own tortured soul ! [ Laughs . ]
My own tortured psyche .
AVC : The question sort of arose over the perception that your books are autobiographical in some way .
Advertisement
BEE : Well , they are autobiographical in the sense that they reflect who I was at a particular moment in my life .
There was talk of a memoir , and I realized why I could n’t write a memoir , because the books are the memoir — they completely sum up how I was feeling , what I was thinking about , what my obsessions were , what I was fantasizing about , who I was , in a fictional context over the last 25 years or so .
I do n’t really look at writing as like , “ Oh yeah , I went out with Donna and Frank the other night , and she said something really interesting , and God , the way he lit his cigarette was kind of a cool thing .
I ’m gonna jot that down and put that in the book I ’m working on . ”
It just does n’t work that way .
I do n’t know how it works .
I do n’t know why I write what I write .
I mean , it ’s impossible to talk about .
I do n’t know .
AVC : If you could go back in time and give advice to the kid who wrote Less Than Zero , what would it be ?
Advertisement
BEE : [ Long pause . ]
Not to take everything so seriously .
To understand that … you know what , I ’m not gonna answer this question .
When ’s the last time someone asked you that , and you realized not only do you have to answer it , but it ’s gonna be put in the newspaper ?
AVC : So how about the American Psycho musical ?
Are you excited ?
BEE : It ’s not what you think at all .
It ’s a rock musical , with like a band .
It ’s like a multimedia rave situation .
It ’s not like a straight - ahead Broadway musical with guys in Armani suits doing jazz hands with an old - style score .
It ’s like a concert , in a way .
You get this idea in your head that it ’s 42nd Street or something , and it ’s not .
It ’s a very different kind of musical .
We ’ll see .
It ’s still a long way down the road .
But I ’ve talked to everybody involved , and the reason to move forward with it was exactly because of how the guys who are doing this want to do it .
It ’s not old - school Broadway .
It ’s very new , interesting concepts .

AVC : Is it like an Evil Dead 2 thing , where people are wearing ponchos in the front row ?

AVC : A lot of Rules Of Attraction fans would ask you if Glitterati will ever see the light of day .
BEE : For many legal reasons , it will never see the light of day .
You ca n’t really show Glitterati in public , it ’s not possible .
There are a lot of people who would be very upset .
I do n’t even know if they got permission from a lot of the people in it , which might be a big problem , why it ’s only shown privately .

AVC : Todd Haynes ’ Superstar : The Karen Carpenter Story can also never be shown for rights reasons , but it ’s found its way into underground circles .
So maybe there ’s hope ?
BEE : Roger ’s obsessed with containment of this .
I think it would ruin marriages .
[ Laughs ]
I think what they shot is …
I think it ’ll be a long time before they can show this movie .
I think Kip Pardue would be okay with it , maybe .
But it ’s basically about 90 minutes of him in character actually seducing women throughout Europe .
Much of this was shot late at night , and people did n’t care .
I just do n’t know what you could do with it .
You ca n’t really show this movie in public .
IT IS a source of daily frustration for hundreds of Sydney cyclists making their way to and from work .
At the northern approach to the Harbour Bridge the bike path comes to an abrupt end and pedal - pushers are forced to dismount and negotiate 55 steps by walking their bikes down a narrow ramp before continuing .
Daily frustration ... cyclists negotiate the ramp on the Harbour Bridge 's northern approach .
Credit : Dean Sewell
" Give me one example of a Sydney road where the driver has to get out and push his or her car for 10 metres ? " cyclist Chris Virtue asked yesterday .
" There 's a traffic jam there during peak hour every day - 20 - odd cyclists lining up to go up the ramp .
Absolutely ridiculous . "
Sydney 's cycleways are not so much an organised network as a fragmented collection of winding paths and half - finished ideas .
Most were built or designed when cycling was viewed as a pleasant pastime rather than a practical form of travel and are now poorly suited to commuting .

Share and share alike : a male chimp will give up his hard - earned catch for sex
Chimpanzees enter into " deals " whereby they exchange meat for sex , according to researchers .
Male chimps that are willing to share the proceeds of their hunting expeditions mate twice as often as their more selfish counterparts .
This is a long - term exchange , so males continue to share their catch with females when they are not fertile , copulating with them when they are .
The team describe their findings in the journal PLoS One .
Meat is an important , protein - rich food for chimpanzees Cristina Gomes and her colleagues , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany , studied chimps in the Tai Forest reserve in Ivory Coast .
She and her team observed the animals as they hunted , and monitored the number of times they copulated .
" By sharing , the males increase the number of times they mate , and the females increase their intake of calories , " said Dr Gomes .
" What 's amazing is that if a male shares with a particular female , he doubles the number of times he copulates with her , which is likely to increase the probability of fertilising that female . "
High value Meat is important for the animals ' diet because it is so high in protein .
Since female chimps do not usually hunt , " they have a hard time getting it on their own , " explained Dr Gomes .
Males might share meat with a female one day , and only copulate with her a day or two later
Cristina Gomes
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
The " meat for sex hypothesis " had already been proposed to explain why male chimps might share with females .
But previous attempts to record the phenomenon failed , because researchers looked for direct exchanges , where a male shared meat with a fertile female and copulated with her right away .
Dr Gomes ' team took a new approach .
In a previous study , she had found that grooming exchange - where the animals take it in turns to groom each other - happens over long periods , she related .
" So we thought , why not meat and sex ?
" We looked at chimps when they were not in oestrus , this means they do n't have sexual swellings and are n't copulating . "
" The males still share with them - they might share meat with a female one day , and only copulate with her a day or two later . "
Dr Gomes thinks that her findings could even provide clues about human evolution .
She suggests this study could lay the foundations for human studies exploring the link between " good hunting skills and reproductive success " .
" This has got me really interested in humans , " she said .
" I 'm thinking of moving on to working with hunter - gatherers . "
Michael Gurven from the University of California in Santa Barbara studies human behaviour in communities of hunter - gatherers in South America .
He told BBC News that the direct link between success in hunting and reproduction highlighted by this study could " help in our thinking about humans " .
Professor Gurven , who was not involved in this study , added that the nature of this exchange of meat for sex is " kind of like pair bonding in humans , because it 's long - term .
" This highlights something we have n't seen in chimps before . "

Opinion
Columnist believes politics , religion inseparable
Last week , a column by Nathan Sparks proclaimed that religion and morality had no place in the issue of same sex marriage .
To that , I say he is so wrong .
Such thinking , that you can and should separate morality and religion from politics has promoted the moral decay of this country and corrupted and confused the foundations on which it was built ; you know , the good old U.S. Constitution .
It must be first understood that beliefs ; religious and moral ; are the precursor to laws , principles and government structure .
Our beliefs give birth to them and without beliefs those things would n’t exist nor would they serve any purpose .
These things tell us what is right to do and wrong to do , how we can and should live and within what limits .
This country was founded on Christian beliefs and it should not be deceivingly denied ( read the Bible and the constitution and their relationship is clear ) .
The constitution states : “ they are endowed by their Creator [ God ] with certain unalienable Rights ’ ” When the Founding Fathers suggested a separation of the church and state it was not to say that religion should be removed from laws but that the government did not have the right to impose a religion on any person .
The intent was to keep the government out of God not to keep God ( religion ) out of the government .
However let ’s stick to the issue at hand : marriage .
It is not about discrimination , gay or civil rights , the constitution , insurance policies or even someone ’s happiness .
It ’s about marriage , its purpose , definition and significance .
To Christians , marriage is much more than a “ legal arrangement . ”
Marriage has existed since the beginning of time , long before any political institution did .
Marriage was a gift given by God to be shared between a man and a woman .
It was and is meant to be a spiritual union , something that is greater than love or happiness .
Therefore , it is first and foremost religious .
All matrimonial legalities that followed were indeed based off this truth .
Denying marriage to gays or lesbians is not about denying them freedom or equality .
Mr. Sparks compared the denial of same sex marriage to women ’s right to vote and slaves ’ freedom , but did this fallibly .
Women cannot choose their sex nor can a person choose the color of their skin , but people can choose their sexual preference ( there is no proof it is genetic ) .
Gays , lesbians and the like are free to live as they choose but they do n’t have a right to redefine marriage .
The issue is about not condoning something believed to be wrong or aiding in its manifestation .
It is about preserving the sanctity of marriage .
In order to do that , laws such as those which ban same sex marriage are imperative .
That ’s why I ’m standing up and I ’m asking if we allow same sex marriage , where are we going to draw the line ?
Will we OK polygamy ?
How about bestiality , will that be OK ?
Marriage will mean nothing if we allow it to be corrupted by definitions and unions outside of its sacred purpose .
I agree with Mr. Sparks on one point : we need to contribute to the solution , not the problem of this country .
Unlike him , I believe the problem is too many of us are bystanders , we follow and we do n’t lead .
We watch as God is being taken out of this country .
As for me , it is my prayer that we will stand up for God , keep this nation under Him and save marriage for us , our families and the generations to come .

There are some things science needs to survive , and to thrive : eager , hardworking scientists ; a grasp of reality and a desire to understand it ; and an open and clear atmosphere to communicate and discuss results .
That last bit there seems to be having a problem .
Communication is key to science ; without it you are some nerd tinkering in your basement .
With it , the world can learn about your work and build on it .
Recently , government - sponsored agencies like NIH have moved toward open access of scientific findings .
That is , the results are published where anyone can see them , and in fact ( for the NIH ) after 12 months the papers must be publicly accessible .
This is , in my opinion ( and that of a lot of others , including a pile of Nobel laureates ) a good thing .
Astronomers , for example , almost always post their papers on Astro-ph , a place where journal - accepted papers can be accessed before they are published .
John Conyers ( D - MI ) apparently has a problem with this .
He is pushing a bill through Congress that will literally ban the open access of these papers , forcing scientists to only publish in journals .
This may not sound like a big deal , but journals are very expensive .
They can cost a fortune : The Astrophysical Journal costs over $ 2000 / year , and they charge scientists to publish in them !
So this bill would force scientists to spend money to publish , and force you to spend money to read them .
Why would Conyers do this ?
Interestingly , if you look at the bill sponsors , you find that they received twice as much money on average in donations from journal publishers than Congresscritters who do n't sponsor the bill -- though to be fair , the total amount is not large .
Still , Conyers got 4 times as much .
Interesting .
Ironically , this bill is called The Fair Copyright in Research Works Act , which is much like the Clean Air Clear Skies Act or the Patriot Act , in that it does exactly the opposite of what its name says .
This bill is not fair , it puts a burden on scientists and keeps research from being publicly accessible as it should be .
I myself rely on things like Astro -ph to do my reporting here ; it could become illegal to post papers there for federally - sponsored scientists if this bill is passed .
You can read more about this at Financial Times , Earlham College , and at Lawrence Lessig 's blog .
I think I have some phone calls to make .
Tip o' the etaoin shrdlu to Tim Farley .
Oft erscheint es vor allem älteren Menschen , dass es ja eigentlich keine aufsehen erregenden Erfindungen mehr geben kann .
Besonders in den vergangenen 50 Jahren hat die Technik einen so großen Sprung gemacht , dass es oft unvorstellbar scheint , dass dort noch Entwicklungen für die Zukunft bleiben sollen .
Viele Zukunftstechnologien existieren indes auch schon seit geraumer Zeit .
Doch erst mit steten Verbesserungen und zusätzlichen Forschungen werden einige Technologien reif für den Massenmarkt .
Dort angekommen jedoch können die im Folgenden vorgestellten Technologien das Leben der Menschen ebenso stark verändern , wie es die Einführung des Fernsehgerätes oder des Telefons taten .
Vor 20 Jahren war es das Internet für das technikbegeisterte Menschen belächelt wurden , heute ist ein Leben ohne das weltweite Informations - und mittlerweile auch Unterhaltungsnetz für viele Menschen kaum noch vorstellbar .
Untrennbar mit dem Überall - Internet verknüpft sind die Möglichkeiten der Augmented Reality , der sogenannten Erweiterten Realität .
Damit sind keine Drogenexperimente gemeint sondern ganz im Gegenteil die Möglichkeit per Smartphone oder Tablet - PC zusätzliche Informationen über die reale
Welt zu blenden .
Auch Navigationsprogramme nutzen diese Möglichkeiten und blenden über ein Video der vor dem Auto liegenden Straße Verkehrs - und Navigationshinweise ein .
Die Realität bekommt eine weitere rein informative Ebene .
Doch auch spielerische Möglichkeiten sind denkbar .
Das AKW - Unglück in Japan hat erneut bewiesen , dass dringend an Alternativen zum Atomstrom gearbeitet werden muss .
Eine bereits seit langer Zeit bekannte Technologie ist die Photovoltaik – die Solartechnik .
Doch noch sind die Solarzellen vergleichsweise schlecht in der Energieausbeute und teuer in der Herstellung .
Dennoch wird in wenigen Jahren ein nicht unerheblicher Teil unserer Energie mittels Solarzellen produziert werden .
Von aktuell 17 Gigawatt soll die Photovoltaik bis zu 50 Gigawatt Energie für Deutschland liefern .
Doppelt so viel wie alle deutschen Atomkraftwerke aktuell zusammen produzieren .
Verbesserte Herstellungsverfahren und eine stark erhöhte Energieausbeute machen aus der Solartechnik eine der für die Energieerzeugung wichtigsten Zukunftstechniken .
Begrenzte Ressourcen sind ein Problem , mit dem sich die Menschheit eher früher als später auseinandersetzen muss .
Die Sorglosigkeit mit der viele Millionen Autos alleine in Deutschland unvorstellbare Mengen zu Benzin raffiniertes Öl verbrennen wird in Zukunft ein schnelles Ende haben müssen .
Die Trendwende können Elektroautos einleiten – wir bleiben weiterhin mobil und müssen nicht auf das Auto verzichten , die Energie kommt aber nicht mehr aus der Tankstelle sondern aus der Steckdose .
Elektroautos existieren zwar schon seit einiger Zeit , doch erst jetzt kommt Bewegung in die Technik .
Auch hier sorgen Fortschritte in der Technik für alltagstaugliche Autos und fallende Preise .
UK scientists have created a computer program to work out all the aromatic heterocycles that could be synthesised , hoping to expand the range of molecules used in the pharmaceutical and other industries .
William Pitt and colleagues from UCB Celltech in Cambridge and Slough have created the virtual exploratory heterocyclic library , dubbed VEHICLe , which contains over 3,000 heterocycles considered ’ synthetically viable ’ .
Heteroaromatic ring systems are often used as the core of drugs or agrochemicals , but a survey of the literature showed that only 1,701 different cycles had ever been synthesised .
Less than 10 novel small heteroaromatic ring systems are published each year , the researchers estimate , and the number is falling .
Pitt explains that VEHICLe could be a powerful tool in drug discovery : ’ If you have a natural product or a competitor ’s drug molecule , but you want to replace the ring system - either because the original has problems or the patents are owned by someone else - then you could replace the core with a new ring system that overcomes those problems and is in a clear patent space . ’
The VEHICLe database was generated using a learning computer program , which first identified all possible five - and six - membered heterocycles and bicycles containing nitrogen , oxygen and sulfur heteroatoms .
’ A lot of these ring systems obviously did n’t make chemical sense , ’ explains Pitt , ’ so we came up with a machine - learning method to filter out ones which were n’t of any interest . ’
The program was then taught to be able to give an indication of which ring systems would be synthetically accessible .
’ I was surprised by how well it works , ’ Pitt adds , ’we ’ve already applied VEHICLe to several projects within UCB where we needed to substitute heterocyclic systems that we were unhappy with . ’
’ We ’d love people to try and make some of these molecules , ’ says Colin Groom from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre , who collaborated on the work , ’ because that will show whether or not our predictions are right about which ones can and ca n’t be made ’ .

Lately I ’ve been consuming as much conservative media as possible ( interspersed with shots of Pepto - Bismol ) to get a better sense of the mind and mood of the right .
My read :
They ’re apocalyptic .
They feel isolated , angry , betrayed and besieged .
And some of their “ leaders ” seem to be trying to mold them into militias .
At first , it was entertaining  just harmless , hotheaded expostulation .
Of course , there were the garbled facts , twisted logic and veiled hate speech .
But what did I expect , fair and balanced ?
It was like walking through an ideological house of mirrors .
The distortions can be mildly amusing at first , but if I stay too long it makes me sick .
But , it ’s not all just harmless talk .
For some , their disaffection has hardened into something more dark and dangerous .
They ’re talking about a revolution .
Enlarge Handout photo via Getty Images Jiverly Wong killed 13 people , wounded four other people , and killed himself at the American Civic Association on April 3 in Binghamton , N.Y. BINGHAMTON 
Years before he achieved infamy for slaughtering 13 people and killing himself , Jiverly A . Wong was sparking fears among immigration officials , police and his own father .
The federal employee who did Wong 's criminal background check used the term " sketchy . "
One Southern
Tier police agency thought his pistol permit application merited extra attention .
Another believed he 'd robbed a bank of almost $ 10,000 .
Those are some of the questions
Wong raised among authorities who would decide if he would become a citizen , if he could possess a firearm , and later , if he would be charged with the daring daylight holdup of a bank about 40 miles from his Johnson City apartment .
But the most chilling flag raised about the Vietnamese immigrant was in a letter from his father to the Broome County sheriff .
" I do not want he hold a pistol , " Henry Voong wrote .
Wong served time in jail and clearly feared police , but he would spend most of his time in America living a life typical of many people in Greater Binghamton , records obtained via the federal Freedom of Information Act show .
He held assembly jobs at several local manufacturers .
He married .
He divorced .
He owned guns .
On April 3 , Wong loaded two semi-automatic pistols and drove a borrowed Toyota to the American Civic Association in Binghamton , barging through the front door during a citizenship class and firing 98 shots .
In barely a minute , Wong had ended 13 people 's lives , wounded four other people , and killed himself .
Except for the April 3 letter in which Wong , printing in block capital letters , expresses vague fears about being followed and harassed by police , his motivation remains unclear .
' Really , I was innocent '
Wong was born Linh Phat Voong on Dec. 8 , 1967 , in Saigon , a son of Duong and Mui Thong Voong .
An 80 - page file from the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service shows that he attended Han Duc School in Saigon until 1982 , then worked as a shoemaker into 1990 .
Early that year , he sought a visa to come to the United States .
A doctor 's examination of Voong from 1990 concluded he had no physical or mental disease , defect or disability .
That July , Voong was admitted to the United States as a refugee by INS , now known as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service ( USCIS ) .
He settled in Johnson City , moved to California in 1991 , and returned to JC in December 1992 .
In 1995 , he applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen — and to change his name to Jiverly Anteras Wong .
That raised the first flag .
An unidentified INS employee found Wong 's explanation for his time in a Los Angeles - area jail " gives only his side of the story , which is sketchy . "
At issue was Wong 's explanation for his 1992 arrest in Huntington Park , Calif .
A felony forgery charge , records show , led to a misdemeanor conviction for passing a fictitious check .
A note in the file shows that Wong was sentenced to 100 days in jail and three years ' probation .
He was freed after about a month .
" They kept me back to the jail for 30 days to investigate the real criminal , " Wong wrote as part of his application for naturalization , under the section that requires applicants to explain arrests and convictions .
In printed block capitals , he described cashing " an empty check " received from an unnamed man as payment for a " necklace , " followed by a trial in which jurors voted 8 - 4 in favor of a guilty verdict .
" Really , " he wrote , " I was innocent . "
It 's unclear what immigration officials did in response to the employee 's concern .
They granted him citizenship — and a name change .
Nor can officials explain another discrepancy on Wong 's application .
On a form labeled " Refugee , " Voong was asked to print his name .
" Athi Von " is printed in capital letters . "
" Our initial research finds no ' Athi Von ' in our records , " said Bill Wright , spokesman at the Department of Homeland Security .
DHS oversees USCIS .
In a ceremony at the Broome County Courthouse on Nov. 17 , 1995 , Jiverly Wong became an American citizen .
' His name is Linh Voong ' Less than a year later , Wong decided he needed a permit to carry a pistol .
He filed a two - page permit application June 26 with the Broome County Sheriff 's Office , listing names and addresses for four character references and answering " no " to questions about mental illness , drug and alcohol abuse , and dishonorable work and military discharges .
He claimed he worked at IBM in Endicott ( IBM says it has never employed him ) .
Details on the application are sketchy , but one item stood out enough that another police agency raised questions about it years later .
In one of six reference letters to the sheriff in response to Wong 's application , the writer declares , " I do not want he hold a pistol . "
In the letter , the person writes , " Jiverly , he is my son , " and " his former name is LINH VOONG . "
The letter , signed " Henry Voong , " does not say why Henry Voong thought his son should n't have a gun .
The letter was obtained from the USCIS via a Freedom of Information request .
Voong and his wife , who moved to the Tier after leaving Vietnam in 1990 , have not spoken with Binghamton media .
An interview last week in The Post - Standard of Syracuse quoted Henry Voong , 66 , apologizing to the community for the shootings , and saying he feared for his son's sanity back in 1990 after Wong told him " they 're in front of me and trying to capture me . "
He said he never saw his son with a handgun , never knew he owned one , and never heard him discuss visiting a gun range .
Broome Sheriff David Harder , who in 1996 worked in the section of the department that processed pistol permits , told the Press & Sun-Bulletin on Thursday that he called California regarding Wong 's application and found nothing negative .
Items like felony convictions disqualify permit applicants .
The application was signed by then - Undersheriff David Chase , then forwarded to County Judge Patrick H. Mathews without an indication of whether Chase recommended approval or rejection .
Mathews , now retired , granted the permit in June 1997 .
Five other letters of reference are in the file .
The letters — four from people with Johnson City mailing addresses — say Wong was a " responsible person , " a " good working partner and team member , " and in one case , " he 's good . "
USCIS blocked out the writers ' names .
There is an indication that the sheriff 's department had a concern about the application , because it appears that extra letters of reference were requested .
Three of the letters are dated August 1996 ; Henry Voong 's is dated that October .
Two others are dated April 1997 — almost 10 months after Wong first applied .
Harder on Friday refused to discuss
Wong 's file , saying his department promises to keep permit applications confidential ( by law , applicants ' names and addresses are public information ) .
Nor would he discuss the letter from Wong 's father .
Said Harder : " Who can trust the Department of Homeland Security now ?
Our position is we 're not going to discuss this . "
He said his department gave Wong 's file to the FBI on Thursday .
Broome 's current regulations say references from relatives wo n't be accepted .
Harder could n't say if that was the rule when Wong sought a permit .
Bank robbery suspect
In 1998 , the letter from Wong 's father got the attention of New York State Police .
" We had a confidential informant who claimed Wong was involved in a bank robbery in December 1992 , " said Lt. Glenn Miner , director of public information for the state police .
Media reports show that a masked man with a pistol walked into the County National Bank in Lenox , Pa. , at midday .
The man , described as being 5 - feet - 7 —
Wong 's height — left moments later with a wad of cash .
State police records , obtained via FOI , peg the amount at $ 9,855 .
As state police investigated , they obtained Wong 's pistol - permit file , including the letter from his father .
Troopers thought enough of the information that they assembled a file of photos of Wong " to aid in any further investigations . "
They also checked his history of gun ownership , and found he had sold two handguns — a Beretta and a Sig Sauer — to a West Corners firearms dealer late in 1997 .
The dealer , Harry McLain , said he'd forgotten about the transaction until he saw Wong 's picture after the shootings .
Wong , he said , was difficult to understand , but did nothing to draw extra attention in visits to McLain 's shop .
" It was quite a ways back , " McLain said .
" He just acted like a regular Joe . "
Because the robbery was a Pennsylvania case , Miner said , " we turned that information over to the FBI . "
Wong was never charged .

Space Station Crew Lands in Soyuz after Successful Mission
HOUSTON --
Two members of the 18th crew to live and work aboard the International Space Station and a spaceflight participant returned to Earth at 2:16 a.m. CDT Wednesday .
NASA astronaut Mike Fincke , Russian cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov and spaceflight participant Charles Simonyi safely landed their Soyuz spacecraft in the steppes of southern Kazakhstan .
The Expedition 18 crew members undocked their Soyuz from the station at 10:55 p.m. April 7 .
The deorbit burn to slow the Soyuz and begin its descent toward Earth began at 1:24 a.m. April 8 .
The landing was moved to a more southerly landing site because of poor landing conditions at the original site .
Fincke commanded the Expedition 18 mission , which saw the station go to full power and begin water supply recycling .
He spent 178 days in orbit on this flight and has accumulated a full year in space during his career .
Launching to the station on Oct. 12 , 2008 , he also became the first American to fly to and from the space station twice aboard a Russian Soyuz .
Fincke served almost 188 days as a flight engineer on the Expedition 9 crew , which launched April 18 , 2004 , and returned to Earth on Oct. 23 , 2004 .
Lonchakov completed his first long - duration spaceflight .
He spent nearly 12 days aboard the space shuttle Endeavour in 2001 .
He spent nearly 11 days in space in 2002 , launching aboard one Soyuz craft and landing in another while carrying different crews to the space station and back .
With this mission , he has accumulated a total of more than 200 days in space .
Simonyi , an American , spent 11 days on the station under a commercial agreement with the Russian Federal Space Agency .
He is the only spaceflight participant to visit the station twice .
The Expedition 18 crew worked with a variety of experiments , including human life sciences , physical sciences and Earth observation .
Many of the experiments are designed to gather information about the effects of long - duration spaceflight on the human body , which will help with planning future missions to the moon and beyond .
Other experiments involved practical solutions to extended mission challenges such as repairing electrical components and fighting fire in microgravity .
Before undocking , Fincke and Lonchakov bid farewell to the new station crew , Expedition 19 Commander Gennady Padalka and Flight Engineer Mike Barratt , who launched to the station on a Soyuz March 26 .
Remaining on the station with Padalka and Barratt as an Expedition 19 crew member is Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata .
Wakata launched to the orbiting laboratory on space shuttle Discovery 's STS - 119 mission on March 15 .
The Expedition 19 crew will be joined in orbit by Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko , European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Robert Thirsk in May , inaugurating the station 's first six - person crew .
It also will be the first time that crew members from all five International Space Station partners will be living aboard at the same time .

" Spiritual but not religious " is an increasingly popular way to describe one 's religious views .
What does it mean to be spiritual but not religious ?
Everyone seems to define the term differently .
I do know that if you tell me you 're spiritual I feel like I know more about you , even if I have a hard time pinpointing exactly what new knowledge I tote .
I would probably peg you a person unusually self - analytical , interested in inner peace , health - conscious , and someone who thinks more than usual about emotions and relationships .
But that 's a pretty random list of characteristics , and that 's part of the problem .
Another common definition : Spirituality is about reverence for nature .
Spiritual people display a certain wonderment at the majesty of everything around us .
This was the consensus in a recent roundtable discussion on religion that I facilitated .
This amusing page of atheist motivational posters contains one emphasizing secular awe at natural beauty .
Me ?
I 'm not affiliated with an organized religion and I do not believe in a higher power .
I do not evangelize my atheism and am uncertain about the correctness of my view .
Am I spiritual ?
By the above definitions , yes .
But I am reluctant to self - identify as spiritual .
For one , many people I know who wear this label and wear it proud are fuzzy thinkers and too enthusiastic about new - age texts .
Second , I am suspicious that people who check the " spiritual but not religious " box are taking advantage of semantic ambiguity to absolve themselves of actually forming a belief about God .
Utilizing ambiguity in this way is similar to people who casually call themselves agnostic .
Historically , agnosticism has meant that you believe that you cannot know whether or not there 's a God ( this is different than saying " I do n't know " ) .
Modern agnostics tend to be all over the place .
" I do n't know , I do n't care " is the most common translation I discover when I probe .
I also encounter many " agnostics " who are really atheists but do n't want to say they are or do not understand that the absence of a positive belief in God is atheism .
In any event , I have no problem if someone 's stance is , " I 'm not sure where I stand on the God / religion question . "
For that matter , I respect any stance – believer or non-believer or confused .
But a clear , understandable stance on religion is what I respect most , and I do n't think " spiritual " counts as one .
And as a supplementary label , absent additional explanation , it can be interpreted in too many ways to be useful .
One friend offered perhaps the cleverest answer to whether he is a spiritual man : " Other people consider me spiritual . "
Ha !
He gets all the associative benefits with being spiritual , whatever those might be , and yet since he does n't think of himself in this way he is relieved of the fuzziness charges .
Bottom Line : " Spiritual but not religious " is in vogue but fraught with ambiguity .
( thanks to DaveJ for helping explain the agnostic point and the absence of positive belief = atheism point . )

The reform of the Rockefeller Drug Laws proposed during the NY State budget negotiations is a welcome sign in the abolition of these exceedingly unjust laws , but does not go far enough , according to the New York State Green Party , whose 1998 gubernatorial candidate “ Grandpa ” Al Lewis was instrumental in helping publicize the Drop the Rock coalition in its early days .
The party notes that although the proposed bill restores much judicial discretion in sentencing of drug - related offenses and displays a preference for treatment , it still ignores a good portion of the 12000 nonviolent drug offenders in New York prisons .
It also does nothing to recognize that the so - called “ War on Drugs ” is a failed prohibitionist policy , and that the sensible option is to legalize , tax , and regulate drugs just like alcohol .
“ The New York State legislature has a chance to chart a radically new course in U.S. drug policy , which would mean ending the war on drugs and legalizing them , and releasing all non-violent drug offenders in custody .
This is recognized by the Green Party and groups as diverse as NORML and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) .
Instead it has decided to propose changes in sentencing procedures , which will do nothing to end the phony ‘ war . ’
This is an example of the Legislature and Governor Paterson patting themselves on the back for policies that are still badly misguided , ” said Gloria Mattera , secretary of the New York State Green Party .
“ The proposals for which our legislators are lauding themselves would still oblige judges to impose jail terms on broad categories of non-violent offenders without any option of diverting them to treatment instead .
Although estimates by the Correctional Association of NY show that up to 55 % of current non-violent drug offenders might have been spared jail time with the reforms , that leaves at least 45 % who would still be sent to prison .
The Legislature and the Governor can do better than this , ” said Alice Green , executive director of the Center for Law and Justice in Albany , NY .
“ The ‘ war on drugs ’ disproportionately affects people of color .
It ’s a fair assessment to say that the Rockefeller Drug Laws – all drug laws – are laws that contribute to the racism still endemic in our society .
Black men are incarcerated at rates 6 times higher than whites , and Latino men 2 times higher than whites .
Drug laws and enforcement targeting minority neighborhoods have led to this situation , and it ’s far past time to end it . ”
“ Additionally , in this time of fiscal crisis , New York could use the tax revenue that legalized and state - regulated drugs would bring .
Why are n’t the Democrats in the Legislature bringing up a bill like California Legislator Tony Ammiano ’s , which would legalize and tax marijuana sales ?
Not only would legalization help alleviate New York ’s fiscal crisis , but ending arrests of nonviolent offenders and releasing those already imprisoned would be a blow at the phony moralism of the ‘ War on Drugs . ’
In a year where the governor proposed a tax on non-diet sodas and the Bottle Bill is set to pass , why not help New Yorkers shoulder the fiscal crisis by measures which simultaneously unburden them of unjust laws ? ” said David Doonan , the mayor of Greenwich , NY .

A few days ago , when I read that bank lending had dropped 2.2 % in February , I did n’t think too much of it .
In fact , it did n’t really sound all that bad .
Given that we ’re in the middle of a serious recession , a decrease of 2.2 % seemed like it might be reasonable even if there were no bank crisis at all .
But I was n’t reading closely enough .
First : this is not a year - on - year decline .
It ’s a one - month decline , which annualizes to about 30 % .
Second : that number is a median .
Total lending decreased 4.7 % .
Third , it ’s an average , and some banks cut back a lot more than others .
The Wall Street Journal reports :
According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Treasury Department data , the biggest recipients of taxpayer aid made or refinanced 23 % less in new loans in February , the latest available data , than in October , the month the Treasury kicked off the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
….
In February , nearly half of lending by the 21 banks was to consumers , up from about one - quarter in October .
But excluding mortgage refinancings , consumer lending dropped by about one - third between October and February .
Commercial lending slumped by about 40 % over that period , the data indicates .
That ’s a big drop , even for the middle of a recession .
What ’s more , as the Journal ’s chart shows , some of the biggest drops came from Citigroup and JPMorgan , both recipients of big TARP bailouts .
Even with all that TARP money , they ’re apparently not capitalized well enough to keep lending at a healthy level — which means that far from being able to pay back their TARP dough , they might very well need even more .
Pat Garofalo at the Wonk Room :
( CNN ) --
Your husband , an avid gamer and techie , dies of a heart attack , leaving his vast online life ­-- one you do n't know much about ­-- in limbo .
Eternal Space lets loved ones create customized online gravesites and memorial pages .
His accounts , to which you do n't know the passwords , go idle .
His e-mails go unanswered , his online multiplayer games go on without him and bidders on his eBay items do n't know why they can't get an answer from the seller .
Web site domains that he has purchased , some of which are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , ­ will expire , and you may never know .
It 's a scenario that 's becoming more likely as we spend more of our lives online .
And it 's raising more questions about what happens to our online lives after we log off for the final time .
The answer , until recently , was nothing .
But now , as online usage increases and social - media sites soar in popularity , more companies are popping up to try and fill that void created in your digital life after death .
Jeremy Toeman , founder of the site Legacy Locker , recognized that when he was on a plane and wondered what would happen to his online life if it crashed .
While his will leaves everything to his wife , including all of his digital assets , Toeman realized how difficult it would be for her to access his accounts .
" My GoDaddy account would belong to her , but it does n't solve the practical reality of how she would get access to it , " he said .
He experienced a similar scenario after his grandmother died , and he tried to get the password for her e-mail account -- only to give up because of the hassle .
So Toeman built his company to change all that .
Legacy Locker allows users to set up a kind of online will , with beneficiaries that would receive the customer 's account information and passwords after they die .
" We know it 's a hard thing to think about -- to get people to face mortality .
We know it 's kind of morbid , but for those who live their entire lives online , it 's also very real . "
A Legacy Locker account costs $ 29.99 a year .
Users can set up their accounts at www.legacylocker.com to specify who gets access to their posthumous online information , along with " legacy letters , " or messages , that can be sent to loved ones .
If someone contacts Legacy Locker to report a client 's death , the service will send the customer four e-mails in 48 hours .
If there 's no response , Legacy Locker will then contact the people the client listed as verifiers in the event of his or her death .
Even then , the service would not release digital assets without examining a copy of the customer 's death certificate , Toeman said .
Eddie Lopez is the kind of tech - savvy guy for which a service such as Legacy Locker was made .
The St. Paul , Minnesota , man has three online banking accounts , a PayPal account , domain names , Web - hosting accounts , multiple e-mail addresses and many social - networking accounts .
" I do think this is something people should be really considering these days , " Lopez told CNN when asked about services such as Legacy Locker .
He wants to hire a service to handle his digital assets but is concerned about privacy .
" Although I 'm glad there 's people breaking ground in this area , I do n't think I would jump at the first opportunity to sign up , " Lopez said .
" My concerns are turning over such an exhaustive list of user names and passwords to a single business .
That 's one - stop shopping for any hacker to get access to just about every detail of my life . "
Lopez would prefer to entrust half of his digital - security information to a service such as Legacy Locker and the other half to family members , so that each side 's information would be useless without the other's .
" I hope Legacy Locker and similar services can address these privacy - security concerns with some real - world solutions , " he said .
" I just do n't feel comfortable turning over my digital life -- built over 15 years -- to a kind promise . "
Legacy Locker is n't the only new company helping techies plan for death in the digital age .
AssetLock ( formerly YouDeparted.com ) offers a " secure safe deposit box " for digital copies of documents , wishes , letters and e-mails .
Deathswitch and Slightly Morbid also offer similar services in a variety of prices and packages , depending on how many accounts are involved .
Not all of these services deal with online assets .
There 's also a growing trend towards giving all aspects of death --­ the grieving process , the funeral , the memorial and even the grave site --­ a digital makeover .
FindaGrave.com claims to have cemetery records for 32 million people in its searchable database , while EternalSpace.com offers a new spin on the traditional grave site by offering virtual memorial pages ­full of videos , pictures and tributes .
On Eternal Space , loved ones can choose from different headstones and bucolic landscape backgrounds -- the mountain lake is a popular option -- to create a customized online grave site .
Loved ones can add " tribute gifts " such as roses , candles , stuffed animals and other items , while mourners can access photos and videos in a " Memory Book " and leave remembrances of their own .
Jay Goss , president of Eternal Space president , is trying to bring the funeral experience to anyone who can access the Web .
In that way , he hopes to provide a gathering place , and a voice , for mourners who may not be able to attend the real - life memorial service .
" It 'd be the equivalent of a funeral where everyone can attend and everyone can spend 30 minutes behind the podium , " Goss said .
" It gives everyone a chance to put a 360 - degree wrapper on the life the person lived and celebrate that life from how every person knew them . "
Eternal Space 's virtual memorial sites are currently only being offered through select funeral homes , cemeteries and crematoriums .
Goss ' hope is that the site will help allow the deceased 's memory to be " eternally " passed on .
" All of these stories and videos are being left , in essence , to this Eternal Space Web site so that everyone can share , not just that day , not the days after , but the weeks after and years after , " he said .
Some funeral - industry professionals believe these online memorials and virtual grave sites provide a valuable service .
" Assuming the site is handled with respect , virtual memorials respond to a basic human need to remember our deceased family , friends and colleagues , " said Robert M. Fells , general counsel for the International Cemetery , Cremation and Funeral Association .
" Based on our members ' feedback , I 'd have to say that virtual memorial sites are gaining popularity with the public as a very practical alternative to being present at the grave site , " he added .
" There 's nothing ' weird ' about them as far as we have seen . "
" There are funeral homes out there that will help families create virtual memorials , but ... we 've also seen Facebook and MySpace profiles of deceased persons being turned into memorials , " agreed Jessica Koth , spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association .
" Consumers have become increasingly comfortable with expressing their grief online . "
" While not a replacement for a funeral , online memorialization can help people work through their grief after the funeral , " she added .
" We 've all become accustomed to communicating and expressing ourselves electronically -- via e-mail , Facebook , Twitter .
Expressing one 's grief online is an outgrowth of what 's happening in other areas of our lives . "

Opinion New research from NASA suggests that the Arctic warming trend seen in recent decades has indeed resulted from human activities : but not , as is widely assumed at present , those leading to carbon dioxide emissions .
Rather , Arctic warming has been caused in large part by laws introduced to improve air quality and fight acid rain .
Dr Drew Shindell of NASA 's Goddard Institute of Space Studies has led a new study which indicates that much of the general upward trend in temperatures since the 1970s - particularly in the Arctic - may have resulted from changes in levels of solid " aerosol " particles in the atmosphere , rather than elevated CO 2 .
Arctic temperatures are of particular concern to those worried about the effects of global warming , as a melting of the ice cap could lead to disastrous rises in sea level - of a sort which might burst the Thames Barrier and flood London , for instance .
Acid rain fixed , woo !
Hey , what 's that gurgling sound ?
Shindell 's research indicates that , ironically , much of the rise in polar temperature seen over the last few decades may have resulted from US and European restrictions on sulphur emissions .
According to NASA :
Sulfates , which come primarily from the burning of coal and oil , scatter incoming solar radiation and have a net cooling effect on climate .
Over the past three decades , the United States and European countries have passed a series of laws that have reduced sulfate emissions by 50 percent .
While improving air quality and aiding public health , the result has been less atmospheric cooling from sulfates .
Meanwhile , levels of black - carbon aerosols ( soot , in other words ) have been rising , largely driven by greater industrialisation in Asia .
Soot , rather than reflecting heat as sulphates do , traps solar energy in the atmosphere and warms things up .
The Arctic is especially subject to aerosol effects , says Shindell , because the planet 's main industrialised areas are all in the northern hemisphere and because there 's not much precipitation to wash the air clean .
" Right now , in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and in the Arctic , the impact of aerosols is just as strong as that of the greenhouse gases , " says Shindell .

Course Summary
Synthetic Biology is an emerging technology that hopes to further develop biology as a substrate for engineering by adapting concepts developed in other fields of engineering .
Foundational tools to meet this challenge include : ready access to off - the - shelf standardized biological parts and devices ; a reliable and defined cellular chassis in which engineers can assemble and power DNA programs ; and computational tools as well as measurement standards that enable the ready integration of simpler devices into many - component functional systems .
By applying these engineering foundations to the richness and versatility of biology , some of the worlds most significant challenges can be addressed .
For example advanced genome , protein and pathway redesign , metabolic engineering and cell - programmed therapeutics have already benefited from the tools of synthetic biology , and these developments will serve as the point of departure for many of the foundational topics .
As synthetic biology matures into a robust engineering discipline , it should be capable of transforming the biotechnology , pharmaceutical , and chemical industries as well as suppliers of biotechnology tools , reagents , and services .
This summer course offers an unprecedented opportunity to learn about this emerging field from its leaders as well as engage in hands - on computational and laboratory work using the latest tools and techniques .

Tony Hoare , Inventor of QuickSort , Turing Award Winner Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare ( Tony Hoare or C.A.R. Hoare , born January 11 , 1934 ) is a British computer scientist , probably best known for the development in 1960 of Quicksort ( or Hoaresort ) , one of the world 's most widely used sorting algorithms .
He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness , and the formal language Communicating Sequential Processes ( CSP ) used to specify the interactions of concurrent processes ( including the Dining philosophers problem ) and the inspiration for the Occam programming language .
Presentation : " Opening Keynote : The Science of Computing and the Engineering of Software " Time : Wednesday 09:00 - 10:00 Location : Fleming Room Abstract : Tony Hoare has devoted his academic research life ( 1968 - 1999 ) to the purer aspects of the science of computer programming .
Then he moved to Microsoft research , and has seen some of his scientific discoveries transferred into software engineering tools , and used routinely in programming practice .
He will speculate on the prospects of division of labour between academic research and industrial developments , leading to further progress of the science of computing and its exploitation in engineering practice .
Presentation : " Null References : The Billion Dollar Mistake " Track : Historically bad ideas Time : Friday 13:00 - 14:00 Location : Abbey Room Abstract : I call it my billion - dollar mistake .
It was the invention of the null reference in 1965 .
At that time , I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language ( ALGOL W ) .
My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe , with checking performed automatically by the compiler .
But I could n't resist the temptation to put in a null reference , simply because it was so easy to implement .
This has led to innumerable errors , vulnerabilities , and system crashes , which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years .
In recent years , a number of program analysers like PREfix and PREfast in Microsoft have been used to check references , and give warnings if there is a risk they may be non-null .
More recent programming languages like Spec# have introduced declarations for non-null references .
This is the solution , which I rejected in 1965 .
Presentation : " Parallel computing " Track : Interview Track ( Friday ) Time : Friday 14:15 - 15:15 Location : Fleet Room Abstract : Sadek Drobi interviewing Tony Hoare
A couple good things have come out of the recession , when you stop and think about it .
Some of the high end restaurants trimmed their prices , for one thing .
Prix
Fixe menus have become the rage .
Places like Blue Collar Bar and Kent Rathbun 's new place celebrate the depression era ' blue plate special '-- essentially a pre-McDonald 's value meal .
And several of the snootier venues now welcome a jeans and t- shirt crowd .
Even before talk radio traced our economic collapse back to Obama ( and coincidentally uncovered a plot to turn us into socialists , like those freedom - hating Canadians ) , an ugly trend emerged -- one that a financial crisis only seems to encourage .
That 's right , I 'm talking about sliders .
Nothing against miniature sandwiches , mind you .
It 's just that the word has no place on an upscale restaurant menu ... unless , of course , you prefer to associate fine dining and the sudden , rapid functioning of the bowels .
You see , most people who look into such things claim " sliders " began as a derisive term for those greasy little White Castle burgers -- as in , " slides right in , slides right out . "
Another insulting name attached to the chain , " porcelain palace " alludes to the same internal function .
Those given to cringing over public discussion of diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems blocked the concluding phrase from their minds and focused on the " slides right in " part .
A little better -- although for high end kitchens the thought of cooking hunks of meat so small and oily guests can swallow them whole , the improvement is only marginal .
Now the folks at White Castle were a smart bunch .
In order to defuse the situation , they adopted the nasty bit of slang , renaming the mini-burgers " slyders " ( using a ' y ' for trademark purposes ) .
Eventually the name - slinging fizzled and people began to accept the term .
Guess Americans were no less gullible to marketing then .
Still , it seems odd that the better restaurants hasten , these days , to celebrate any of this by placing ' sliders ' on their menus .
Part of this has to do with the continuing ' small plates ' trend .
The economy makes lower - priced items more appealing , as well .
But I 'm concerned with the mental image .
I mean , should Nana come out with roasted pheasant gut bombs ?
Should we exchange fart jokes with our waitress at Aurora ?
Maybe establishments should rename their meat - carving areas " constipation stations . "
Why not ?
Once we 've embraced sliders , there 's no reason to hold back .
Just to reiterate : Nothing wrong with a menu including mini gourmet sandwiches .
Just maybe drop the gastrointestinal angle .
Technology.am ( Apr. 11 , 2009 ) — Another feature of the Conficker worm have been detected by researchers giving an extra clue about the intention of the creators –the worm installs malware that masquerades as antivirus software , Trend Micro said on Friday .
The worm is downloading a program called Spyware Protect 2009 and displaying warning messages saying that the computer is infected and offering to clean it up for $ 49.95 , according to the Trend Micro blog .
The fake antivirus program also attempts to install a Trojan downloader that is programmed to download new versions of Spyware Protect 2009 , according to Kasperky Lab ’s blog .
However , the domain the Trojan downloader was being accessed from has been shut down , the blog said .
The fake antivirus feature further bolsters the speculation that the motivation behind the worm is to make money and not a desire to disrupt computer or network operations .
Researchers were still analyzing new component code of the worm that began being spread via peer - to - peer and being downloaded off domains that host the Waledec worm on Wednesday but were finding the task difficult because the instructions are encrypted .
Nearly 60 percent of the infections monitored by IBM ISS are in Asia , followed by 18 percent each in Europe and South America , and 4 percent in North America , the statistics show .
By country , China leads with 16.6 percent , followed by Brazil at 10.8 percent , Russia at 10.2 percent and Korea at 4.6 percent , according to ISS .
American snipers are already center - of - the - bullseye accurate - just look at the three shots that ended the Somali pirate standoff in the Indian Ocean .
But tomorrow 's sharpshooters could be even sharper still , if a slew of Pentagon research projects work out as planned .
Already , we 've seen Navy SEAL shooters take out three pirates with three trigger - pulls – despite uneven seas and bobbing ships .
Imagine how much easier the snipers ' jobs would have been , if they had rounds that could change course in mid-air , to account for crosswinds , air density , and moving targets .
Darpa , the Defense Department 's way - out research arm , launched a $ 22 million effort in November to do just that .
By countering these " fundamental limitation [s ] of accuracy , " Darpa thinks it can dramatically improve American snipers ' range – and " provide a dramatic new capability to the
U.S. military . "
And if this EXACTO ( " EXtreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance " ) project does n't work out , Darpa has other guided - bullet programs – like a $ 7.5 million effort to use lasers to steer rounds to their targets .
Laser guidance systems are what made the some of the early " smart bombs " so much more accurate than their predecessors ; it changed how war was waged from the sky .
" Smart bullets " could eventually make a similar impact , perhaps .
The agency is also working on ways to radically upgrade snipers ' scopes and spotting gear .
Researchers in the " One Shot " program are trying to build an optical system that 'll compensate for hiccups in the local atmosphere .
By using thousands of laser pulses , agency - funded investigators are hoping to create a profile of the
" eddies " in the air , as the light bounces back .
The scope , through a series of algorithms , can take those eddies into account , as the sniper team aims .
Darpa hopes the new scope will give snipers lethal precision at a range of up to 2000 meters , in winds up to 40
miles per hour .
If it happens , Defense Department researchers say , it 'll boost a sniper 's kill - rate by ten - fold , or more , and let snipers " engage and pull the trigger " in " less than one second . "
A companion project , Super - Resolution Vision System ( SRVS ) , would n't just make snipers more accurate .
It would make them functionally invisible , as well .
The system is trying to use " heat haze " – that shimmer you see on summer days , out in the distance – for helping snipers , instead of inhibiting them .
In any given instant , the heated air acts as a series of lenses ; you may be able to look right through them and see a magnified view of the scene beyond .
The trick is to use digital technology to identify the " lucky regions " or " lucky frames " when a clear view appears and assemble them into a complete picture .
SRVS researchers are aiming to do just that .
If scope works out , it 'll be a particular spooky tool .
Even if the target is looking right at you , they wo n’t see a thing because of the heat haze .
A sniper using one of these will be a truly invisible assassin , with the ideal technology for picking off high - value targets .
The prototype is supposed to be ready this year .
Finished units could be delivered to Special Operations units as early as 2011 .
As if pirates did n't have enough to worry about .

IN 1974 Tehching Hsieh , a young Taiwanese performance artist working as a seaman , walked down the gangplank of an oil tanker docked in the Delaware River and slipped into the United States .
His destination : Manhattan , center of the art world .
Once there , though , Mr. Hsieh found himself ensnared in the benumbing life of an illegal immigrant .
With the downtown art scene vibrating around him , he eked out a living at Chinese restaurants and construction jobs , feeling alien , alienated and creatively barren until it came to him :
He could turn his isolation into art .
Inside an unfinished loft , he could build himself a beautiful cage , shave his head , stencil his name onto a uniform and lock himself away for a year .
Thirty years later Mr. Hsieh ’s “ Cage Piece ” is on display at the Museum of Modern Art as the inaugural installation in a series on performance art .
But formal recognition of Mr. Hsieh ( pronounced shay ) , who is now a 58 - year - old American citizen with spiky salt - and - pepper hair , has been a long time coming .
For decades he was almost an urban legend , his harrowing performances  the year he punched a time clock hourly , the year he lived on the streets , the year he spent tethered by a rope to a female artist  kept alive by talk .
That ’s right !
Ana Ivanovic is so hot that she deserves all the space in this volume .
She ’s a Serbian hottie who ’s a close friend of her fellow country tennis star , Jelena Jankovic .
Besides her stunning look and body , Ana is also one of the best female tennis players on the planet , who was ranked as high as number one in 2008 .
Because of this reason ( a uber hot girl who can actually play tennis ) , she ’s often compared to Maria Sharapova .
If my dying wish allows me to pick only one of the two , it ’ll definitely be Ana .
Of course , there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with Maria , but there are just too many hot blonde Russian tennis players .
So to me , Ana ’s hotness is truly one of a kind .
To each his own I guess .

Evidently , Andrew Klavan thinks the problem liberals have with Rush Limbaugh is that they do n't actually listen to his shows .
But then , as Media Matters observes , Klavan does n't seem to have listened much to Limbaugh himself .
Still , such stroking is the liquid naphtha that fuels Limbaugh 's ego , so sure enough , he was touting the piece yesterday on his radio show , as Simon Maloy at the Limbaugh Wire recounts .
Not only that , it rocketed him to new heights of rhetorical excess :
Based on what we 've seen with General Motors and the banks , if he fails , America is saved .
Barack Obama 's policies and their failure is the only hope we 've got to maintain the America of our founding .
That , of course , was just the start .
Greta Van Susteren played some clips on her Fox News show last night :
It 's not what Obama knows .
It 's what you think he knows .
It 's what he makes you think he knows .
He does n't know anything about the automobile business .
He does n't know how to change a tire .
The automobile business needs car guys -- people who love grease , get in there , manufacture these engines and cars , create designs , lines , make people want to go out and buy these cars .
Car companies have to be run by financial people today , because they 're basically health care and retirement funds .
The side business is making cars , hoping they pay for some of it .
And he wrapped it all up with a classic piece of projection :
This is a radical guy .
This is a very arrogant , radical guy , who is angry -- no one will convince me otherwise .
Yeah , I mean , he does n't show it .
Sometimes I think I notice -- I think it flares at some times .
Not the anger , the -- he reveals that he has a bunch of chips on his shoulder .
And we know his wife does , and we know Reverend Wright does .
And we 're getting , you know , a lot of this stuff that 's happening right out of Reverend Wright 's sermons .
Yeah , but it really is .
And a lot of what 's gonna happen in education right out of Bill Ayers ' curriculum .
His extremist terrorist buddy .
So I think we 've got a guy -- I think the best way to understand Obama -- and I can't say this enough -- he really believes it his job to return the nation 's wealth to its rightful -- quote unquote , rightful owners .
And that means he believes the people who have wealth have stolen it , from those who have no wealth .
It 's been unfair achieved and accrued .
And it's his job to take it and redistribute it .
And that 's what he means by sacrifice .
When he talks about sacrifice , he 's talking about raising your taxes , taking your assets , and giving them to other people who he thinks you stole them from , who are thus more deserving .
Sorry , Andrew , but you 're sadly mistaken .
We hear Rush Limbaugh all too much .
Picture this .
Gaudi's breathtaking Barcelona Cathedral , the Sagrada Familia .
Exquisite carvings cover every surface , depicting creatures beyond comprehension .
The baking sun streams through rainbow - hued stained glass , suffusing everything with shimmering colour .
But there 's no Mass being held .
No blessing , priest or sacrament .
There 's some incense burning , but its perfume is the acridity of hallucinogens rather than salvation .
On the floor of the nave , where an altar should stand , is a wrestling ring .
The ropes are spun gold , the mat is woven from Dalis , the turnbuckles are jewel - encrusted gargoyles .
In the centre stands a six - foot mouse - four flapping breasts loosely held by a leather harness - and a horrifying bird - man , munching on the eyes of a violently coloured pheasant .
In the midst of all this beauty and elegance , the two begin to fight .
Screaming , they kick , punch , elbow and knee each other with incredible violence , viciously and unrelentingly .
This is Zeno Clash .
Now that your hyperbole filters are fully engaged , let 's skip back to the basics .
Zeno Clash is a PC only , independently produced first person brawler .
Released on Steam and Direct 2 Drive yesterday , it 's a product of Chilean developer ACE Team .
It 's beautiful , brutal and , in many ways , brilliant .
It 's been on my horizon , dressed in a big , colourful ' watch - me ' hat , for some time now , alternately dancing like a loon and kicking me in the chest .
As anyone who 's been following the game will tell you , it looks incredibly distinctive .
Created using the relatively long - in - the - tooth Source engine , Zeno Clash swerves away from the spectre of visual realism , straight into the oncoming traffic of fever - dream imagery : Hieronymous Bosch , Neil Gaiman and the Muppets which live in David Cronenberg 's head .
Happy hour in the Northern Gate Bar .
Environments are lushly crafted and massively colourful , while enemies range from the queasily quasi- familiar to the outright sexually grotesque .
Ghat 's hermaphroditic ' parent ' FatherMother , a key character , is a ten foot - tall half - chicken with a dirty mac full of babies and shadow .
For every image that disturbs , however , there 's one which takes your breath away with its beauty .
The open vista of the purple desert sky , peppered by planets and the curmudgeonly heads of four storey high giraffe - beasts , plays host to an excellent boss battle , familiar to those who've played the preview .
The town of Halstedom , which you escape from at the start of the game , is a hodge - podge of vibrant architectural styles , Star Wars markets and eerie Gothic towers .
As the storyline takes Ghat on a whistle - stop tour of Zenozoik , environments change rapidly and completely .
Areas rarely bear any resemblance to the preceding or following location .
Vivid , arresting and unconventional , the visual style somehow remains chaotically coherent .
It feels like a place .
A place where your brother is a sociopathic retard macaw .
Gameplay is violent and straightforward .
Make the other ' people ' fall over and bleed .
When they do , kick them violently in the spine so they stay there .
Combat is involving and complex .
An array of punches , kicks , blocks and combos connect with hugely emotive thwacks , squeals and squelches .
It feels violent .
It makes me feel pretty violent .
I 'm easily immersed in games , yet I 'm a pacifist on the whole .
Often I found my jaw clenched with vicarious aggression , a feeling in my hind - brain which I usually associate with too much cider and the wayward form of Gabriel Agbonlahor .
The immediacy is surprising - even given the outlandish nature of the world I found myself drawn in , feeling every blow dealt and taken .
Deadra in repose .
Not sure where her ' horns ' have gone .
The first fight pits you against a few of your siblings : a bipedal parrot , a half - pig and a relatively normal female in a lovely hat .
I started out with some fairly middle - of - the - road beatings .
Quick one - twos to the chops .
A hefty charge punch when the beasts were briefly dazed .
Occasionally I 'd step in and grab their dizzy heads , pistoning a knee into their faces before tossing them from the bridge - based bazaar into the gulch below .
Once , I got subtle and used timed blocks to put them off balance , shifting sideways and countering with haymaking hooks .
However you do it , the chances are that when you 're finished , your heart will be racing and the surly sneer of victory will be creeping across your lip .
Rarely have I experienced a game with so much raw kinetic energy .
Each ' round ' takes place in a small arena , from city back - alleys to metallic wastelands .
Player character
Ghat will turn up and be assaulted by various members of the insane menagerie - sometimes singly , usually in groups .
Occasionally he 'll be assisted by the charming Deadra , a buffalo - hatted chum whose human appearance and willingness to help mark her out as a potential love interest .
Fights begin with a flashed up ' announcement ' of the roster of combatants but reinforcements will often pile in , invariably on the AI 's side , part - way through the scrap .

For those with a little free time this morning , the Institute for Creation Research filed an 80 - page complaint in Dallas federal court at the end of last week claiming that the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has done violated its constitutional rights , including freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of religious exercise .
For starters .
Why come ?
Says the suit , when the THECB -- of which Raymund Paredes , Ph.D. serves as commish -- decided last year not to let the Royal Lane - based joint hand out master 's degrees in science , they " perpetrated viewpoint discrimination and censorship . "
The lawsuit reads kind of like stereo instructions , but here 's one excerpt among many worth a look :
Dramatic evidence that America is involved in illegal mercenary operations in east Africa has emerged in a string of confidential emails seen by The Observer .
The leaked communications between US private military companies suggest the CIA had knowledge of the plans to run covert military operations inside Somalia - against UN rulings - and they hint at involvement of British security firms .
The emails , dated June this year , reveal how US firms have been planning undercover missions in support of President Abdullahi Yusuf 's transitional federal government - founded with UN backing in 2004 - against the Supreme Islamic Courts Council - a radical Muslim militia which took control of Mogadishu , the country 's capital , also in June promising national unity under Sharia law .
Evidence of foreign involvement in the conflict would not only breach the UN arms embargo but could destabilise the entire region .
One email dated Friday , 16 June , is from Michele Ballarin , chief executive of Select Armor - a US military firm based in Virginia .
Ballarin's email was sent to a number of individuals including Chris Farina of the Florida - based military company ATS Worldwide .
Ballarin said : ' Boys : Successful meeting with President Abdullay Yussef [ sic ] and his chief staff personnel in Nairobi , Kenya on Tuesday ... where he invited us to his private hotel suite flacked by security detail ...
He has appointed is chief of presidential protocol as our go to during this phase . '
She refers to one ' closed - door meeting ' with a senior UN figure and mentions there are ' a number of Brit security firms ' also looking to get involved .
Ballarin claimed she has been given ' carte blanche ' to use three bases in Somalia ' and the air access to reach them ' .
She then suggests that the CIA have been kept informed of the plans .
Ballarin states : ' My contact whom we discussed from the agency side requested an in - person meeting with me .
I arrived in New York at 2340 last night and was driven to Virginia - arriving at 0200 today . '
According to the highly respected newsletter , Africa Confidential , which originally published extracts of the emails last week , Select Armor started its operation planning in Kampala , Uganda .
The emails suggest that the Ugandan government were willing to help secure arms supplies for any operation although this is denied by security officials in Kampala .
In one reply to Ballarin , Farina said : ' A forced entry operation [ into Mogadishu ] at this point without the addition of follow - on forces who can capitalise on the momentum / initiative of the initial op will result in a replay of Dien Bien Phu ' .
This is a reference to the defeat of French colonial forces in Indochina in 1953 .
The website of Farina 's company ATS boasts it ' can execute operations in support of host national indigenous forces ' .
ATS claims it uses former US and British special operations personnel .
One email discussing funding of any operation sent from Farina to Ballarin states : ' We may have to re-focus our efforts in the US among the DOS [ State Department ] and DOD [ Defence Department ] to bring any forward movement to this effort . '
The Observer left several messages with both Select and ATS requesting interviews but nobody responded .
Ballarin told Africa Confidential last week that the company 's operations in Somalia were ' classified ' .

" To create something from nothing is one of the greatest feelings , and I would — I do n't know , I wish it upon everybody .
It 's heaven . "

Two groups have filed suit in federal court to block a rule that would allow people to carry loaded , concealed firearms in national parks .
The rule goes into effect today .
The Bush administration in December finalized a rule change to allow people to bring firearms into all national parks , including the Cuyahoga Valley National Park .
Only parks in Wisconsin and Illinois are excluded from the rule .
The new rule overrides a regulation enacted by the Reagan administration that required that firearms be safely stowed and unloaded when transported through national parks .
The suit was filed by the National Parks Conservation Association and the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees .
A similar lawsuit was filed in late December by the Brady Campaign , founded after the 1981 wounding of President Ronald Reagan and his press secretary James Brady during an attempted assassination .
Gun supporters say that the parks are dangerous and that people have a right to defend themselves and their families .
Critics say allowing guns in the parks increases danger to visitors , park staff and wildlife .
Tom Kiernan , president of the National Parks Conservation Association , said the rule is unlawful because the Department of the Interior did not analyze its environmental effects .
The current leadership of the National Park Service and other park management professionals -- including the Association of National Park Rangers and the Ranger Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police -- oppose the rule .
Of the 140,000 people who voiced their opinion on this issue during the public comment period , 73 percent opposed allowing loaded , concealed firearms in the national parks .

( CNN ) -- Woody Allen 's lawsuit against American Apparel for unauthorized use of his image on billboards ended Monday with a $ 5 million settlement to be paid to the actor - director by the clothing company .
Woody Allen received $ 5 million to settle a suit with American Apparel .
Allen said the case should discourage advertisers from using celebrities ' images without permission , but American Apparel 's head said he still thinks his company had a good defense .
The settlement , announced just moments before jury selection was to begin in New York , interrupted a trial that lawyers had hinted could include a parade of witnesses testifying about Allen 's sex scandals .
" Threats and press leaks by American Apparel designed to smear me did not work , and a scheme to call a long list of witnesses who had nothing to do with the case was disallowed by the court , " Allen said .
" I hope this very large settlement will discourage American Apparel and others from doing this type of thing to myself or others in the future . "
Dov Charney , founder and CEO of American Apparel , issued a statement published by London 's Guardian newspaper saying lawyers for his insurance company -- which will pay the money to Allen -- made the decision to settle the case .
" For the record , I personally think we had a good case , " Charney said .
Allen filed his suit , asking for $ 10 million , against American Apparel in March 2008 after the company placed several billboards and online ads using an image of Allen dressed as a Hasidic Jew in his 1977 movie " Annie Hall . "
" I sued American Apparel because they calculatingly took my name , my likeness and image and used them publicly to promote their business , " Allen said Monday .
" Testimony revealed that American Apparel believed that fear of publicity would keep me from ever taking action , and so they put my face on billboards , on the Internet , and my image on their building , " he said .
Charney , who said he finally could talk about the case , said the ad was a " an attempt to at least make a joke about " sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him and his company in recent years .
" Today , two years later , all the claims in the lawsuits have been completely disproven and yet at the time , some writers characterized me as a rapist and abuser of women , others asserted that I was a bad Jew , and some even stated that I was not fit to run my company . "
Charney said it was " ironic that I have to explain this to Woody Allen when he has expressed similar frustrations in the past . "
American Apparel lawyers wanted to call as witnesses Allen 's former companion Mia Farrow and Soon - Yi Previn , Farrow 's adopted daughter and Allen 's wife .
Allen 's relationship with -- and eventual marriage to -- Previn was scandal material for tabloids beginning in 1992 , when she was 21 .
Allen said the company 's lawyers may have been persuaded to settle because the judge made it " clear that the court considered their phony First Amendment ranting and claims of parody , sheer nonsense . "

SET in America 's crumbling industrial heartland , Philipp Meyer 's first novel , “ American Rust ” , is so timely that it makes painful as well as enjoyable reading .
The novel is a paean to the end of empire .
Though his father Henry never told him , Isaac 's boyhood IQ was measured at 167 — genius level .
He is probably smarter than his older sister , who escaped her withering rural roots for Yale .
Yet at 20 Isaac is still trapped in the small town of Buell , Pennsylvania , taking care of his father .
Henry was disabled by an accident in one of the valley 's poorly maintained steel mills , nearly all now closed ; indeed , some of the only remaining work in Buell is tearing down these redundant structures .
After stealing $ 4,000 from his father , Isaac plans to make his own life at last in California .
On the eve of his departure , Isaac gets together with his best friend Billy Poe , a former high - school football star who has also failed to heed the edict that at 18 you should flee the rust belt altogether .
Sheltering from a rainstorm in an abandoned factory , the boys encounter a trio of tramps .
In a fateful confrontation , Isaac kills one of the vagrants to save his friend .
Unaware that Poe will end up taking the rap for the murder , Isaac hightails it by rail .
Meanwhile ,
Poe samples another of America 's decrepit institutions : its prison system .
Mr Meyer 's voice is assured , and the story crackles with narrative tension .
He develops his characters with impressive psychological and sociological insight , observing astutely that “ there was something particularly American ” about “ blaming yourself for bad luck — that resistance to seeing your life as affected by social forces , a tendency to attribute larger problems to individual behaviour . ”
Meyer himself sees these larger forces all too clearly , and it is his portrayal of America 's devastated industrial base that is likely to get this novel much attention : “ You could not have a country , not this big , that did n't make things for itself .
There would be ramifications eventually . ”
The author delineates the inexorable welfare dependency , petty crime and drug and alcohol abuse that follow when the infrastructure of steady employment implodes .
The picture is grim , but masterfully painted .
We ’ve seen some of the new Captain Kirk ’s fighting sprit in some of the new trailers , and according to his Dossier , the new Kirk is an instructor in hand - to - hand combat .
This all fits with grand Star Trek history , and so with that in mind , TrekMovie has taken a look back at the original Kirk fight moves in a little something we like to call : TrekMovie ’s official guide to Kirk - Fu .
The Kirk Drop Kick
The name pretty much says it all .
Kirk would kick an opponent in the chest with both of his legs .
This may be an effective method of taking someone down , but it would often result in Kirk falling to the ground along with them .
The Wall of Destruction
Here ’s the scene : The Captain and Andorian delegate Thelev , have resorted to duking it out in the halls of the Enterprise .
But Kirk knows how to use the walls to his advantage , so instead of just attacking the alien head on , he uses the wall as a jumping off point to fling himself in the alien ’s direction – though usually missing and just falling on the floor …
The Human Projectile
Let ’s just say the rejected title for this one was the “ throw - your - body - horizontally - into - a - group - of - opponents ” .
Again , this move results in the captain falling to the ground .
Bowling for Bad Guys
Here ’s an interesting technique we stumbled upon while watching the TOS episode “ The Apple ” .
I think the idea is to knock over your opponent by taking out their legs .
This method used by Kirk is most interesting .
The Smooch n’ Smack
Captain Kirk plays it suave with the ladies in order to catch them off their guard and then smack em ’ across the face .
Good luck getting a second date there Captain Fabio .
The Cold Boulder
Classic moment where Kirk chucks a rock the size of his head at the The Gorn , which really only makes the giant lizard mad and ends up with Kirk dodging a boulder twice his size .
Good thing the Captain is also a skilled geologist to get himself out of this one …
Captain Kirk — YOU ROCK !
The Kirk Chop
Is there any dangerous situation that a 1960 ’s style karate chop ca n’t solve ?
One chop to the back of the neck … or side of the neck … or the general shoulder region … produces instant unconsciousness , but only in henchmen .
While this was one of Kirk ’s favorites , it was also a move utilized by much of the Enterprise crew .
Here Bones ’ shows that he has learned much from Sensei Kirk .
Fighting Advice from The Shat
Several months ago , William Shatner talked on his vlog about how to perform his signature drop kick .
Check out the video below .

Here ’s a great video we snagged off of YouTube ; it ’s a nice compilation of some of our favorite fight scenes .
Star Trek 09 “ Fighting Trailer ”
In case you missed it , or just want to watch it again ( and , who could blame you ? ) here is a video of the Star Trek TV showing off some new fight moves ( this commercial was shown during WWE and UFC , so it has ‘ fight ’ all over it ) .
ST . POELTEN , Austria ( CNN ) --
A jury in Austria has found Josef Fritzl guilty of raping and imprisoning his daughter for more than two decades and sentenced him to life in prison .
Josef Fritzl arrives for sentencing at the courthouse in St. Poelten on Thursday .
more photos »
It was the maximum sentence for the most serious charge Fritzl faced : one count of murder , for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth .
The eight - member jury returned a unanimous verdict on all counts .
Fritzl , dressed in a gray suit , blue shirt and dark tie , stared blankly ahead and showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict .
The 73 - year - old had pleaded guilty to all charges on Wednesday , but Austrian law requires a jury to return a verdict as well .
Fritzl will soon be moved to a detention facility for mentally abnormal offenders , where psychiatrists will evaluate him and decide on therapy .
Until then , he will remain in a two - person cell in St. Poelten .
The man who kept his crimes a secret for 24 years until he was exposed last year made a final , emotional apology to the court Thursday morning .
Read blog on how Austria was reacting before sentencing
" I am deeply sorry with all my heart for what I have done , but I can not go back and change it , " Fritzl told the court at St. Poelten , about 70 kilometers ( 45 miles ) east of Amstetten , where he and his family lived .
The jury found Fritzl guilty of incest , rape , enslavement and false imprisonment of his daughter Elisabeth .
It also found him guilty of two assault charges and murder in the death of the baby , one of twins , which died 66 hours after birth .
Fritzl initially pleaded not guilty to murder , enslavement , and one of the assault charges , and partly guilty to rape .
He surprised his own lawyer by changing his plea Wednesday .
Prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser urged the jury Thursday to return a murder conviction .
She called Fritzl 's admission of guilt a ploy .
" This was not a confession by the accused .
It was a change in strategy , " she told the court .
Elisabeth Fritzl also wanted her father to be convicted , said her lawyer , Eva Plaz .
Both sides accepted Thursday 's verdict and Josef Fritzl refused the option to appeal , court officials said .
He could be considered for parole in 15 years , when he would be 88 , said court spokesman Franz Cutka , but the Ministry of Justice will decide whether to allow it .
Fritzl 's lawyer revealed Thursday that Elisabeth had been in court Tuesday , the second day of the trial .
Defense attorney Rudolf Mayer said the elder Fritzl noticed his daughter 's presence in the final hour of viewing Elisabeth 's videotaped testimony .
Mayer said he was not disappointed with the verdict because it was a " logical consequence " of his client 's admission of guilt .
He said life in prison is a " very just sentence . "
" In my eyes , no man is a monster , regardless of what he 's done , " Mayer told the BBC .
" He 's always a human , regardless of what he 's done . "
A technical expert testified at the trial that the underground chamber in which Fritzl kept his daughter and their offspring had low ceilings -- about 1.7 meters ( 5.5 feet ) high -- and , for the first couple of years , only minimal sanitation .
The cellar had no daylight or fresh air .
Prosecutors said Fritzl closeted Elisabeth in the specially designed cellar in 1984 , when she was 18 , telling other family members that she had run away to join a cult .
He kept her there for 24 years , authorities believe , repeatedly sexually assaulting her and fathering her seven children .
Fritzl took three of the children upstairs to live with him and his wife , telling the family that the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off .
Elisabeth and the remaining children never saw daylight , prosecutors said , and Fritzl went away for long periods , leaving them without food .
To punish them , prosecutors said , Fritzl sometimes turned off the power in the cellar for up to 10 days .
In addition , they alleged , Elisabeth was often sexually assaulted in front of the children .
One of the babies -- a boy named Michael -- died shortly after birth .
Prosecutors charged Fritzl with murder in his death because he did not receive medical care .
Fritzl admitted Wednesday that he was in the cellar when the baby was born .
He noticed the child was breathing heavily , he said , but he did not think the baby would die and decided not to seek help .
Fritzl told the court he was probably responsible for the child 's death and pleaded guilty to his murder .
He had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charge but said he changed his mind after hearing Elisabeth 's videotaped testimony .
The prosecution said Thursday that Michael struggled for 66 hours before dying of respiratory problems .
They said Fritzl knew what was happening but was indifferent .
Authorities have said that Elisabeth and her children now have new identities and are in a secret location .
Asked at a news conference why other family members have not testified , officials said they did not wish to .
The case came to light in April 2008 , when Elisabeth 's then - 19 - year - old daughter , Kerstin , became seriously ill and ended up in the hospital .
Hospital staff became suspicious and alerted police , who then discovered the family 's plight in the cellar .
CNN 's Diana Magnay and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report .

General Motors product chief and Vice Chairman Bob Lutz in a file photo .
REUTERS / Gregory Shamus
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp ’s product chief and Vice Chairman Bob Lutz will retire at the end of the year , bringing to a close a legendary automotive career that spanned 46 years and included top jobs at all three Detroit automakers .
Lutz , 76 , will transition to a new role effective April 1 , as vice chairman and senior adviser -- providing input into GM ’s global design and key product initiatives -- until his retirement at the end of 2009 , the automaker said on Monday .
Tom Stephens , currently GM ’s executive vice president of global powertrain and quality , will take over product development at GM .
Lutz was widely credited for the success of GM ’s more recent products , including the Chevy Malibu sedan , and was the leading proponent for its all - electric Chevy Volt .
But at the same time , Lutz remained a controversial and outspoken figure , recently telling a group of journalists that global warming was a “ crock of s---. ”
A former U.S. Marine fighter pilot , Lutz began his automotive career in 1963 at GM .
He went on to work for BMW in Europe , served on Ford Motor Co ’s board and spent 12 years at Chrysler before rejoining GM in 2001 .
A consummate showman , Lutz was famed in Detroit for flying his own helicopter and a collection of aircraft , sometimes to corporate events .
Remember how we did n't have to worry about Social Security now because payments from the program would n't exceed revenue for another decade or more ?
Well , the CBO has revised its estimates .
It 's still projecting a tiny surplus for next year - - tiny -- but Chris Martenson thinks those estimates will quickly be revised down :
[ I]t was only last year that I was writing about the impeding fiscal calamity that was awaiting us all in 2017 when the outlays for Social Security were slated to exactly match receipts .
Now that date could be as early as 2010 , apparently .
In the chart above ( source ) , I want you to note the extreme deterioration in surplus funds between the 2008 and 2009 forecasts .
Can you spot the trend ?
Here ’s a prediction – these too will be revised to the worse in about 6 months .
I base this prediction on my belief that more people will opt for retirement than are currently projected and that entitlement program tax receipts will be below current projections .
Also , nearly every prediction by the CBO has been revised to the worse over the past year so I am “ riding the trend ” with this prediction .
In the projections for the table above , the CBO has assumed no cost of living adjustments ( COLAs ) in 2010 , 2011 , or 2012 and a return to economic growth next year .
If either of those assumptions proves wrong , the table above gets smoked to the downside .
I give that a better than 90 % chance of happening .
This , of course , will have implications far beyond the Social Security system .
The Social Security " trust fund , " you 'll recall , is n't a trust fund at all .
It 's just another source of annual government financing and a future liability .
Today 's receipts are used to pay current payments to retirees and , in the case of a surplus , whatever else the government is spending money on .
As the Social Security surplus shrinks , therefore , the government loses a source of funding .
If it wants to keep spending at its planned rate , it therefore has to borrow the difference .
When Social Security goes into deficit , meanwhile , the government will have to borrow even more money to pay current SS recipients .
Chris Martenson :
From a budget - busting perspective , last year where the US government had a $ 73 billion Social Security surplus to spend , this year it will be a paltry $ 16 billion and next year it will be a number indistinguishable from zero .
It is hard to overstate the importance of this shift .
This means several things .
Instead of $ 703 billion coming in over the next 10 years , the current ( overly optimistic ) projection calls for only $ 83 billion .
This means at least another $ 620 billion in fresh borrowing will have to occur .
More importantly , this means that the United States eventual date with bankruptcy has been moved forward by about 8 years or so .
It also means that instead of being some future problem , a few administrations down the road , it is a near certainty that the current administration will have to confront some very difficult funding decisions that will be forced by the inability to borrow enough to pay for everything .
RALEIGH , N.C. --
The goals came in bunches for the Carolina Hurricanes .
So did the records .
The Hurricanes matched a club mark with their ninth straight victory by giving the New York Islanders the worst beating in franchise history , a 9 - 0 rout Tuesday night .
Eric Staal had three goals and an assist , and finished with a club - record fourth hat trick of the season .
Cam Ward made 12 saves in setting the team 's single - season mark with victory No. 39 , and he matched another club mark with his sixth shutout while helping Carolina extend its franchise - record home - ice winning streak to 12 .
" We 're playing the right way .
We 're playing at a high , competitive level , and we 're playing like a well - oiled machine , " Staal said .
" When you 're confident and when you 're doing the right things , you 're going to get good results and nights like tonight . "
Erik Cole assisted on all three of Staal 's goals and finished with four assists , while Tuomo Ruutu had two goals and Scott Walker , Dwight Helminen , Rod Brind ' Amour and Frantisek Kaberle also scored for the Hurricanes .
They led 3 - 0 after one period and 6 - 0 after two and held a 57 - 12 shots advantage -- the widest differential in franchise history -- in keeping pace with Philadelphia in the race for the No. 4 seed in the East .
Both teams have 97 points , but the Flyers , who beat Florida 2 - 1 , have a game in hand .
Yann Danis stopped just seven of 10 shots in the first period before giving way to Joey MacDonald , who made 41 saves but allowed six goals for the Islanders .
Never before had they lost by more than eight goals -- and they had n't done that since losing 8 - 0 at St. Louis in 1988 .
" It was just one of those nights when it seemed nothing was going in the right direction , " Islanders coach Scott Gordon said .
The Islanders finished this one with more than twice as many penalty minutes as shots .
They did n't hit double figures in shots until there were six minutes left .
And by the midpoint of the third period , they had as many shots ( eight ) as Carolina had goals ( eight ) .
" I do n't have any explanation , " Danis said .
Anton Babchuk had four assists and Dennis Seidenberg added three for the Hurricanes .
Carolina continued a push for the No. 4 seed in the East by not overlooking the NHL's worst team three nights after an emotional win over Pittsburgh that clinched a playoff spot .
" This could have been easily a game that we could have taken a night off , and the guys came in and prepared and threw everything at them , " Ward said .
Their nine - game winning streak matched the mark reached twice by the 2005 - 06 team that won the Stanley Cup , and Ward broke the mark for victories set by that season 's starter , Martin Gerber , who won 38 before Ward supplanted him on his way to the Conn Smythe Trophy .
" It 's great , but the most important thing is that we 're playing some good hockey right now , " Ward said .
" We want to be peaking when we go into the playoffs , and now with two games left , it 's important that we bear down and have a similar effort like we did tonight .
But I thought the veteran guys were exceptional to get everybody prepared .
...
We definitely came to the rink ready to play . "
Staal polished off his record hat trick before the second period was over .
He stretched Carolina 's lead to 2 - 0 midway through the first , when he took a feed from Cole , faked a pass from the left circle and shot the puck around defenseman Mark Streit and past Danis .
His backhander past MacDonald made it 4 - 0 early in the second .
Then he completed his eighth career three - goal game at 16:51 of the second , taking a pretty pass from -- who else ? --
Cole and one - timing it by MacDonald for his 39th goal .
" It 's a pretty good glimpse of the chemistry that we have together , " Staal said of his linemate .
He and the Hurricanes certainly did n't waste much time taking the suspense out of this one .
They needed less than three minutes to take a 1 - 0 lead .
Seidenberg pulled in Jack Hillen 's clearing attempt just inside the blue line , and unloaded a shot that clipped Helminen on its way through a crowd in front of the net for his second career goal .
" The first one I really did n't see until the last second , " Danis said .
" The other two [ goals allowed ] , I definitely should have had .
Staal just beat me . "
By then , though , the rout was on -- and it could have been even worse , had Danis not stopped Ray Whitney 's breakaway in the opening minute .
" That game is not much fun from about the 10 - minute mark of the second period on for the coach , because nothing good can happen in that game now , " Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice said .
" We can't play better .
We do n't need to score more .
You 're hoping nobody gets injured . "

Backpacker Britt Lapthorne 's body was immersed in water from the time she went missing in Croatia and her body was weighed down , a Victorian autopsy has found .
While the results of the autopsy have not been officially released , Ms Lapthorne 's parents have revealed details to News Ltd .
Died in Dubrovnik ... Britt Lapthorne .
Ms Lapthorne , 21 , of Melbourne , went missing from a nightclub in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik on September 18 last year .
Her badly decomposed body was found in a nearby bay on October 6 .
A report completed by the Victorian coroner late last year found Ms Lapthorne had been in the sea for the entire time she was missing and that there were marks on her remains from contact with marine life that dwell on the sea floor , News Ltd said .
For technical reasons , blocking simply cannot provide the level of protection that is necessary , and simple morality demands that we take strong collective action to get child pornography removed from the Internet , rather than simply hiding behind national firewalls . "
Malcolm Hutty , president of EuroISPA , told The Register : "
The European Union ( EU ) has issued new proposals that could see all broadband ISPs in the UK and Europe , regardless of size , being legally required to block " . "
Presently 95 % of mainstream UK ISPs have adopted a similar service via the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) .
However this still leaves a core group of 5 % , which is mostly made up of smaller ISPs that have concerns about the viability and cost of implementing such a system , whom have yet to adopt a similar service - much to the annoyance of some charities and government ministers ( Charities Call on Small UK ISPs to Block Child Porn ) .
Certainly it 's true that circumventing such technology is a relatively easy task , although we do n't completely buy EuroISPA 's other line that it would " " .
Preventing the casual ability to access such content is important and while current methods may not be perfect , there are n't a lot of alternatives .
Perhaps the biggest concern is not so much the action proposed above but how such filtering technology could be extended and potentially abused in the future ( Anybody for Wikipedia blocking ? ) .
Elizabeth Warren , the TARP watchdog , has released her six month report card on the state of TARP .
Yep , it 's been six months and we 're still mainly here and in one piece , so take a second to be glad for that .
As was reported a few days ago , Warren 's report calls for the government to administer tough justice to the banks , arguing that there are four keys to the success of any banking system rescue , when looking throughout history .
Transparency
Assertiveness
Accountability
Clarity ( as in , a full explanation of why and what the government 's doing with taxpayer money )
The other key point , which we 're really glad Warren made , is that Tim Geithner 's strategy only works if this is a temporary , liquidity problem , rather than something more profound .
That 's key .
Few others in government are acknowleding that crucial point .
Feeding the water habits of such major cities as Los Angeles , Las Vegas , and Phoenix , in addition to providing irrigation waters for the entire Southwestern United States , has stretched the Colorado River thin .
The river no longer consistently reaches the sea as it once did .
Now a new study warns that the Colorado River system , which has proven dependable for human use throughout the 20th Century , may soon experience shortages due to global warming .
Two climate researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , UC San Diego conclude in a study that if global warming causes the region to become even drier than the Colorado River will be unable to meet current human demand 60 - 90 percent of the time by the middle of the century .

“ All water - use planning is based on the idea that the next 100 years will be like the last 100 , ” said Scripps research marine physicist Tim Barnett , a co-author of the report published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ We considered the question : Can the river deliver water at the levels currently scheduled if the climate changes as we expect it to .
The answer is no . ”
The river would even experience shortfalls under conservative global warming scenarios , coming under current targets by a half - billion cubic meters ( or 400,000 acres feet ) of water per year 40 percent of the time by 2025 .
By the later part of the century , the numbers double .
Currently an acre foot of water is considered enough for the water consumption of two households every year .
“ People have talked for at least 30 years about the Colorado being oversubscribed but no one ever put a date on it or an amount .
That ’s what we ’ve done , ” said Barnett .
“ Without numbers like this , it ’s pretty hard for resource managers to know what to do . ”
According to reconstructions of past climates in the Southwest , the 20th century was actually one of the wettest centuries in the last 1,200 years .
According to tree rings , the Colorado River typically flows lower than it did throughout most of the last century , making current water requirements even more unsustainable down the road .
Conservation and water transfers should make up for the river ’s shortfall during most years , say the authors .
However , during dry years the shortages for the region could be large .
“ Fortunately , we can avoid such big shortfalls if the river ’s users agree on a way to reduce their average water use , ” said co-author David Pierce .
“ If we could do that , the system could stay sustainable further into the future than we estimate currently , even if the climate changes . ”

Revolutionary new theory overturns modern meteorology with claim that forests move rain
( 04/01/2009 ) Two Russian scientists , Victor Gorshkov and Anastassia Makarieva of the St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics , have published a revolutionary theory that turns modern meteorology on its head , positing that forests — and their capacity for condensation — are actually the main driver of winds rather than temperature .
While this model has widespread implications for numerous sciences , none of them are larger than the importance of conserving forests , which are shown to be crucial to ‘ pumping ’ precipitation from one place to another .
The theory explains , among other mysteries , why deforestation around coastal regions tends to lead to drying in the interior .
Secretary of Energy warns of dire future for agriculture in California
( 02/05/2009 ) Secretary of Energy Steven Chu warned climate change could severely impact California agricultural industry by the end of the century , reported the Los Angeles Times .
California faces severe drought
( 01/30/2009 ) California appears to be on track for its worst drought since the early 1990s , warned the state ’s Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) following its survey of snowpack and other water resources .
Victor Billot argues that the Otago Daily Times series " Faith and reason " has so far featured a lot of faith , and very little reason .
As a non-expert citizen , my basic claim is this : Religion is nonsense .
Often it is dangerous nonsense .
The late American writer Kurt Vonnegut observed " say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith .
I consider the capacity for it terrifying . "
I agree .
The common religious belief in a " supreme being " is a psychological and social construction .
Religion is made up , an invention given credibility simply because a lot of people agree with it .
It is the product of primitive human societies which required a way to explain reality and create social rules .
Religious leaders developed in history as a privileged class who still insist they have all the answers and a direct line to the Creator of the Universe .
Yet the list of these individuals is hardly confidence - inspiring ; just imagine ending up in heaven and finding your eternal flatmates are the Ayatollah Khomeini , the current Pope , and Bishop Brian Tamaki .
In our society , the " right " God is usually one of the various Christian versions .
However , it does n't take much to realise that if the same New Zealand pastors , priests and door - knockers happened to have been born in Iran , they would no doubt be devout Muslims , or in Timbuktu , devout followers of the established religion of Timbuktu , whatever that may be .
The basic line of most religions is that our religion is completely right and everyone else is completely wrong .
We are blessed and others will be sorted out by God .
How do they know ?
It says in their preferred collection of fables from the dim past .
No evidence is required and there is always the fall - back position of " faith " .
If I was to proclaim my faith in Zeus and Apollo , most people today would rightly regard me as a lunatic .
Yet absolutely nothing separates faith in Zeus and Apollo from faith in Christianity or Islam in any respect but current popularity .
If religion had not been challenged by reason , and free - thinking independent minds , we would still languish in the dark ages .
Most major Western religions are filled with guilt and sadistic violence .
Their so - called " message of love " is complemented by a message of fear and retribution .
If you do n't obey the angry male father figure in the sky , you will be thrown out of paradise , burned , drowned , cursed by plague , turned into a pillar of salt , plunged into eternal torment etc - the vengeful imagination of our loving creator knows no bounds .
One could say the " love " of God is conditional .
Love me , and more importantly obey me , or face the consequences .
Even if God existed , why would people wish to " worship " such a psychopathic control freak ?
By all decent standards , if such an individual was human , he would be locked away for the safety and wellbeing of the rest of us .
Why can't we take this disturbing God character out of the equation and just treat each other with compassion and respect for their own sake , rather than because we want a reward or to avoid punishment ?
Religious advocates often assert science " does not have all the answers " .
Of course science does not have all the answers .
Nor does it claim to , unlike religion which pretends to have the answers for everything , even if those answers are gibberish .
Religion encourages mindless obedience and unshakeable certainty , not reason .
Those who reject scientific concepts such as evolution seem to generally have no problem with aeroplanes , electricity , hygiene , dental care and all the other products of applied science and reason that we enjoy .
This is complete hypocrisy .
Thanks to reason , we have realised we are not at the centre of the universe , woman was not created from the spare rib of the first man , and that the earth is unlikely to have been created in seven days ( although that would have been far more efficient and impressive than the boring several billion years it did take ) .
The reality revealed and investigated by reason is far more complex , amazing and wonderful than the cramped one - stop shop presented by religion .
So much for faith .
Science does n't provide a moral or ethical framework , but it is a way of describing reality far superior to religious explanations .
It allows us to a limited degree to understand why people are the way they are , and to a limited extent act the way they act .
This does not create a moral or social framework in itself , but can inform the way we look at moral and social questions .
There are many moral or ethical ideas or behaviours that can be adhered to without believing in superstition , and it is about time religion was challenged on its self - appointed moral high ground .
My argument is not that religion is the sole cause of the world 's problems , and obviously there are countless decent people of both religious and non-religious opinion .
I support freedom of religion , which in my case means freedom from religion .
However , an outlook based on reason , openness , respect and dignity is possible and in my view preferable , even if it does not always provide simplistic easy answers to the tough questions .
It will be difficult to move to a post - religious world .
The disappearance of religion has dangers , too , if people are simply going to fill its absence with mindless consumerism or ego - driven selfishness , the creed of modern capitalism .
But move to a non-religious world we must , if humanity is to survive and grow beyond a dangerous and challenging century ahead .
• Victor Billot is a Dunedin atheist and humanist .
To describe what 's needed to wean the country off fossil fuels , people often use the word transition .
As in " the transition to a clean - energy economy . "
But transition is too smooth .
It suggests steadiness , even inevitability , as if the endpoint is predetermined .
The outcome of the tremendous push that 's now underway to change how the United States and other countries obtain and consume energy is anything but predetermined .
There are no definite answers to questions about the role one source of energy or another will play 15 or 20 years from now , no clear sense about the type of fuel ( if any ) people will put in their cars , no consensus on how quickly any of this can happen or at what cost .
Nor is the change likely to be smooth and quiet .
Instead , it will probably be disruptive , breaking down existing ways of thinking and acting .
Not that disruption is bad : Joseph Schumpeter , the famous Austro - Hungarian economist , once spoke of " creative destruction , " whereby new technologies and ideas replace old ones , which themselves are overthrown by newer , more progressive ones .
Already , 2009 has been a year of visions , of prophecies .
President Barack Obama 's inaugural address offered one such vision : doubling alternative energy production in the next three years , updating and expanding the nation 's energy infrastructure , saving billions of dollars in energy costs through improved energy efficiency .
Think tanks , businesses , industry groups , and environmentalists have laid out their own plans , some more aggressive and some less so .
The sheer number of these plans , not to mention the interest percolating up from nearly all corners of American life , suggests , as Energy Secretary Steven Chu puts it , that " the landscape is changing . "
Ebb and flow .
Clean energy is , of course , a narrative that has been slowly developing in the United States over the past four decades or so , at least since President Jimmy Carter 's administration .
In the past , its visibility and its urgency have ebbed and flowed with the price of oil .
Today , however , it 's not just the wild fluctuation in oil prices that is driving the discussion .
There is the economic crisis .
There is the burgeoning climate crisis , with its implicit call for global cooperation .
And there are fresh concerns about national security in an age of emboldened oil cartels and nuclear ambitions .
Addressing each of these priorities raises its own set of questions .
At the moment , there is no consensus on how aggressively the United States should reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the few next decades or , more broadly still , the proper role of fossil fuels and renewable energy .
Meanwhile , almost every potential contributor to a " green energy economy " — wind and solar power , biofuels , nuclear power , energy efficiency — faces hurdles well beyond the technology of each system .
Regulatory policies or economic issues stand in the way of massive , quick deployment of any of these .
And so , today , a new mentality is emerging among almost all the major energy players , from wind developers in the Dakotas to coal - plant operators in North Carolina : Energy issues can no longer be treated as piecemeal policy items left up to states and hodgepodge federal legislation to decide but instead must be addressed nationally , in a sweeping manner .
Want the country running on flex - fuel vehicles ?
" It 's just a few hundred dollars more per vehicles , " says retired Gen. Wesley Clark , the 2004 presidential candidate and now cochairman of Growth Energy , a group representing several of the nation 's largest ethanol producers .
" What would encourage an automobile manufacturer to believe he should do it would be a government policy that says we are moving in that direction . "
Want more wind power ?
" The critical thing we are talking about here is national policy and the signals it sends to people , " says Denise Bode , CEO of the American Wind Energy Association .
" There is tremendous demand for wind power , but there is not enough transmission . "
The idea that a nation should have a clear - cut national energy policy sounds obvious enough .
In the United States , however , the truth is that energy has not always been considered a national issue , and in some ways it still is n't .
Nowhere is this more obvious than with the transmission grid , a sprawling jumble of wires and mechanical connections dating back 50 , 80 , even 100 years in some places .
Today , the grid is divided into more than 140 " balancing areas " to help manage the distribution of power .
But some are so localized that they can't communicate with their next - door neighbors .
As a result , extra power in one region is often wasted rather than being sent to a place that needs it .
So if wind power , solar power , and plug - in electric vehicles are to be big players in the country 's energy future , as many hope , this antiquated system for delivering electricity will have to change .
The grid must be retooled , and new high - capacity power lines are needed to carry wind - generated electricity from the Midwest to the East and West coasts .
To get those high - power lines approved , Bode and other advocates say , the federal government needs more authority to override nasty squabbles between states , environmentalists , and other interest groups that have typi-cally stalled such efforts .
The federal government , the thinking goes , already has the authority to build natural gas pipelines across state lines , and electricity should be no different .
That sentiment seems to be gaining ground even among regulators who once opposed it , although there are many issues still to be worked out .
As Chu says , " If we just take the view that we are going to cram something down someone 's throat , this is not a constructive way of doing business . "
Infrastructure is only one part of the battle to make national energy problems a national issue .
Another is technology .
Even though wind power technology is relatively mature — it was the country 's largest provider of clean electricity last year — most other renewable sources still need work .
Improvements to photovoltaic cells could reduce solar power costs significantly .
New drilling technologies could help geothermal spread across a larger geographic range .
Advancements in biofuels , in particular to the enzymes needed to break down grasses and woods to produce ethanol , would have a major impact .
Meanwhile , fossil fuels face their own technological challenges .
If coal is to stay around for a while , it 'll most likely be because of still - developing methods to capture carbon dioxide emissions before they enter the atmosphere .
Groundwork .
Scientific breakthroughs do n't come cheap .
The economic stimulus package set aside $ 21.5 billion for scientific research , signaling that Washington is taking a much more active role in basic energy issues after years of declining budgets at national labs .
But this is just the groundwork .
The most powerful force to remake the energy America uses could be government policies : climate change legislation , which would set a price on carbon dioxide emissions , and a national renewable - electricity standard , which would require the United States to get a certain portion of its electricity from renewable energy .
Both rules could have far - reaching impacts , forcing industries to massively reconsider their operations , giving financial investors confidence to pump money into wind farms , solar fields , and other industries , and convincing the coal industry that it 's worth investing billions in technology to reduce emissions .
The consequences of climate change legislation , in fact , are expected to be so great that companies typically opposed to government regulation are asking Congress to go ahead and act just so that they can have some certainty about where to put their money .
What Washington wo n't do — not in theory , anyway — is pick specific winners .
" The market will decide what the mix will be , " says Matt Rogers , a former director at McKinsey & Co. and now one of Chu 's top advisers .
" It will be interesting to see what the market brings forward . "
Of course , in reality , Congress 's record is one of subsidizing some industries but not others .
Even within the biofuel world , corn - based ethanol is heavily supported , but some others , such as biofuel made from algae , receive almost no backing .
In this new era of national energy , one of the primary questions facing the country is that of timing .
When should things happen ?
In what order ?
And how soon can they occur ?
" Broadly , what scares me is that we want to do this in an incremental fashion .
We want this to come across as painlessly as possible , " say Rich Wells , vice president of energy at Dow Chemical .
" We need a breakthrough mentality . "
It has become a cliché to say that there is no " silver bullet " for the nation 's energy and climate problems .
Most experts prefer to think about energy solutions as a collection of options to be deployed in tandem .
Perhaps the most widely quoted example is the " wedge model , " developed by Princeton University professors Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow in 2004 .
It outlined 15 wedges , each one representing a way to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the next 50 years .
Among them : raising the fuel economy of 2 billion cars from 30 mpg to 60 mpg and doubling nuclear capacity worldwide .
Only some of these , of course , are realistic in the shorter term .
" If you 're only going to do one , the top one is always energy efficiency , " says Dow 's Wells .
" It is for the most part the easiest , cheapest fuel out there . "
Amory Lovins , chief scientist at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute , agrees , saying that energy savings from highly fuel - efficient cars would be equivalent to " finding a Saudi Arabia under Detroit . "
Perhaps the biggest barrier for buildings has been the upfront cost of doing retrofits , with the need to convince people that the costs can be quickly recouped by lower energy bills .
The stimulus package is taking a stab at this , setting aside $ 5 billion for home weatherization .
The giraffe population of Kenya 's Masai Mara reserve has declined by up to 95 % because of increased human settlement around the unfenced park , according to a new study .
Scientists at the Nairobi - based International Livestock Research Institute ( ILRI ) found that the numbers of giraffes , hartebeest , impala , warthogs , topis and waterbuck all fell " markedly and persistently " throughout the 1,500 sq km reserve between 1989 and 2003 .
Their sample counts were backed by government population estimates that showed actual losses as high as 95 % for giraffes , 80 % for wart­hogs and 76 % for hartebeest for the period dating back to 1979 .
The authors of the study , which was funded by the WWF and will be published in the British Journal of Zoology in May , say it presents the most detailed evidence yet of the rapid decline of ungulate , or hoofed , animals in the Mara , in south - western Kenya .
The main reason for the population decrease was the rapid expansion of human settlements on the land next to the reserve .
The area was traditionally used by wild animals for seasonal grazing but is increasingly being turned over to livestock and crop production .
" The situation we documented paints a bleak picture and requires urgent and decisive action if we want to save this treasure from disaster , " said Joseph Ogutu , a statistical ecologist at ILRI and lead author of the study .
" If nothing is done , these declines will not just continue but accelerate as the human populations around the reserve increase . "
The Mara reserve sits at the top of the Mara - Serengeti ecosystem , which hosts the spectacular annual migration of up to 2 million wildebeest and other animals .
Bordering the park is an area known as the Mara ranchlands , which is mainly home to the Masai ethnic group .
Until the last few decades , the Masai semi-nomadic herders and their livestock coexisted easily with the wild animals that roamed their lands .
But rapid population growth and a steadily more sedentary lifestyle for the Masai , driven in large part by decades of policy neglect , have seen the number of permanent settlements surge along the boundaries of the Mara .
In Koyiaki , one of the ranches next to the reserve , the number of huts increased from 44 to 2,345 between 1950 and 2003 .
Individual titleholders now own what was once communal land .
Ogutu said this meant wild grazing animals that previously moved freely in and out of the reserve were increasingly competing for habitat with cattle and large - scale crop cultivation .
The destruction of trees for firewood was also having a negative effect .
" It 's not just that wild animals are moving away from these areas ; they are dying out , " Ogutu said .
Among the other ungulates studied by the ILRI scientists , topi antelopes and impala also suffered sharp declines over the 15 - year period .
While zebra and waterbuck numbers increased , they were still down 87 % and 57 % respectively from their 1979 population estimates .
The study warned that killing of animals that damage crops and water supplies , break down fences and threaten humans and livestock was " common and increasing " in the ranchlands .
Adding to the pressure on wildlife , more and more farmers were allowing their livestock to graze in the reserve , especially in times of drought .
Hunting by mainly non-Masai ethnic groups within the Mara also remained a significant problem .
" The traditional livestock livelihoods of the Masai , who rarely consume wild animals , actually helped maintain the abundance of grazing animals in east Africa .
And where a pastoral approach to livestock grazing is still practised , it continues to benefit wild populations , " said Robin Reid , director of the Centre for Collaborative Conservation at Colorado State University , who co-wrote the paper .
She warned : " There appears to be a ' tipping point ' of human populations above which former coexistence between Masai and wildlife begins to break down .
In the villages on the border of the Mara , this point has been passed , but large areas of the Mara still have populations low enough that compatibility is still possible . "
Since 2003 , several wildlife conservancies have been set up in the Mara rangelands .
The operators say these have helped increased animal numbers while providing employment and rental income to Masai landlords .
Power + technology = performance .
At least it does in the case of the 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 ( $ 112,200 ; Fall 2009 ) .
We 're not talking about computer - style tech though — the new GT3 packs a 3.8 - liter flat six that has Porsche 's Variocam system on both the intake and exhaust , enabling 0 - 60 performance in the 4 second range with 435 hp and a top speed of 194m ph .
That 's not all , however : it also features dynamic engine mounts that use magnetic fluid to stiffen the mounts when driving hard , yet offer a soft ride in normal conditions , an air - based lift system to raise the car up to 1.18 inches for driving over speedbumps or up inclines , LED tail lights , and more .

Introduction
In our continuing series on personal computing security , we ’re talking with Collin Jackson and Adam Barth to discuss the security features of Google Chrome .
Both Collin and Adam are members of the Web Security Group at Stanford University .
Collin is still finishing his PhD at Stanford , while Adam completed both his Masters Degree and a PhD at Stanford .
After completing his training at the Best School in the Bay Area , Adam spent some time as a post - doc at the second - rate public school across the bay ( UC Berkeley ) .
Both of them have worked at Google .
While there , they were the lead authors on an academic analysis of the security architecture of Chromium , the core upon which Google Chrome is built .
Alan :
Thanks for taking the time to talk with us .
Let ’s start with the basics .
Why do n’t you tell me a little bit about yourself ?
How did you decide to specialize in security research , and why did you both choose Stanford University ?
Collin : I picked Stanford because it is has top - notch professors working in a broad range of fields , and I was n't yet sure what I wanted to do .
When I got there , I got drawn in to Web security because all the most interesting applications are moving to the Web , yet the details of the Web security model are still poorly understood .
Adam : I 've been interested in security since I was a kid .
One of my favorite games growing up was to invent ciphers for my friends to break .
I chose Stanford because I have a personal connection with Stanford : I grew up in Palo Alto and my mother is a professor in the business school .
Alan :
When I was in CS106B , I won first place in the programming contest ( Fastest Algorithm : Panex Puzzle ) .
The instructor was from Google , which was then only about a year and a half old .
I ’ve always wondered if I could have gotten a job at Google if I wanted to pursue a career in CS .
What was the coolest thing about working at Google ?
Adam :
For me , the coolest thing about working at Google was being able to use their massive computing infrastructure to run experiments .
For example , we used this infrastructure to optimize the security of Chrome 's content sniffing algorithm ( these experiments eventually lead to this paper : http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/barth-caballero-song.pdf).
Alan :
There have been a few designers who have recently left Google because they felt that the process was too bureaucratic .
Was it hard to get them to let you run an experiment on a new algorithm using Google ’s database of billions of Web pages as the data set , and then convince them to let you use the QA team to manually test the top 500 sites ?
How long did it take to run your algorithm through the billions of Web sites ?
Adam :
There was n't any resistance to running the experiments .
I 'm not sure exactly how long they took to run , but it certainly took less time to run the experiments than to design them in the first place .
We did this work in collaboration with the HTML 5 standardization effort , and we hope that other browsers can benefit from these experiments by adopting the HTML 5 content sniffing algorithm .
Jeff Stein , Spy Talk columnist for Congressional Quarterly , discusses his breaking news story about the alleged NSA wiretap recording of Rep.
Jane Harmon agreeing to intervene on behalf of two AIPAC employees accused of espionage in exchange for help getting appointed chair of the House Intelligence Committee and why then - Attorney General Gonzales intervened to close the case before it could really begin .
Interview conducted 4/22/09 .
Listen to the interview .
Scott Horton :
All the news is about Jeff Stein ’s report in Congressional Quarterly about a seeming obstruction of justice case involving the former attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , and a congresswoman from here in California named Jane Harman .
Jeff Stein is the national security editor for Congressional Quarterly .
The Web site is CQPolitics.com .
Welcome to the show , sir .
How are you ?
Jeff Stein :
Thanks alot .
It ’s nice to be here .
Horton : I guess first of all the ground work here is the Rosen and Weissman case .
Can you just briefly describe for the audience what that case is about for the background of what you have reported here ?
Stein :
These two gentlemen who were lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , which is the most powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington , stand accused of espionage - related charges .
They , according to the charges , they received classified material from a Pentagon employee and supplied it to the Israeli government .
The Pentagon employee is now serving 12 1/2 years in prison .
It could have been a lot longer , except he agreed to cooperate with the government on the case .
So the trial of the two AIPAC officials now scheduled to begin in June .
Horton :
Now this is a very … well , despite the scant media coverage it is a very high profile case .
The Pentagon employee …
Stein :
Wait a minute , the New York Times lead story today confirms my story .
Horton :
Oh , no , I ’m sorry .
I meant of the Rosen / Weissman case .
I ’m just trying to get to the political import of that case .
Most Americans do n’t hear very much about it .
Stein : Yeah , it ’s kind of esoteric .
It ’s a Washington story .
It ’s about bureaucrats and Pentagon and the spies and influence peddling and all that stuff .
It ’s gotten a lot of coverage actually but it ’s not the kind of thing that generally draws a large public following .
Horton : Right .
But it is the kind of thing where apparently , well someone that you describe in your article as a suspected Israeli agent would work hard to make a deal with a congresswoman in order to put pressure on someone , I ’m not sure , sir , to reduce the charges against these men .
Tell us about what happened here .
Stein : According to my sources and now according to the New York Times own sources , this unnamed suspected Israeli agent asked Representative Harman if she could lobby the Justice Department , call somebody at the Justice Department , to get the charges against these two officials of AIPAC reduced .
In exchange , the alleged Israeli agent said he would raise money for the top Democrat in the House , who is Nancy Pelosi , and try to get her , out of gratitude , to appoint Jane Harman chairwoman of the House Intelligence Committee when the Democrats took Congress in the next election .
That is the allegation .
Horton :
And now , it ’s a bit unclear , you have the phrase and quotes , in your article : according to the police or national security people who listen to these wire taps or read the transcripts , she “ completed a crime . ”
She did something , apparently to influence I think in your article you say , it looked like she tried to influence lower level members of the Department of Justice perhaps .
And then as you mentioned the New York Times article on the front page this morning , they seem to indicate that she thought she would have better luck dealing with the White House .
Stein :
That ’s right .
Horton :
Do you have any idea , exactly what or can you flesh these arguments out for us ?
Stein :
Well , first of all let ’s start with this term , “ completed crime , ” which I had never heard of before until I did this story .
And as it was described to me , it ’s a term of legal art .
What it means is that there is a prima facie case that a crime was committed .
This case that she did something in exchange for something .
In other words pay for play , or influence peddling kind of thing .
There was a prima facie case .
On the face of it it looked like a crime had been committed .
Horton :
So it was n’t just that she had been overheard saying , yeah , maybe we should do this .
It ’s seems like she actually carried out the conspiracy to do something .
Stein :
No , it says that it looks like by just merely promising to do that , merely promising to do that , she had committed a crime , according to the Justice Department attorneys who looked at the tape , listened to the tape .
So , that does n’t mean she did , it means that there is evidence on the face of it that she committed a crime by promising to exchange something for something of value .
In other words to do a favor in exchange for something of value , which is to say to get appointed to be the Chair of House Intelligence Committee .
Now , what happened is that that triggered an FBI investigation .
But before the investigation was to begin , according to my sources , the attorney general stepped in and stopped the investigation .
So she was never questioned .
So what we have here is that we do n’t know what really happened , because the FBI investigation was stopped before it began .
So we ’ll never know .
Ms. Harman may have all sorts of innocent explanations for this conversation , which I believe with 99 % certainty did happen the way I described it and the way the New York Times is now describing it , that she did have this conversation .
But there may be a context to it in which puts a less severe spin on what it looks like now and what it looked like to the Justice Department officials when they heard it .
So that ’s the whole point here , is that justice was not allowed to take its course .
Horton : Well , and I want to get to the Gonzales thing in a second , but in the first place you say in your article it was a National Security Agency investigation , apparently not the same FBI investigation that nabbed Larry Franklin and Rosen and Weissman , and that it was this apparently was n’t Michael Hayden ’s illegal wire tapping program .
This actually was sanctioned by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
It was an investigation of the suspected Israeli agent , not of the congresswoman .
Is that correct ?
Horton :
That ’s right .
I ’ll correct one thing : I think that this was a continuation of the investigation into a back , the officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
I think it was at least an outgrowth of that or continuation of that .
But yes , it had nothing to do , as far as I know , with the so - called warrantless wire tapping program being conducted by the National Security Agency .
It could very well have been the National Security Agency , because of it ’s technological prowess was carrying out this investigation – this eavesdropping operation – for , or in collaboration with , the FBI .
But it was not part of a warrantless program .
It was part of a court sanctioned – The Justice department went to this court and asked for an electronic intercept on this target .
They got the court ’s approval and then the electronic surveillance picked up this conversation with Rep. Harman on it .
Horton : Now as we work our way toward Attorney General Gonzales , and his intervention , we have the question of the notification of the leaders of the House of Representatives due to the separation of powers protocols .
And it ’s interesting to me .
I do n’t think this has made it into much of the reporting so far .
Well , Laura Rosen , at Foreign Policy , says that Dennis Hastert would have been notified , as well as Pelosi .
I ’m not sure if she says [ that ] she knows he was , or he would have been , according to the protocol .
But he was under investigation , in this same investigation as part of the NSA and the FBI looking into the lobbies and their influence , as David Rose reported in Vanity Fair back in 2005 .
Stein :
Yes , that was a separate thing , but I do n’t know about that .
But I do know that , under the protocol , when a member of Congress is about to be investigated , a national security investigation , the intelligence agencies , the FBI , the CIA , go to the leaders of Congress , the top Democratic Congressperson and the top Republican , and notify them , in confidence , that they ’re about to launch this investigation .
The reason for that is , basically , the member of Congress may have access to classified information .
They want to tip off these top Congressmen that they do n’t want this person to have access to classified information .
But it ’s also a way to protect the investigative agencies from running afoul of the Constitution by investigating a member of Congress .
That ’s a very sensitive area , of course .
But , yes , Denny Hastert , who was then the Speaker of the House , would have been notified , and so would have Nancy Pelosi , who was the Democratic Leader , or Minority Leader at that time , of the House .
Horton : Okay , here ’s where we get to Alberto Gonzales .
I guess I ’m still a bit fuzzy .
Is it your understanding that the Department of Justice lawyers were preparing to go ahead and convene a grand jury at this point , before the Attorney General intervened ?
And then , how did he intervene , exactly ?
Stein :
No , I did n’t report anything about a grand jury convening .
I reported only that lawyers in the public integrity section of the Justice Department , who had reviewed the wiretap intercept , thought there was prima facie evidence here of a crime having been committed .
They wanted the FBI to go out and investigate .
It ’s after the investigation that you go to a grand jury and get the grand jury to issue an indictment .
You ca n’t have an indictment until this investigation , i.e. , until evidence has been gathered .
Horton : I see .
So this was killed very early in its crib here – this investigation .
Stein :
It never even started , according to my sources .
Horton :
This was because , according to your sources , Alberto Gonzales said , “ We need Jane . ”
Why did Alberto Gonzales need Jane ?
Stein :
Here ’s where the story really gets convoluted , more like a movie , a thriller about Washington .
About this time that all this happening , the New York Times was preparing a story .
It was about to release a story about revealing this whole , vast , warrantless wiretapping program run by the NSA through the telephone companies .
They were listening to virtually all American traffic , email traffic and telephone calls .
That was about to be a huge scandal .
According to my sources , the Attorney General needed a prominent Democrat on the Hill , who was above reproach , to help defend the administration in a bipartisan way on this warrantless wiretapping program .
So , according to my sources , the Attorney General told the intelligence agencies to stand down , to not go ahead and notify Denny Hastert , the Speaker of the House , and Nancy Pelosi , then the Democratic Leader of the House , to not notify them , because he did n’t want any dirt on Jane Harman to be made public .
He did n’t want an investigation of her ongoing , ironically having been picked up by a wiretap herself allegedly trading favors with a foreign agent .
He did n’t want that coming out .
At the same time , he needed her to be defending , very publicly and vociferously , the administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
In fact , she did .
She came out very much in support of the administration and denounced the New York Times for revealing the existence of that wiretapping program .
So she did do that .
Whether she did that as a favor , or whether she felt that anyway , we do n’t know .
Again , justice was aborted here .
The FBI was not allowed to investigate and thrash this out .
This is just an aside from me :
The problem for Representative Harman , now , is that she may have done nothing wrong , and yet she ’s under a cloud of suspicion because the investigation was aborted .
Horton :
As you mentioned on your blog this morning at CQPolitics.com , that Glenn Greenwald pointed out and went back over some of the history on his blog about how she really was the best , from Gonzales ’ point of view , in terms of being a loyal Democrat in defending the program after it came out .
Stein :
That ’s right .
Horton :
In fact , I do n’t think this made it , by press time of your blog entry , but apparently this blog , PlumLine , this morning is confirming that Harman , in fact , did pressure the New York Times twice , two different times .
And according to Keller ’s second statement now , the first time was in late October or early November 2004 , just in time to apparently bury the story and help George Bush win reelection over her guy .
Stein :
That ’s right .
So it ’s a very convoluted story .
In fact , when one of my principal sources was first describing this , including the quote that Jane Harman allegedly said , “ This conversation does not exist , ” I said , “ Oh man , that sounds like a bad , bad movie . ”
He said , “ It does . ”
In fact , the whole things sound like a Washington thriller , sort of like that one that just came out now , “ State of Play , ” or whatever .
It ’s sort of a thriller , and I ’m hoping someone buys the movie rights .
[ laughter ]
Horton :
Or at least pick it up , like the Times has done today , and continue reporting on it .
When does your follow - up article come out ?
Stein :
My problem is I have n’t written anything yet .
I wrote a blog about what had been written for today , as you saw , and you mentioned .
I ’m continuing to investigate the story .
We have not identified with any certainty yet who was the target of the wiretap , who was the suspected Israeli delegate , we have n’t identified that person yet .
That ’s just for starters .
There are lots of questions to be answered here .
Horton : Indeed .
Well , I guess it was the Time story of 2006 that brought up this guy , Haim Saban .
Your reporting does n’t indicate to you that he ’s the suspected Israeli agent that we ’re talking about here ?
Stein : I do not have that .
In fact , I was told by one of my sources that he was not the target .
Horton : I see .
Do the cops that you talked to , did they think – this maybe is a stretch of a question – but they are under the impression , I guess , that she knew the guy she was making the deal with was actually an agent of Israeli government rather than just an influential lobbyist of some kind ?
Stein :
That is a really interesting question , which has n’t been answered yet , and I hope to be able to answer that .
Again , if the FBI had been allowed to investigate , we might have found out .
Horton :
Have you talked to any lawyers , and are they saying it looks like – I ’m no lawyer , that ’s The Other Scott Horton who ’s got all the credentials – but it seems to me like this is what you call a prima facie for obstruction of justice on the part of the former attorney general , right ?
And perhaps this congresswoman .
Stein : I ’ll let other people characterize it , I am just reporting what happened .
Horton : I see .
Alright .
That is fair enough .
Thank you very much .
I really appreciate it .
Stein :
Thanks for calling me .
I appreciate it .
CINCINNATI ( AP )  " Bailout " was the magic word as Domino 's had to give away thousands of free pizzas because someone stumbled on an online promotion the company scrapped .
Domino's Pizza Inc. spokesman Tim McIntyre said Wednesday that the company prepared an Internet coupon for an ad campaign that was considered in December but not approved .
He says someone apparently typed " bailout " into a Domino 's promo code window and found it was good for a free medium pizza .
Word about the code spread quickly Monday night on the Web and 11,000 free pizzas were delivered before it was deactivated Tuesday morning .
Cincinnati - area franchise owner John Glass says his 14 stores gave away more than 600 pies , but that Domino 's promised to reimburse him .

If someone were to tell us that morale among staffers at the SEC is flying high , we might politely suggest that that person move away from the burning plastic .
After all , the commission has in recent days received blistering down - dressings over its missing the alleged frauds of Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford .
But according to this Legal Times story , SEC staffers are , in fact , feeling pretty good these days .
" There 's a sense of the lifting of spirits , " said Elisse Walter , one of the SEC's two Democratic commissioners , to Legal Times .
According to staffers , new SEC chairman Mary Schapiro has played a big role in the new buoyant mood .
Since being sworn in as chairman Jan. 27 , Mary Schapiro has rolled back a number of existing rules that critics say slowed down the enforcement process and hired a new enforcement chief , Robert Khuzami , a veteran federal prosecutor .
Perhaps most importantly , Schapiro is urging staffers to aggressively pursue investigations .
Under the previous administration , " the guiding principle was slow it down , shut it down , find a way to bog it down , " says a lawyer in the division .
" We are now being given the tools , the ability , and the discretion to use our good judgment . "
Over 1000 cuts .
6 hours of guitar tabbing .
1 hour of shooting .
God knows how much editing .
Amazing result .
10.8 % unemployment , 6.2 % inflation , and a doubling of the deficit over the previous year .
Those were the cold truths that President Reagan and Republicans faced in November 1982 .
Yet despite this bleak economic news , and widespread predictions that Republicans would lose the Senate , they retained their 54 Senate seats and limited House losses to 27 seats , many as a result of redistricting .
In 2010 , the shoe could be on the other foot .
President Obama and congressional Democrats could be riding out the worst recession since , at least , 1982 .
And Republicans will be salivating at the chance to pick up seats by tying Democrats to Obama and the economy .
So exactly how did Reagan emerge unscathed in ' 82 - and what lessons does it hold for Democrats today ?
Looking back , Reagan and the Republicans did three things successfully - all of them replicable by Obama and Democrats .
First , Reagan made sure his ambitious blueprint for the country was clear , understandable , and concise .
Any American paying attention in 1982 could say exactly what Reagan was trying to do : cut taxes , shrink government , and beef up defense spending .
Like Obama , Reagan had an agenda designed to dramatically alter the trajectory of American government .
But despite its size and boldness - and perhaps even because of it - Reagan framed it in simple , compelling language .
That does n't mean congressional Democrats must rubberstamp Obamanomics .
But it does suggest that a party carrying a unified message about enacting transformational change - even as it debates the details - is likely to be best positioned for 2010 .
As the recession deepened in 1982 , some Republicans feared a political backlash to Reaganism , but the President held his ground .
As the New York Times reported the week before the election , " the President . has taken the lead in turning the Congressional elections of ' 82 into a referendum on Reaganomics . "
Reagan gambled that the big story he and his Republican allies were telling - even with the country still mired in rough economic times - would retain the backing of the American people because they had , in electing him , rejected the old Democratic order of Carter and Mondale .
Second , Reagan had a relentless and positive focus on the middle class .
He believed that even during grim economic times , middle class Americans were by nature indomitable optimists who wanted economic success , not simply economic survival .
He invoked a " shining city on a hill , " promised and delivered tax cuts , and even his ideas on welfare were designed to appeal to the middle class ethic of work .
Some may argue - as we do - that Reagan 's policies ultimately harmed the middle class .
But the middle class believed otherwise and gave him overwhelming support .
As in 1982 , the middle class holds the keys to the castle for Obama and Democrats .
They will determine whether health care , energy , and education reform pass or fail .
And they are a truly swing vote - shifting 15 - points between 2004 , when they delivered a 5 - point loss for Democrats , and 2008 , when they favored Democrats by 10 points .
And they are still optimists with an unshakeable belief in the American Dream ; they want government to help ensure success as they define it , not mere subsistence .
This means a comfortable retirement , affordable college for their kids , opportunities for career advancement , lower health care costs and an answer to the challenges of juggling work and family .
Third , Reagan owned the recovery and assigned away blame for the pain .
Even in 1982 , the economy was described as suffering from the " Carter Recession . "
Every bit of bad news was assigned to the previous regime ; every morsel of good news was evidence of a Reagan - led recovery .
Public opinion polls today roundly blame former President Bush for the state of today 's economy .
But will they in 2010 ?
Some Democrats have been as harsh on administration officials like Timothy Geithner as they have been on Bush .
And they have too easily shifted their outrage over economic malpractice to tertiary figures , like AIG executives , rather than where it really belongs - with the former Administration .
In stark contrast to 1982 was 1994 , the last time Democrats controlled both the White House and the Congress , and those mid-terms were a disaster .
They lost a total of 63 seats and the majority in both houses .
In hindsight , they did n't follow the lessons of Reagan .
They failed to clarify to the American people what President Clinton and a chaotic Democratic Congress were trying to achieve .
The Clinton focus on the middle class , so dominant during his campaign , somehow disappeared .
And even though the economy was rotten when Clinton took office , they ended up taking ownership for the bad news .
With Democrats potentially facing many of the same circumstances , perhaps their motto going into 2010 should be : win one for the Gipper .

Instead of building a permanent lunar base , NASA may send astronauts on short ‘ sorties ’ or excursions ( Illustration : NASA )
NASA will probably not build an outpost on the moon as originally planned , the agency ’s acting administrator , Chris Scolese , told lawmakers on Wednesday .
His comments also hinted that the agency is open to putting more emphasis on human missions to destinations like Mars or a near - Earth asteroid .
NASA has been working towards returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and building a permanent base there .
But some space analysts and advocacy groups like the Planetary Society have urged the agency to cancel plans for a permanent moon base , carry out shorter moon missions instead , and focus on getting astronauts to Mars .
Under Scolese ’s predecessor , Mike Griffin , the agency held firm to its moon base plans .
But the comments by Scolese , who will lead NASA until President Barack Obama nominates the next administrator , suggest a shift in the agency ’s direction .
He spoke to the Subcommittee on Commerce , Justice , Science , and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations .
Scolese was asked repeatedly whether NASA could still make it to the moon by 2020 under the proposed 2010 budget , but failed to give a clear yes or no , and his answers suggested the agency ’s plans were in flux .

Short trips
“ We were looking at an outpost on the moon , as the basis for that [ 2020 ] estimate and that one is being revisited , ” he said .
“ It will probably be less than an outpost on the moon , but where it fits between sorties , single trips , to the moon to various parts and an outpost is really going to be dependent on the studies that we ’re going to be doing . ”
“ Recall [ that ] the Vision [ for Space Exploration ] was not just to go to the moon as it was in Apollo , it was to utilise space to go on to Mars and to go to other places , ” he added .
“ We ’ve demonstrated over the last several years that with multiple flights we can build a very complex system reliably – the space station – involving multiple nations … and we ’ll need something like that if we ’re going to go to Mars . ”
Scolese ’s further comments hinted that the agency ’s plans might shift to include a greater emphasis on destinations beyond the moon .
“ So what I would like to see from NASA over time is an architecture that …will give us flexibility for taking humans beyond low - Earth orbit and allowing us to have options for what we can do at the moon as well as other destinations … [ like ]
Mars or an asteroid … so that there are options on what we do in 2020 , ” he said .
Vague answers
Scolese ’s vague answers on whether NASA believed it could meet its 2020 moon deadline , as well as similarly unclear answers from Doug Cooke , NASA ’s associate administrator for exploration systems , left the subcommittee ’s chair , congressman Alan Mollohan , wondering whether the agency had been given new directions .
“ Does the 2010 budget request impact in any way our target – is this so complicated – our target of getting to the moon by 2020 ? ” he asked .
“ Is there any consideration being given within the organisation to not attempting to meet the 2020 moon [ return ] … is there any reconsideration of going there ?
What is going on here ? ”
Cooke replied : “ The direction that we have is to continue to pursue the 2020 date , ” but added that the agency was still assessing how the 2010 budget might affect that .
Some clarification about any shift in NASA ’s goals and priorities could come in early May , when the Obama administration ’s detailed 2010 budget proposal for NASA is set to be released .
The good news for the newspaper , which Ms Hanson is suing for publishing the pictures , is that Dr Sutisno is convinced the photos are not doctored .
She is convinced they are genuine images .
The bad news : she is convinced they are of another woman .
At first glance , she concedes , the young woman is strikingly like the Ms Hanson of today , a candidate in Saturday 's Queensland election .
That is particularly so when considering the " most striking similarities in her features : the eyes and the thin lips … but that is a subjective assessment " .
When Dr Sutisno subjected the photos to a more rigorous facial mapping analysis , she was left with little doubt .
" The most obvious difference is the nose .
The young woman 's nasal bridge is high , prominent and projecting , and more narrow .
Pauline Hanson 's nasal bridge is quite wide and thick . "
Might that not change with age ?
Or might Ms Hanson have had nose surgery ?
Perhaps , but then Dr Sutisno studied Pauline Hanson as a young child .
" She already had a thick nasal bridge . "
While the tip of Ms Hanson 's nose was " fleshy " , the other woman 's was more defined and downward - pointing .
" If Pauline was going to have surgery , you would think she would change her nose to make it look more like this young woman's . "
Psychotherapists are offering to help " cure " gays and lesbians of their homosexuality without any evidence that such treatment is beneficial or safe .
One in six said they had tried to turn gays straight , or reduce their gay or lesbian feelings , even though the mainstream medical view is that this is impossible .
The idea that homosexuality can be cured has a long and dubious history and the disclosure that a significant minority of therapists and doctors still think it is possible is " worrying " , Professor Michael King , of the University College Medical School , said .
" Heaven knows what they do .
We did n't attempt to ask them because there is no evidence that anything works .
We did n't expect it to be happening at this rate and we are really rather concerned .
It ought to stop .
It is distressing and harmful and there is absolutely no evidence it works , " he said .
A study of more than 1,400 psychiatrists and therapists in BMC Psychiatry found that 222 ( 17 per cent ) said they had treated at least one client to alter their homosexual feelings at some point .
The researchers expected the cases to be concentrated in the past , but the 400 to 500 cases recorded were distributed evenly across the decades .
" It is happening up to the present moment , " Professor King said .
It might only be the " tip of the iceberg " .

Many therapists seemed uncomfortable with giving treatment , or admitting to it .
When asked if they would attempt to change someone 's sexual orientation if requested , only one in 25 ( 4 per cent ) said they would – far fewer than the one in six who reported actually doing so .
Pressure from clients demanding help because of bullying or discrimination or family pressures may have pushed the therapists into delivering it , the professor said .
The idea that homosexuality is an aberration from the norm which can be " corrected " , rather than a natural state , was current for most of the last century .
Everyone was thought to be basically heterosexual and homosexuality was regarded as a deviation from the norm , the result of " faulty learning " in childhood .
During the 1950s and 1960s , when belief in psychological behaviourism was at its height , aversion therapy was used to " cure " homosexuals .
Male patients were given a slide show which included pictures of sexually attractive men and women and a lever that allowed them to change the slides .
If they lingered too long over the pictures of the men , and did not move on swiftly enough to the pictures of the women , they received an electric shock .
A variation of this treatment involved a drug that would make them vomit .
Aversion therapy , famously employed in Anthony Burgess 's novel A Clockwork Orange to cure Alex , the leader of the Droogs gang , of his obsession with violence , was used up to the 1980s , but has since been discredited .
Other treatments included advice to masturbate to a homosexual fantasy and then switch to a heterosexual one near orgasm .
Covert sensitisation was a method which required patients to counter homosexual thoughts with shameful fantasies of arrest by the police or discovery by their family .
Hypnotherapy and psychoanalysis were also used .
Although not uncommon , these treatments never became mainstream in Britain .
In the US , however , the idea that homosexuality can be cured retains wide support .
There is an ex-gay movement , led by right - wing Christian groups , which promotes " reparative " therapy to return people to the heterosexual " norm " .
Supporters cite findings that depression is two to three times more common among young gay men as evidence that a homosexual orientation is itself harmful – rather than the responses of bullying and discrimination that it engenders .
Professor King , head of the psycho-sexual clinic at University College Hospital in London , said : " We do not have the same attitudes in Europe .
But young people go on the internet , they see this stuff and they pop off to see a psychotherapist .
If the therapist is not wise enough to say that this is a part of them and there is nothing pathological about it , they may get seduced into trying to change them .
Instead , the therapist should be saying that it is very unfortunate they are being bullied and that they can try to help them come to terms with their situation and learn to cope with it . "
Derek Munn , of the gay rights organisation Stonewall , said : " So - called gay cure therapies are wholly discredited .
The conclusions of this research are a welcome reminder that what gay and lesbian people need is equal treatment by society , not misguided treatment by a minority of health professionals . "
A patient 's story : ' I got an electric shock if I looked at the man '
I think I always knew I was gay but there was , in the Sixties , an enormous social pressure on you not to be .
I was a day pupil at a boarding school and there was some fairly broad - minded sexual play .
Some people stayed there and some moved on to heterosexual activity – while your peer group and natural development is telling you that there is a very fuzzy edge , society is telling you that there is this very hard , black - and - white precipice .
So , it becomes an area that you do n't talk about with parents and people like that .
While I was a student back then , I had some successful heterosexual relationships .
However , during that time I got involved in a strong relationship with a school friend which went on for a long time .
When that broke up , it caused me a lot of anguish .
During my early twenties ( the early 1970s ) , I became increasingly depressed and went to my GP .
I ended up meeting one of the leading lights in treatments for homosexuality at the ( local ) university department of psychology .
He used aversion therapy and an electric shock machine that was tied to the ankles and wrists .
You then watched a number of slides , some [ of men ] which you find sexually attractive , some which [ of women ] were best identified as your heterosexual goal .
If you switch from the " gay " picture to the " heterosexual " picture then you do n't get the electric shock .
By today 's standards , the pictures used were about as stimulating as a Reader 's Digest .
Each session lasted 30 or 40 minutes and I had about 30 sessions .
In the fullness of time I got married and the sex thing ... well , it never worked out .
My wife knows about these gay feelings .
She tends to regard them as a threat in her own mind .
It 's still a very , very sensitive area .
A few casual but long - term sexual friendships ensued with people who were – almost without exception – married .
My wife knows of these encounters and has tolerated them with increasing difficulty .
Increasingly I feel betrayed by the promises of treatment .
After I left treatment where was the back up ?
My deepest feelings , the very structure of my being , had been torn apart in the name of science and left abandoned while the psychologists got on with building their own careers and lives .

Find Something Missing ?
While compiling this list , it ’s always a possibility that we missed some other great Tutorials .
Feel free to share it with us .
Are netbooks ready for productive use in large enterprises ?
Analysts say no .
They might be okay for small businesses , but netbooks are n't ready for the demanding work of big business .
" I think acceptance in the enterprise is very small , " IDC analyst Bob O'Donnell told The Standard .
" In fact , we do n't even track that .
We do believe about 7 % of netbooks are going into small business .
I do n't know of any companies standardizing on them . "
Gartner predicts that less than 1 percent of netbooks sold globally over the next two years will be shipped to businesses .
Gartner analyst Mika Kitigawa said netbooks are n't acceptable to enterprise - size companies .
" They 're made cheaply to cut costs , so you 're looking at them breaking one or two years down the road .
The hinges are n't are strong and the hard drives do n't have head - parking protection .
Also , most have Windows XP Home or Linux .
Upgrading to Windows XP costs more money . "
Anecdotally ,
The Standard found several small business owners who are happy with their netbooks , but only for light work or travel , as analysts predicted .
Enterprises were less sure about adoption , citing comfort and power as key concerns .
Dr. John Halamka , CIO of the CareGroup Health System in Boston , told The Standard he was considering the Dell Mini 9 for thin - client computing such as Web - and Citrix - based applications if " the keyboard and screen are large enough . "
His company has bought one Mini 9 , which will undergo six weeks of testing by various teams .
Consultant William Jones said he wo n't recommend netbooks to his clients , even small companies .
" Netbooks have an appealing price and form factor , but if they are not powerful enough to be primary computers , where are users supposed to turn when they need more horsepower ? "
He sees netbooks as fine for students but a passing fad for professionals .
Peter Ubriaco , owner of New York Information Systems , a software development company , was disappointed with the two Asus EEE PC netbooks he bought for employees .
" They 're excellent for computing on the go , but were too weak to support work around the office .
I definitely do find it useful for email , basic web browsing , instant messaging .
But I also need development tools like Eclipse IDE , and it just does n't feel right running slowly , on a cramped screen . "
Ubriaco did , however , recommend an Asus EEE 1000HA to one of his clients , a family - owned tire store .
" They simply wanted a laptop to get them online and that fit in a briefcase .
So far they 've been very happy with the EEE PC , since it does what they need to do at a reasonable price and inside a tiny footprint . "
Heather Lutz , a professional speaker who travels often , also loves the netbook 's size .
" My Acer Aspire One fits in the front pouch of an airline . "
She intends to outfit her entire eight - person office with netbooks .
Andy Abramson of the marcom firm Comunicano did the same thing , purchasing over a dozen Asus netbooks for employees who travel .
His Acer Aspire
One with built - in 3G AT&T broadband is perfect for certain situations .
" When I go to dinner or out for coffee , it takes up so little space and handle a lot more than an iPhone or Blackberry can do . "
This story , " Analysts : Netbooks Are n't Enterprise - Worthy " was originally published by thestandard.com .
Thaksin is living outside Thailand , but is still the focus of the protests Thailand 's government has revoked all the passports held by ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in the aftermath of the protests that paralysed Bangkok .
It leaves the exiled former leader without any legal travel documents .
An arrest warrant has also been issued for Mr Thaksin , who has been calling for a popular uprising in Thailand .
Bangkok is now calm , after clashes between troops and anti-government protesters .
Fights were also reported between residents and protesters .
At least two people were killed and more than 100 injured in the violence .
On Wednesday , Mr Thaksin published a statement calling on his followers to pursue their struggle through peaceful means .
He blamed Monday 's violent scenes in the capital solely on the government 's decision to deploy the army against his red-shirted supporters .
Status unclear
The decision to revoke Mr Thaksin 's personal passport also follows the recent disruption of a major Asian summit by his supporters .
His diplomatic passport was invalidated in December .
A government spokesman said that if a person was " doing anything that could undermine the security of the nation , then we have the right to revoke the passport " .
A state of emergency is still in force , but the streets are quiet The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the move leaves the exiled former leader with no legal travel documents - unless he can persuade another country to give him asylum .
Until now he has been living mostly in Dubai , but it is not clear what his status there will be now he has no passport , our correspondent says .
The government says it has been in talks with other countries and Interpol to try to get him sent back to Thailand , where he has been sentenced to two years in prison for abuses of power when he was in office .
He now also faces additional charges of inciting a public disturbance - for which an arrest warrant was issued by the authorities on Tuesday in the wake of the protests .
Police are still hunting 10 key protest leaders , after three others surrendered .
Secret location Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva welcomed the end of the protests on Tuesday , but said his government would remain on guard .
He is now working from a secret location because he fears an assassination attempt , our correspondent says .
Mr Abhisit has accused Mr Thaksin 's supporters of stockpiling weapons for a possible armed struggle against the government .
During the three - week - long rally , Mr Thaksin addressed the red- shirted protesters nearly every night via a video - link .
In one speech , he called for a " revolution " .
The protests shut down large parts of Bangkok , as the demonstrators called for the current government to step down and call fresh elections .

Details of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) being negotiated across the globe are now labeled as a " properly classified " national security secret by the White House , in spite of a Freedom of Information Act request .
( Source : wired.com )
Leaked Docs Suggest Massive Breach of Privacy
Leaked documents posted on WikiLeaks suggest that the proposed trade accord would criminalize peer - to - peer file sharing , subject iPods to border searches , and allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to monitor customer communications .
ACTA is a treaty ( PDF ) regarding protections on intellectual property being secretly negotiated by the European Union , the U.S. , Japan , South Korea , Canada , Mexico , Australia , Switzerland and New Zealand .
( Source : wired.com )
Trade representatives from those nations are being urged by dozens of special - interest groups to disclose the language of the evolving agreement in order to end the speculation on its content and to assist in its creation .
Too Many Questions Raised Over Secrecy
A multi-group letter ( PDF ) sent to trade representatives from the participating nations notes that due to the secrecy surrounding the text of the treaty , the public cannot determine the extent to which their concerns are validated .
Secrecy surrounding ACTA raise many concerns , including whether it will go too far .
Last fall , a couple of U.S. senators expressed the same concerns .
Illicit secrecy surrounding ACTA raises a lot of questions , making one wonder if this is really a case of ' national security ' or another matter , altogether .

No matter how long or how deep a severe economic downturn , its residual effects can still be somewhat jarring , such as when a company with annual revenues of more than $ 182 billion is worth less on the stock market than one with $ 21.8 billion in annual sales .
Over 100 years old , General Electric ( s GE ) , long the vanguard of U.S. industrial might , ended today ’s trading session with a market capitalization just a shade under $ 105 billion .
That compares with the market cap of Google ( s GOOG ) , which now stands at more than $ 108 billion .
Granted , we ’ve seen this movie before , during the last bubble , when Cisco Systems ( s CSCO ) surpassed GE .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) -
The push to boost U.S. electric generation from wind and other renewable energy sources is forcing U.S. lawmakers to address the contentious issue of whether states or the federal government should have final authority to site new power lines , industry officials said on Friday .
Six 1.5 - megawatt wind turbines are pictured at work at the Exelon - Community Energy Wind Farm at Somerset , Pennsylvania , August 10 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Stelios Varias
Denise Bode , head of the American Wind Energy Association , said national oversight of transmission development is critical to exploit the country ’s abundant wind energy resources .
Thousands of miles of new high - voltage lines will be needed to move electric generation from the windiest regions in the center of the country to power - hungry cities .
“ We need a national transmission policy , ” Bode said at the Gulf Coast Power Association conference on Friday .
She expressed optimism the issue can be resolved with legislation in the current Congress which is looking at economic and other measures to encourage renewable power to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil and to create jobs .
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission additional authority to oversee some transmission siting questions , but stopped short of giving the agency broad siting and planning responsibility .
Most power - line siting issues are handled by state regulators .
“ The issue has matured ” since that time , said Bode .
Pat Wood , former FERC chairman , said the agency is well - equipped to handle the task , given its experience regulating the nation ’s vast interstate natural gas pipeline system .
“ They were ready yesterday , ” said Wood , from the conference sidelines .
“ It has worked great for gas . ”
“ Nobody talks about it because it works , ” said Wood .
“ It ’s paid for and it ’s safe .
That is what we want for the power grid . ”
FERC ’s new siting authority has been challenged in court , so statutory changes will be needed , Wood said .
Bode also said a federal mandate calling for a percentage of the nation ’s the electric supply to come from less - polluting resources , known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) , is
needed if the administration wants to rebuild the economy with manufacturing jobs tied to wind and other clean energy sources .
“ A state - by - state RPS cannot create the national market to bring these jobs in , ” said Bode .
“ If you are trying to get manufacturing companies to grow in the U.S. , chasing an RPS in each state wo n’t work . ”
SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS , Dominican Republic —
On a dusty field in Barrio Lindo , kids shout in a mixture of Spanish and English as they chase down fly balls : “ Oye , I got it , I got it ! ”
The outfield is framed by a burning trash heap , a few stray dogs , a handful of goats and a wandering horse .
The ragtag players are wearing sandals , not cleats .
You would never know this is the Mecca of Dominican baseball , but it is .
And despite the dilapidated field and the lack of uniforms , baseball is king here .
It is the place of big dreams of the big leagues and the pride of a nation that has made baseball a lucrative commodity for export .
Starting today and into this summer , we will be documenting for GlobalPost the pursuit of the dream among teenage prospects battling for a spot in the coveted baseball academies here , seasoned trainers vying for a percentage of future signing bonuses , and hard - ball agents representing the corporate interests of Major League Baseball .
We will be following the action with video portraits and written reports in a series titled “ Dominican dreams : El barrio to the big leagues . "
Though the focus of much attention in recent years , Dominican baseball is largely misunderstood .
The classic image of impoverished children playing street - ball with cardboard gloves and wound - up sock balls has recently been overtaken by reports of scandals and corruption .
Neither portrayal adequately depicts the whole story .
What defines Dominican baseball today is a system of multi-million dollar training compounds owned by MLB teams .
While these academies may dominate the landscape , the structure of the industry is actually much more complex .
Without the traditional track to the majors provided by high school and college baseball , these facilities rely on independent and virtually unregulated trainers to supply their talent .
The number of Dominicans playing professional ball in the United States is staggering .
At the start of the 2008 season , slightly more than 10 percent of the 855 players in MLB were from the Dominican Republic ( see map below ) , making them the single largest minority in the game .
In addition , approximately one - fourth of all players in the minor leagues are from the Dominican .
The city of San Pedro alone has produced more professional baseball players per capita than any city on earth — including such stars as Robinson Cano , Alfonso Soriano and former MVPs George Bell and Julian Javier .
“ San Pedro is like the Mecca of baseball , ” says Astin Jacobo Jr. , a new type of Dominican baseball professional .
He refuses to admit that the string of highly publicized scandals accurately represents his country ’s game .
Instead , he develops and signs a bevy of young talent in a legal and healthy training environment .
Jacobo avoids the term buscon , or scout , which has become a pejorative designation implying a predatory and exploitative approach to the business , in favor of entrenador , or trainer .
Unlike coaches in the United States , entrenadores take on responsibilities that begin with identifying potential prospects and providing them with training , housing , meals and equipment .
In addition , the trainers double as scouts , managers and surrogate parents .
Moreno Tejeda , one such entrenador , explains , “ Imagine …
If they ’re hungry , you buy them something to eat .
If they do n’t have sneakers , you buy them sneakers .
I get their gloves , their cleats , whatever they need . ”
Moreno meets these demands daily for his highly touted 15 - year - old prospect Miguel Angel Sano .
In this way , entrenadores justify their 25 to 40 percent cut of their players ’ signing bonuses , a figure that is up to five times what American agents earn for signing a player .
While a player can technically sign at any time during the year if eligible , one day in the dead of summer matters more than the other 364 combined : July 2 .
On this day , the youngest players — boys who have turned 16 after August of the previous year — become old enough to sign professional contracts , and the largest signing bonuses are divvied up among the year ’s top prospects .
This year , Tejeda ’s shortstop Sano is in the running for what is rumored to be a seven - figure signing bonus .
Tejeda keeps him busy , shuffling him to and from a gamut of tryouts and showcases for the area ’s top scouts and even a few executives .
While the official amount will not be released until July 2 , trainers and teams will more than likely be talking in the weeks leading up to that day .
“ All of the scouts tell me he ’s going to be the next superstar … so we ’re going to wait until the last minute , ” Tejeda says , “ not only so that he can sign for the most money , but also to sign with whoever can give him the best opportunity . ”
Until then , Tejeda intends on keeping Sano focused .
“ I do n’t want to take away the love he has for the game by thinking about money , ” he explains , “ What I ’m interested above all is that he continues in the game . ”
In the United States , top draft prospects earn seven - figure signing bonuses between the ages of 18 and 22 .
Dominican players who fail to sign a big deal on July 2 at age 16 are significantly devalued in the prospect market thereafter .
But that does n’t mean they wo n’t get a shot at the big leagues .
Jose Serra , Latin American director for the Chicago Cubs , is one of several MLB directors who prefer to avoid the July 2 hype .
“ I ’m not focused on those players who are thinking about July 2nd , ” he says .
Alternatively , he signs players who he deems worth the investment for the Cubs — often for a fraction of their alleged July 2 value .
He continues , “ I ’ve signed players for … 50 , 60 , even 100 thousand dollars with the same ability [ of a ] player who signed for 2 million on July 2nd . ”
The intense focus on July 2 in the Dominican baseball world has both defined the country ’s training methods and encouraged its excesses .
In some cases , this has led players and trainers to fabricate birth certificates in order to qualify for July 2 - style signing bonuses .
Jacobo explains , “ When a guy ’s 18 , he ’s victimized … it gives guys motivation to be 16 . ”
Once signed , recruits will stay in an academy for two months to four years .
Such facilities offer luxuries that many players will never have previously experienced — advanced medical and dental care , hot showers and one ’s own bed .
While some academies are nothing more than a Spartan dormitory and adjacent field , other teams have invested as much as $ 12 million building verdant camps that better resemble palm tree - lined country clubs .
Behind the sunny facades of these institutions lies a highly managed baseball boot camp in which every facet of a player ’s life is purposefully controlled .
The academies are intentionally isolated in an attempt to remove all distractions .
Players spend up to eight hours a day fine - tuning their technique through a myriad of drills , games and workouts .
Serra signs between 10 and 20 players a year .
Once they are in the academy , his job is to refine the players ’ raw talent so that they can ultimately reach the United States .
“ When I sign the contract , I ’m 100 percent sure that he ’s gonna make it , ” Serra says .
“ I do n’t sign any minor leaguers .
I sign big leaguers . ”
Nonetheless , although half of the players from any given academy will make it to the States , only a handful will ever get to take a swing at a Major League pitch .
For those who do n’t make it , the cut sends them back to a precarious existence .
Most will have abandoned what little education the government provides for a chance to play baseball , and with recorded unemployment at 16 percent , decent job opportunities are rare .
However , those who do make it are fulfilling the dream of a nation .
That dream , says 15 - year - old Sano , is “ to get to the big leagues . "
" I think I can get there in three years , " says Sano , " or maybe less . ”
This article is the first part of a continuing series , “ Dominican dreams : El barrio to the big leagues , " about baseball in the Dominican Republic and the lead - up to July 2 , International Signing Day .

Latest story : Phil Spector convicted of second - degree murder
Phil Spector has been convicted of second - degree murder in the fatal shooting of actress Lana Clarkson six years ago .
An L.A. Superior Court jury reached its decision against the legendary music producer after nine days of deliberations .
An earlier jury deadlocked 10 - 2 in favor of guilt .
The decision means the 69 - year - old Spector , famed for his work with musical acts such as Tina Turner , the Beatles and the Righteous Brothers , faces at least 18 years in prison when he is sentenced .
The jury determined that Spector killed Lana Clarkson , a statuesque blond actress , on Feb. 3 , 2003 , just hours after they met in the Sunset Strip club where she worked as a hostess .
Over the course of the trial , which began in October , the prosecution portrayed Spector as a sadistic misogynist who had a three - decade “ history of playing Russian roulette with the lives of women ” when he was drunk .
A prosecutor told jurors in her summation that “ by the grace of God , five other women got the empty chamber and lived to tell .
Lana just happened to be the sixth woman who got the bullet . ”
Spector ’s defense contended Clarkson died by her own hand .
They said she was depressed over her flagging career and the accompanying financial worries , and may have committed suicide impulsively after hours of late - night drinking with Spector .
Spector arrived in court Monday wearing a " Barack Obama " button .

Twenty years ago I was standing in a football field in a school in Bradford , watching a group of mullahs burn The Satanic Verses .
I was then a university student from nearby Leeds , from where I had come with a group of Muslim protesters to gather on a cold Saturday morning in March , to chant slogans calling for the death of Salman Rushdie .
After the speeches in English and Urdu were delivered an awkward moment of inertia elapsed .
A shout went up to burn the book but the organisers seemed reluctant to begin until the camera crews from BBC Yorkshire had turned up to film them .
The protagonists were savvy enough , even then , to stage their indignation with one eye firmly on the cameras .
Islamic identity politics did not suddenly appear on the scene after the Rushdie affair .
It was already fully formed and operational in many parts of Britain like Birmingham and Bradford .
By then Britain had come a long way from the race riots that had engulfed it in the early eighties .
It was no longer a society cleaved along lines of race .
Society was undergoing the effects of multiculturalism and the focus had shifted to religious and cultural issues .
In the 1970s Asian immigrants to Britain organised their activism in a unified secular battle against racism .
But by the 1980s organisations like the Asian Youth Movement , one of the beacons of anti-racism politics , began to disintegrate as multiculturalism spread across the fabric of society .
As racism receded what replaced it was a society fragmented .
Different groups asserted their particular identities more fiercely and unelected community leaders became the handlers the government used to engage with communities identified by religion .
In From Fatwa to Jihad , Kenan Malik takes a panoramic view of England before and after the seismic events of the Rushdie affair .
In a collection of punchy chapters in razor sharp prose comes an intelligent and insightful analysis of how racism , multiculturalism , religion and terrorism has affected British society over the last twenty years .
Malik was born in India to a Muslim father and a Hindu mother and came to England when he was five .
" Like Rushdie " , he says , " I was of a generation that did not think of itself ' Muslim ' or ' Hindu ' or ' Sikh ' or even as ' Asian ' , but rather as ' black ' .
' Black ' for us was not an ethnic label but a political badge " .
Rushdie himself described The Satanic Verses as " about migration , metamorphosis , divided selves , love , death " and one of the ironies Malik returns to again and again , is to is show how Khomeini 's fatwa , rooted as it was in the illusion of tradition and immutability , transformed the religious and cultural landscape of Britain .
It was political expediency , not divine law , that motivated Khomeini to issue his fatwa in February 1989 .
His regime was struggling to retain legitimacy amongst his own followers , most of it lost to political reformists in Tehran .
Abroad , he was losing the battle for spiritual supremacy to Saudi Arabia and he was desperate to regain some of the face that he had personally lost .
The Saudis were in the ascendant with the growth of Salafi Islam , its denomination of choice and its Trojan horse into thousands of mosques and universities all over the world .
In a chapter on the growth of Islamist radicalism in the Muslim community , Malik 's commentary takes us to North Yorkshire to show us the Mullah Boys of Beeston , the gang led by Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer , two of the perpetrators of the July 7 terrorist attacks in London .
He dismisses the idea that they were compelled by foreign policy , but rather by rage , a loss of identity and getting " caught between no cultures " .
They were worldly Muslim men who had found the expression for their personal alienation in the spurious legitimacy of extremism .
In the last third of the book in , Malik delves into the restrictions of free speech in the post - Rushdie world .
As Hanif Qureishi puts it , " Nobody would have the balls today to write The Satanic Verses , let alone publish it .
Writing now is timid because writers are terrified " .
He is probably right when you consider the Muhammad cartoons scandal and Random House 's decision to retract the publication of Sherry Jones ' novel The Jewel of Medina , based on a message thread on an online discussion forum .
These are just two instances of how the grievance culture of radical Islam is winning the battle against Enlightenment values , helped along , Malik believes , by multicultural policy and laws like the Racial and Religious Hatred Act ( 2006 ) , which has made it an offence to incite hatred against a person on grounds of their religion .
Its aim was to protect the faith and dignity of minority communities .
But the paradox is that these laws are now exploited to undermine the civil liberties of those very same communities they were meant to protect .
The censorship that the anti-Rushdie protestors demanded is the same censorship of offensive thought that imprisoned the cartoon protestors .
The great appeal of From Fatwa to Jihad is its pitiless observation and it is this which raises it above the easy standards of one - sided polemic .
No one gets away – certainly not Islamic radicalism and multiculturalism and its penchant for ethnic and religious particularism , the monomaniacal Melanie Phillips and the chauvinism of Daniel Pipes and Mark Steyn are all roundly criticised .
If Malik 's book advocates anything , it is a social order based on universalist Enlightenment values , the importance of free speech and for the elevation of secular and progressive ideas within minority , particularly Muslim , communities .

Guido van Rossum has never been a big fan of this idea , and he recently unloaded a pile of reasoning as to why .
Much of this really boils down to the unsuitability of existing Python implementations as a platform for a capability version of the language , though clearly there are language features that must go , too .
There ’s more on this point from tav , but perhaps his idea of translating Capability Python into Cajita is a more fruitful course …
Anyway , what intrigued me more than the specifics was this statement from Guido
The only differences are at the library level : you cannot write to the filesystem , you cannot create sockets or pipes , you cannot create threads or processes , and certain built - in modules that would support backdoors have been disabled ( in a few cases , only the insecure APIs of a module have been disabled , retaining some useful APIs that are deemed safe ) .
All these are eminently reasonable constraints given the goal of App Engine .
And yet almost every one of these restrictions has caused severe pain for some of our users .
Securing App Engine has required a significant use of internal resources , and yet the result is still quite limiting .
Now consider that App Engine ’s security model is much simpler than that preferred by capability enthusiasts : it ’s an all - or - nothing model that pretty much only protects
Google from being attacked by rogue developers ( though it also helps to prevent developers from attacking each other ) .
Extrapolating , I expect that a serious capability - based Python would require much more effort to secure , and yet would place many more constraints on developers .
It would have to have a very attractive “ killer feature ” to make developers want to use it …
There are two important mistakes in this .
Firstly , capability enthusiasts do n’t prefer a security model in the sense that Guido is suggesting ; we prefer a way of enforcing a security model .
App Engine does this enforcement through layers of sandboxing whereas capability languages do it by not providing the untrusted code with the undesirable capabilities .
Of course , a side effect of this approach is that capabilities allow far more subtle security models ( e.g. “ you can only write this part of the file system ” or “ you can only write files a user has specifically designated ” or “ you can create sockets , but only for these destinations ” ) without much extra work and so capability enthusiasts have a tendency to talk about and think in terms of those subtler models .
However , Guido ’s all - or - nothing model can be implemented easily with capabilities – we do n’t have to be subtle if he does n’t want us to be !
This fallacy causes the second error – because the security model does not have to be subtler , there ’s no particular reason to imagine it should take any longer to implement .
Nor need it place many extra constraints on developers ( I will concede that it must place some constraints because not all of Python is capability - safe ) .
Developers are really only constrained by capability languages in the intended sense : they ca n’t do the things we do n’t want them to do .
If the security models are the same , the constraints will be the same , regardless of whether you use sandboxes or capabilities .
Incidentally , I tried to sell the idea of capabilities to the App Engine team several years ago .
Given how far we ’ve come with Caja in a year , working on a language that is definitely less suited to capabilities than Python is , I would be very surprised if we could not have done the same for Python by now .
Nokia has announced the availability Qt 4.5 , a major update of the popular development toolkit .
This version is packed with impressive new features and includes significant performance improvements .
Nokia has also delivered the first official release of Qt Creator , a lightweight development environment designed to facilitate rapid construction of Qt applications .
Qt is a cross- platform C++ development framework for graphical application development .
It is distributed under an open source license and is supported on Windows , Mac OS X , Linux , and several mobile operating systems .
It was originally created by Trolltech , a Norwegian software company that was acquired last year by Nokia .
The toolkit is popular on the Linux platform where it serves as the foundation for the KDE desktop environment and software ecosystem .
It is also used by some commercial software developers , including Google , Skype , and Adobe .
The evolution of Qt under Nokia
The licensing and business model behind Qt has evolved considerably since the toolkit was first released .
It went through several major licensing transitions and eventually ended up with a dual - license model under the GPL for open source software developers and a commercial license for proprietary software developers .
The cost of the commercial license created a steep barrier to entry for proprietary developers who wanted to adopt the toolkit .
Nokia changed this in January when the company announced plans to transition the Qt codebase to the permissive LGPL license which would broadly enable proprietary development without a commercial license .
That move is a serious game - changer for Qt as it eliminates the primary impediment that has traditionally compelled major software makers to use GTK + or other alternatives .
Qt 4.5 is the first major version of the toolkit to be released under the LGPL .
Nokia is making a lot of other changes , too .
The company is streamlining
Qt development and increasing its focus on the core toolkit at the expense of some of Trolltech 's other major offerings .
Nokia announced last month that it will discontinue Qt Jambi , a project that brought Java support to the toolkit .
Nokia is also pulling the plug on Qt Extended , Nokia 's rebranded version of Trolltech 's Linux - based Qtopia mobile platform build .
The demise of Qt Extended is not particularly surprising , because Nokia is already investing heavily in its Linux - based Maemo platform and in the Symbian operating system , which Nokia recently acquired for the purpose of transitioning it to an open source development model .
Maemo and Symbian both have Qt ports .
It 's worth noting that these abandoned projects are n't going to disappear entirely .
Nokia intends to merge some of the features of Qt Extended back into the toolkit so that those capabilities can be used in Qt applications across all supported platforms .
Nokia is also making source code fully available so that existing Qt Extended and Jambi users can form their own community - driven development efforts around the projects and perpetuate or expand them as needed .
Although there have been some rough spots , it seems like Nokia 's stewardship has generally had a very positive impact on the toolkit .
Nokia is clearly committed to moving it forward and is actively expanding development .
New features
WebKit enhancements
The last major version of the toolkit introduced support for the QtWebKit module , which enables application developers to embed Apple 's open source WebKit HTML rendering engine directly into Qt applications .
It provides a high - level QWebView widget that has a self - contained WebKit renderer with full support for bidirectional communication between JavaScript and native code .
QtWebKit has been greatly enhanced in Qt 4.5 .
The developers have merged in some of the latest improvements from the WebKit trunk and have also implemented support for a nice assortment of important features from emerging web standards , including HTML 5 and CSS3 .
One of the most exciting additions is the inclusion of Squirrel Fish , WebKit 's fast new JavaScript engine .
I conducted several tests to see how it compares to other WebKit implementations .
It gets 100/100 on Acid 3 , but does n't quite fully pass yet .
I also tried it out with a bunch of CSS 3 features — such as text - shadow and RGBA color — and several of the non-standard WebKit CSS capabilities , including gradients and reflections .
It handled these well , which seems to indicate that it is a bit ahead of Chrome and on par with the GTK +
WebKit port in the area of CSS support .
QtWebKit also got lots of new support for rich media content in this version .
The Netscape plugin API has been implemented , which means that it is now possible to embed Flash content in Qt applications and display it in the QWebView widget .
The Qt developers also implemented native HTML 5 video and audio support by leveraging the Phonon multimedia framework as a rendering backend .
As the web becomes an increasingly central part of the computing experience , desktop software will have to adapt to provide better integration with web content and services .
This trend is driving the growth of rich Internet application ( RIA ) frameworks such as Adobe AIR .
Qt 's pervasive support for web technologies — including WebKit , CSS theming , XML support , and JavaScript extensibility — at several different layers of the toolkit stack make it a compelling option for rapid development of RIAs .
Qt Creator
In addition to releasing Qt 4.5 , Nokia has also launched Qt Creator , an open source integrated development environment ( IDE ) for building Qt applications .
Qt Creator is a relatively new project , but it 's already pretty useful and robust .
We were impressed back in November when we got our first look at an early technical preview .
It has matured a bit since then and has gotten some much - needed QA love that makes it stable enough for day - to - day use .
Qt Creator provides end - to - end support for the entire Qt application development workflow .
It has a project generator , tight integration with Qt Designer , support for code editing with autocompletion and syntax highlighting , and a built - in breakpoint debugger .
The user interface has a few really handy features , such as a search system that can be used to speed up navigation and quickly get to individual methods in source code .
Qt Creator is supported on Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X .
The binaries are distributed as part of an SDK bundle that also includes the toolkit and various dependencies .
The installers are a bit large : 194MB on Windows , roughly 269MB on Linux , and 430 MB on Mac OS X. Installation is relatively painless and intuitive .
The Windows bundle unfortunately lacks support for using Visual Studio 's compiler .
Instead , it comes with a MinGW toolchain .
This can be problematic in some cases because there are certain features of Qt , including Phonon , that do n't work in MinGW .
It will not be possible to use Qt Creator on Windows to develop or compile applications that use those features .
Despite the limitations , Qt Creator is pretty good and it serves an important function .
It makes it easier for new developers to get started , because it provides a complete build environment right out of the box and it automates a lot of the trickier aspects of Qt development that might create challenges for the uninitiated .
1933 : Although it will be another eight months before Prohibition is officially repealed , this is a red - letter day for beer drinkers .
Suds containing up to 3.2 percent alcohol by weight are legally obtainable again , without having to get the glad eye from some guy behind a peep hole and telling him , " Louie sent me . "
President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's signature repealed the Volstead Act , legalizing 3.2 percent beer .
It also paved the way for the December ratification of the 21st Amendment , which repealed the 18th Amendment and deep - sixed Prohibition altogether .
The Volstead Act , which is how the National Prohibition Act was widely known , was pushed hard by religious and temperance groups and passed Congress in 1919 over the veto of President Woodrow Wilson .
The prohibition movement had been active in the United States for 80 years before its adherents finally succeeded in ramming through an outright national ban on alcohol .
The original movement lost some steam during the Civil War ( soldiers drink ; deal with it ) but was revived with a vengeance by the Prohibition Party and Woman 's Christian Temperance Union .
Conservative Protestant groups formed the backbone of the prohibition movement , although dissenters popped up within that branch of Christianity .
Scandinavian Lutherans , for example , favored proscribing alcohol , while their German brethren opposed any ban .
The Baptists ?
They loved the idea , Northern and Southern alike .
In any case , Prohibition was another instance of a motivated minority forcing its self - righteous views on the amorphous mass that is the unthinking , perhaps nonthinking , American public .
Passage of a prohibition act , however , did nothing to slake the drinking man 's thirst for alcohol .
So the practical effect of Prohibition was to serve as a boon to organized crime during the Roaring ' 20s , with bootlegging and illegal speakeasies flourishing all over the country .
Al Capone began his criminal career as a bootlegger , before diversifying his portfolio .
Bootleggers smuggled legit booze , but could also get pretty creative in concocting home - brewed liquor .
The quality of this stuff , known generically as bathtub gin ( gin being the most popular distilled beverage of the day ) , varied widely .
The worst of it could be lethal .
With the stock market crash in 1929 and the coming of the Great Depression , opposition to Prohibition intensified .
Plenty of people needed a drink now .
The so - called Noble Experiment had run its course , and FDR was more than happy to heap dirt into its grave .
Except for the bluenoses and the crooks , Prohibition 's repeal was greeted enthusiastically by most Americans .

やっと 、Yコンビネータが何を意味するものなのか、どういう意義があるのかがわかりました。
名前を使わず再帰ができますよ！というだけのものじゃなかったのですね。
まずλありき 関数の話をしたいのです 。
そのとき、いちいち hoge(x ) = x * 2 としてhogeを・・・、とか名前をつけて話を進めるのがめんどうなので、関数を値としてあらわすと便利ということで、λという値を定義するのです。
そうすると、上のhoge関数なんかはλ(x )( x*2)などとあらわせますが、引数をあらわすのに( )
を使うといろいろまぎらわしいので、 λx.x*2 のように表記します。
というのがλ 。
このとき、λになにかわたされたら、引数としてあらわされる部分を単純におきかえます。 ( λx. x * 2 ) y とあった ら、xの部分をy でおきかえて ( λx.x * 2 ) y → y * 2 となります。λの引数部分を与えられた引数で置き換えることを簡約といいます。 ( λx.xは暑いね ) 今日 →今日は暑いね です。式が複雑になっても、冷静に置き換えれば大丈夫です。
これを動くコードで書くので、Javaで匿名クラス使いまくって書くのもいいんだけど、無意味にわけわからなくなるので、今回はGroovy使います。
Groovyだとこんな感じ {x -> x * 2}
引数なんてひとつで十分だよね 関数には複数の引数をとるものがあります。
たとえばこんな感じ。 def func( x , y) {x + y} ここで、たとえばy を
3に固定すると、引数ひとつの関数がつくれます。 def add3 ( x ) {func( x , 3 ) }
けど、この3の部分も指定できるようにしたいので、あとで指定してねという感じで、引数ひとつとる関数を返してしまいます。 def add( x ) { {y -> func( x , y ) }} そうすると、add( 5)としたときに引数をひとつとる関数を返してきます。なので(add(5 ))(3)とするとx+yが計算されるようになります。
クロージャで書き直すとこうです。 def add = {x -> {y -> func( x , y ) }}
こうやって、複数の引数をとる関数を1引数の関数に変換することをカリー化といいます。カリー化のおかげで、関数のことを考えるときは1引数の関数だけを考えればいいということになります。
やったね ！
λで条件分岐できるよね カリー化のおかげで、λはひとつの引数をとる場合だけを考えればいいことになりました。
ここで、こんな関数を導入してみます。 true=λx.λy.x false=λx.λy.y そうすると、変数bがtrueかfalseをとるとして b(0 ) (1 ) とすると、bがtrueのとき0、falseのとき1を返します。
λで条件分岐ができた！
Groovy で書くとこう。 def tr = {x -> {y ->
x}} def fl = {x -> {y -> y}} ついでに 、booleanか らλ版true / falseに変換するboolという関数を作っておきます。 def bool = {b -> b ? tr : fl} そうすると、こんな感じで条件分岐が確認できます。 > bool ( 3 < 4 ) ( 2 ) ( 5 ) 2 > bool ( 3 < 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 5 ) 5 条件分岐しました ！
補 足( 2011/11/16 ) > tr( 2 ) ( 5 ) とする と2が > fl ( 2 ) ( 5 ) とすると5が返りますね。
そうすると > var b=tr > b( 2 ) ( 5 ) 2 > var b=fl > b( 2 ) (5 ) 5 のようにbがtrなら2が、flなら5が返ります。
あとは、比較演算子をここでラムダで定義するのは面倒なので、Groobyのbooleanをtr/flに変換する関数boolを作っています。
比較演算子は、あとで出る引き算と同じ感じで定義することができます。
λでループは？ 条件分岐ができたら、ループもやりたい！ここで出てくるのがYコンビネータです。
定義をそのまま書くと、こう。深く追わないのが吉。 Y=λf .(λx.f( xx ) ) ( λx. f( xx ) ) で、ここに関 数Mを考えてYを適用させるとこうなります。 YM = λf .( λx.f( xx ) ) ( λx. f( xx ) ) M → ( λx . M( xx ) ) ( λx . M( xx ) ) → M ( λx . M( xx ) ( λx . M( xx ) ) ) MをYMに適用させるとこうなります。YMを上ででてきた２番目の式に置き換えてみます。
M( YM ) = M( λx . M( xx ) ) ( λx . M( xx ) ) これは、 上 のYMの変換と同じです。このことから、こうなります。
M( YM ) =YM 関数にその関数自身を適用させるときにYを適用させておくと、そのまま同じものが帰ってくるので、Yを不動点演算子といいます。
これを使うとλで再帰関数が表現できるようになります。再帰関数が表現できるということは、ループができるということです。条件分岐とループができるということは、あらゆる計算ができるということです。
λで計算ができることがわかりました！
Yコンビネータ をGroovy で書くとこうなります。 def Y = {f -> {x -> f( x ( x ) ) }( {x -> f( x ( x ) ) } ) }
こいつを使ってフィボナッチをやってみましょう。 > println Y( {f -> {n -> n < 2 ? n : f( n - 1 ) + f( n - 2 ) }} ) (7 ) Exception in thread " main " java.lang.StackOverflowError ぬぬ、スタックオーバーフロー。
これは、式がそのまま評価されてしまうことに問題があるようです。そこで遅延評価するための変換をいれてみます。
mをかましてみます。 def Z = {f -> {x -> {m -> f( x ( x ) ) ( m ) }}( {x -> {m -> f( x ( x ) ) ( m ) }} ) } そうすると、無事フィボナッチができます。 > println Z ( {f -> {n -> n < 2 ? n : f( n - 1 ) + f( n - 2 ) }} ) (7 ) 13 この変換を行ったものはZコンビネータというらしいです。ブログでみかける「Yコンビネータできたよ！」は、だいたいZコンビネータができています。
せっかくboolも作ったことなので、それを使ってみましょう。 > println YY( {f -> {n -> bool(n < 2 ) ( n ) ( f( n - 1 ) + f( n - 2 ) ) }} ) (7 ) Exception in thread " main " java.lang.StackOverflowError ぬぬ、またしてもオーバーフロー
これは、boolで真の場合も偽の場合の式もその場で評価されてしまって無限ループになってしまうためで、やっぱり遅延評価しないといけません。 > println YY( {f -> {n -> bool(n < 2 ) ( {n} ) ( {f ( n - 1 ) + f( n - 2 ) } ) ( ) }} ) ( 7 ) 13 ということで、条件分岐とループが関数だけでできてしまいました。やりましたね！
数字もλであらわすよ さて、制御構造がλであらわせたのですが、まだいろいろとλじゃないものが残っています。ということで、数字もλで表しましょう。
0=λf.λx.x 1=λf.λx.f(x ) 2=λf.λx.f( f( x ) ) のように、関数fが値xに何回適用されたかで自然数を表します。チャーチの数字といいます。チャーチえらい！
これ をGroovyで書いてみます。 def zero = {f -> {x ->
x}} def one = {f -> {x -> f( x ) }} def two = {f -> {x -> f( f( x ) ) }} これを整数に置き換えるには、0に+1が何回適用されたかという風に考えればいいので、こんな感じです。 > println zero( {x -> x + 1 } ) (0 ) 0 > println one ( {x -> x + 1} ) (0 ) 1 > println two ({x -> x + 1} ) (0 ) 2 この、チャーチ数から整数への変換の関数を作っておきましょう。 def toInt = {n -> n( {x -> x + 1 } ) (0 ) }
で、すべての数字をいちいち定義するわけにもいかないので、1増やす演算をしてみます。 succ = λx.λf.λx.f( n f x ) とあらわせます 。
Groovy で書くとこう。 def succ = {n -> {f -> {x -> f( n( f ) ( x ) ) }}} 試してみます。 > println to Int ( succ ( two ) ) 3 増えました ！
フィボナッチしたいので、足し算したいですね。足し算はこうです。 add = λm.λn.λf.λx.nf(m f x )
Groovy で書けばこう。 def add = {m -> {n -> {f -> {x -> n( f( m(f ) ( x ) ) ) }}}} 試してみます > println toInt ( add ( two ) ( two ) ) 4 足せました ！
さてλだけでフィボナッチ フィボナッチやるには、比較や引き算もλでやる必要があります。
ということで、まず同値比較。ただ、同値比較はGroovy版λだけではだめで、一旦整数に変換しました。関数が同値かどうかをGroovyで判定できないので仕方ない。できるのかな？λ項の同値関係を判定するアルゴリズムが難しそう。
ということで、こんな関数を導入します。 def eq = {x -> {y -> toInt ( x ) == toInt (y ) ?
tr : fl}} そうすると、こう使えます。 > println eq ( one ) ( two ) ( " わん " ) ( " つー " ) つー > println eq( succ ( one ) ) ( two ) ( " わん " ) ( " つー " ) わん
さて、問題は引き算です。1引く関数を定義します。今回はZコンビネータ使ってループしました。 def pred = Z( {g -> {n -> {m -> eq (m ) ( succ(n ) ) ( { n} ) ( {g( succ ( n ) ) ( m ) } ) ( ) }}} ) ( zero ) 使ってみます。 > println toInt ( pred ( add ( two ) ( two ) ) ) 3 おー、引き算ができたようです。
ということで、フィボナッチの準備ができたので、やってみます。 def fib = Z ( {f -> {n -> ( eq ( n ) ( zero ) ( {zero} ) ( eq ( n ) ( one ) ( {one} ) ( { plus ( f ( pred ( n ) ) ) ( f( pred ( pred ( n ) ) ) ) } ) ) ) ( ) }} ) できた！カッコだらけ でLISPみたい！
ためしてみます。 > println toInt ( fib ( add ( two ) ( add ( two ) ( two ) ) ) ) 8 > println toInt ( fib ( succ ( add ( two ) ( add ( two ) ( two ) ) ) ) ) 13
おー、これで基本的にλだけでフィボナッチができました！
Chocolate can be addictive , and eating it is fattening – which is why a Harvard professor has helped create a cigarette - like chocolate inhaler that allows users to take a puff of their favorite treat whenever they want .
The product , called Le Whif , is a way to get chocolate without the calories , says David Edwards , a professor at Harvard University and the lead inventor of the product .
And it is an experiment and adventure in gastronomy .
" The idea here is to move beyond the fork and the knife and think about inhaling food , " he says .
" Each whiff here fills your your mouth but has less than a calorie and is yet almost all pure chocolate .
It tastes good . "
Until recently , food particles could not be made small enough to get airborne and not offer the risk of choking , says Edwards .
But his team claims to have found a way to offer super - tiny particles of chocolate through an inhaler .
" The typical particle size for us is 80 to 300 microns , " he says .
But the technology means that Le Whif does n't come cheap .
A pack of 24 Whifs is currently available for about $ 52 and is available through online orders only .
Le
Whif will have a launch party in Paris for the product on April 29 .
The chocolate inhalers will come in four flavors : mint chocolate , raspberry chocolate , mango chocolate , and milk chocolate .
The goal is n't to replace the average Lindt chocolate bar but to enhance the chocolate experience , says Edwards .
" It 's a great diet thing or wonderful with coffee or it can be handed out as a gift at parties , " he says .
Consider us sold for a snort from this chocolate pipe .

Top economist Steve Bundred
Audit Commission chief executive Steve Bundred , who is in charge of monitoring how taxpayers ' cash is used , said the next Government could face an economic Doomsday scenario .
It would immediately have to start paying back cash Labour has spent bailing out banks and trying to pump life into the economy .
National debt would otherwise add up to 65 per cent of Gross Domestic Product by 2010 - 11 .
He added : " At that scale of indebtedness , the Armageddon scenario most feared by the Treasury - that there will be insufficient lenders to match the planned level of borrowing - begins to look a distinct possibility . "
An all - round collapse in lending caused by over - borrowing would leave families , businesses and the Government with no credit at all .
Britain would be forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bail - out , which it might not be able to provide .
In effect , the UK would be bankrupt .
Before the downturn began , total public debt was just 36.3 per cent .
The EU caps member states at 60 per cent .
Mr Bundred added : " That 's why tax increases and spending cuts are inevitable immediately after the election , assuming that there are signs of economic recovery by then . "
He said in a newspaper article that the Government had already breached internationally agreed definitions of " reckless " fiscal policy .
Compared with what lies in the future , earlier recessions like the 1970s could " look like days of wine and roses quite soon " .
Mr Bundred warned : " Any managers of a public service who are not planning now on the basis that they will have substantially less money to spend in two years time are living in cloud cuckoo land . "
Shadow Treasury Minister Greg Hands said : " This is yet more evidence of how Gordon Brown did not fix the roof while the sun was shining and why the country desperately needs a Government that will ensure both fiscal discipline and spending restraint . "

The Cucumber King of Burma
I ’m sure this is n’t the first time you ’ve been told that certain members of the ruling classes are weird , but this might be the first time you ’ve heard some of these exceptionally strange tales of royal weirdness .
In 931 , King Theinhko of Burma ate the cucumbers of a local villager without asking first .
The angry farmer murdered Theinhko and then took over the throne as King Nyanng -u Sawrahan .
The queen welcomed him , in an effort to prevent political unrest .
Nyanng -u was forever after known as ‘ The Cucumber King . ’
He reigned over Burma for 33 years until he was overthrown .
Nine Months of French Bastards
King Philip Augustus of France was married to his second wife , Ingeborg of Denmark , in 1193 .
Sadly , Augustus found Ingeborg to be absolutely revolting and filed for a divorce on the grounds that the marriage was not yet consummated .
His wife , however , argued that they had consummated the marriage .
As a result , Pope Celestine III refused to grant the king a divorce .
Philip was not easily defeated .
He ignored the decision and went on to marry Agnes of Marania .
The pope ordered him to return to Ineborg and to make his point , he imposed an interdict on December 12 , 1199 .
During this time , all churches were closed and the pope determined that as long as the king was n’t sleeping with his wife , his subjects were not allowed to sleep with theirs .
As a result , all children born in this period were deemed illegitimate .
The interdict continued until September 7 , 1200 –resulting in nine months of bastards born in France .
Augustus eventually did return to Ineborg , but not until 1213 .
A Dead Woman Crowned Queen
The Ghastly Death of Mary Queen of Scots
A Strange ‘ Divine Right ’
Louis The XIV ’s Enema Obsession
Ines de Castro was a loving mistress to Dom Pedro , heir of the Portuguese throne .
Unfortunately , the current ruler , King Alfonso , was paranoid that the pair was plotting against him and ordered Ines to be assassinated in 1355 .
When Pedro was crowned as king in 1357 , his love for Ines had not yet faded .
He sought revenge on the assassins and made them suffer through horrendous tortures .
That was n’t enough though , Pedro was still determined that Ines should take her seat beside him as queen .
He had her body exhumed , dressed in proper royal attire and the entire candlelit coronation ceremony proceeded as usual .
Ines ’s body was anointed and crowned , the subjects were made to swear allegiance to her , and the nobles were required to kneel and kiss her cold , two - years - dead hand .
If you ever played Bloody Mary in the mirror as a youth , you know that it is quite a terrifying ghost story .
While there are many proposed “ Marys ” that could be referenced in the story , Mary Queen of Scots has a terrifying ghost story thanks to her botched execution .
On February 8 , 1587 , Mary was led to the execution block .
The executioner , likely drunk , failed to knock off her head on the first blow .
Instead , he hit the back of her head , at which time , her servants reported that she muttered “ Sweet Jesus . ”
He managed to remove her head on the second blow and he lifted her head up by the auburn hair on her head , right then , her head fell from his hands , revealing that she actually had short gray hair covered by thick wig .
Also strange , her lips continued moving for the next fifteen minutes , likely caused by a nerve damaged during the first execution attempt .
As if all this was n’t enough , Mary ’s dog was discovered to be hiding under her skirts .
When the pet was pulled out , it insisted on lying between the shoulders and decapitated head of her body .
Eventually , Mary ’s servants took the dog , but not until it was thoroughly soaked in its dead master ’s blood .
Even for the people of the time , jaded from by frequent public executions , Mary ’s beheading was full of exceptionally terrifying surprises .
Normally a king ’s “ divine rights ” seem to include things like violating virgins and taking food and money , however , in 1627 , Charles I decided to declare rights of a much different nature .
He ordered all of his subjects to turn in their urine to official collectors once a day in the summer and once every other day in the winter .
These collections were to help the country create saltpeter , a component of gunpowder .
Charles also claimed rights to all soil loaded with animal waste .
The so - called ‘ Saltpeter Men ’ were permitted to dig up the floors of stables , slaughterhouses and other areas without permission of the property owners .

The King of Debt
Theodore this moral learned ere dead :
Fate poured its lessons on his living head ,
Bestowed a kingdom , and denied him bread .
Madness Doth Not A Kingdom Make
The Long - Lasting Legacy of Nobility
Technicalities Galore
Imagine trying to hold a conversation with someone receiving an enema .
Now imagine that someone was King and he was holding court throughout the experience .
King Louis XIV was known for performing this type of activity regularly .
The enema was a quite popular medical procedure at this time , but few people seemed to love the activity nearly as much as the king who is said to have received over 2,000 enemas throughout his lifetime – many of them in public .
King Theodore of Corsica was n’t much of a king .
For one thing , he was n’t nobility by birth , he was merely a soldier who asked to be king in exchange for helping aid the Corsicans in a revolt .
When the revolt had proven to be ineffective and a the Genovese government put a price on his head , Theodore started to lose popularity amongst his people .
He decided that he would be better off ruling overseas .
Unfortunately , once he left the country , he was never able to return to his kingdom .
Eventually , he ended up in debtors prison in Amsterdam , and later , London .
He was freed from Holland ’s prison easy enough , but the only way he could earn release from the London jail was by giving Corsica to his creditors .
When he died in London in 1756 , his epitaph read :
After his death , an opera was made from his tale in 1784 .
Additionally , ‘ King Theodore of Corsica ’ started to be used as a nickname for gin , joining the ranks of ‘ Cuckold ’s Comfort ’ as a slang for the drink .
Nouvelle France was a South American territory also called the Kingdom of Araucanìa and Patagonia .
The area ’s first ( and only ) king , elected in 1860 , was Orelie - Antoine de Tounens , a French lawyer .
He supported the local people ’s efforts to resist takeover by Chile and Argentina .
The people of the area , called Mapuche , thought that Tounens may help aid their cause as he was a skilled European negotiator .
He helped the locals draft a constitution and mint coins , but Chile largely ignored him .
Tounens tried to convince France to come to his aid and after a short investigation , they determined him to be crazy .
He was arrested by the Chilean government within two years of becoming king .
France managed to secure his release from prison by convincing his jailers that he was insane .
After his release , he was deported back to France and Tounens then spent the rest of his life trying to take over his kingdom again .
In 1869 , he made it back to the country , but soon returned to France to gather more money .
Tounens attempted to return two more times afterward , but both times he was captured by Chilean authorities and deported .
He eventually died in squalor in France in 1878 .
His relatives periodically continued to claim their rightful place as ruler of the country , although the most recent heir has renounced the claim .
Since the establishment of Nouvelle France , no sovereign state has ever recognized the territory as a legitimate country .
In 1888 , Charles - Marie David de Mayrena elected himself Marie the First , King of the Sedang .
Marie was an eccentric French adventurer and he arranged his kingdom to rule over a number of small tribes .
King Marie declared the official religion of the country to be Roman Catholic although most of its residents were Muslims and he later adopted the Islamic faith himself .
He awarded titles of nobility to his supporters during his two - year rule .
He attempted to trade his kingdom to the French , English and Belgium governments in exchange for a trading monopoly , but he received little interest .
When he tried to return to his kingdom though , the French prevented him from entering any port in Indochina .
He died in 1890 , and the details of this death remain a mystery –some sources claim it was by duel , others say it was poison and yet other reports argue he was bitten by a snake .
Over 100 years later , the Assembly for the Restoration of the Sedang Nobility was established in Montreal in 1995 .
This group consisted of descendants of those who bestowed with titles of nobility by King Marie .
The organization claims it seeks to “ re-establish and promote the social institutions of monarchy and nobility and practice their principles in a world which has largely forgotten them : chivalry , honor , duty , loyalty , respect , enlightenment , tolerance . ”
At the same time , they are glad to renounce their claims to the territory , admitting it is undisputedly part of Vietnam .
Three years later , they changed their name to the Sedang Royalist Assembly .
Although genealogists helped the group find an heir of King Marie , the descendant was uninterested in claiming his title .
This organization is still around and is headquartered in Montreal .
What happens when your country ’s official constitution and other historical documents fail to mention one small town ?
If that unmentioned village happens to be Seborga ( flag shown above ) , you may end up with an “ independent principality ” smack dab in the middle of your country .
The area , that should be part of Italy , declared its independence in 1967 and elected the head of the flower growing collective , Giorgio Carbone , to be the country ’s head of state or “ Giorgio I , Prince of Seborga . ”
Giorgio is officially addressed as “ Your Tremendousness ” by his followers .
Giorgio and other members of the village claim that Seborga was never incorporated into Italy .
Although it was sold to the king of Savoy and Sardinia in 1729 , the sale was not registered .
On top of that , the Congress of Vienna in 1815 , the 1861 Act of Unification and the constitution written in 1946 all fail to mention Seborga .
Scholars have proven that regardless , the area is still part of Italy , but Seborgians defy this logic .

Nissan ’s Updated Four - Door Sports Car
Nissan has long referred to the Nissan Maxima as a four - door sports car .
Although that sounds like great marketing gibberish , the Maxima sadly has often missed the mark in its ability to live up to its name .
However , the all - new 2009 Nissan Maxima Boston may be a different story .
Nissan ’s new Maxima offers a 290 - horsepower engine , delivering 35 horsepower more than the outgoing model .
This is important considering that the smaller and cheaper Nissan Altima had been quicker than the Maxima until this latest redesign .
The engine for the new Nissan Altima , is mated to a newly tuned Continuously Variable Transmission that has been tweaked for performance driving .
Along with sporty 19 - inch tires , Massachusetts Nissan dealers say the new Maxima will zoom to 60 mph is under 7 seconds , which is n’t bad considering the new model ’s size .
Helping to provide even more sporty driving dynamics is the shortened wheelbase and widened stance which according to Boston Nissan dealers will help make the new Maxima more nimble in corners .
Additionally , the chassis has been stiffened up and the engine has been mounted lower in the body to help the new Maxima take on corners more efficiently .
The new CVT transmission also comes with paddle shifters with the steering wheel , which enables the driver to mimic a standard six - speed transmission .
This advanced feature has been adored by customers among Manchester Nissan dealers that love the CVT ’s bled of efficiency and sportiness .
The steering ratio is also quicker , providing incredible responsiveness , perhaps a bit too much .
The new Nissan Maxima ’s styling should also appeal to plenty of potential buyers , thanks to its aggressive stance and muscular fender flares .
In fact , the styling is more in - line with Nissan ’s Infiniti brand than Nissan admit new car buyers at one Boston Infiniti dealership .
Nissan has also made ample improvements to the interior , with premium leather seating and plenty of electric gizmos , such as a rear view camera , and Bluetooth connectivity .
Priced in the mid to high $ 30,000 range , the new Maxima is n’t cheap , but it does have the panache and driving dynamics of a true four - door sports car .

It seems that British scientists are to be the first in the world to develop synthetic human blood .
It was reported that the synthetic blood was created from embryonic stem cells .
The discovery means that it would be possible to create an unlimited amount of blood , which could help perform emergency transfusions without the risk of infection .
Due to the fact that stem cells multiply indefinitely , doctors will be able to create as much blood as it is required .
It is worth mentioning that the cells are created from universal donor embryos and due to the fact that they have never been inside a human , the cells do not include any infections .
The project of the British scientists is going to be led by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service .
It involves the participation of NHS Blood and Transplant and the Wellcome Trust , which is the largest medical research charity in the world .
In an interview , a spokeswoman for the National Blood Service for England and North Wales said that the official announcement is being held by the legal issues rather than the research itself .
According to a spokesman for the Wellcome Trust , the intricate legal issues are currently being solved among all the parties that are involved in the research , reports The Independent .
Scientists look forward to test human embryos that were left over from the in - vitro fertilization treatment .
The test will help researchers identify embryos that are genetically programmed to grown into the O - negative blood group .
To note that the O - negative is the universal blood group that can be transfused into any patient , with no risk of negative response from the tissue .
This blood group is quite rare , but it can be created in unlimited amounts from embryonic stem cells , due to the fact that , in laboratory conditions , these cells can multiply indefinitely .

“ Clean coal is supported by the coal industry .
The most trusted name in coal ! ”
There is no such thing as “ clean coal ” in the U.S. today .
Coal is responsible for 32 % of CO2 emissions in this country and 83 % of the CO2 emissions from producing our electricity .
In theory , we could retrofit this nation ’s coal plants to capture their pollution and store it .
Here is my question :
If every single coal plant needs to be revamped to be truly “ clean , ” why not just invest that time and money in truly clean , renewables ?
Despite the truth about coal , America ’s coal industry spends millions of dollars to convince us that coal is the solution to our energy needs .
The folks fighting these guys do n’t have millions of dollars , but we do have a voice , and we can pull together to spread the word about the clean coal myth .
Take Action
If you ’ve seen a claim about clean coal that feels less than true , This is Reality wants to hear from you !
The first step in fighting the coal industry ’s message is debunking any outright lies .
You can also get involved with Repower America , who is working towards making clean , renewable electricity a reality .
Not only are renewables better for our air , our drinking water , and the planet we live on , initiatives like Repower America will create jobs building a new energy infrastructure .
Reports that wind energy jobs have surpassed jobs in coal mining makes moving beyond coal look as good for the economy as it is for the environment !
There are also individual actions we can all take .
Since we burn most of our coal for electricity , cutting your electricity use is a great way to help !
Twilight Earth has some great tips to get you stared on cutting back your carbon .
You can also take steps to make your home more energy efficient .
Spread the word !
Our voices are our biggest defense against the coal industry ’s clever message .

TwitterAuth has been out for a little while and has received some great feedback .
Dr. Nic released a great template that lets you quickly build a TwitterAuth app for deployment to SliceHost and since I have some plans for a number of Twitter applications I wanted to try my own hand at writing one up .
If you have Rails 2.3 , all you need to do is run this :
rails -m http://github.com/mbleigh/rails-templates/raw/master/twitterapp.rb yourappname 1 rails - m http : //github.com/mbleigh/rails-templates/raw/master/twitterapp.rb yourappname
Changing yourappname to the directory in which you want to generate your application .
The template will then prompt you for three things :
What is your application called ?
Just give it a title for the pretty template generators .
Just give it a title for the pretty template generators .
OAuth Consumer Key :
The consumer key that you register at http://twitter.com/oauth_clients
The consumer key that you register at http://twitter.com/oauth_clients
OAuth Consumer Secret
It will also ask you if you want to install missing gems and go ahead and generate your databases and run migrations .
Once you ’ve responded through the prompts though , you ’re good to go !
Just switch to your application ’s directory and script / server .
Your http://localhost:3000 should look like this :
When you click on Login via Twitter you will be taken to the Twitter OAuth approval page .
Twitter will then send you back to your application , and guess what ?
You ’re logged in !
You can now build on top of this without having to worry about the basic authentication stack .
If you are n’t familiar with TwitterAuth , it works a lot like RESTful Authentication , so it should be easy to pick up .
Enjoy , and I hope you find it useful !

Citigroup is teetering , with a stock price lower than Johan Santana ’s earned run average and a brand synonymous with “ bank bailout . ”
But its name will still grace the Mets ’ new ballpark , Citi Field , when the season starts next month .
The same cannot be said of the subway station at the ballpark ’s doorstep .
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had once hoped that a bit of Citigroup ’s $ 400 million endorsement pact with the Mets might trickle down their way , through a naming rights deal of their own for the station .
But those hopes evaporated with the bank ’s near - collapse and the Mets ’ refusal to share the wealth .
So on Tuesday , transit officials informed the Mets that when the subway station ( currently named after the team ’s former home , the now - demolished Shea Stadium ) was rechristened , it would not actually use the name of the new ballpark .
Instead , the station , on the No. 7 line , will be called simply Mets / Willets Point .
New signs will go up soon replacing the old signs , which say Willets Point / Shea Stadium .
The nearby Long Island Rail Road station will be renamed in the same way .
ASPARTAME CONCERNS - JUNK SCIENCE , QUACK DOCTORS ?
PART 1
By : Devvy May 16 , 2004 NewsWithViews.com Quack Doctors ?
NewsWithView.com recently ran a news piece on Donald Rumseld and Aspartame which brought a sizable amount of mail to their editor 's desk .
The bulk of it was from people thanking NewsWithViews for getting this important information out to the general public .
However , there were a few knee jerk reactions ( " Are you for real ... pure horses__t . " ) which prompted me to write this piece .
Aspartame is a very serious health issue and those who ignore the warnings may deeply regret it someday .
Before we begin , I am compelled to point out the difference between a news item , a column or op - ed commentary .
A news item is just that .
It 's not a research paper nor a dissertation on any subject .
Certain facts are presented without commentary .
One whiner complained the news piece was full of political bias .
In my opinion , it was not .
Everyone should be accountable for their actions regardless of who they are or what political party they belong to because no one is above the law .
Quack doctors
One whiner screeched that the doctors in the news article were a bunch of quacks and kooks .
Below is factual information on some of the doctors referenced in the news piece : John W. Olney , M.D. , professor of psychiatry and neuropathology at Washington University in St. Louis and the first occupant of the John P. Feighner Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology .
Olney received a bachelor 's degree in 1956 and a medical degree in 1963 from the University of Iowa .
Olney arrived at Washington University as a resident in psychiatry in 1964 .
He joined the faculty as an instructor of psychiatry and became a full professor of psychiatry and neuropathology in 1977 .
Olney was a recipient of the Wakeman Award for Research in Neuroscience in 1992 , the Society for Biological Psychiatry Lifetime Achievement Award and the St. Louis Academy of Science Peter H. Raven Lifetime Award in 1996 .
That same year , he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences .
Olney is recognized as a pioneering neuroscientist who helped establish glutamate as a major excitatory transmitter in the brain .
Stemming largely from Olney 's research over the past 30 years , glutamate now is recognized as a neurotoxin that contributes to the degeneration of brain cells in a number of neurological disorders .
Ralph G. Walton , M.D. Professor of Clinical Psychiatry , Northeastern Ohio University College of Medicine .
Currently Acting Chair of the Department of Psychiatry , is a Professor of Clinical Psychiatry for NEOUCOM and Psychiatry Clerkship Director for Forum Health .
He is Chairman of The Center for Behavioral Medicine , Forum Health .
Under his leadership , programs include ECHO ( Enhancing and Creating Healthy Opportunities ) , adult and youth services , Discovery House , adolescent recovery services and CHAMPS ( Challenge and Mutual Problem - Solving ) .
Woodrow C. Monte , Ph.D. , R.D. Associate Professor of Family Resources and Human Development ; B.S. , New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology ; M.S. , Ph.D. , Colorado State University .
Current : Director of the Food Science and Nutrition Laboratory Arizona State University , Tempe , Arizona 85287 .
Russell Blaylock , MD is a board certified neurosurgeon engaged in a private neurosurgical practice for the past 21 years .
Dr. Blaylock 's interests of research and treatment include nutritional treatment of neurological disorders and in the biochemical basis of diseases of the nervous system .
In 1994 he documented his work on this subject , Excitotoxins , The Taste That Kills , which was revised and updated it in 1998 .
Blaylock has written and illustrated three chapters in medical textbooks and a patient care booklet on multiple sclerosis and published several papers in peer reviewed journals on a variety of subjects from the pathology and treatment of pituitary tumors to immunotherapy of brain tumors .
H. J. Roberts , M.D. , F.A.C.P. , F.C.C.P. , is a Board - certified internist in West Palm Beach , and an internationally respected medical consultant and researcher .
He is on the Staff of Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Mary 's Hospital , Director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research ( since l964 ) , and a member of prestigious medical and scientific organizations including The Endocrine Society and the American Academy of Neurology .
His publications include ten acclaimed texts and more than 220 original articles and letters ; many deal with research in challenging neurological disorders .
Twenty years into his long career he voluntarily re-certified with American Board of Internal Medicine : his high marks helped to insure he remained as current as his peers .
He is listed in every Who 's Who Medical list one can imagine .
One doctor not listed in the news item who is also blowing the whistle on aspartame is Dr. Leonard Horowitz .
He received his doctorate in medical dentistry from Tufts University in Boston in 1989 , then his master 's of public health degree from Harvard University .
Horowitz became the nations leading author of dental self care books and audiotapes .
Titles such as Your Mouth is Your Business : The Dentist 's Guide to Better Health ( Appleton , 1980 ) , Freedom from Dental Anxiety ( Tetrahedron , LLC Press , 1986 ) , and Freedom From Headaches and TMJ Pain Syndrome ( Tetrahedron , LLC Press , 1987 ) graced dental offices and lending libraries throughout North America .
Horowitz also authored Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola .
His recorded and now published admissions are horrific , and frighteningly similar to the conclusion Horowitz reached by examining the scientific evidence that a Dr. Hilleman , along with CDC and FDA officials , developed the 1974 contaminated chimpanzee - linked hepatitis B vaccine that was the likeliest AIDS pandemic trigger .
Major General Gwambo , Director of the Department of Defense in Kenya has given copies of Horowitz 's books to all heads of state and their government has now stopped the World Health Organization 's experimental vaccine program in that nation .
All these doctors certainly look like a bunch of kooks and quacks to me .
I feel confident in saying that if these doctors all came out in favor of aspartame , those who think they 're kooks for exposing the dangers , would accept their assessment and findings in a NY second .
Betcha .

Israel warns of a ' new approach ' in the path to peace in the Middle East
Israel 's foreign minister has given clear signals to the U.S. that their plans for peace with Palestinians will not include making concessions to create a new state .
Avigdor Lieberman told the U.S. Middle
East envoy today that trade - offs had , in the past , caused wars and said Israel needed to find a ' new approach ' .
But Barack Obama 's envoy George Mitchell , speaking after the meeting with the Foreign Minister today , said the United States continued to support the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state .
It has been the guiding principle of U.S. - backed peace efforts in recent years .
Israel 's Avigdor Lieberman ( left ) shakes hands with U.S. envoy George Mitchell before their meeting
In a statement after the meeting , Liberman said : ' The historic approach has so far not brought any result or solution . '
He said they would need to find a ' new approach ' .
He added : ' Past prime ministers were prepared to make wide - ranging concessions and the result of the Olmert - Livni government was the second Lebanon war , the operation in Gaza , severance of relations with Qatar and Mauritania , Gilad Schalit still in captivity and the peace process at a dead end . '
Although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials of the new government have spoken at length about the emotional and strategic ties between Israel and the United States , clear differences are emerging over the outlines for an Israeli - Palestinian peace .
Ultra-nationalist Lieberman made waves after taking office last month , saying the past year of U.S. - led negotiations was no longer relevant and concessions to Palestinians only invite war .
Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni thought Palestine should take control over most of the West Bank and Gaza and some Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem .
But no agreement with the Palestinians was reached .
Despite their efforts to exchange Palestinian prisoners for captured soldier Schalit , they failed to negotiate his release from the Hamas militants who have been holding him in Gaza for nearly three years .
U.S. envoy Mitchell said after the meeting : ' U.S. policy favors - in respect to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict - a two - state solution which will have a Palestinian state living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel . '
Earlier , Mitchell visited President Shimon Peres , who played down differences between Jerusalem and Washington .
He told the envoy : ' The policy of President Obama and his efforts for peace in this region are the same as the position of Israel . '
And he played down concerns that Israel could bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities if Tehran did not stop developing nuclear arms which could be turned against the Jewish state .
Israel sees a nuclear Iran as the most serious threat to its existence .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called for Israel 's destruction and Tehran has tested long - range missiles that could strike Israel .
While not directly threatening to take out Iran 's nuclear facilities , Israel has kept the military option open .
The world has gone from the greatest synchronized global economic boom in history to the first synchronized global bust since the Great Depression .
How we got here is not a cautionary tale of free markets gone wild .
Rather , it 's the story of what can happen when governments ignore market signals and central bankers believe in endless booms .
Following the March 2000 Nasdaq bust , the Federal Reserve began to slash the fed - funds rate from 6.5 % in January 2001 to 1.75 % by year - end and then to 1 % in 2003 .

An elite corps of patient , concentrated shareholders quietly underpins corporate America .
This group , which Warren Buffett dubbed “ high - quality shareholders ” back in 1978 , contrasts with today ’s dominant index funds , which hold for long periods but do not concentrate , and momentum traders or many activists , who often concentrate heavily , but rarely hold for long .
Every investor , adviser and manager would benefit from familiarity with these high - quality shareholders .
Microchips in medication
Microchips in pills could soon allow doctors to find out whether a patient has taken their medication .
The digestible sensors , just 1 mm wide , would mean GPs and surgeons could monitor patients outside the hospital or surgery .
Developers say the technology could be particularly useful for psychiatric or elderly patients who rely on a complicated regime of drugs – and are at risk if they miss a dose or take it at the wrong time .
It could also be used for the chronically ill , such as people with heart disease , to establish whether costly drugs are working or whether they are causing potentially dangerous side effects .
The sensors could even remind women to take the Pill if they forget .
The ‘ intelligent ’ medicine works by activating a harmless electric charge when drugs are digested by the stomach .
This charge is picked up by a sensing patch on the patients ’ stomach or back , which records the time and date that the pill is digested .
It also measures heart rate , motion and breathing patterns .
The information is transmitted to a patient ’s mobile phone and then to the internet using wireless technology , to give a complete picture of their health and the impact of their drugs .
Doctors and carers can view this information on secure web pages or have the information sent to their mobile phones .
The silicon microchips are invisible to patients and can be added to any standard drug during the manufacturing process .
Two major drugs companies are investigating the technology , developed by US - based Proteus Biomedical .
Trials are to begin in the UK within 12 months .
Professor Nick Peters , a cardiologist at Imperial College London , who is co-ordinating
trials , said the technology was ‘ transformative ’ .
‘ This is all about empowering patients and their families because it measures wellness , and people can actually be tracked getting better , ’ he said .
‘ Psychologically speaking , that ’s hugely helpful for patients and enormously reassuring for carers .
‘ Normally patients would have to be in hospital to get this level of feedback , so the hope is that it frees up beds and saves the NHS money . ’

Die rigide Rechtsprechung des Landgerichts Hamburg bezüglich der Haftung für Internetforen und Blogs sorgt bereits seit Jahren für erhebliche Rechtsunsicherheit unter den Betreibern derartiger Angebote .
Dieser Rechtsprechung hatte das Hanseatische Oberlandesgericht nun in einer neuen Entscheidung eine klare Absage erteilt , jetzt liegt auch die schriftliche Begründung des Urteils vom 4 .
Februar 2009 vor ( Az. 5 U 180/07 ) .
Kläger des Verfahrens waren die Betreiber von " Marions Kochbuch " , die vor allem durch die massenhafte Abmahnung angeblicher Urheberrechtsverletzungen in die Diskussion geraten waren .
Diese hatten den Betreiber der Fußballforen - Community Foros für die Veröffentlichung eines Fotos durch einen Forenteilnehmer in Haftung nehmen wollen und Klage vor dem Landgericht Hamburg eingereicht .
Wenig überraschend verurteilten die Richter des Landgerichts den Beklagten daraufhin zur Unterlassung sowie zur Zahlung von Anwalts - und Lizenzgebühren .
Dieser sei als Störer für die Urheberrechtsverletzung mitverantwortlich .
Insbesondere sei dieser in der Lage gewesen , die Rechtsverletzung zu unterbinden , etwa dadurch , " dass er das Einstellen von Bildern durch Dritte auf die von ihm betriebene Webseite grundsätzlich nicht ermöglicht " .
Das Oberlandesgericht hob diese Entscheidung nun auf und urteilte in allen Punkten zugunsten des Forenbetreibers .
Entgegen der Ansicht des LG
Hamburg seien solche Inhalte nicht als eigene Inhalte im Sinne des § 7 TMG zu bewerten .
Vielmehr handele es sich bei Postings in Foren um fremde Informationen , für die der Betreiber nach § 10 TMG nur eingeschränkt haftet .
Etwas anderes ergäbe sich auch dann nicht , wenn es sich um ein geschäftliches Angebot handeln würde .
Auch den Ausführungen des Landgerichts , wonach der Betreiber als Störer hafte , erteilt das OLG eine klare Absage .
Insbesondere habe dieser keine ihm obliegenden Prüfungspflichten verletzt .
Denn der Betreiber eines zulässigen Geschäftsmodells im Internet sei nicht zur vorsorglichen Überprüfung sämtlicher Inhalte auf etwaige Rechtsverletzungen verpflichtet .
Dabei beruft sich das Gericht vor allem auf das Heise - Foren Urteil des OLG aus dem Jahr 2006 .
Bereits dort wurde festgestellt , dass eine solche Pflicht " die Überwachungspflichten des Betreibers überspannen und die Presse - und Meinungsäußerungsfreiheit , unter deren Schutz Internetforen stünden , verletzen würde " .
Zudem käme bei Bildern noch das Problem dazu , dass diesen in aller Regel noch weniger als Textbeiträgen anzusehen sei , ob durch ihre Veröffentlichung Rechte Dritter verletzt werden .
Weiterhin hafte der Beklagte auch nicht deshalb auf Unterlassung , weil er nach der Abmahnung keine ausreichenden Anstrengungen unternommen hatte , zukünftige Rechtsverletzungen zu vermeiden .
Insoweit sei es unstreitig nicht zu weiteren Rechtsverletzungen gekommen .
Vielmehr habe der Forenbetreiber seine Verpflichtung damit erfüllt , die ihm bekannt gewordene Rechtsverletzung unmittelbar nach Kenntnis zu beseitigen .
Auch die Möglichkeit für die Nutzer , ihre Beiträge in die Foren anonym einzustellen , führe nicht dazu , dass schon nach einer einzigen Rechtsverletzung die Veröffentlichung von Bildern in den Nutzerbeiträgen generell zu verhindern ist .
Denn auch anonym oder unter Pseudonym nutzbare Internetforen stellen nach Ansicht des OLG Hamburg ein grundsätzlich zulässiges und auch übliches Geschäftsmodell im Internet dar und stehen unter dem Schutz der Meinungsäußerungs - und Pressefreiheit .
Wie die Regelung des § 13 TMG zeigten , sei die anonyme Nutzung des Internets sogar ausdrücklich geschützt .
Auch in einem weiteren für die Betreiber von Foren wichtigem Punkt erteilt das OLG der Rechtsprechung des Landgerichts eine klare Absage : Der Beklagte sei nicht zur Erstattung der Anwaltskosten für das Abmahnschreiben der Kläger verpflichtet .
Denn erst mit diesem Schreiben habe der Forenbetreiber Kenntnis von der Rechtsverletzung erlangt .
Die Kosten für die erste Information über eine Rechtsverletzung habe der Rechteinhaber zu tragen , weil diese Maßnahme allein in seinem Interesse liege , um den Betreiber zu einer Entfernung des Beitrags zu bewegen und gegebenenfalls bei künftigen Folgeverstößen als Störer in Anspruch nehmen zu können .
Etwas überraschend ließ das OLG die Revision gegen das Urteil mangels grundsätzlicher Bedeutung oder Erforderlichkeit zur Sicherung einer einheitlichen Rechtsprechung nicht zu. ( Joerg Heidrich ) / ( axv )

REDMOND , Washington ( CNN ) --
Should a bridge that would connect two campuses at Microsoft 's headquarters be funded with $ 11 million from the federal stimulus package ?
An artist 's rendering shows how the proposed bridge would be constructed over a busy highway .
Critics of using stimulus money for the bridge say it would give the software giant a break on a pet project .
They also say it serves as a warning sign of how some stimulus money is not being used to finance new projects but is being diverted to public works already under way .
Supporters argue the bridge is an ideal public - private partnership that will benefit an entire community while fulfilling the stimulus package 's goal of getting people back to work .
" It 's going create just under 400 jobs for 18 months constructing the bridge , " says Redmond Mayor John Marchione .
" It 's also connecting our technical sector with our retail and commercial sectors so people can cross the freeway to shop and help traffic flow . "
See a larger image of the proposed bridge »
Marchione applied for federal stimulus money after costs jumped on the project from $ 25 million to $ 36 million .
Marchione says the increase in costs were due to a rise in construction prices and because the bridge will be built on a diagonal in order to connect Microsoft 's original East campus with a newer West campus that are split by a public highway .
Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free .
The company is contributing $ 17.5 million or a little less than half the tab of the $ 36 million bridge , which would be open for public use .
Do n't Miss CNN / Money :
Here comes your stimulus bonus
And even though the bridge goes from a parking lot behind Microsoft 's West campus across a highway to an entrance of Microsoft 's East campus , Marchione says , people other than Microsoft employees would use the overpass .
" We 're not a one - company town , " Marchione says .
" Our traffic studies show that Microsoft traffic would be about 42 percent of the bridge , yet Microsoft is paying for about 50 percent of the bridge , so we think we are getting fair value .
" The United States taxpayer is leveraging their dollars , and I think everyone is getting a fair deal . "
But a watchdog group monitoring how stimulus money is being spent says the taxpayer in this case is getting ripped off .
" This is $ 11 million where we are substituting public money for private money , and that means there 's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that 's not being built , " says Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
But without the stimulus money , Marchione counters , the bridge may not have been built .
Microsoft had " capped out " its contribution to the project , he explains .
And the economic tough times have affected even the biggest companies .
" Microsoft laid off 5,000 people in January , " Marchione points out .
Ellis does n't buy it .
" Let 's face it .
Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country , " Ellis says .
" They could have easily funded this out of pocket change .
This is really about getting while the getting is good .
Uncle Sam has a big wallet that 's there for the taking , and Redmond wanted to take it -- and Microsoft was happy to let them pick up that part of the tab . "
Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project .
But in a posting online , Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith wrote : " As the largest employer in Redmond , Microsoft takes its responsibility to the surrounding community seriously .
We have spent over $ 50 million to assist the City of Redmond and other local governments with street construction , transit facilities , water and sewer facilities and fire equipment . "
Last week , Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire certified 138 projects , including the bridge , to receive stimulus funding .
Construction is expected to begin in June .
Michael Ennis of the Washington Policy Center , a Seattle - based not - for - profit group that advises policy makers , said there are many reasons the bridge project is a good one .
" Any time you can include the private sector in funding transportation projects , it 's a win- win situation , " Ennis explains .
" The state has a monopoly on our roads system .
Even if Microsoft wanted to pay for this project on their own , legally they are required to work with the public sector . "
But Ennis also says the bridge does not fit with the kind of projects the stimulus plan is meant to bankroll .
" This project would have moved forward regardless of having the federal money or not , so it does n't have any additional benefit to the economy , " he says .
As he pedaled on his bicycle to work , one Microsoft employee saw the issue in much simpler terms .
" It 's going to cut about two miles off my ride each day , " he said .

My former boss , Jim Fawcette , used to say that if you asked a group of Porsche owners what they wanted they ’d tell you things like “ smoother ride , more trunk space , more leg room , etc . ”
He ’d then say “ well , they just designed a Volvo . ”
His words were meant to get us out of letting the customers run our business mode we often found ourselves falling into .
Today , over on Techmeme , I see that the latest uproar is over Facebook ’s new design and how Mark Zuckerberg is telling people that he wo n’t listen to customers .
Or something like that .
Before we get deeper into this , remember that Facebook has always pissed off its users .
First , you ’ve gotta realize that in Facebook ’s life it will go through at least seven phases .
We are moving from phase four to phase five right now .
In each phase change people have gotten pissed off .
Here ’s the phases of Facebook :
Phase 1 . Harvard only .
Phase 2 . Harvard + Colleges only .
Phase 3 . Harvard + Colleges + Geeks only .
Phase 4 .
All those above + All People ( in the social graph ) .
Phase 5 .
All those above + People and businesses in the social graph .
Phase 6 .
All those above + People , businesses , and well - known objects in the social graph .
Phase 7 .
All people , businesses , objects in the social graph .
Phase 5 is known as when Facebook is really going to find its business model .
This is why Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely correct to say he can’t listen to people who wants Facebook to get stuck in Phase Four .
It was a nice phase , yes , when Facebook only had people in the social graph , but those days are over .
Do n’t get distracted by the current design that looks sort of like Twitter .
Twitter showed that businesses can co-exist on the social graph along with people .
Zuckerberg is smart .
He saw that Twitter was going to make a crapload of money ( that ’s why he tried to buy Twitter ) and instead of being depressed by being turned down by @ev he decided to phase shift Facebook .
Zuckerberg is a real leader because he does n’t care what anyone thinks .
He ’s going to do what he thinks is best for his business .
I wish Silicon Valley had more like him .
Anyway , all those who are saying the new design sucks should NOT be listened to .
Yeah , I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for saying that .
After all , how can a blogger say to not listen to the masses ?
Easy : I ’ve seen the advice the masses are giving and most of it is n’t very good for Facebook ’s business interests .
When Zuckerberg announced these changes a couple of weeks ago I told him he was brilliant and that his moves this month would be remembered for decades .
Decades .
Here ’s why :
Let ’s say you ’re walking down University Ave. in Palo Alto , California in a couple of years ( or , really , any street in the world ) and you ’re hungry .
You pull out your iPhone or Palm Pre or Android or Blackberry or Windows Mobile doohickey and click open the Facebook application .
Then you type “ sushi near me . ”
It answers back “ within walking distance are two sushi restaurants that more than 20 of your friends have liked . ”
Wait a second .
“ Friends have liked ? ”
Sounds like friendfeed .
But , because Facebook has the users ( it is growing the size of Twitter every 15 days or so because Facebook has about 180 million users while Twitter only has about 10 million .
Facebook , at this point , is growing 200,000 to 700,000 users per day .
Twitter is growing by far fewer users per day ( although its percentage growth is faster ) .
But do n’t worry about the friendfeed copying .
Zuckerberg is so close to a gold mine that his metal detectors must be going crazy .
All he has to do is figure out how to keep those pesky users from leaving the service .
Oh , wait , they are n’t leaving !
How do I know that ?
Because my wife Maryam is totally addicted to Facebook .
She has n’t left .
She has n’t slowed down .
She just told me she did n’t like the new design and made some noises that she was only going to use the iPhone version ( not true in my observations ) .
So , if Zuckerberg did n’t lose Maryam and her friends , he ’s safe .
He SHOULD NOT LISTEN to those who are saying the new design sucks .
It will keep him from getting to the promised land where we mix businesses and people .
Here ’s what really is hanging out there for Facebook if Zuckerberg does n’t listen : billions .
Maybe even trillions .
Look at what we just announced to the world :
Yes , we ’re having another baby .
But look at what did NOT happen on Twitter : not a single diaper company contacted us yet .
Not a single maternity clothing company .
Not a single car company ( yes , we ’re going to buy a new one soon ) .
Not a single camera company ( already bought a new one for this occassion ) .
Not a single insurance company ( I need more ) .
Not a single bank ( I need to start saving for another college student ) .
Not a single stroller company ( need a new one that can hold two ) .
Not a single vitamin company ( Maryam is going through her prenatal vitamins at a good clip ) .
Not a single shoe company ( Maryam needs new shoes for pregnancy , and Milan is growing fast too ) .
That will NOT last .
Imagine we ’re on Facebook in a year .
Now all of a sudden I can search for all these things and see which items and companies have gotten the most “ likes . ”
Now do you get why Facebook is copying friendfeed ?
Zuckerberg is not listening to you because you do n’t get how Facebook is going to make billions .
Zuckerberg is right .
He should n’t start listening to his users now .
While the buzz at GDC was about a possible price break on the PlayStation 3 , today all the rumors about a Sony price drop have been confirmed ... for the PlayStation 2 .
Starting April 1 , new PS2 hardware will cost $ 99.99 , coming in below the magical $ 100 price point .
Compared to $ 400 for the PS3 , that 's almost an impulse purchase .
“ PlayStation 2 set the industry standard for worldwide mass market adoption and is a clear embodiment of Sony 's commitment to platforms that deliver 10 - year product lifecycles .
It 's a tribute to outstanding technology , great consumer value and unprecedented development support that we 've now been able to do twice what no one else has ever accomplished , ” said Jack Tretton , president and CEO , SCEA .
“ Demand for PlayStation 2 remains strong throughout the world , and the new $ 99 price point will bring in new consumers who will discover how PlayStation platforms are an outstanding choice for their gaming and home entertainment needs . ”
Is a price cut on last generation 's hardware big news ?
It is when the PS2 still continues to sell incredibly well at retail , month after month .
The PS2 also has the distinction of being the most popular gaming system ever , with over 136 million units sold worldwide .
The PS2 was also important for DVD sales , as the gaming hardware was , for a time , one of the most affordable DVD players as well as a gaming system .
The ability to keep your PSone catalog of games for play on the system was another major selling point and , although DVD players can now be found for $ 20 and PSone games are n't much of a concern for the modern audience , the value and power of the games available on the PS2 is unmatched in the industry .
Now that the hardware is $ 99 , you can pick up a new system and a literal armload of games for the cost of one current - gen system .
Sony addressed the rumored PS3 price cut with an official statement from Al De Leon , PR Manager for Sony Computer Entertainment America .
" As we have stated previously , we do not have plans for a PS3 price drop , and any rumors to that effect are false and are the result of speculation , " he wrote to the gaming press .
" SCEA remains focused on the long - term momentum of PS3 .
With the industry 's best software lineup this year , combined with our most aggressive marketing campaign to date , we remain confident in our approach and the value we 're delivering with PS3 . "
The PS2 price drop is great news for budget - conscious consumers — a group that includes nearly everyone these days — but while it may give the PS2 a boost , it neglects the system that needs a price cut the most in the market : the PS3 .
Publishers want it , gamers want it , and Sony needs it to catch up with the Xbox 360 in terms of units sold .
Focusing on PS2 sales seems like a step in the wrong direction for a company that wants to move forward .

The European Space Agency announced today that the Herschel and Planck spacecraft will now launch on May 14 .
Liftoff had been delayed to allow time for additional checks on the Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle .
The two spacecraft are launching together in what was originally a cost saving move , but the complexity of preparing two spacecraft at once has caused frequent delays and cost overruns .
However , now that the launch is near , hopefully the cutting - edge technologies included in both spacecraft will soon pay off in new discoveries astronomy and cosmology .
The Herschel Space Observatory ’s primary mirror is the largest single mirror ever built for a space telescope .
At 3.5 - meters in diameter the mirror will collect long - wavelength radiation from some of the coldest and most distant objects in the Universe .
The mirror is also a technological wonder : it uses 12 silicon carbide petals fused together into a single piece .
Herschel will be the only space observatory to cover a spectral range from the far infrared to sub-millimeter .
Planck is designed to image the anisotropies of the Cosmic Background Radiation Field over the whole sky , with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution .
It will provide a major source of information relevant to several cosmological and astrophysical issues , such as testing theories of the early universe and the origin of cosmic structure .
The two satellites are being prepared for launch and recently were both fueled with hydrazine .
Planck ’s three - stage active cryogenic cooler , needed to keep the instruments at extremely cold temperatures , has been filled with helium - 3 and helium - 4 .
Herschel ’s cryogenic tanks are also being filled with superfluid helium .
Herschel and Planck will liftoff from Europe ’s Spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana

The best observatories ranked by their scientific impact .
SDSS image of Messier 51 , the Whirlpool Galaxy .
Sloan Digital Sky Survey
It does n't take a big mirror to have a big impact .
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey , a project conducted with a modest 2.5 - metre - wide telescope in New Mexico , performed the most highly cited science in 2006 , according to a new analysis of the top ten ' high impact ' astronomical observatories1 .
" It measures how hot the science of the telescope is , " says Juan Madrid of McMaster University in Hamilton , Canada , of the top - ten table he has released for most years since 1998 .
" In a way it measures how good the time - allocation committee is and how good the telescope is .
I will also say it measures how good the scientists are . "
Also in the top five is another modest telescope —
Swift , a satellite that looks for γ-ray bursts — followed by three technological giants of the astronomy world : the Hubble Space Telescope , the four 8 - metre telescopes of the European Southern Observatory in Paranal , Chile , and the twin 10 - metre Keck telescopes in Hawaii .
The table shows that a telescope 's technological advantages can push it to the top of the list , but also that the culture and constraints of the operating institution are important .
However , some astronomers caution that citations are just one of many metrics that should be used to assess an observatory 's value .
" I think a number of them need to be taken together in determining which observatories are important , " says Robert Williams , president - elect of the International Astronomical Union and former director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , which operates the Hubble telescope .
Masters of the Universe
Madrid began compiling his citation rankings in 2001 while working at the Space Telescope Science Institute .
It was a time , he says , when the political will for refurbishing Hubble was not very strong .
His method : take the top 200 most - cited papers from a given year , throw out the theory papers , determine the observatories responsible for the remaining papers , and apportion the citations appropriately .
His latest rankings , accepted for publication in the Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society , are for highly cited papers from 2006 because it takes a couple of years for citations to build up .
Click here for a larger image .
The rankings have served Hubble well : the telescope has been in the top five every year that Madrid has compiled his table .
Other observatories spike in the rankings for brief periods before fading away .
The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , for instance , took first place in 2003 , following the data release of its seminal map of the cosmic microwave background .
It was fourth in 2004 .
But as its data has been mined , it has since dropped off : it did n't make the top ten in 2006 .
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey , by contrast , has been ascendant : it was the most highly cited observatory in both 2004 and 2006 , the two most recent years in which Madrid has performed his analysis .
The survey has helped unravel the structure of the Milky Way and has indirectly gauged dark energy 's effect on the accelerating expansion of the Universe , says the survey 's spokesman , David Weinberg of Ohio State University in Columbus .
" It 's not a huge , honking telescope , but it has very powerful instruments . "
He points to the richness of the dataset , along with its uniformity and quick public availability , as reasons for why so many scientists , including many outside the Sloan consortium , have done important work with its data .
Winners and losers
Some astronomers have wondered aloud about a few conspicuous absences from the top - ten list , including Gemini , an observatory with two 8 - metre telescopes — one in Hawaii and one in Chile .
Gemini science committee chair , Timothy Beers of Michigan State University in East Lansing , points to the fact that the Gemini telescopes were designed more for observations in the infrared part of the spectrum than for optical work , so they draw proposals from a smaller scientific community .
" These were not instrumented as workhorse telescopes , " he says .
" It remains a problem . "
Without a broader array of instruments for a wider spectrum , Beers says scientists " vote with their feet and go to other observatories " .
Another issue , he says , is control over the amount of telescope time , which is always limited .
Privately owned and operated telescopes , such as Keck , can give large amounts of time to small groups of scientists aiming at the juiciest topics .
Gemini , a publicly funded consortium representing seven nations , has seven separate time - allocation committees .
They make it more difficult to organize long , unified campaigns — even though Beers recognizes that large datasets created from long campaigns tend to create the high - impact science .
But most of the astronomers agree that a citation metric is just one of many ways to measure an observatory .
Other metrics include the overall production rate of scientific papers as well as the over - subscription rate — the ratio of proposed experiments to accepted ones .
" My overall view is that citation mania has taken over to an absurd degree , " says Weinberg .
" But do they make a difference ?
I think so , especially when you are trying to raise funds . "
And so Weinberg was sure to present the rankings based on the 2004 data — and the presence of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey atop it — when applying for a six - year extension to the project .
The survey ended up winning US$ 9 million from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) last summer .
" How much impact did that have on reviewers and on the NSF programme officers ?
I do n't know .
But it certainly had some .
And it should . "
" So , darling , how 's your week looking ? "
" So - so .
I 've got a meeting on Thursday . "
" Oh , that 's a bore .
Where is it ? "
" London . "
" London ! ? "
" I know .
Got to go to London for a meeting . "
" What 's it about ? "
" Er ... everything , really .
It 's a meeting about everything .
We need to sort everything out , so we 've got a meeting about it . "
" That might run on . "
" Yeah . "
This is the sort of conversation I imagine the world 's leaders and their spouses having in the run-up to the G20 summit .
" Can I come ? "
" What , to the meeting ? "
" No , to London .
I thought I might come along with you and just , you know , hang out . "
" Why ? "
" Oh I do n't know .
There might be a dinner . "
" A dinner ? "
" Yeah , they might do a dinner for all the wives and Angela Merkel 's husband .
Dame Kelly Holmes and JK Rowling might be there . "
" That does n't sound very likely . "
" I bet there 'll be a dinner .
Naomi Campbell and Martha Lane
Fox might be there .
Come on , you never ask me along to anything . "
" Have n't you got things of your own you need to be doing ? "
" As is still the convention with politicians ' wives , I totally do n't . "
And so the wives and Angela Merkel 's husband start making plans while the husbands and Angela Merkel make mollifying phone calls to their mistresses and whoever Angela Merkel might be having an affair with .
Let 's say it 's Jacqui Smith 's husband - we know he likes fun .
" It might be a chance for us to spend a bit of time alone together , " continues the wife or Angela Merkel 's husband .
" Right . "
" What ? "
" A hundred other people are coming . "
" A hundred other people ? "
" Yeah , I 'm bringing a hundred people from the office .
To help out . "
" Does n't that constitute an invasion ?
Are we invading Britain now ? "
" Everyone 's doing it .
Obama 's bringing five times that . "
" What do you need them all for ? "
" Loads of things .
You know , photocopying , erm ... "
With an entourage of 500 , there is no way the American president will have had to do any of his own photocopying last week .
Any suggestion that he might photocopy something himself , get his own coffee , brush his own teeth , or even shake his own cock after a wee , will have been met with dismay by the army of support staff and servants feverishly competing for the right to cater to one of his finite number of every needs .
Like a medieval king on a progress , the president is using this retinue to demonstrate his power .
" America is still the mightiest country on Earth , " he is asserting .
It 's a worrying sign that he feels the need to .
The US has been going through a bit of a bad patch .
He obviously feels that now is not the time to skimp on prestige .
Back when it was the only country with nuclear weapons , an American president could have come to a summit on his own , or with a girlfriend to get off with during the boring bits .
If he 'd wanted any photocopying done , he'd have got another world leader to do it .
But these days , the Americans are reduced to a ludicrous attempt to outnumber the Chinese .
Which must have made for a frustrating few days for his attendants .
Riding a wave of presidential cachet and buoyed up by the self - importance that only an Air Force
One napkin can give you , they arrive at London 's already fully staffed American embassy with very little to do .
Suddenly , they 're in a world where securing a meeting with Alastair Darling is a coup .
Some of them probably settled for George Osborne , poor sods .
But then I suppose it beats standing around watching footage of a window being broken on the news , and taking it in turns to replace toner cartridges .
An apparently healthy man , Obama travelled with six doctors .
I hope , for his own sake , that doctor number six brought a book .
But then , after all the razzmatazz , the dinners , the meeting the Queen , the jostling of the entourages , the group photograph , the breaking of the window of that bank , 20 people walk into a room to have a meeting .
A meeting about how everything 's going wrong and is there any way of stopping it ?
How does that work ?
How do they refrain , as soon as the doors close , from pissing themselves laughing ?
" What the hell do those guys out there think we 're going to do ! ? "
I imagine them giggling hysterically .
" There 's an asteroid heading towards the planet and we have n't even got Superman 's phone number ! "
Does this make them insincere ?
Are they , as the writer and diplomat Harold Nicolson wrote of the delegates at the Congress of Vienna , " mere hucksters in the diplomatic market , bartering the happiness of millions with a scented smile " ?
I do n't think so - there wo n't have been much smiling and I can't vouch for their breath .
And they 're not evil .
It 's worse than that - they 're just a bunch of people having a meeting .
That 's what it 's come to .
Our only hope of saving the world is that a meeting goes well .
A meeting - something that anyone sensible hates and avoids , where nothing ever gets achieved , where the most boring person talks the longest , that runs on for hours and prevents people from getting on with their actual jobs - that 's what we 're relying on .
The same process by which bypasses are approved and the admin of church fetes discussed .
Item one : economic implosion , item two : environmental catastrophe , item three : parking .
In case anyone 's wondering , no I do n't have a better suggestion .
And presumably most of what is agreed at summits is sorted out behind the scenes beforehand .
Obama 's fourth doctor has a quiet drink with Medvedev 's third IT support guy , who knows a bit of maths , and they hammer out the details .
It 's probably better that way .
" How was your meeting , darling ? "
" Long and pointless .
I did n't really need to be there . "
" What 's Nicolas Sarkozy like ? "
" His own way . "
" No , I mean , as a person . "
" Well , remember what you said after meeting Naomi Campbell ? "
" Yes , sorry , I really hate that word . "
" OK , but he 's a massive one . "
Voice chat is something that PC gamers often take for granted .
Most games ship with some flavor of built - in voice chat , and almost every MMO guild sets up their own server for in - game voice .
Dolby wants something more , however ; the company is looking to take voice chat out of the bullet - list selling points and make it a more integral part of the game .
With its upcoming Axon 3D Voice Technology , your voice is intended to become part of the game .
Dolby has just confirmed that the technology will ship with Jumpgate Evolution , an online space title that impressed us at GDC , as well as Mission Against Terror , an online FPS title .
Ars spoke with Matt Tullis , Senior Manager of Marketing , Games Segment at Dolby Laboratories , to talk about the technology , and he explains why we should care about yet another voice chat program .
Tullis told us that Axon was designed to be integrated into the game itself , not simply to sit on top of it and offer communication .
" When your teammate moves behind you and asks for cover , you will now be able to hear their voice from behind you , " he explained to Ars .
The technology will also take advantage of the game 's inner workings to add levels of immersion to voice chat .
" Dolby Axon can include game geometry so that players will cut off when they go behind walls , " Tullis said .
" Best of all , game developers will now be able to use voice in exciting new ways : spy microphones , the ability to hear through walls , throwing your voice , and more . "
In other words , the technology uses sound as an object , something that exists within the game .
Tullis also promised that the technology wo n't come at a high price to your gaming rig .
" Since we 've built Dolby Axon specifically for games , we 've kept these things in mind , " he told Ars .
" A full surround sound scene can be delivered in 16 kbps .
The CPU hit on a modern CPU ( dual core ) is less than 1 percent .
The CPU hit on an 866MHz P3 is still well less than 10 percent . "
Mid -level system owners take heart , you 'll be able to take advantage of the technology .
The technology can be added to any game , although the earlier it 's implemented in the development process , the more features can be added to the gameplay .
Tullis also wants to assure us that every microphone and headset combination will work fine with games using Axon , although surround sound systems will give you some advantage , for the obvious reasons .
Imagine playing Jumpgate and flying behind an asteroid , with the huge mass of rock causing communications to jump in and out .
Electrical interference could cause actual interference , giving the game 's settings actual tactical advantages and disadvantages .
The only problem is that you can counteract these effects by simply using Ventrillo or TeamSpeak , although that should n't be an issue on anything other than Player vs.
Player areas .
Penny Arcade recently weighed in on how group chat on Xbox Live hurt certain games — Chromehounds and Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow in particular — that used sound as part of the game design .
Simpy put , you can't force others to use it , which makes its inclusion in competitive environments somewhat futile .
For those of us who are lame and prefer to role - play our online gaming , however , this sounds very cool .
The ability to flow in a group , knowing where people are by the sound of their voice in your surround sound system , with items in space interfering with voice chat , should add much to the game experience .
" We 've really tried to incorporate a lot of Dolby 's audio expertise in the product , " Tullis said .
" We 've added dialog leveling so that you wo n't constantly have to adjust your volume between players with quiet microphones and players with loud microphones .
We 've built in noise and echo reduction .
We even created a special codec for Dolby Axon to deliver high quality audio at low bitrates . "
You 'll be able to hear all that work when Jumpgate Evolution ships on PCs .

While the public is exercising a Freudian fixation on the A.I.G. scandal , misguidedly thinking that A.I.G. is an American company in the sense of G.M. or Ford ( it is not although many Americans see a Rorschach American company ) , the Federal Reserve just decided to increase its balance sheet by $ 1.2 trillion .
This unprecedented action was not unexpected , like rain in the winter but the speed and magnitude tells us that the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are completely set on decimating any value in U.S. dollar .
What is even more troubling is over the life span of the crisis , each new program for injecting liquidity and capital into the markets has been less and less transparent .
One of the more transparent ways of getting capital in the system initially was repurchase agreements .
These were basically short term loans made to lending institutions .
These were rather transparent ( at least in Federal Reserve terms ) and for that reason , they initially had a run in 2008 but have now fallen by the way side to zero :
A repo is similar to a secured loan with the buyer receiving the actual loan and rights conferred by it to protect itself from default .
Think of a car loan .
If you default , the lender has the right to takeover the car and many consumers are facing this .
Now why is this now at zero ?
Well as a lending institution , would you rather take a loan or a free grant coming from the taxpayer ?
That is why this lending facility went to zero once other mechanisms of lending were brought about inching closer and closer to free money funded by the U.S. taxpayer .
You need to recall that even these minor moves which now in hindsight look like chump change found in the cracks of your couch , had very little political will moving forward .
Little by little we went from debating million dollar loans to now discussing a commitment of $ 9 trillion to the financial crisis , much of it in free money to the banks via the taxpayer .
Another chart showing us that lending institutions are now electing to fleece the taxpayer for all they got is looking at discount window borrowing :
Again , borrowing from the discount window required borrowers to actually pay back the initial loans .
Of course this kind of borrowing has fallen drastically recently but do n’t confuse this with the notion that banks are now healthier .
What is now occurring is banks are now electing to use more “ free ” money sources such as the TARP in which instead of creating a loan , they are given something more akin to a grant .
That is , they do n’t have to pay it back in any set timeframe .
The TARP is basically a 0 percent loan with no due date .
That is the taxpayer has given these lending institutions free money to turn a profit whenever they see fit ( that is if they do survive that long ) .
And you have to rewind to what the $ 700 billion TARP plan was about .
The entire impetus of the plan was that we needed to get money flowing to the consumer so they could go out and spend again .
Remember that distant promise ?
That was the thesis of the plan .
Consumers needed money and banks were n’t lending .
Ergo , we needed to give banks money so they would lend it out to consumers .
Instead , banks had destroyed balance sheets that they have held onto the money while making credit tighter for consumers .
Aside from the real day proof of tighter credit card terms and more stringent mortgages , let us look at where banks have their ( our taxpayer ) money :
What is occurring is banks are gearing up for a long winter on the back of our money while the consumer is asked to face the economic headwinds of unemployment and recession with no safety net .
That is why giving banks money made no sense whatsoever .
With that money , we could have easily created a “ good bank ” that was unencumbered by any liabilities or toxic assets created by the housing bubble and this money could have gone directly to consumers .
But if you have n’t caught on , the solution to the crisis is n’t about you .
It is about saving banks and figuring out ways to unload the toxic waste onto the taxpayers .
That is why the newly leaked plan regarding a way of dealing with toxic assets is so destructive .
The design of the program is setup to give investors an incentive to buy up toxic assets with your money .
In fact , it is a gigantic subsidy to investors which most likely will be banks , to buy up toxic assets with massive taxpayer funded leverage .
That is a horrible idea on par with the idea of TARP which was buying up bad assets was going to be good for the taxpayer and would help get credit going again .
It never did and has been an abject failure .
And that $ 700 billion allocated with over half already committed , was a waste of nearly $ 1 trillion .
Think about that .
And now , we have a plan that will put nearly $ 1 trillion more at risk with no actual method of helping the consumer .
Frankly , a crisis that has destroyed $ 50 trillion in global wealth will not be solved by adding more debt .
Debt is the problem so using debt to solve it is tantamount to a gambler doubling down when he hits a bad streak .
We cannot rely on what we are being told by officials or those on Wall Street .
If we look at how poorly the TARP has been mismanaged , should we trust the same people to come up with a better plan ?
Why are we to believe this next plan is going to help ?
In fact , this plan from the start is designed more poorly than the TARP .
It will be a disaster .
Protect your wealth because the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are gearing up to bailout the banking sector on the back of American taxpayers … again .

TOLYATTI , Russia 
If there is a country that truly needs a car czar , it is Russia , home of the czars  and Lada .
The factory here has been stamping out the same version of the Lada , the typical boxy people ’s car of the former Eastern Bloc , for four decades .
Known as Avtovaz for short , it is one of the least efficient automobile factories anywhere in the world  each worker produces , on average , eight cars a year , compared with 36 cars a year at General Motors ’ assembly line in Bowling Green , Ky. , for example .
Yet the government is giving Avtovaz ( pronounced aft - OV - az ) billions of dollars in aid , no strings attached .
No chief executive firings .
No renegotiation of workers ’ contracts .
No demands to turn out better - quality cars , much less fuel - efficient hybrid cars .
( The first car with an airbag was introduced here in 2005 . )

Was it a mistake to allow Dave to muscle in ?
Some interesting debate on the previous thread over whether Nick Clegg was right to allow Cameron to be part of his big moment in the immediate aftermath of yesterday afternoon ’s vote .
Ben Brogan in his Telegraph blog was no doubt about its significance and ran a piece under the heading “ A picture that changes politics ? ” .
He went on about Clegg : “.. His willingness to share the glory with Dave shows political smarts and a keen eye for an irresistible photo .
We are still a long way from coalition politics , but the more the polls point to a hung Parliament , the more today will take on significance ”
Labour is far less enthusiastic for the idea of a more united opposition must add further to the jitters of MPs .
Tom Harris blogs under the headline “ Just how much of a mug is Nick Clegg ? ” – an approach that suggests that he for one senses the real danger of the others ganging up on his party .
For in electoral terms this sends out messages to several different segments of voters that could affect the outcome in key marginals .
In LAB >CON seats it could encourage more Lib Dems to vote tactically to get Labour out while at the same time causing those considering switching to Labour to think twice .
In LD>CON seats it might make the Lib Dem defences a tad easier .
It ’s going to be a bit harder for the Tories to claim that a vote for Clegg ’s party is a vote for Brown .
In LAB >LD contests it might encourage more Tory tactical voting but it could also make Labour supporters more determined to turn - out .
The pictures from yesterday are going to appear time and time again in all sorts of different forms .
You can see them being featured in Tory leaflets in marginal Labour seats as well as in LD leaflets where Clegg ’s party is the main challenger .
So should Clegg have shared the moment ?
Yes – his party might well end up with a handful more seats than it was expecting – although there ’s a danger that it ’s national vote share will decline .

, that egregiously misspelled Nazi movie by Quentin Tarantino , has n't even finished its reign of filming terror in Germany .
But that wo n't stop QT from grabbing our attention this weekend with a trailer for the movie , in which Brad Pitt sports a mustache and kills Nazis like it's his job .
According to Tarantino .info , the trailer will debut this Thursday on , which means our first look will have annoying voice over from Nancy O'Dell or Billy Bush .
C'est la vie .
The real thing to look for will be a trailer in theaters this weekend -- maybe paired with ?
Or , hilariously , .
Either way , it 'll be fascinating to finally get a look at this movie -- and figure out if QT can justify that misspelled title .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc is partnering with other online music providers as the Internet giant tries a fresh approach to getting an edge in the evolving digital music business .

The new version of Yahoo Music , unveiled on Monday , aggregates paid and free music services available on the Internet , allowing Yahoo users to access and interact with the services directly from the Yahoo site .
Yahoo has struck commercial relationships with digital music retailers like Apple Inc ’s , collecting a fee for every referral , the company said .
The move comes a little over a year after Yahoo announced it was shuttering its own paid - music service , and is in keeping with the company ’s latest efforts to make Yahoo a more open service by integrating products and services developed by other companies .
“ We really want to focus on providing the service that ’s most valuable to users , and then partner with third parties to provide the entire set of music services , ” said Yahoo Music General Manager Michael Spiegelman , who described the new Yahoo Music as a major strategic shift for Yahoo .
Visitors to the Yahoo Music site will be able to select from a variety modules representing the Web ’s disparate music sites , including free , radio - like streaming audio services such as Pandora and last .
fm , music videos from Google Inc ’s YouTube , and paid music downloads from iTunes and Amazon.com .
The new Artist Pages on Yahoo Music will also offer a one - stop shop for people interested in particular singers or bands , offering everything from tour dates and concert tickets to photos and editorial content .
In all , the company said , Yahoo Music will offer music or information about 500,000 artists , about double the size of the selection Yahoo previously offered .
The idea , Spiegelman said , is to provide a starting point for people to get information about any artist they ’re interested in .
Yahoo Music was the No. 2 online music site in December , with 19.6 million unique visitors , according to research company ComScore .
Time Warner Inc ’s AOL Music was the top site with 24.6 million visitors , while News Corp ’s MySpace Music ranked third with 17.2 million visitors .
Yahoo , which is due to report its first - quarter financial results later this month , is in the midst of a broad reorganization effort led by CEO Carol Bartz , who took the reins from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang in January .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , Yahoo ’s sales declined 1 percent year - over - year to $ 1.8 billion .
Yahoo had announced the new open direction it had in mind for Yahoo Music in September .
The version unveiled on Monday is technically a “ beta ” test version , although the company said it is available to the general public .
Yahoo shares were off 33 cents , or 2.5 percent , at $ 13.01 in afternoon trading on Monday .
Here ’s something for Linux users to be cognisant of – the default mount option for ext3 ’s journaling is going to changing from “ data=ordered ” ( i.e. data is committed to disk prior to its metadata ) to “ data=writeback ” ( i.e. file metadata may be committed to disk before the file data is ) .
This may be down to Ted Ts’o ’s fixes for ext3 fsync ( ) latency in that mode which spawned a long thread on the ext4 list .
Update : apparently
Ted floated the idea at the 2009 Linux Storage & Filesystems Workshop , in his session “ fsync ( ) , rename ( ) , barriers ” – the LWN article notes it made people nervous , saying :
This idea was received with a fair amount of discomfort .
The data=writeback mode brings back problems that were fixed by data=ordered ; after a crash , a file which was being written could turn up with completely unrelated data in it .
It could be somebody else ’s sensitive data .
Even if it ’s boring data , the problem looks an awful lot like file corruption to many users .
It seems like a step backward and a change which is hard to justify for a filesystem which is headed toward maintenance mode .
So it would be surprising to see this change made .
It was later followed by the post script : “ [ After writing the above , your editor noticed that Linus had just merged a change to make data=writeback the default for ext3 in 2.6.30 .
Your editor , it seems , is easily surprised . ] “ .
Given the massive filesystem thread I guess this is going to make for more interesting times on LKML .. ;-/
Update 2 : Forgot to mention too that the relatime option will be the default in 2.6.30 , so by default the access time of a file will no longer be updated for every read .

It usually starts as a joke .
Even you think you ’re kidding , at first .
A treehouse ?
Grow up .
But then fantasy overwhelms your rational instincts , bit by bit .
“ Does n’t everyone want a treehouse ? ” Kit Sickels asks .
That ’s a common assumption among adult treehouse owners , who often have trouble pinpointing the exact nature of their fascination .
“ You ’ll know what I mean when you visit , ” they say .
Sickels , a San Diego real estate developer , and his wife , Karen , a retired schoolteacher , started talking treehouses while vacationing in Colorado .
They followed their whim to an Aspen bookstore , where they bought two books by treehouse maven Peter Nelson .
Nelson ’s Seattle - based company TreeHouse Workshop has built more than 60 treehouses in the last six years , many of them for adults .
The world ’s largest treehouse builder , Scotland - based TreeHouse Co. , fields “ far more enquiries from the States than from all other countries combined , ” says president John Harris , whose company will build more than 150 treehouses this year , up from 40 in 2000 and three in 1996 .
In the past five years , home offices , libraries , guest rooms , even entire houses have increasingly begun migrating skyward , aided by a tightknit cadre of treehouse architects , carpenters , arborists and engineers who build treehouses full time .
Buoyed by the realization that plenty of perfectly sane people choose to spend time in the trees , the Sickelses arranged to meet Nelson in Seattle .
In the weeks following , Nelson drew up a plan and a 32 - year - old carpenter named Bubba Smith rigged himself a temporary home in a tree on the Sickelses ’ 70 - plus acres in northeastern San Diego County .
In June of last year , construction began on what would become one of the few full - amenity treehouses in the country .
For the central figure in the American treehouse movement , it all began 34 years ago in front of a tiny Dutch colonial house in Ridgewood , N.J. Eight - year - old Nelson — a lanky , blond , would - be hippie wearing colorful bell - bottoms — grabbed a hammer and began nailing two - by - fours into a nearby maple .
First he built a ladder , then a platform sprouted in the elbow of the split - trunk tree , then a roof .
Over the next eight years , Nelson and his tomboy kid sister divided their time between trees and the ground .
About the time he got his “ driver ’s license and discovered the opposite sex , ” his arboreal gene went into “ deep freeze , ” he says , but it resurfaced when he was 25 and working in Colorado as a carpenter .
“ I imagined that there were some adult - size treehouses out there , ” says Nelson , who began photographing any he could find .
To gain access , he told people he was working on a coffee - table book .
“ Treehouses : The Art and Craft of Living Out on a Limb , ” was published in 1994 — and still sells .
While swinging through palms in Hawaii , Nelson heard of a guy in Oregon who had just built his first treehouse — so he flew to Portland and drove to “ the middle of nowhere ” to Takilma , a former copper - mining town .
There he met Michael Garnier , a man with an imposing French fur trapper mustache who had opened a bed - and - breakfast hundreds of miles from any potential guests .
There was Charlie Greenwood , a former Silicon Valley engineer , and Jonathan Fairoaks , certified arborist .
These men and others formed the nucleus of the American treehouse movement , and for the past eight years they have returned to Takilma each Columbus Day weekend to participate in the World Treehouse Assn.
Conference .
Conference attendance has grown to about 60 and includes enthusiasts from Japan and Europe who seek workshops on treehouse design or engineering .
Each year they toast breakthroughs such as the Garnier limb , an artificial branch that minimizes puncture damage to the tree while providing an anchor that can hold up to 9,000 pounds .
Today , Garnier ’s Out ’n ’ About Treesort features 18 treehouses up to 37 feet in the air , connected by swaying rope bridges and treetop platforms .
Families can opt for the Suite — replete with queen bed , loft , dining table and antique claw - foot bathtub — or Treezebo , a gazebo - style pad nearly 40 feet above ground .
To get to Treezebo , follow the Mountain View Treeway : a spiral staircase and 135 feet of suspension bridges .
It ’s a veritable city in the trees — bed - and - breakfast , plus Treehouse Institute , where visitors with arboreal inclinations enroll in courses from Treeminology to Treehouse Construction 301 .
The team goes to work
Enter the arborist , who will stage an elaborate dance , kneeling to gauge soil quality , prodding and measuring roots and branches to get a feeling for the site .
Enter the engineer , who will “ assess the critical geometry of the tree or trees , ” explains Greenwood .
Measure base dimensions .
Taper .
Wind mass .
Sail area .
Watch Greenwood plug data into the same computer software used to design the International Space Station .
Nelson patiently draws and redraws , Smith and another carpenter spend the next nine months hammering , and the Sickelses learn to go with the flow .
For lumber , the team fells standing dead oaks on the property , and Nelson ships beautiful refurbished wood from old demolished buildings in Seattle .
A brick fireplace ?
Skylights ?
Let ’s give it a shot !
Finally : plumbing , electricity , heat and air conditioning .
In the end , the house is 980 square feet , 10 feet off the ground .
Kit Sickels “ got writer ’s cramp from signing checks ” — around $ 350,000 worth — but few treehouses are so elaborate and expensive .
Most treehouse owners willingly sacrifice the practical for the fantastical — why bother with a /c and plumbing when you can be like Andrew Fisher and build 40 feet in the air and install a zip line that zooms you directly to a homemade archery range ?
Fisher , a San Francisco interior decorator , is a Napa - based Tarzan come weekends .
He followed the whim , got the books , but Nelson was too busy to call back .
So Fisher phoned Jonathan Fairoaks and soon the arborist was in Napa , climbing and examining bark .
About four months later , in July 2002 , Fairoaks and a crew of two put the finishing touches on a 400 - square - foot room high in the swaying pines .
“ I wanted it to gray out to nothing and fade right into the trees , ” says Fisher , and unless you ’re looking for it you ’re liable to miss this guesthouse and weekend hideaway ensconced in the boughs above .
The end of construction was only the beginning for Fisher , who built “ make - believe furniture ” — such as an oversize “ fantasy Indian daybed ” — and upholstered the walls in gold lamé .
He installed a gilded steel chandelier fashioned to resemble tree branches sprouting from the ceiling and mounted jasmine - filled planter boxes outside .
Treehouses “ are just inherently dreamlike , ” says Fisher .
He and his partner host cocktail parties , and sometimes offer the room to newlyweds who “ find it extremely romantic . ”
All ’s well until windstorms kick up and buffet the treehouse 2 feet from side to side : time to descend — or all part of the adventure , depending on your perspective .
Then there are the unwearied do - it - yourselfers .
Inspired by a treehouse photo in Smithsonian magazine , Pasadena magician Mike Caveney scaled the giant willow in his backyard and “ basically never came down . ”
In 1997 , he donned a mountain climber ’s harness , anchored himself to the trunk , and built a platform 18 feet up .
Next , he spent two years in the garage fashioning redwood walls and a shingled roof .
“ I went as slowly as I could , ” Caveney admits .
“ I did n’t want this to end . ”
When Caveney emerged , he and wife Tina Lenert , also a magician , staged a “ treehouse raising ” party .
Friends and neighbors cheered as Caveney used a pulley system to hoist each piece into place .
The Craftsman - style treehouse took less than an hour to assemble .
Solar panels on the roof generate enough electricity to power reading lights and a small TV .
Even so , Caveney and Lenert often find themselves just sitting .
Sometimes for hours .
Far from the ground , sheltered by fluttering willow fronds , the mind slows and turns inward .
“ Decisions get made up here , ” Lenert says .
New magic tricks bubble from the deep .
An ancient inclination
Winston Churchill had a treehouse at Chartwell Manor , his country estate in Kent , England , as did John Lennon during his first years as a Beatle .
Chances are , though , that they never had to deal with what Garnier calls “ Legalitrees ” — the , “ Hey , you up there in the tree !
That thing is n’t up to code . ”
“ One grouch can take all the wonderment and fantasy away , ” says Jeri Chiavetta , a Huntington Beach grandmother who in 2000 was forced to remove her Greene and Greene - style treehouse after a neighbor complained .
Few cities have specific treehouse zoning regulations , so negative attention can be a death knell .
Locals rallied with petitions and “ Save the Treehouse ! ” signs , to no avail .
Greenwood , the engineer , is working on a model treehouse code that may someday , he hopes , be adopted by city governments .
Until then , make friends with neighbors .
Invite them skyward .
Once people leave the ground , say treehouse owners , they are more likely to build their own hideaway than to nix yours .
Those wild neighbors
You ’re never alone in the trees , says Mike Caveney , who once flipped open the trapdoor of his Pasadena treehouse and encountered 10 glinting eyes .
He backed down the ladder and watched as a family of five raccoons filed down after him , one by one .
He can hear woodpeckers tap - tap - tapping , and the phone cable intersecting the willow is like a freeway for squirrels .
But beyond the colonies of bees that have twice taken up residence in his treetop birdhouse , Caveney does n’t mind keeping company with critters .
It is a tree , after all .
0 BDR , 0 BA , great view
How do you put an earthbound price on something as blissful and Elysian as a treehouse ?
Well , you turn to the comps , of course .
In the area of Pasadena where Mike Caveney and Tina Lenert built their treehouse , homes sold in June for a robust $ 412 per square foot .
The treehouse is 196 square feet , which makes their tiny Craftsman - style addition worth about $ 80,752 in today ’s market .
The squirrels are probably negotiable .
What about the tree ?
Treehouses can bring a hidden benefit to their living hosts by extending the lifespan of the tree , if the structures are installed properly .
They can , for instance , make it more stable by lowering the tree ’s center of gravity and strengthen weak branch structures .
“ Let the tree design the treehouse , ” says Jonathan Fairoaks , an arborist and treehouse builder who considers trees “ very intelligent .
Their chemical makeup allows them to adapt to new stresses . ”
To cut down or eliminate damage to the tree , hire an arborist before picking up a hammer , major treehouse builders say , and follow this advice :
 Build below the tree ’s center of gravity .
 If possible , let two or three trees share the load .
 Puncture the tree as infrequently as possible , and drill holes at a distance from one another so that wounds do n’t coalesce .
 Use bolts and hardware designed for treehouses — this way , the “ tree actually grows over the bolts , and connections grow stronger over time , ” Fairoaks says .
Nails will be slowly expelled .

With so much worldwide panic and pressure surrounding swine flu , you had to guess that the conspiracy theorists would come out of the woodwork .
Everyone wants to find what pig was the original carrier .
Everyone wants to know if the government is behind this .
The FBI ?
The CIA ?
Is this is a great pandemic that was warned about by Nostradamus ?
Is Donald Rumsfeld secretly planning our demise to make money with Tamiflu ?
And who stands to gain ?
As the news continues to break , and everyone wants to name a bad guy first , let ’s take a look at the theories swirling around the Interweb .
From Grist.org :
Swine - flu outbreak could be linked to Smithfield factory farms
Is Smithfield Foods , the world ’s largest pork packer and hog producer , linked to the outbreak ?
Smithfield operates massive hog- raising operations Perote , Mexico , in the state of Vera Cruz , where the outbreak originated .
From MotherJones.com :
Swine flu : Bringing home the bacon
As the world gears up once again for a flu pandemic that may or may not arrive ( it actually seems possible this time ) , we might want to remember some of the lessons of the last flu scare .
One of these is that there are winners as well as losers in every high - profile outbreak of infectious disease .
First and foremost among them , of course , is Big Pharma , which can always be counted on to have its hand out wherever human misery presents an opportunity to rake in some cash .
From LayScientist.net :
This site wryly rounded up an array of blogs and tweets crying “ Conspiracy ! ”
A sample of the notes posted there :
ATTENTION AMERICA !!!!
This is highly significant .
The WHO " Pandemic Control Room " is a creation of the Illuminati elite for the final " end- game " killer virus mapping and tracking , and is thus equipped with super - computers tied to all U.N. member government 's security forces .
Obama makes an official visit to Mexico , and a short week later , Mexico City schools , Universities and all PUBLIC BUILDINGS are shut down in pandemic fear -- ( for the first time since the devastating 1985 earthquake ! )
Again , is this just a bizarre co-incidence ? ? "
From Twitter :
How could we leave out the latest Internet phenomenon ?
Love it or hate it — Twitter is being talked about and used .
Who knew that in 140 characters , hundreds of little tweet - ed paranoias could be passed and spread , much like a virus .
From Twitter user @supergodiva :
Is Swine Flu lethal Israeli scam to force Mexico =Gaza comparison via separation fence ?
http://is.gd/uVnR
Ret. Army General Russell Honore asks @donlemoncnn
" Did this swine flu come out of a lab ? "
http://is.gd/uUaO "
Swine
Flu reported as unusual as it affects the most healthy ( 20 - 45 ) vs weak kids / elderly .
Perfect pathogen to quell dissent .
Finally , from NaturalNews.com :
The naturalists weigh in with “ As Swine Flu Spreads , Conspiracy Theories of Laboratory Origins Abound . ”
From the article :
It 's not an unreasonable question to ask : Could world governments , spooked by the prospect of radical climate change caused by over - population of the planet , have assembled a super - secret task force to engineer and distribute a super virulent strain of influenza designed to " correct " the human population ( and institute global Martial Law ) ?
So , what 's the real truth here ?
One sick pig ?
Man -made lab experiment ?
Population control ?
Pharm companies cashing in ?
Rummy cashing in ?
Or a whole lot of floated hogwash ?
What 's your theory ?

This is the mail archive of the libc-alpha@sourceware.org mailing list for the glibc project .
onwards to git
From : Ulrich Drepper < drepper at redhat dot com >
To : GNU C Library < libc - alpha at sources dot redhat dot com >
Date : Wed , 29 Apr 2009 11:27:57 - 0700
Subject : onwards to git
Immediately after the release of 2.10 on 5/9 we 'll switch over the master and * only * repository for glibc to git .
There is already a git mirror in place so it 's not unheard of .
We 'll recreate the git archive once more from scratch .
To facilitate this there will be absolutely no checkin into the cvs archive without my permission on 5/9 .
I 'll tag the tree on that day and we start the creation of the git archive after that .
The cvs archive will at that point be read - only , forever .
After the migration is verified we 'll announce the glibc git archive and this will be the only source tree from that point on .
We will * not* have the cvs pserver emulation git could provide enabled .
This is more hazzle than it 's worth .
Just jump into the 21st century and use a real DVCS .
Since the git archive will contain all the useful history there is no reason to keep the cvs archive online forever .
I would like to retire it in the not too distant future entirely .
What we do need for the migration is a list of the useful branches in the cvs archive .
Send them along to this list by 5 /8 .
If reasonable , we 'll include those branches in the git archive .
There is certainly a lot of junk in cvs and we want to use this opportunity for some house cleaning .

Google 's search data may have been able to provide an early warning of the swine flu outbreak — if the company had been looking in the right place .
Last week , at the request of the Centers for Disease Control , Google took a retroactive look at its search data from Mexico .
And there the team found a pre-media bump in telltale flu - related search terms ( you know , " influenza + phlegm + coughing " ) that was inconsistent with standard , seasonal flu trends .
" We did see a small increase in many parts of Mexico before major news coverage began last week , " said Jeremy Ginsberg , lead engineer for Google.org 's Flu Trends .
But the Google Flu Trends team , which aggregates and analyzes search queries to estimate how many people are sick , was n't watching Mexican flu data until after the outbreak had already begun .
That highlights the problem with tech - heavy disease - detection systems :
Often , we do n't know what internet data to look at until after a problem starts .
The early signals of disease are hidden in plain sight , and it takes humans recognizing that something is happening before the computers can be asked to find it .
And even if Flu Trends had picked up a noticeable bump in flu searches in Mexico early , a lot of additional analysis would have been required to understand the potential severity of the pandemic .
But it 's encouraging to think that if the Flu Trends system were built out across the globe , it might sound an early alarm about the next unusual flu outbreak .
You can check out the data yourself at the site , Experimental Flu Trends for Mexico , launched today .
Ginsberg cautioned , though , that the correlation between the Mexican flu - search terms and actual epidemiological data had n't been verified .
For the U.S. version of Flu Trends , the Google engineers have been able to check their equations and graphs against actual reported cases of flu .
It turns out their system tracks the CDC data quite nicely .
The U.S. version of Flu Trends also appears to be handling the latest swine flu epidemic well .
The system has n't reported large upticks in states like New York , where the number of cases remains still quite small relative to standard seasonal flu infections .
That means that people simply searching for swine flu or # swineflu are n't generating false - positive spikes in Flu Trends .

THANKS TO MOUNTING bearish technical evidence , the stock market is in a precarious position despite Wednesday 's strength .
The stage has been set for the bears to take over , and while they have not done so yet , the risk for investors jumping in now is just too high .
Last week , I highlighted several indicators saying that the five - week rally has lost its momentum , its fuel and its driving sentiment ( see Getting Technical , " The End of the Rally Is Nigh , " April 8 , 2009 ) .
These factors do not automatically set a top in place , but they do set the stage for a falling trend to begin .
The April 9 rally , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 246 points , seemed to have been a last - gasp type of move .
Volume and breadth were strong enough to inspire market pundits to proclaim that the market had plenty of life left .
After all , it was another new high for the rally and this time a six - month trendline was broken to the upside ( see Chart 1 ) .
Chart 1
The Standard & Poor 's 500 did move above a trendline of sorts drawn from the Oct. 14 high .
I say " of sorts " because I do not believe it really was a valid trendline at all .
True , it followed many textbook rules for trendline construction but not my biggest personal rule .
It did not describe the action .
Unless trendlines keep investors on the right side of the market , they are merely lines drawn connecting unrelated points on a chart .
Critics will point out that a trendline that runs through not two but four market peaks is a valid line .
Normally , I would agree but in this case there were rallies and declines on the order of 25 % along the way .
If we apply the journalist 's favorite rule that bull and bear markets are characterized by 20 % moves up and down , respectively , we can then cite at least two bull and two bear markets since October .
Of course , the market 's major condition is still bearish overall .
So is it valid to use one trendline to describe two full up and down cycles ?
My answer is an emphatic no .
Therefore , last week 's action cannot have been the strong breakout that many believe .
I am not saying that the market cannot edge higher but at what risk ?
With so much overhead supply waiting to come out at 875 on the S&P 500 and then again at 950 , there is not a lot of upside room .
Contrast that to the downside risk of another trip to major support at 741 and again at 666 .
As I 've said before , just because it is a rally does not mean it is a good idea to play it .
Let 's go back to the chart to look at a pattern called a " rising wedge " ( see Chart 2 ) .
Although prices continued to rise , swings between rallies and pullbacks diminished .
It tells us that uncertainty is building and that is not good for bullish trends .
Chart 2
Given that overall market volume continues to decline , the lack of conviction by the bulls is becoming critical .
The wedge pattern is nearly complete , and all it would take is one or two big down days to trigger the breakdown .
The Nasdaq presents a different picture as there is no declining trendline about which to argue ( see Chart 3 ) .
Rather , there is a clear resistance zone at 1652 - 1165 , and it has so far successfully stopped the rally .
Chart 3
In technical literature , resistance is a price at which rallies tend to stop .
They do not necessarily have to reverse course , but the burden of proof falls on the bulls ' shoulders .
It is up to them to prove that demand can soak up all the supply that is released at resistance .
Anything less hands the reins to the bears .
Can the Nasdaq break out from here ?
Of course it can .
But when we look at all the technical factors mentioned earlier , the odds are stacked against it .
For now , it 's a waiting game .
The bulls have stumbled , but the bears have not yet seized control .

Priors and the Argument By Design
Although I ’m not completely sold on the book as a whole , Ken Binmore ’s “ Rational Decisions ” is a great collection of very sharp , terse insights into many paradoxes and counter - intuitive results regarding probability and decision theory .
One such digression is his five sentence analysis of the “ Argument By Design ” that is central to the Intelligent Design movement .
With minor modification to his notation , it goes like this :
Let F be the event that something appears to have been organized .
Let G be the event that there is an organizer .
Everybody agrees that \( \mathbb {P}( F|G ) > \ mathbb{P}(F|
eg G ) \ ) , but the argument by design needs to deduce that \( \mathbb { P}( G|F ) > \ mathbb{P} (
eg G|F ) \ ) if God ’s existence is to be more likely than not .
Applying Bayes ’ rule , we find that \[ \ mathbb {
P}( G|F ) = \ frac{\mathbb{P}(F|G) \mathbb{P}(G)}{\mathbb{P}(F|G)\mathbb{P}(G ) + \ mathbb{P}(F|
eg G ) \mathbb {P} (
eg G ) }. \]
If \( \mathbb {P}( G ) \ge \mathbb {P} (
eg G ) \ ) , we can deduce the required conclusion that \( \mathbb { P}( G|F ) > \ mathbb{P} (
eg G|F ) \ ) , but we are otherwise left in doubt .
From this snappy argument he concludes
Bayesianism therefore has an explanation of why religious folk are more ready to accept the argument by design than skeptics !
As an atheist with Bayesian tendencies , I was very ready to accept this argument against the argument by design , but upon reflection I think this conclusion is arrived at too quickly .
Since we are computing probabilities anyway , why stop at checking if one is just larger than the other when we can compute odds ?
Rather than just ask whether \( \mathbb {P}( G|F ) > \ mathbb{P} (
eg G|F ) \ ) we can compute the odds \( \mathbb {P}(G|F ) /\mathbb{P}(
eg G|F ) \ ) and see how far it is from 1 .
Specifically , \[ \ frac{ \mathbb {P}( G|F) }{\mathbb{P} (
eg G|F ) } = \ frac{\mathbb{P}(F|G) \mathbb{P}(G)}{\mathbb{P}(F|
eg G ) \mathbb {P} (
eg G) } = \ frac{\mathbb{P}(F|G)}{\mathbb{P}(F|
eg G) } \cdot\frac{\mathbb{P}(G)}{\mathbb{P}(
eg G) } \ ] since the denominator in Binmore ’s calculation is just \( \mathbb { P} ( F ) \ ) — the probability that “ something appears to have been organized ” and is assumed to be the same for believer and skeptic alike .
Now we see that the argument by design increases one ’s belief in God given that organisation is observed ( since we have assumed \( \mathbb { P}( F|G ) > \ mathbb{P}(F|
eg G ) \ ) ) but will only “ convert ” a non-believer to a believer if the likelihood ratio for God is larger than the non-believer ’s initial skepticism , as measured by his or her subjective odds against God ’s existence .
That is , if \ [ L = \ frac{ \mathbb {
P}( F|G)}{\mathbb{P}(F|
eg G) } > \ frac{\mathbb{P} (
eg G)}{\mathbb{P}( G) } = R. \]
The strength of the argument by design is a function of the likelihood ratio \ ( L\ ) of observing organised things with and without assuming a God .
However , contrary to Binmore ’s conclusion , I believe the real reason ID advocates and skeptics disagree as to the strength of the argument by design is due to differences in this likelihood ratio .
It is fair to assume , as Binmore does , that the the likelihood ratio \ ( L_r\ ) for an ID advocate and the likelihood ratio \ ( L_s\ ) of a skeptic are both greater than 1 since there are many man-made artefacts such as watches that clearly do have an “ organizer ” .
However , I would additionally argue that \( L_r > L_s\ ) .
Why ?
Well , presumably a skeptic who belies in evolution sees the natural world as a whole lot of things that were organised without an organiser whereas the ID advocate does not .
An ID advocate with a large \ ( L_r\ ) will believe that even if you were very skeptical ( small \ ( R\ ) ) , the product of \ ( L_r\ ) and \ ( R\ ) would be much larger than 1 and you would therefore be convinced to believe in God .
From the point of view of a skeptic though \ ( L_s\ ) would not be larger than \ ( R\ ) and so the argument by design is not convincing .
It was the season of the Seven - Five - Three Festival .
Many people who had children of the ages offered prayers at Shinto shrines .
I saw many such families in this shrine .
When I came to the gate of this shrine , I saw a nicely dressed boy , his mother and his grandmother standing there .
All of them were silhouetted .
They could come here to celebrate a traditional rite of passage .
And the boy seemed to be happy .
Were the Founders “ Post - Christian ” ?
Two years ago , Newsweek editor Jon Meacham published American Gospel : God , the Founding Fathers , and the Making of a Nation .
There , as in his public appearances and journalism since , Meacham argued that the United States were founded on a Madisonian vision of secular government .
Meacham of course did not blaze any new trail making that argument .
In fact , since the Supreme Court ’s decision in Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township ( 1947 ) , Americans have lived under a system in which local and state ordinances recognizing the traditional Christianity of their culture are apt to be invalidated by federal courts .
Usually , the decisions striking such ordinances down come wrapped in opinions purporting to instruct the hoi polloi in the error of our ways .
Thus , the pre-game prayers we said before we went out under the Friday night lights in the little Texas town where I graduated from high school in 1981 supposedly now would be unconstitutional .
Ditto the invocation at the annual baccalaureate exercises , led by local ministers on a rotating basis .
The same holds for traditional Christian imagery in long - standing city seals , Christian symbols on public land , and myriad other nods to the base of most Americans ”  conception of the cosmos .
Just in time for the Easter holiday , Meacham gives over his magazine ’s cover and prime pages to a story under the title “  The Decline and Fall of Christian America . ” 
Here , Meacham explains that recently , Christianity ’s political and cultural influence in America has been waning .
Now , he notes , there has been a significant decline in the proportion of Americans claiming to be Christian : from 86 % to 76 % in the last 19 years .
He adjudges this “ good for our political culture . ” 
Claiming high secular authority , Meacham says that political culture is “ as the American Founders saw , … complex and charged enough without attempting to compel or coerce religious belief or observance . ” 
Reading this assertion , my antennae pricked up .
Which Founders ?
Compel how ?
What does he mean by “ religious belief or observance ” ?
People familiar with the Revolution and Early Republic ”  the period when the American tradition of writing constitutions was born ” can guess easily enough , even without prior familiarity with Meacham ’s argument , which figures he has in mind : perhaps Tom Paine , possibly Benjamin Franklin , and certainly James Madison and Thomas Jefferson .
Sure enough : there they are , two pages later :
By the time of the American Founding , men like Jefferson and Madison saw the virtue in guaranteeing liberty of conscience , and one of the young republic ’s signal achievements was to create a context in which religion and politics mixed but church and state did not .
Hmm .
What does Meacham mean by that ?
The half - educated ( think of Justice Hugo Black writing for the Court in Everson ) might conjure up a mental image of Jefferson with Latin , Greek , French , and English editions of the Bible , carefully excising anything his to - this - purpose - feeble mind could not explain .
This , he might think , was The Founding Fathers ”  Attitude Toward Church and State .
Well , yes , it was Jefferson ’s attitude ” in private .
For some reason , Jefferson kept his biblical bowdlerization to himself .
Only after his death did his favorite grandson , Thomas Jefferson Randolph , publicize Jefferson ’s account of Christ ’s life .
And what was the reason that Jefferson did not publicize his hostility to the Bible far and wide ?
As he explained to an acquaintance in another context , Jefferson had several irons in the political fire , and to make himself obnoxious on a question about which he was not going to persuade his compatriots would only defeat his other efforts .
Discretion , in other words , was the better part of valor : Jefferson knew that his fellow Virginians would have drummed him out of political life if he had told them what he thought .
Besides which , as then - Justice William Rehnquist noted in dissent in the Wallace v. Jaffree “ moment of silence ” decision , Jefferson had nothing to do with drafting the federal Bill of Rights .
Indeed , he didn ” t help write his own state ’s declaration of rights or constitution , not to mention the federal Constitution , either .
It thus is difficult to see what his private conception of the proper relationship between church and state , Christianity and government , has to do with the U.S. Constitution .
Yet , on the other hand , James Madison favored the project of abolishing legislation to govern the human mind .
He , unlike Jefferson , played a significant role in drafting not only Article XVI of the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( the church - state article ) , but also the U.S. Constitution and the federal Bill of Rights .
Surely if he favored secular government , as he certainly did , that proves that the Founding bequeathed us a system in which Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Ginsburg are within their rights , indeed doing their duty , when they say that high school students in , say , Belton , Texas cannot constitutionally be led in the Lord ’s Prayer by their coach after a football game .
Well , no .
For James Madison ’s private opinions , even his public positions , are not equivalent to any particular provision of the U.S. Constitution .
( This is a good thing , since Madison was about as consistent as the weather in a Texas spring . )
In fact , one of the most common errors in scholarship about the Constitution is to elevate Madison ’s every private jotting and utterance to the status of the Constitution itself .
Like Jefferson , Madison knew that his private preferences were unpopular in Virginia .
It is to his public position that we ought to look , and then only when it was consistent with that of the body that gave a particular constitutional text effect .
Madison said in the Philadelphia Convention that wrote the Constitution and , and this is what counts , in the ratification campaign thereafter that a bill of rights was unnecessary .
In fact , he said that amendments along that line could be dangerous .
But Madison did not reckon with public opinion , specifically with Baptists ”  opinion , in his home community , Piedmont Orange County , Virginia .
His neighbors ( read : the local electorate ) insisted there be a religious liberty amendment , because they feared a revivification of the colonial Episcopalian establishment if there wasn ” t .
Besides the Baptists , Madison ’s elite political friends Edmund Randolph , Jefferson , and George Mason all insisted that there must be a bill of rights .
That ’s why Madison promised that he would propose amendments in the first federal Congress : he disliked the idea , but popular and elite pressure in Virginia squeezed grudging support for it out of him .
Having promised to sponsor amendments , Madison was narrowly elected to the first U.S. House after being rejected as too nationalist ” too much in favor of centralization ” in Virginia ’s election for the first Senate .
Madison did not believe that the First Amendment banned state actions such as having local ministers give invocations at public - school events .
Meacham is right to say that he and Jefferson favored such a prohibition , but he is wrong to imply that anyone in the Founding era wrote one into federal law .
The supposed location of this prohibition in the Constitution is the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .
The First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause , however , says “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ”  ( emphasis added ) , and it means precisely that : that Congress shall make no such law .
Far from fortuitously , this language was intentionally about Congress , and not the state legislatures .
As the Preamble to the Bill of Rights shows , the entire purpose of the Bill of Rights was further to delineate the limits on federal authority , because Antifederalists insisted that the unamended Constitution had not made those limits clear enough .
The phrase “ respecting an establishment of ”  was chose instead of “ establishing ”  because the former could be read as banning congressional disestablishment of states ”  established churches , as well as congressional attempts to establish a national church .
Why , you might ask , would James Madison , the chief author of the Bill of Rights , have omitted a provision allowing the federal government to police states ”  policy - making in this area ?
After all , as we ” ve seen , he favored secular government , and the unamended Constitution already included some provisions ” most notably but not only the Contracts Clause ” empowering federal officials to police state behavior .
The answer is that he tried .
The First Congress ’s Bill of Rights included twelve proposed amendments , of which ten were ratified in 1791 and one was ratified in 1992 .
It did not include the one that Madison ever after insisted had been the most important one : his proposed amendment stating that “  No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience … . ” 
Madison had attempted to use the Philadelphia Convention to create a national government , and he had been disappointed .
He then vowed to sponsor amendments clarifying the limits of federal power , but this characteristic subterfuge yielded a proposed amendment to empower federal officials to intervene to regulate the states ”  religion policies .
Pace Meacham , Madison not only failed to write a federal ban on state religion legislation into the Constitution , but he could not even get it out of the House .
Meacham notes that Christians have endeavored sporadically since 1962 to overturn the Supreme Court ’s opinion that year banning prayer in public schools .
He omits that so unpopular was that decision in its day that all but one governor insisted it should be countermanded .
The Constitution makes amendment difficult , except in the case of amendment via judicial legislation ; that kind of amendment , which is far the most common kind , is virtually impossible to correct .
The Supreme Court can foist off upon us a decision such as the School Prayer Decision , with which Americans never agreed and to which they never consented , and there is essentially nothing that can be done about it .
Yes , our culture is becoming less Christian .
I attribute this in large part to the success of the Supreme Court in wiping Christianity out of our public life .
The Court ’s campaign to do so has been aided and abetted by other significant actors in American intellectual life , such as the editor of Newsweek .
When people like Jon Meacham tell us that the attenuation of the Christian element in our culture is simply a trend , perhaps like the weather , and that it is in consonance with what the sainted Founders wanted , who can contradict them ?
Who knows any better ?
It is in the interest of the government to aid in divinizing the government , including its creators .
The cult of Madison and Pals may well replace the old one , Christianity , in Americans ”  affection .
If it does so , that event will mark the success of a long - standing propaganda campaign by figures such as Jon Meacham and Hugo Black , Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Ginsburg .

The ' secret ' documents clutched by Mr Quick were clearly on show Twelve men have been arrested in the north west of England after Britain 's most senior counter - terrorism police officer sparked a security alert .
Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick said he " deeply regretted " revealing a secret document to photographers when he arrived for a briefing at No 10 .
The document , clearly marked " secret " , carried an outline briefing on an ongoing counter - terrorism operation .
The 12 suspects were later arrested at locations across north - west England .
It is understood raids took place at 10 addresses sooner than planned due to the documents being revealed .
Opposition MPs criticised Mr Quick , with the Liberal Democrats describing him as " accident prone " and the Conservatives condemning his " very alarming " lapse of judgement .
But former Labour Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said it would be wrong for such an experienced officer to resign " for holding a piece of paper the wrong way " .

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith made no comment about the officer 's mistake .
Instead , she praised police for their professionalism .
" The decision to take such action was an operational matter for the police and the security service , " she said , adding that she and the Prime Minister had been kept informed of developments .
Police were shouting at [ a suspect ] and one of the officers had what looked like a machine gun pointed right into his head
Student Daniel Taylor
Some hours after the Downing Street incident , armed officers from the North West Counter - Terrorism Unit arrested a man outside the main library at Liverpool John Moores University .
Students said they heard police shouting at two suspects as they were advised over the library loudspeaker to stay away from the windows for their own safety .
Journalism student Daniel Taylor said : " I saw a man on the floor .
Police were shouting at him and one of the officers had what looked like a machine gun pointed right into his head . "
Police wearing blue plastic gloves were searching the man , along with a second man nearby , and both appeared to be " ordinary students " , Mr Taylor said .
Ten of those arrested are Pakistan - born nationals on student visas and one is a UK - born British national .
Their precise ages are not known but range between a youth in his mid- to - late teens and a 41 - year - old man .
Greater Manchester Police said several hundred officers were involved in the operation , including armed officers during some of the arrests .
Five addresses in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester , including an internet cafe , are being searched .
Three premises are being searched in Merseyside , plus a guest house in Clitheroe , Lancashire .
Two men are understood to have been arrested at a Homebase DIY store in Clitheroe , where dozens of police officers carried out a raid .
In Cheetham Hill , witnesses described two men being taken from the cafe after police arrived .
Mesu Raza , who lives in the flat above , said : " I saw police arrest two people and put them in a police van .
They had handcuffs on , they were Asian men , and the police were armed . "
The counter - terrorism officers were assisted by officers from the Merseyside , Greater Manchester and Lancashire police forces .
Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Porter , head of the North West CTU said : " Today 's action is part of a continuing investigation and we have acted on intelligence received .
" This phase is still in its very early stages , so the information we can release about it is limited . "

Advertisement Earlier on Wednesday press photographers in Downing Street pictured Mr Quick clutching a white document marked " secret " and containing the names of several senior officers , locations and details about the nature of the overseas threat .
Details of the information revealed cannot be reported .
Mr Quick was attending the meeting in his role as lead for counter terrorism and for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) .
On Wednesday evening he apologised to Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson for the error .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said : " Assistant Commissioner Quick accepts he made a mistake on leaving a sensitive document on open view and deeply regrets it . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said Mr Quick 's judgement had been called into question .
" This was highly sensitive information that should not have been carried under an arm in front of a line of photographers , " he added .
Secrets revealed Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick seems to be increasingly accident prone which is potentially dangerous given the serious responsibilities of his role . "
Ken Livingstone said : " The idea that we should offer up the person who 's at the head of our counter terrorism , with years of experience - a dedicated public servant , for one mistake of holding a piece of paper the wrong way - well , al - Qaeda will be delighted . "
Mr Quick , once seen as a " safe pair of hands " by Scotland Yard colleagues , ordered the controversial arrest of senior Tory MP Damian Green over alleged security leaks .
Last December , he accused the Conservatives of involvement in newspaper stories about his wife 's hire car business .
It is not the first time secret information has been revealed to journalists who habitually stand outside Downing Street .
Last year housing minister Caroline Flint inadvertently showed off secret Cabinet briefing notes revealing a steep projected fall in UK house prices .

Subject : Please stop implying that we 're assassins
by Jeremy Hooper
Dear Social Conservatives ,
We know your goal is to make the LGBT community seem like unsavory militants whose lives run counter to all that is good , right , and holy in this world .
But can you all do us a solid and pleeeeeeeeease stop implying that we want to murder heterosexual couples / families ?
Pretty please ?
Many of us saw that West Virginia video in which a family of four is placed behind a sniper 's crosshairs in order to make a fear - mongery point .
But now the Family Research Council is running with that same concept , using this graphic to highlight the illustrate the recent victories in Iowa and Vermont :
Everybody sing :
♫ " Here comes the bride ,
She better hide
Because gay marriage uses John Hinckley as a guide
There is the groom
He 'll face his doom
If there 's to be a queer wedding boom " ♫
Look , we really do n't want to assassinate heteros .
Honestly .
Hell , the writer who 's speaking to you now is a staunchly anti-gun vegetarian who does n't even want to kill a gnat , much less hetero human beings .
Yet I 'm constantly confronted with supposedly " pro-family " people who want to put me in a Dallas , TX , book depository simply because I am pledging a vow of monogamous commitment to another man .
It 's not only an offensive tactic -- it 's borderline sociopathic !
We gay folk do n't expect social conservs all to come around to our way of thinking , and that 's fine .
But surely we can have public dialogue without this whole gunplay meme .
It may seem like all fund and games to those of you who are desperate to stop queer " i dos " at any cost .
But political fun and games end not when someone loses an eye , but rather when one side overplays their hand and destroys all credibility .
It does n't take a rocket scientist ( or NRA member ) to see that invoking assassination attempts is a surefire reputation killer !
Best ,
Jeremy Hooper

Hee hee , so true .

LOL @ the married couple in the sights of a sniper gun !
Why would anyone want to kill them , when their misery has just begun on that blessed day ?
That 's more wasteful than peeling an unripened banana .

... and also really a bad move for Gay people to kill opposite sex couples - they literally the major source of LBGT people .

( CNN ) -- Insurance agent David Conn received a postcard recently in his Hudson , Ohio , post office box : " Greetings from Montana . "
This postcard was mailed in 1962 and arrived -- perhaps not for the first time -- at its destination in 2009 .
The card said Fran and Polly were enjoying their cross-country train ride and had fed deer somewhere along the way .
That was all nice , and a little curious for several reasons :
One , Conn did n't know anyone named Fran or Polly ; two , the card was addressed to a different name at his P.O. box ; and three , it had been mailed in 1962 .
" This card looks like somebody just bought it at the drugstore , " Conn told CNN .
" It 's not even yellowed .
It looks spankin ' new . "
The card was addressed to Marion White , who was editor of Hudson 's North Summit Times newspaper and once held the post office box Conn now uses .
She later served for more than 20 years on the Hudson Village Council .
She died in 1988 .
A few days after receiving the card , Conn talked to White 's relatives and others , who told him the sender had to be Fran Murphey .
Murphey was an iconic Akron Beacon Journal reporter who lived her whole life in the same house near Hudson .
She died in 1998 .
Murphey 's life was an eccentric mixture of the mundane and the extraordinary .
In her 55 years with the Beacon Journal , she became a local celebrity .
She was well - known for , among other things , her preference for bib overalls , her love of travel , her sometimes salty language , her expertise on outhouses and her vast collection of postcards -- a quarter of a million of them , according to her niece Barbara Joy Godar .
" She was definitely one of a kind , " said Godar , 73 , of Akron .
" She was a corker . "
Murphey 's dispatch from Montana chronicled a trip she took with friend and colleague Polly Paffilas , who died in 2005 .
It bore a 3 - cent stamp , the postcard rate in 1962 , and was hand - canceled twice on July 5 , 1962 , with a Smokey Bear indicia at the Helena , Montana , post office .
Mail sometimes falls behind machinery or is left in a discarded mail bag and languishes for years at a time , but there 's no telling where Murphey 's card spent the past 47 years , said Mark Saunders , a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service in Washington .
Victor Dubina , a postal service spokesman for northern and central Ohio , declined to surmise what happened to Murphey 's card .
" Anything I 'd guess would be sheer speculation , " he said .
" Over the course of the years we 've seen little things like this pop up , and it's never the same . "
It 's unlikely the card was lost in the mail since 1962 , two antiques dealers said Wednesday .
A penciled notation near the stamp indicates the card was sold for $ 1 at booth " # 32 " in an antique shop somewhere , said Howard Diefenbach , who owns an antique shop in Bay City , Michigan , and Grant Winchell , who sells postcards through Diefenbach 's shop .
Fran Murphey Birth - death : 1922-1998
Years as reporter : 55
Words written ( est. ) : 30 million
Photos taken ( est. ) : 40,000
Postcards collected ( est. ) : 250,000
Sources : Akron Beacon Journal , Barbara Joy Godar
" It 's common practice for most dealers make a mark in pencil on a card to indicate the price and which booth it 's from , " Diefenbach said .
Dealers make the mark in pencil so the buyer can erase it without compromising the value of the card , said Winchell , who happens to hold booth number 32 in the shop but does n't claim any relationship to Murphey 's card .
The $ 1 price would be appropriate for that type of card in today 's market , he added .
Conn is n't sure what he 'll do with the card .
He may frame it and hang it on his wall .
He 's also considering donating it to Hudson 's historical society or giving it to the Beacon Journal to display .
Whatever route the card took , it makes for an interesting artifact , Dubina said .
" This is a lost art , " he said .
" Anymore , you either send an e-mail or send a tweet : ' I 'm on the edge of the Grand Canyon . '
See the postcards that iReporters treasure »
" Bless Fran 's heart , she wrote postcards .
We just do n't see that much of it anymore , " Dubina said .
" Thirty years from now , 40 years from now , who 's going to say , ' Ooh , I just got an e-mail from Victor ' ?
' How did I get it ?
What happened ? ' "
It 's something special for loved ones , too , Saunders added .
" That piece of tangible postcard , that ' Greetings from Montana , ' that 's almost a piece of that individual that extends beyond their life , " Saunders said .
Murphey built her postcard collection in part by mailing cards to friends while traveling and then asking for them back when she returned , Conn said .
" I can just picture her finally getting back from her trip , saying , ' OK , hey , Marion , where 's that card I sent you from Montana ? ' and [ White ] said , ' I never got that card from Montana , ' and [ Murphey ] was probably thinking , ' That 's part of my collection !
Where 's the card ? ' "
Conn said .
" And here it is 47 years later , and it appears . "
In her lengthy 1998 obituary in the Beacon Journal , colleagues recounted having to wait in the hallway outside Murphey 's hospice room while she made phone calls for one final story .
" When she gets to heaven , I would n't be surprised if Fran finds some way to send news from the beyond , " former Beacon Journal books editor Betsy Lammerding said in the obituary .
Looks like she found a way .

“ You see , the fact is that for years these same individuals – many of them , not all of them , but many of them – who pronounced religious doctrine did not exercise it when young gay and lesbian students were being chastised for expressing their point of view .
Where were these leaders of faith when college students of gay and lesbian orientation were beaten and often brutalized for expressing their feelings for each other ? …
All I ’m saying is :
Why did n’t they speak about that at the time when it was the other way around ?
See what really makes a democracy work is when you speak for others rights even when you disagree with them .
I ’m saying most of the religious leaders that I hear speaking out now did not do it at the time .
Had they done so I think they would have better moral standing to speak at this moment on this legislation even though I disagree with them . ”

The allure of two female German hitch - hikers was blamed by a Southland man convicted of drink - driving .
Christopher Ralston , 30 , was driving through Motueka in November when he stopped and got talking to two female German hitch - hikers , the Invercargill District Court heard yesterday .
Defence lawyer David Slater said Ralston had not intended to imbibe in alcohol , but he drank two stubbies of beer while with the women .
" They were Germans and you know what they do when drinking is concerned , " he said to Judge Kevin Phillips .
Ralston then drove on , drinking another two stubbies in his car , before being pulled over by police and being found to have a breath - alcohol level of 484mcg , the court heard .
Although it was his fifth drink - driving offence , each had been at the lower end of the scale and he was a hard - working man who had met all his financial requirements to society , Mr Slater said .

Britain ’s Channel 4
News aired a video report on Thursday night showing Taliban forces on the streets of the strategically important Pakistani town of Buner , just 70 miles from the country ’s capital , Islamabad .
As Carlotta Gall and Eric Schmidt explain in The Times , a near total lack of resistance from Pakistan ’s military has allowed just “ 400 to 500 insurgents , ” to seize control of the area .

News report also features footage of a large Taliban rally earlier this week in the neighboring Swat Valley , where the government ceded control to the Taliban in a peace deal , and an interview with a spokesman for the Taliban in Swat .
On Wednesday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that “ the Pakistani government is basically abdicating to the Taliban , ” but the spokesman , Haji Muslim Khan , said that Taliban anger was partly caused by the presence of female American soldiers in the region .
Mr. Khan said that Pakistan ’s prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , “ should think about Western white women who take up arms and come from 20,000 miles away to fight against us here . ”
Given that the circumference of the planet is only about 25,000 miles , it is not clear what route Mr. Khan believes Western forces are taking to get to Pakistan .

C. Political Repression and Social Control in the Industrial Revolution .
Even after the expropriation of their land , the working class was not sufficiently powerless .
The state still had to regulate the movement of labor , serve as a labor exchange on behalf of capitalists , and maintain order .
And historically , this function was most vital when the bargaining power of labor threatened to increase : " one might expect that the efforts of the State in a capitalist society to control wages and to restrict the freedom of movement of the labourer would be greater when the labour reserve was depleted than when it was swollen .
"
65 Thorold Rogers described the law from the Tudor period until the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824 , as a conspiracy ... to cheat the English workman of his wages , to tie him to the soil , to deprive him of hope , and to degrade him into irremediable poverty ....
For more than two centuries and a half the English law , and those who administered the law , were engaged in grinding the English workman down to the lowest pittance , in stamping out every expression or act which indicated any organized discontent , and in multiplying penalties upon him when he thought of his natural rights .
66
As we have seen above , the liquidation of the Church 's system of poor relief left a void to be filled by the Tudor state 's harsh regulation of the working class .
The act of Henry VIII in 1530 licensed beggars who were old or infirm , while providing for the whipping and imprisonment of " sturdy vagabonds . "
The 27 Henry VIII strengthened the statute with ear - cropping for second offenders , and execution for third .
I Edward VI ( 1547 ) condemned anyone who refused work as a slave to whoever denounced him .
The 1572 act of Elizabeth I prescribed execution of unlicensed beggars on the second offense , unless someone would " take them into service . "
The statutes were only repealed at the end of the sixteenth century , by 12 Ann , cap. 23 , when they had done their work .
" Thus were the agricultural people , first forcibly expropriated from the soil , driven from their homes , turned into vagabonds , and then whipped , branded , tortured by laws grotesquely terrible , into the discipline necessary for the wage system .
" 67 Queen Anne 's repeal of the Tudor legislation did not , by any means , put an end to state - imposed regulation of the working class ' movement .
The laws of settlement had been created , in the meantime , and were later supplemented by the Combination Laws and the police state of Pitt .
The government continued to set maximum wages , as well .
The Act of Settlement dates back to 1662 .
There had been a great deal of lower class movement during the Interregnum , characterized by the tendency of " poor people ... to settle themselves in those parishes where there is the best stock , the largest commons or wastes to build cottages and the most woods for them to burn or destroy . "
As that quote from the preamble might suggest , the Act was intended to remedy such excess mobility .
Under its terms , two justices of the peace in each county were empowered to eject any newcomer to a parish without independent means , and return him to his parish of origin .
The legislation was explicitly directed against cottagers and squatters in commons , and was evidently followed " by a destruction of cottages erected in the free times of the interregnum .
"
68 In a quotation earlier in this chapter , Marx referred to the " laws of settlements " as analogous to " the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunov " in their effect on the English working population .
Had he been more familiar with events in America at the time he wrote , he might have referred to the Black Codes as a better analogy .
Had he lived into the twentieth century , he might have cited the internal passport systems of South Africa or the Soviet Union .
The British state 's controls on the movement of population , during the Industrial Revolution , were a system of totalitarian control comparable to all these .
Under the Poor Laws and the Laws of Settlement , a member of the English working class was restricted to the parish of his birth , unless an official of another parish granted him a permit to reside there .
The state maintained work discipline by keeping laborers from voting with their feet .
It was hard to persuade parish authorities to grant a man a certificate entitling him to move to another parish to seek work .
Even on the rare occasion when such a certificate was granted , it amounted to a system of peonage in which the worker 's continued residence in the new parish was conditioned on maintaining the good will of his employer .
Workers were forced to stay put and sell their labor in a buyer 's market .
Adam Smith ventured that there was " scarce a poor man in England of forty years of age ... who has not in some part of his life felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill - contrived law of settlements .
" 69 At first glance this would seem also to be inconvenient for employers in parishes with a labor shortage .70 Factories were built at sources of water power , generally removed from centers of population .
Thousands of workers were needed to be imported from far away .
But the state solved the problem by setting itself up as a middleman , and providing labor - poor parishes with cheap surplus labor from elsewhere , depriving workers of the ability to bargain for better terms on their own .
This practice amounted , in nearly every sense of the term , to a slave market :
No doubt , in certain epochs of feverish activity , the labour market shows significant gaps .
In 1834 , e.g..
But then the manufacturers proposed to the Poor Law Commissioners that they should send the " surplus population " of the agricultural districts to the north , with the explanation " that the manufacturers would absorb and use it up . "
" Agents were appointed with the consent of the Poor Law Commissioners ....
An office was set up in Manchester , to which lists were sent of those workpeople in the agricultural districts wanting employment , and their names were registered in books .
The manufacturers attended at these offices , and selected such persons as they chose ; ... they gave instructions to have them forwarded to Manchester , and they were sent , ticketed like bales of goods , by canals , or with carriers , others tramping on the road , and many of them were found on the way lost and half - starved .
This system had grown up into a regular trade .
This House will hardly believe it , but I tell them that this traffic in human flesh was as well kept up , they were in effect as regularly sold to these ... manufacturers as slaves are sold to the cotton grown in the United States . " 71
There you have it : the Tudor state without the whippings , ear - croppings and executions ; the Black Codes without the lynchings .
Child laborers , who were in no position to bargain in any case , were a popular commodity in these poor - house slave markets .
According to John Fielden ( " The Curse of the Factory System , 1836 ) , In the counties of Derbyshire , Nottinghamshire , and more particularly in Lancashire , the newly invented machinery was used in large factories built on the sides of streams capable of turning the water - wheel .
Thousands of hands were suddenly required in these places , remote from towns ....
The small and nimble fingers of little children being by very far , the most in request , the custom instantly sprang up of procuring apprentices from the different parish workhouses of London , Birmingham , and elsewhere .
72 Relief " was seldom bestowed without the parish claiming the exclusive right of disposing , at their pleasure , of all the children of the person receiving relief , " according to the Committee on Parish Apprentices , 1815.73 Frances Trollope estimated that 200,000 children , altogether , were pressed into factory labor .
74 Even when Poor Law commissioners encouraged migration to labor - poor parishes , they discouraged adult men and " [ p ] reference was given to ' widows with large families of children or handicraftsmen ... with large families . ' "
In addition , the availability of cheap labor from the poor - law commissioners was deliberately used to drive down wages ; farmers would discharge their own day - laborers and instead apply to the overseer for help .
75 Although the Combination Laws theoretically applied to masters as well as workmen , in practice they were only enforced against the latter .
76 " A Journeyman Cotton Spinner " - - a pamphleteer quoted by E. P. Thompson77 -- described " an abominable combination existing amongst the masters , " in which workers who had left their masters because of disagreement over wages were effectively blacklisted .
The Combination Laws required suspects to answer interrogations on oath , empowered magistrates to give summary judgment , and allowed summary forfeiture of funds accumulated to aid the families of strikers .
78
In other words , workers subject to the Combination Law magistrates were deprived of all the common law 's due process protections .
Workers , far from possessing the much - heralded " rights of Englishmen , " were thrown into prerogative courts as arbitrary as Star Chamber .
At the same time , the laws setting maximum rates of pay amounted to a state enforced system of combination for the masters .
In Adam Smith 's immortal words , " [ w ] henever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between the masters and their workmen , its counselors are always the masters .
" 79
In the mid-19th century , a superficial examiner might conclude , the state 's " progressive " reforms finally began to remedy all these evils .
But as the historians of corporate liberalism have shown us in regard to the " progressive " reforms of the twentieth century , these " reforms " were in fact undertaken in the interests of the ruling class .
Their ameliorating effect on working conditions , to the real but limited extent they occurred , were a side effect of their main purpose of increasing political stability and bringing the working class under more effective social control .80 Regarding legislation for the ten - hour day , for example , Marx described it as an attempt by capitalists to regulate the " greed for surplus labour " ; they served to regulate the economy in the interest of the capitalist class as a whole , in a way that could only be accomplished by acting through the state .
With competition unlimited by the state , the issue of working conditions presents a prisoner 's dilemma for the individual capitalist ; it is in the interest of the capitalist class as a whole that the exploitation of labor be kept to sustainable levels , but in the interest of the individual capitalist to gain an immediate advantage over the competition by working his own labor force to the breaking point .
As we shall see in Chapter 6 below on the rise of monopoly capitalism , the real effect of such regulations is to coordinate labor practices through a state - enforced cartel , so that those practices are no longer an issue of competition between firms .
These acts curb the passion of capital for a limitless draining of labour power , by forcibly limiting the working day by state regulations , made by a state that is ruled by capitalist and landlord .
Apart from the working - class movement that daily grew more threatening , the limiting of factory labour was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano over the English fields .
81 Marx referred , later in the same chapter , to a group of 26 Staffordshire pottery firms , including Josiah Wedgwood , petitioning Parliament in 1863 for " some legislative enactment " ; the reason was that competition prevented individual capitalists from voluntarily limiting the work time of children , etc. , as beneficial as it would be to them collectively : " Much as we deplore the evils before mentioned , it would not be possible to prevent them by any scheme of agreement between the manufacturers ....
Taking all these points into consideration , we have come to the conviction that some legislative enactment is wanted . "
Attempts by employers to limit the workday voluntarily to nine or ten hours , in their collective interest , always came to nought because the individual employer found it in his interest to violate the agreement .
82
As for trade unions : even after the Combination Laws were repealed in 1825 , the position of workers was different from that of masters in regard to contract .
" The provisions of the labour statutes as to contracts between master and workman , as to giving notice and the like , which only allow of a civil action against the contract breaking master , but on the contrary permit a criminal action against the contract - breaking workman , are to this hour ( 1873 ) in full force .
" 83 In 1871 , trade unions were officially recognized by Act of Parliament .
But another act of the same date ( the Act to amend the Criminal Law relating to Violence , Threats , and Molestation ) , had the effect that " the means which the labourers could use in a strike or lockout were withdrawn from the laws common to all citizens , and placed under exceptional penal legislation , the interpretation of which fell to the masters themselves in their capacity as justices of the peace . "
84 Thus , the state at the same time permitted collective bargaining , and prohibited collective bargaining outside the avenues prescribed and regulated by the state .
In much the same way , the great " labor victory " of the Wagner Act was followed , in short order , by Taft - Hartley , which criminalized most of the tactics by which the CIO victories of the early Thirties had been won independently of the state .
And in the process , as Hilaire Belloc so brilliantly explained , for the laborer contract was replaced by status -- one step in the retrograde long march toward industrial enserfment of the wage - earning population .
85 A comment of Adam Smith a century earlier is worth quoting again : " Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen , its counselors are always the masters .
"
86 The working class lifestyle under the factory system , with its new forms of social control , was a radical break with the past .
It involved drastic loss of control over their own work .
The seventeenth century work calendar had still been heavily influenced by medieval custom .
Although there were spurts of hard labor between planting and harvest , intermittent periods of light work and the proliferation of saints days combined to reduce average work - time well below that of our own day .
And the pace of work was generally determined by the sun or the biological rhythms of the laborer , who got up after a decent night 's sleep , and sat down to rest when he felt like it .
The cottager who had access to common land , even when he wanted extra income from wage labor , could take work on a casual basis and then return to working for himself .
This was an unacceptable degree of independence from a capitalist standpoint .
In the modern world most people have to adapt themselves to some kind of discipline , and to observe other ' people 's timetables , ... or work under other people 's orders , but we have to remember that the population that was flung into the brutal rhythm of the factory had earned its living in relative freedom , and that the discipline of the early factory was particularly savage ....
No economist of the day , in estimating the gains or losses of factory employment , ever allowed for the strain and violence that a man suffered in his feelings when he passed from a life in which he could smoke or eat , or dig or sleep as he pleased , to one in which somebody turned the key on him , and for fourteen hours he had not even the right to whistle .
It was like entering the airless and laughterless life of a prison .
87 As Oppenheimer suggested in the quote earlier in this chapter , the factory system could not have been imposed on workers without first depriving them of alternatives , and forcibly denying access to any source of economic independence .
No unbroken human being , with a sense of freedom or dignity , would have submitted to factory discipline .
Steven Marglin compared the nineteenth century textile factory , staffed by pauper children bought at the workhouse slave market , to Roman brick and pottery factories which were manned by slaves .
In Rome , factory production was exceptional in manufactures dominated by freemen .
The factory system , throughout history , has been possible only with a work force deprived of any viable alternative .
The surviving facts ... strongly suggest that whether work was organized along factory lines was in Roman times determined , not by technological considerations , but by the relative power of the two producing classes .
Freedmen and citizens had sufficient power to maintain a guild organization .
Slaves had no power -- and ended up in factories .
88
The problem with the old " putting out " system , in which cottage workers produced textiles on a contractual basis , was that it only eliminated worker control of the product .
The factory system , by also eliminating worker control of the production process , introduced the added advantages of discipline and supervision , with workers organized under an overseer .
... the origin and success of the factory lay not in technological superiority , but in the substitution of the capitalist 's for the worker 's control of the work process and the quantity of output , in the change in the workman 's choice from one of how much to work and produce , based on his preferences for leisure and goods , to one of whether or not to work at all , which of course is hardly much of a choice .
89 Marglin took Adam Smith 's classic example of the division of labor in pin-making , and stood it on its head .
The increased efficiency resulted , not from the division of labor as such , but from dividing and sequencing the process into separate tasks in order to reduce set - up time .
This could have been accomplished by a single cottage workman separating the various tasks and then performing them sequentially ( i.e. , drawing out the wire for an entire run of production , then straightening it , then cutting it , etc. ) .
without specialization , the capitalist had no essential role to play in the production process .
If each producer could himself integrate the component tasks of pin manufacture into a marketable product , he would soon discover that he had no need to deal with the market for pins through the intermediation of the putter - outer .
He could sell directly and appropriate to himself the profit that the capitalist derived from mediating between the producer and the market .90
This principle is at the center of the history of industrial technology for the last two hundred years .
Even given the necessity of factories for some forms of large - scale , capital - intensive manufacturing , there is usually a choice between alternate productive technologies within the factory .
Industry has consistently chosen technologies which de-skill workers and shift decision - making upward into the managerial hierarchy .
As long ago as 1835 , Dr. Andrew Ure ( the ideological grandfather of Taylorism ) , argued that the more skilled the workman , " the more self - willed and ... the less fit a component of a mechanical system " he became .
The solution was to eliminate processes which required " peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand ... from the cunning workman " and replace them by a " mechanism , so self - regulating , that a child may superintend it .
" 91
And the principle has been followed throughout the twentieth century .
William Lazonick , David Montgomery , David Noble , and Katherine Stone have produced an excellent body of work on this theme .
Even though corporate experiments in worker self - management increase morale and productivity , and reduce injuries and absenteeism beyond the wildest hopes of management , they are usually abandoned out of fear of loss of control .
Christopher Lasch , in his foreword to Noble 's America by Design , characterized the process of de-skilling in this way :
The capitalist , having expropriated the worker 's property , gradually expropriated his technical knowledge as well , asserting his own mastery over production ....
The expropriation of the worker 's technical knowledge had as a logical consequence the growth of modern management , in which technical knowledge came to be concentrated .
As the scientific management movement split up production into its component procedures , reducing the worker to an appendage of the machine , a great expansion of technical and supervisory personnel took place in order to oversee the productive process as a whole .
92
The expropriation of the peasantry and imposition of the factory labor system was not accomplished without resistance ; the workers knew exactly what was being done to them and what they had lost .
During the 1790s , when rhetoric from the Jacobins and Tom Paine was widespread among the radicalized working class , the rulers of " the cradle of liberty " lived in terror that the country would be swept by revolution .
The system of police state controls over the population resembled an occupation regime .
The Hammonds referred to correspondence between north - country magistrates and the Home Office , in which the law was frankly treated " as an instrument not of justice but of repression , " and the working classes " appear[ed ] ... conspicuously as a helot population .
” 93 ... in the light of the Home Office papers , ... none of the personal rights attaching to Englishmen possessed any reality for the working classes .
The magistrates and their clerks recognized no limit to their powers over the freedom and the movements of working men .
The Vagrancy Laws seemed to supercede the entire charter of an Englishman 's liberties .
They were used to put into prison any man or woman of the working class who seemed to the magistrate an inconvenient or disturbing character .
They offered the easiest and most expeditious way of proceeding against any one who tried to collect money for the families of locked - out workmen , or to disseminate literature that the magistrates thought undesirable .
94 Peel 's " bobbies " -- professional law enforcement -- replaced the posse comitatus system because the latter was inadequate to control a population of increasingly disgruntled workmen .
In the time of the Luddite and other disturbances , crown officials warned that " to apply the Watch and Ward Act would be to put arms into the hands of the most powerfully disaffected . "
At the outset of the wars with France , Pitt ended the practice of quartering the army in alehouses , mixed with the general population .
Instead , the manufacturing districts were covered with barracks , as " purely a matter of police . "
The manufacturing areas " came to resemble a country under military occupation .
" 95
Pitt 's police state was supplemented by quasi- private vigilantism , in the time - honored tradition of blackshirts and death squads ever since .
For example the " Association for the Protection of Property against Republicans and Levellers " -- an anti-Jacobin association of gentry and mill - owners -- conducted house - to - house searches and organized Guy Fawkes - style effigy burnings against Paine ; " Church and King " mobs terrorised suspected radicals .96
Thompson characterized this system of control as " political and social apartheid , " and argued that " the revolution which did not happen in England was fully as devastating " as the one that did happen in France .

A German DJ broke the world record for the longest continuous radio show on Monday ( local time ) when he finished his " morning " program over a week after beginning it .
By presenting his show for a consecutive 169 hours , 26 - year - old Dominik Schollmayer from Hit Radio Antenne in Hanover , central Germany , beat the previous record - held by an Indian DJ - by one hour .
The rules stated he was allowed to play two consecutive records of up to six minutes but had to broadcast something after that .
He was allowed a five - minute break every hour , but saved these up to give himself a 15 - minute break every three hours .
Schollmayer was monitored by doctors around the clock throughout his record - breaking broadcast .
Sleep deprivation caused bizarre effects , according to a blog on the station 's website .
One entry entitled " Now he 's gone completely mad " reported that the DJ was dancing wildly around the studio as the final hours approached .

There 's an old phrase that an expectant mother is eating for two .
A new study indicates it 's more apt than was known .
A bad diet can actually alter a baby 's genes .
If a mother rat does not eat well , her offspring exhibit genetic changes that affect what they 'll become .
Because the genes and cellular mechanisms involved in the study are very similar to those in humans , researchers think the study is relevant to us .
Specifically , rat fetuses receiving poor nutrition in the womb become genetically primed to be born into an environment lacking proper nutrition , the researchers figure ; they were likely to grow to smaller sizes than their normal counterparts .
The poorly nourished rats were also at higher risk for a host of health problems throughout their lives , including diabetes , cardiovascular disease , obesity and neurodevelopmental delays .
" Our study emphasizes that maternal - fetal health influences multiple healthcare issues across generations , " said Robert Lane , professor of pediatric neonatology at the University of Utah .
" To reduce adult diseases such as diabetes , obesity , and cardiovascular disease , we need to understand how the maternal–fetal environment influences the health of offspring . "
The results , announced this week , are detailed online by the FASEB Journal .
The researchers split rat fetuses into two groups .
The first group was normal .
The second group had the delivery of nutrients from their mothers ' placentas restricted .
The rats were examined right after birth and again at 21 days , considered preadolescence .
The lack of nutrients in the second group caused a gene responsible for a protein that promotes normal development and growth in rats and humans to significantly reduce the amount of the protein produced before and after birth .
It 's an example of nurture affecting nature , the researchers say .
" The jury 's in and , yes , expectant moms really are eating for two , " said Dr. Gerald Weissmann , editor - in - chief of the journal .
" This study shows ... that prenatal care is far more important than anyone could have imagined a decade ago . "

Sentimentality amongst the visiting support was prevalent prior to kick - off as certain pockets of Arsenal fans sported their yellow jerseys in homage to the same fixture a score of years ago where the Gunners required a two goal victory in order to secure a league title , on the last day of the season , at Anfield .
Twenty - years on and there was not as much at stake for Arsenal , but Liverpool were still aiming to gun down Premier League leaders Manchester United , and could have temporarily gone top of the charts with a win this evening .
A feast of attacking football and a spectacular 90 minutes ensued that would have had neutrals everywhere salivating over countless twists , turns , and talking points .
Liverpool began the game with great intent and were clearly the side on a mission as early efforts from Fernando Torres , Albert Riera , and Yossi Benayoun inside the first ten minutes could have provided the home side with an early lead .
Lukasz Fabianski , though , who had such a howling day at the office deputising for Manuel Almunia in between the sticks at Wembley verus Chelsea , was hell - bent on proving his worth in front of Arsene Wenger and got hands to all three shots .
Despite the onslaught to Arsenal 's goal , it was Liverpool who ended up conceding first , as Andrey Arshavin found the net - with the aid of the bar - after some good link - up play between Samir Nasri and Francesc Fabregas inside the area .
The Spaniard squared the ball to the winter window Russian recruit and Arshavin made no mistake in beating a flapping Pepe Reina .
Rafael Benitez made a tactical re-shift after the break and asked hard - working Dirk Kuyt to move to more of a flanking area on the right hand side , and the switch bore instant results as Liverpool scored twice within ten minutes of the re-start .
Some poor defending by Bacary Sagna , who failed to clear the ball in a dangerous area , found it 's way to Kuyt on the right hand side and the Dutchman looped in a pinpoint cross that Torres finished off neatly - and strongly - into the corner of the net with his head .
Benayoun granted the Reds a temporary lead in the 55th minute with a scrappy goal after some poor defensive work again , this time from Fabianski .
Arshavin restored parity - against the run of play - eleven minutes later with a goal from nowhere , as he curled in a powerful effort from outside the box .
Three minutes later and the diminutive , finely - balanced Russian international slotted a neat shot under the reaches of Reina .
It took just two minutes for Liverpool to equalise again , when Spanish winger Riera found his fellow national Torres in the box and the silky striker 's footwork foiled Mikael Silvestre and , even though Fabianski got a hand to the ball , he could not stop it bulging into his net .
At three - a- piece the game was not over , and Arsenal thought they had the game won when Arshavin again , for the fourth time in the evening , popped up to score and sneak the Gunners in front when Theo Walcott found a break and both he and Arshavin stormed forward .
The former with a cross - field on - the - floor assist , and the latter with the goal that sent the away section into raptures .
Liverpool , though , in a finish befitting the spectacle of the evening , restored parity as Arsenal failed to again clear the ball sufficiently , and Benayoun ensured that the Reds - for the second time in the space of a week - battled out an epic 4 - 4 draw .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama called simulated drowning a form of torture on Wednesday , and defended his decision to end a practice used against terrorism suspects by the Bush administration .

Obama said the process , known as waterboarding , violated American ideals and was not appropriate even if it made getting information from suspected enemies easier .
“ Waterboarding violates our ideals and our values .
I do believe that it is torture , ” he told a news conference .
“ That ’s why I put an end to these practices . ”
Pressed on whether that meant former President George W. Bush ’s administration had sanctioned torture , Obama said : “ I believe that waterboarding was torture .
And I think that ... whatever legal rationales were used , it was a mistake . ”
Many experts say harsh interrogations lead to unreliable information because a person will say anything to stop them .
Obama said intelligence that may have resulted from the technique could have been elicited through other methods .
“ We could have gotten this information in other ways , in ways that were consistent with our values , in ways that were consistent with who we are , ” he said .
“ In some cases it may be harder , but part of what makes us , I think , still a beacon to the world is that we are willing to hold true to our ideals even when it ’s hard , not just when it ’s easy . ”
Obama said the policy shift had also deprived al Qaeda of a recruiting tool while strengthening relations with U.S. allies .
After Obama released four memos this month revealing the Bush administration ’s legal justification for methods such as waterboarding , former Vice President Dick Cheney called for declassifying any memos showing that the techniques succeeded in producing valuable information .
The New York Times has reported that Dennis Blair , Obama ’s national intelligence director , told colleagues in a private memo the harsh techniques yielded “ high value information . ”
Obama said the memos that had not been declassified failed to answer the core questions -- whether the information could have been elicited by other means and whether the country was safer as a result of the controversial methods being used .
“ Ultimately I will be judged as commander - in - chief on how safe I ’m keeping the American people , ” he said .
“ So I will do whatever is required to keep the American people safe .
But I am absolutely convinced that the best way I can do that is to make sure that we are not taking short cuts that undermine who we are . ”
Long after I had stopped dressing in saris and decorating my cubby with photos of Guru in nirvakalpi samadhi , an elevated state of consciousness , the kids at Silvermine Elementary School still remembered .
Tommy Frangelo , a boy who lived down the road from my house , told a legion of kids that he saw my family sacrificing a monkey and then drinking its blood .
Because one of the ancient Hindu sacred signs is a swastika , it became standard knowledge that on top of everything else , the Tamms were Nazis , too .
In school , on the rare occasions I had received an invitation to a big event like Susie Thompsons ’ birthday party at McDonald ’s , I was not allowed to attend .
Guru had clear rules that socializing with outsiders was forbidden .
Even when I begged my father to go , he seemed baffled as to why anyone would even want to go to a birthday party .
Social events , for my father , were worse than searching for files at the town clerk ’s office .
My request to attend the year - end roller skating party caused him to stare at me for a long time , as if unsure that this strange little person was somehow the special soul that Guru had selected .
Then he ’d ask if I had meditated that day .
Since every night and every weekend we were in Queens or somewhere else spreading Guru ’s message , instead of chatting about play dates and birthday parties , I ’d attempt to share news with my classmates about the many special events that occurred during our two sacred holidays : April , in honor of Guru ’s arrival in America , and August , in honor of Guru ’s birthday .
During those times , disciples from all over the world congregated in New York for nonstop festivities that included our own parades , Olympics , and circus .
But the girls at Silvermine School were n’t impressed .
Soon , even the rare birthday party invitation ceased .
Sitting in the cafeteria by myself , it dawned on my one day that I was labeled the weird kid not only by my classmates but by the teachers as well .
When I failed the poetry presentation in Mrs. Sanders ’ class , I stayed after school for clarification .
I had done the assignment , a rarity , having chosen a poet — Guru , of course — I memorized the poem , recited it before the class , and made a posterboard illustration to accompany it .
I did n’t know where I had gone wrong .
Granted , all the other students chose Robert Frost and Shel Silverstein , but it was unclear to me what the problem was , until Mrs. Sanders accused me of making up the poet .
Although at the time Guru had already written more than five hundred books and was cranking out a book or two a week of short spiritual aphorisms , I kept quiet .
More and more , defending Guru did n’t seem to be worth it .
Leaving Guru out of school altogether felt like a wiser choice .
I figured that it would n’t insult Guru .
My academic career was never something that he emphasized , or even mentioned .
When I did receive a surprisingly good grade , Guru was quiet .
Education was not what he wanted from me , and he made that clear .
What he wanted and expected was my unconditional obedience and undying love , and for that , I suppose , it did n’t matter if I ever returned to school .
I might as well just have sat on his tour bus forever .

Previously on C.S.I ... a man found an actual card skimmer in the wild , in the flesh .
Today , Gizmodo reader Sean became the card skimmer / PIN camera 's latest almost - victim .
Where ?
Chase Bank in Manhattan , East Village .

Sean Seibel was inside a local Chase bank where he inserted his ATM card into one of two side - by - side automatic teller machines .
When the machine told him it could not read his card , it took him a bit of jiggling to get his card back .
He tried it a couple more times and got the same results .
Before trying the other machine , he inspected the slot of the current ATM he was using and realized that it had a false plastic cover attached to the slot .
The amazing thing about the cover was that the translucent green plastic matched the card reader slot perfectly , meaning that it was made specifically for Chase ATMs .
After snapping a few photos with his iPhone , he alerted the branch manager and explained what happened .

As he was leaving , Seibel remembered reading about card skimmers having small cameras in the proximity in order to read PIN pad activity , so naturally , he went back to the ATM to inspect , which is where he found an extra mirror attached to the vandalized machine that the other ATMs did n't have .
Drilled into the mirror was a tiny pinhole with a camera inside , directed at the PIN pad .
Seibel alerted the branch manager again and asked Chase why they had n't inspected the ATM after he had warned them the first time .
Chase honestly replied that they had n't thought of it because they had never encountered that sort of thing before .
From the crazy amounts of feedback we received last night after we posted the first story , it seems that card skimmers are a common crime everywhere from Thailand to Mexico .
But actually hearing about it happening to our very own readers here in America makes us want to help get the word out .
Seibel says it best : " Take this as a warning and please inspect every ATM machine you use , no matter how secure you think the environment is . "
[ Thanks Sean ! ]

At work I ’ve had the pleasure of programming a preprocessor for our code base .
It just takes an XML specification of structures and generates Lua accessors , serializers , etc .
I did it in Python , mostly because our developers already have to have Python installed to use the test suite .
This has given me a chance to get more familiar with Python as a programming language for doing real things ( previously I knew enough to make minor modifications to code ; basic block syntax , variable model ) .
First , I love the “ usual ” syntax .
That is , as long as you ’re doing fairly straightforward things , the syntax is beautiful , readable , and clean .
I do n’t mind the common complaint that variable declaration is implicit with assignment ( I also do n’t mind having a short declarator , either ; as long as it catches name typos , I ’m happy ) .
I was happy to learn that Python had real closures via nested function definitions .
Previously I believed that it did not support closures , which is why I did not port Glop to Python .
I think Python excels where other languages are mediocre is in communicating to the compiler and the user simultaneously , clearly , what is going on .
The language layout essentially enforces that with statement - only assignment , indentation interpretation , and an overall choice of function names over syntactic constructs ; it ’s difficult to write code that looks like it ’s doing something different than it is .
However , that strength of Python is also a weakness .
After enough abstraction and indirection , you want to be communicating different things to the computer and to the user .
If you communicated to the user what you communicate to the computer , you will just confuse the heck out of the user .
At this level , I want a language which allows me to communicate precisely to the compiler , while communicating a good way to think about the code to the user .
I would never be able to write a Language : : AttributeGrammar for Python , simply because the level of abstraction in that module is too high .
It takes a lot of my brainpower to think about its control flow path ( driven by thunk evaluation ) , and if I were forced to communicate that path to the user , my module would be useless .
I think one of the biggest reasons why it is not possible to express code at this level is the lack of a multi-statement lambda .
It seems like whether lambda is single - statement or multi-statement is irrelevant , since you can do the equivalent of a multi-statement lambda by using a nested function and naming the codeblock .
However , it scatters around the control flow when it should be linear ( or when it should look like it ’s linear when it ’s actually not ) .
It also forces the user to think about functions and the concept of passing functions ( which many programmers are not comfortable with ) , when it could just look like another block construct .
For example , I wrote a function which atomizes output ; i.e. do a whole bunch of output operations in sequence , and if an exception is thrown at any time during the process , then nothing is output .
This was important because I was using exceptions to communicate when an accessor could n’t be generated , and I did n’t want my program to write the accessor declaration and opening brace if I could n’t put something inside .
My use case code could look like this ( using Ruby - style parenless block passing ) :
atomicio( handle ) lambda handle : handle .write ( " foo " ) if blah : raise Exception , " baz " handle .write ( " bar " )
The idea is that if blah ended up being true , then neither “ foo ” nor “ bar ” would be written .
This abstraction has been important for the clarity of my script .
Instead , it looks like this :
def writeFooBar ( handle ) : handle .write ( " foo " ) if blah : raise Exception , " baz " handle .write ( " bar " ) atomicio( handle , writeFooBar )
Okay , that ’s not that bad , but your eyes jump around a bit more as you ’re reading this .
First you skip past the def because it ’s a def , then you read the atomicio line and notice that it ’s passing the writeFooBar function , so you scan for the function and find it above you .
It does n’t read like a book , it reads like an academic paper :-) .
It gets worse when you want composability , though .
Say I wanted to do atomic I/O on two handles at once :
atomicio( fh1 ) lambda fh1 : atomicio( fh2 ) lambda fh2 : ...
As opposed to :
def writeFooBar ( fh1 ) : def writeFooBarHelper( fh2 ) : ... atomicio( fh2 , writeFooBarHelper ) atomicio( fh1 , writeFooBar )
Now do you see the difference ?
The structure of the first example is pretty obvious , but the second example is significantly more awkward .
writeFooBar logically takes two arguments , but that clarity has been lost by the explicit currying .
Additionally , the order ends up appearing backwards in the source file ( fh2 before fh1 ) .
Of course , I do n’t think this is something that should be fixed in Python .
If Python decided to abandon its very explicit vision of being clear about what you ’re telling the compiler , it would fail at being a more expressive language .
The languages that really excel at this kind of thing are Perl , because you can play syntactic tricks on the Programmer ’s eyes , and Haskell , because the entire language is designed around functional abstraction ( a Monad , for example , is just an extension of the idea I presented here ) .
Python would have to change too much to compete with them , and it would almost certainly lose every value it has that puts it in front of other languages .
Sure , concept art is nice and all , but for all we know the previously - mentioned and untitled game never even saw any of its assets converted into in - game objects .
Screenshots , on the other hand , indicate that a game was at least developed enough to be running on a game engine of some sort .
Some Factor 5 - developed screens leaked alongside the concept art , this time for a game called “ Virus . ”
What do you make of it from the screenshots below ?
Or do you think these could be mockups as well , and not actually taken from a game engine at all ?

Idaho Racist recruiting effort disgusts CdA neighborhood Fri. , April 17 , 2009
Many residents of a north Coeur d’Alene subdivision awoke Friday to find racist fliers on their lawns , distributed as recruitment letters by the white supremacist group , the Aryan Nations .
“ I saw Aryan Nations and put it in the trash , ” said Garvin Jones , who lives in the neighborhood southwest of Atlas Road and Prairie Avenue .
“ What ’s wrong with these people ?
Give me a break .
I bet if you went back in their family history , not one is 100 percent white . ”
Jones and dozens of his neighbors found the Xeroxed fliers on their lawns , encased in baggies that also held small rocks .
They depict a young girl asking her father what he did during the “ revolution ” and asking “ Where have all the White ( sic ) people gone daddy ? ” and “ Why did those dark men take mommy away ? ”
The flier is signed “ Aryan Nations , Church of Jesus Christ Christian , ” along with a post office box and a Web site .
The city address is listed as “ Couer ( sic ) d’Alene , Idaho . ”
The Aryan Nations Web site lists Jerald O’Brien and Michael Lombard as the “ pastors ” who have taken over following longtime leader Richard Butler ’s death in September 2004 .
O’Brien said people in this area can expect the dissemination of “ a lot more ” fliers and said “ likeminded individuals will respond and seek membership . ”
He said the election of President Barack Obama has served as the “ greatest recruiting tool ever . ”
He said he had “ several handfuls ” of members in Coeur d’Alene .
The Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations — which has fought the Aryan Nations for decades — quickly condemned the flier distribution and offered its services to anyone threatened or harassed .
“ It ’s bound to be a small group of people trying once again to bring hate into the community .
They do n’t have anywhere to operate from except a post office box , ” said Tony Stewart , a spokesman for the task force .
The people of this community , he added , “ will reject it as they have in the past .
Anyone who feels intimidated should take comfort in the fact that the people are here for them , and we are here for them . ”
Several residents of the neighborhood that received the fliers were interviewed for this story .
However , most of them asked not to be named out of fear of retribution .
All of those interviewed expressed shock , disgust or anger at the fliers and at least two called the police .
One caller was a 22 - year - old white woman who has a 4 - year - old African - American son .
“ My son ’s black , so it ’s not okay , ” said the woman who asked only to be identified as Chelsee B .
She added that she was fearful of her son playing outside .
Coeur d’Alene Police Department Sgt. Christie
Wood said no investigation would be conducted because distribution of fliers is public speech , protected under the First Amendment .
She said , however , that targeting people for harassment based on race is a crime and should be reported .
Stewart said hate speech is protected , but hate crimes are not .
He encouraged any member of the public with concerns about racial harassment to contact the task force at ( 208 ) 765-3932 .
The Aryan Nations was effectively bankrupted on Sept. 7 , 2000 , when a Kootenai County jury returned a $ 6.3 million verdict against the organization , its founder , Richard Butler , and three former members .
The verdict in the civil trial found that Butler and his organization were guilty of gross negligence in appointing security guards who carried out an assault against two people driving by their property .
O’Brien , however , said the “ world headquarters ” of the organization is now in Coeur d’Alene in a location that is “ membership privileged information only . ”
He did admit that he lives in a home on the east side of downtown Coeur d’Alene that regularly flies two white supremacist flags .
Newspaper files show O’Brien marching in a neo -Nazi parade in Coeur d’Alene in July 2004 and joining in a skinhead rally that drew eight people outside the Spokane County courthouse in June 2007 .
O’Brien has a large swastika tattoo on his scalp .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will push hard for Palestinian statehood despite a new rightist government in Israel but anticipates a rough road ahead , a U.S. official said on Thursday .
“ We ’re going to be working hard to see what we can do to move the process forward .
But we ’re under no illusions .
It ’s not going to be easy , ” said State Department spokesman Robert Wood .
“ We have to engage constantly and remind the parties of their obligations and to try to set up a framework , a process for getting us toward that goal of a two - state solution , ” Wood added , referring to the goal of separate Israeli and Palestinian states , living side by side in peace .
Israel ’s new foreign minister angered Palestinians and raised the prospect of tension with Washington on Wednesday by saying Israel was not bound by a deal to start negotiations on establishing a Palestinian state .
On his first day at the Foreign Ministry , ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman said the U.S. - backed Annapolis declaration of 2007 “ has no validity , ” confirming a shift in stance under new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made her first contact with Lieberman on Wednesday , telephoning him from London where she is with President Barack Obama .
“ It was primarily to congratulate him on coming into his new position , but no dates have been set for any type of meeting , ” said Wood .
Wood said U.S. special envoy to the Middle East , former Sen. George Mitchell , is set go to the region soon .
He did not comment on whether Clinton had raised U.S. concerns over Lieberman ’s comments , but said the new Israeli foreign minister was “ well aware ” of the U.S. position .
“ We ’re going to pursue that two - state solution , because we believe it ’s in the best interests of all the parties in the region , ” said Wood .
Lieberman ’s anti-Arab rhetoric has particularly alarmed Palestinians as well as Arab leaders in the region .
Lieberman says land where many of Israel ’s 1.5 million Arabs live should be “ swapped ” for West Bank Jewish settlements in a peace deal with the Palestinians .
Netanyahu was prime minister from 1997 to 1999 and clashed constantly with the administration of Clinton ’s husband , former President Bill Clinton .
Netanyahu is expected to visit Washington soon , possibly as early as next month , an Israeli official told Reuters .
However , he said no date had been set yet for that visit .
A CanJet aircraft is on its way to Jamaica to pick up stranded passengers and fly them to Cuba after a gunman hijacked the jet , holding six crew members hostage for eight hours before police and soldiers stormed the aircraft earlier today and captured the man .
" It ( the jet ) has not arrived in Montego Bay yet but is expected soon , " said Sean Lewis , a media relations officer for CanJet in Halifax , N.S.
The jet will fly to Santa Clara , Cuba , and then to Halifax .
Lewis said the jet might return to Halifax late tonight or early tomorrow morning .
Nobody was killed or injured in the ordeal , which ended with a raid near daylight after talks broke down with a 20 - year - old Jamaican hijacker described as " mentally challenged . "
" We were getting nowhere with the negotiations , " Jamaican Information Minister Daryl Vaz told the Associated Press .
" Police and military went on the plane and captured him . "
The suspect , identified as Stephen Fray , was in custody .
Vaz said he is a " mentally challenged " 20 - year - old man from the northwestern resort city of Montego Bay .
He did not detail the man 's mental condition but said he was apparently upset over a failed relationship .
The hostage crisis began around 10:20 p.m. last night and ended near 6:40 a.m. today , when members of the Jamaica Defence Force Counter Terrorism Operations Group stormed the aircraft 's cabin .
The young man boarded CanJet Airlines Flight 918 in Montego Bay and demanded to be flown to Cuba , Vaz told the Associated Press .
A total of 159 passengers and eight crewmembers were aboard the Boeing 737 at the time , according to Jamaican police .
All the passengers and two crewmembers were released in about half - hour ; others were held captive for eight hours .
All the passengers were Canadian .
The plane had arrived from Halifax , Nova Scotia , and was scheduled to stop in Santa Clara , Cuba , before returning to Canada .
Jacques Poulin , a passenger on the plane , said he can't wait to get home to Glace Bay , N.S. " It was a great vacation with such a dramatic end , " said the 17 - year - old high school student .
He spent a week in Lucea , Jamaica , with his parents Karen and Jay .
The three were at the Sangster International Airport getting ready to board the aircraft when a man , who Poulin described as " raggedy and brandishing a gun " forced his way through security .
" There were two people chasing him but he managed to get into the plane , " said Poulin from his hotel in Montego Bay .
" He said ` You are not going to stop me .
I 'm going to the U.S. "
It was about 10:15 p.m. , he said , and only seven passengers had not boarded the aircraft .
Poulin and his shocked parents watched in horror as the man started arguing with the co-pilot who tried to talk him out of it .
" I do n't know what he said but the man shot into the loading ramp and the bullet grazed the co-pilot 's face , " said Poulin .
About half - hour later , all the passengers and two crewmembers were released .
Passengers told Poulin that the hijacker had taken all their cash .
" But they were all fine - they were shaking but were okay . "
The passengers gave their statements to the police at the airport and were then taken to a hotel for the night .
" I was talking to other passengers last night and we were all just in a shock .
We could n't believe it had happened , " said Poulin , whose girlfriend , Jena Leigh , was frantically trying to reach him .
" I do n't think anyone wants to go to Cuba now .
Everyone wants to go home . "
Alphonse Gossellin's phone has n't stopped ringing all morning since family and friends found his son , Christian , was on the flight to Santa Clara , Cuba .
Christian called up his father in the small New Brunswick town of Tracadie - Sheila early Monday morning .
" He was very shaken up and calm at the same time , " his father , Alphonse Gosselin , told CBC Newsworld .
" He told us not to worry ; everyone was OK . "
Alphonse Gosselin , whose 30 - year - old son Christian was on the plane , said his son told him that the hijacker pointed a gun at him and other passengers .
Christian and his girlfriend were among a group of 22 family members travelling to Cuba for a wedding .
Passengers were asked to give out all their money , Gosselin said .
" [ Christian ] told his girlfriend to hide their passports in her back pocket , and also their credit cards . "
" My son called and he was kind of shaken up , but he said everyone in the crew , in the gang , is safe , " said Alphonse Gosselin .

One of the trucks in the July 19 , 2008 comment was a really heavy duty electric truck in use at the port of Los Angeles .
Back in July 2008 , someone challenged me in Drumbeat to point out some really heavy duty electric vehicles that can move say , a fully loaded 40 foot container .
I fired off a reply featuring lots of links to electric or hybrid trucks and delivery vans .
Both in that comment and in this post , I rely heavily on autobloggreen.com for the research , since it is a blog almost exlusively dedicated to " green " transportation issues .
Electric trucks do more than what most people think they are capable of doing .
In this post , I will talk about both electric trucks and other commercial electric vehicles .
Battery Operated Trucks
The port of Los Angeles is an interesting case .
It seems to me that the electric truck and the port are a match made in heaven .
The trucks used by the port basically shuttle containers around the port and to warehouses and rail yards nearby .
This means that there is very little risk of a truck with a sixty mile range being unable to make the trip out of the port and back .
In addition , with the port being the base of operations , charging and / or battery exchange stations can be set up right where the trucks work .
When my original Drumbeat comment was written , the port of Los Angeles electric truck were still in a trial stage .
Recent news suggests that the trial referred to in my original post was a success , so much so that the port has placed an order and started taking delivery of 20 - 25 more units being produced at the manufacturers new production facility located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area .
The manufacturer also hopes to sell additional units to other customers .
Smith Electric Truck
In the UK , Smith Electric Vehicles and Modec have been in manufacturing and selling plug in , battery electric vehicles for at least two years .
Modec has a list of customers using their trucks at their web site with pictures of the trucks in company livery , as does Smith Electric Vehickes .
Fed Ex Electric Truck
Small North American manufacturers like Canadian Electric Vehicle ( CEV ) have also produced viable battery electric vehicles for use in and around airports .
Fifty of CEV 's electric trucks are on duty at airports from New York 's JFK and Chicago 's Dulles to Los Angeles 's LAX airports .
Other clients include Southwest Airlines , Shell Oil , and British Petroleum , which buys CEV vehicles for its Australian division .

Series Hybrids
Series Hybrids are similar in concept to the Chevy Volt in that the internal combustion engine ( ICE ) is never connected to the wheels by a transmission of any kind but instead drives an electric generator providing power for the electric motors .
Coupled with batteries , this allows the ICE to be run at close to its maximum efficiency at all times .
Significant cost savings can be achieved by this approach .
This has been the experience of London Transport , New York MTA and public transportation systems of other North American cities .
Heavy duty series hybrids are not new .
They were one solution to transferring the massive amounts of power needed to move the giant earth movers used in mining operations .
The technology has also been used widely in railway locomotives .
There are significant numbers of series hybrids in operation in the New York City area bus fleet .
This photo is from the bus manufacturers news page
• MTA New York City Transit and the MTA Bus Company will take delivery of 850 Orion VII Next Generation diesel - electric hybrid transit buses by early 2010 .
This order will bring the MTA 's diesel - electric hybrid bus fleet to almost 1,700 units , making it the largest diesel - electric hybrid fleet in the world .
With this order , Orion brand transit buses will account for almost 50 - percent of MTA New York City Transit 's entire fleet .
• OC Transpo has ordered up to 202 Orion VII Next Generation hybrid diesel - electric hybrid transit buses to be delivered by 2010 .
This delivery will make OC Transpo the third largest hybrid bus fleet in Canada .
Similar technology exists in London where the fleet is being expanded to include double decker series hybrid buses .
Another series hybrid that has been evaluated by the New York MTA is an intresting unit manufactured by DesignLine .
This unit uses electricity generated by an onboard micro turbine manufactured by Capstone Turbine Corporation , a supplier of micro turbines for use in Combtned Heat and Power applications .
This turbine boasts one moving part with air bearings .
It will be interesting to see how these fare in the long term .
What makes this vehicle unique is that its traction motor and auxilary power unit ( turbine - generator ) contain a total of three moving parts !
Parallel Hybrids
Parallel hybrids are vehicles that can have the wheels be driven by the ICE or the electric motor or both .
They are easily the most mechanically complex hybrids and fall into two main camps .
The two mode hybrid being implemented by GM / Allison , Daimler , BMW and Chrysler ( ? ) typically consist of a motor / transmission unit containing :
• two AC motors ;
• three planetary gear sets ;
• four multiplate clutches ;
• two hydraulic oil pumps .
Toyota uses a slightly less complex but similar system in their Hybrid Synergy Drive .
The other main parallel hybrid type uses an electric motor sandwhiched between the ICE and the transmission with a clutch to disengage the ICE when not required leaving the electric motor to move the vehicle .
Otherwise these systems are very similar to traditional ICE driven drive trains .
These systems usually dispense with a starter motor and the alternator with the traction motor filling all three roles , as is the case with Volvo 's ISAM amd Mitsubihi - Fuso 's system .
Misubishi Fuso has been selling a parallel hybrid light truck in Japan for a couple of years now and has ten evaluation units in London .
GM - Allison has sold a significant number of their two mode hybrid buses in North America and Eaton Corporation has supplied Coca - Cola Enterprises with the largest single order to date for trucks using the company 's hybrid system , over 100 .
Electric Advantages
Electric drive systems should be able to gain some serious traction in the commercial vehicle market since electric drive in commercial vehicles is a more viable option NOW .
One reason is that a large percentage of delivery vehicles operate on fixed routes and schedules so their use and charging cycles can be planned with more certainty than an individual 's personal transportation .
Smaller delivery vehicles also tend to do shorter range trips , so electric drive systems are a particularly good fit .
Routes can be planned so that vehicles return to base long before they run out of juice .
In addition , fleet operation bases can be equiped with high power fast charging stations or battery swap stations , if fast turnaround times are more important than the cost of spare battery packs .
School buses , airport shuttles and other pasenger moving operations that frequently move people on routes that are less than 50 miles round trip also present opportunities .
For example , during a recent trip to the US , I spent some time at a car rental location and observed that there were a couple of shuttles making trips to Miami International Airport and back , a trip that I estimate takes less than half an hour to complete .
Also at the location were several shuttles sitting idle .
If these shuttles were electric , the idle ones could be plugged in while the shuttles were working .
When the working ones need charging , they could be plugged in and one of the idle ones used to replace them .
Electric drive vehicles also tend to have lower maintenance costs .
The only parts that can really wear out in an electric moter are the two motor shaft bearings .
One only need look at electic motors used in industry and commerce for an indication of how much maintenace will be required .
The only oil changes that are required relate to transmissions and final drives .
These oil changes are less frequent than the oil changes required by an ICE .
If regenerative braking is used , the vehicles are able to go more than twice as far between brake lining replacements .
In series hybrids , clutches and complex tranmissions are not required so drive train maintenance can be greatly reduced while the ICE used to generate power can be set up to operate under optimum condions extending service intervals and the useful life of the engine .
What 's on the horizon ?
In late 2007 , Daimler introduced 16 new buses and trucks with different driving systems and " greener " fuels .
These have formed the basis for many of the hybrid vehicles in use today .
Research continues as they are currently testing a lithium iron powered series hybrid articulated bus .
British bus builder Optare recently held a demonstration drive of its new Solo EV electric bus at the Millbrook proving ground in central England .
Volvo is supposed to be introducing a parallel hybrid to the European market this year that operates in electric mode at low speed and has regenerative braking .
An article with a video of the truck in operation is here .
Smith Electric Vehicles , after many false starts , finaly appears poised to begin production at a Kansas City production facility in the third quarter of 2009 .
They have an arrangement with Ford to electrify the Ford Transit Connect as a BEV ( battery electric vehicle ) light - duty van scheduled for production in 2010 .
Azure Dynamics , one the suppliers for the US based tests of light to medium duty delivery vans for companies like FedEx and UPS , continues to develop it 's offerings and has signed new Sales & Service agreements with some Ford dealerships to work on the company 's Balance Hybrid Electric commercial trucks .
Electric Vehicles International and aspiring electric truck manufacturer Electrorides both offer medium duty battery electric trucks that appear to be based on the ubiquitous Isuzu NPR cab and chassis .
The main drive systems suppliers that I could identify are BAE Systems , Eaton , Enova and Azure Dynamics .
The companies all appear to be in reasonable financial health and look to have sufficient orders going forward .
One supplier , Odyne , was apparently insolvent and was acquired by DUECO .
If the stimulus package provides an opportunity to this nascent industry , it might survive and provide a basis for a new generation of trucks and buses that will provide both a reliable and cost effective option for the transportation needs of industry and commerce as we enter a post peak world .
According to Zerotruck 's math , it would appear that electric commercial vehicles are not hard to justify in terms of the savings compared to the additional cost of going electric .
Edit
I did n't realize that this post was n't quite finished when I posted it .
( This was the second draft , not final . )
These are some important paragraphs that were added to the final .
Electric Pros and Cons
Battery powered electric vehicles have restricted range .
Overcoming the range restriction carries significant penalties in terms of battery pack size weight and / or cost .
For commercial vehicles , the range limits are not an insurmountable problem as a large percentage of delivery vehicles operate on fixed routes and schedules so their use and charging cycles can be planned with more certainty than an individual 's personal transportation .
In addition , larger commercial vehicles tend to have more space that can accommodate larger battery packs without impacting the cargo or passenger areas .
Smaller delivery vehicles tend to do shorter range trips so smaller battery pack sizes offering limited range are not a big issue .
In any case , routes can be planned so that vehicles return to base long before they run out of juice and the fleet operation bases can be equipped with high power , fast charging stations or battery swap stations if fast turnaround times are more important than the cost of spare battery packs .
In some cases the loading bays at destinations could be equipped with fast charging stations so that batteries could be topped up for the onward or return trip while the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded .
School buses , airport shuttles and other passenger moving operations that frequently move people on routes that are less than 50 miles round trip also present opportunities .
Although Electric drive systems attract a higher initial capital cost of at least 30 % more than a similar conventional vehicle , they should be able to gain some serious traction in the commercial vehicle market since electric drive in commercial vehicles results in significantly lower operating costs in the form of reduced fueling costs and lower maintenance costs .
The only parts that can really wear out in an electric motor are the two motor shaft bearings and one only need look at electric motors used in industry and commerce for an indication of how much maintenance will be required there .
For battery electric vehicles , the only oil changes required , are for transmissions and final drives which are less frequent than the oil changes required by an ICE .
If regenerative braking is used , the vehicles are able to go more than twice as far between brake lining replacements .
In series hybrids , clutches and complex transmissions are not required so drive train maintenance can be greatly reduced while the ICE used to generate power is usually set up to operate under optimum conditions , extending service intervals and the useful life of the engine .
What Should We Be Doing Next ?
The fact is that while electric drive systems are being produced by the hundreds , internal combustion engines and their related transmissions are being produced by the hundreds of thousands .
Component costs will not come down as long as these relatively minuscule number of electrically driven vehicles are being manufactured and sold .
It is the classic cache 22 , for prices to come down volumes must go up but , for volumes to go up , prices must come down .
In this situation , something must happen tip the scales and make the new technology irresistible , like the fuel price shocks of 2008 .
However in this post shock recessionary climate , fuel prices have plummeted and the new , more efficient but , initially more expensive technology has lost it 's luster resulting in buyers returning to the safe haven of buying what they 've always bought .
It is still quite remarkable that many of the electrically driven commercial vehicles have sold in the numbers that they have and it lends credence to the thinking that the long term savings from their use are quite significant .
According to Electrorides ' numbers , it would appear that electric commercial vehicles are not hard to justify in terms of the savings compared to the additional cost of going electric .
If we wait for the next fuel price spike to stimulate demand for electric vehicles , several of the key players may fail and disappear in the meantime .
Tax incentives , purchase rebates , increased fuel taxes are all tools governments can use to stimulate demand during hard times .
If , as many readers of theoildrum believe we are perilously close to if not past the peak of world oil production , we are going to need alternatives to the almost exclusively fossil fuel powered transportation infrastructure that exists today .
Hopefully the stimulus packages being devised around the world will help to provide an opportunity to this nascent industry , so that it will survive and provide a basis for a new generation of trucks and buses that will provide both a reliable and cost effective option for the transportation needs of industry and commerce as we enter a post peak world .
DFLer Al Franken , leading Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes in the still - unresolved U.S. Senate race , was also nearly a million dollars in hock to his main recount lawyers at the end of March , according to federal election reports released Friday .
Federal Election Commission reports show that Franken and Coleman have spent roughly $ 6 million each on the recount and the election trial that followed , though Coleman lists no debts or obligations .
Of the $ 1.3 million in debt listed by the Franken campaign , $ 926,839 is owed to Perkins Coie , the law firm of recount attorneys Marc Elias and Kevin Hamilton .
Perkins Coie clients have included many Democrats in Congress , as well as the Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and John Kerry .
The Seattle - based firm also represented Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire in her protracted 2004 recount battle with Republican Dino Rossi , a legal smackdown that many political analysts compare to the Minnesota Senate race .
The firm is also noted for its representation of Salim Hamdan , whose case as the alleged driver and bodyguard of Osama bin Laden led the U.S. Supreme Court to declare the Bush administration 's military commissions unconstitutional .
The rest of Franken 's current legal debt is owed to two Minneapolis firms .
His campaign owes $ 320,466 to Fredrickson & Byron , which includes recount attorney David Lillehaug , and $ 72,233 to the political fund of Lockridge Grindal Nauen , whose lobbying clients include many Minnesota cities and counties .
Heading into Coleman 's appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court , Franken listed $ 483,731 in cash on hand , compared with $ 469,563 for Coleman .
KEVIN DIAZ
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Any hope that General Motors can survive without massive aid from the federal government was dashed last week when the automaker reported a huge fourth - quarter loss .
Now the Obama administration 's auto panel is determining whether the viability plan that GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) submitted has any merit .
But one of the main justifications GM offers for its long - term survival , " leadership in advanced propulsion technology , " has been shaken by a report from Carnegie Mellon University .
The study concludes that plug - in hybrids like the Chevy Volt - GM 's most publicized technology project - " are not cost effective in any scenario . "
GM says the Volt can go 40 miles on a single charge .
But a better choice , according to the report , is a car that goes less than 20 miles on a charge .
GM wound up 2008 on life support .
After losing $ 43.3 billion in 2007 , it reported another $ 16.8 billion in losses for 2008 .
That left cash on hand at the end of the year at just $ 14 billion .
Since the automaker is burning cash at a rate of greater than $ 1 billion a month , it needs quick help from the government to stay in business until springtime .
But to get that money , GM has to convince Uncle Sam that it has a reasonable shot at survival .
And that 's where the Volt comes in .
It has been the subject of relentless promotion long before its scheduled debut at the end of 2010 , and it gets prominent display in GM 's viability plan .
The Volt has been referred to in the media as " the car that could save GM . "
But GM made some unusual decisions in designing the Volt .
It decided that it wanted the car to go 40 miles on a single electrical charge because that was the maximum distance that it said most Americans travel on their daily commutes .
Trouble is , configuring the car for all that electric driving means installing lots of big , heavy batteries .
The Carnegie Mellon study , conducted by engineers from three different departments , constructed computer simulation models to determine the impact of additional batteries on fuel consumption and cost and greenhouse gas emissions over a range of charging frequencies .
It found that small - capacity plug-ins that get less than 20 miles per charge are more efficient than conventional hybrids .
And it said that large capacity hybrids like the Volt that go 40 miles or further on a charge are never cost - effective , because the batteries cost and weigh too much .
A car with the Volt 's range , according to the study , would also be extremely uneconomical traveling fewer miles as it hauls around battery capacity it does n't need .
The Carnegie Mellon study says small - capacity plug-ins " would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption , cost , and greenhouse gas emissions , " and it said plug -ins perform best when they 're sized according to the charging patterns of the buyer .
Nearly 50 % of U.S. vehicle miles are traveled by automobiles covering less than 20 miles per day , according to the report , and it concludes that 20 miles is a more sensible range .
It also notes that as the charging infrastructure in public places becomes widespread , cars will be able to travel shorter distances between charges .
With a likely price of $ 40,000 , the Volt has always been a dicey economic proposition for GM .
At that cost , the car would be limited to buyers with a high income who can afford a car - most likely a second or third one - with limited functionality .
Nobody will want to take a Volt on a trip much beyond its 40 - mile range because it is too inefficient .
Since Volt was never going to be a big seller , it was never going to make money for GM , but it at least it had the potential to create a technology halo .
Now , even that possibility seems to be eroding .
The president 's auto panel will have lots to consider as it evaluates GM 's plan to get back to profitability .
If the Carnegie Mellon study has real merit , the automaker should consider whether it should continue developing the Volt in its current form - or scale it back so that its technology is less sensational , but more affordable .
Nirvana , ‘ In Utero ’ ( 1993 ) America ’s biggest retailers K - Mart and Wal - Mart threatened not to stock the record unless the back of this sleeve was altered and the song ‘ Rape Me ’ changed to ‘ Waif Me ’ .
Go figure .
The Five Keys , ‘ On Stage ! ’ ( 1957 ) The Five Keys were big in the 50’s , which just so happens to be a time when over - prudence was the norm .
Rudy
West ( far left ) had his right thumb just barely visible on the record jacket for this release .
Of course everyone got really excited about it , because what if someone mistook it for some ahem , other body part ?
As a result , on later pressings the offensive digit was covered up .
The Black Crowes , ‘ Amorica ’ ( 1994 ) Amorica depicted a closeup of a bathing suit with pubic hair showing .
The picture was from a 1976 United States Bicentennial issue of ‘ Hustler ’ magazine and caused quite a controversy .
The record company ended up putting out an alternative cover that blacked out the offending image .
They loved it in Brazil though .
Bow Wow Wow , ‘ See Jungle !
See Jungle !
Go Join Your Gang Yeah !
City All Over , Go Ape Crazy !’ ( 1981 ) The singer for Bow Wow Wow was only 15 years old when this album was released .
Lwin ’s covered - but - naked body on the album cover , prompted her mother to accuse band manager Malcolm Mclaren of exploiting a minor .
Scotland Yard even investigated the case .
Cannibal Corpse , ‘ Butchered At Birth ’ ( 1991 ) This was the death metal band ’s second album , and was quickly banned in Germany until June 2006 .
The very grotesque cover art featured a slaughtered mother - to - be being cut up by a zombie , with her baby apparently about to be slaughtered by another zombie
4. Chumbawamba , ‘ Anarchy ’ ( 1994 )
This one does n’t need any explanation as to why it caused problems .
The anti-establishment rockers , whose guitarist Danbert Nobacon very famously drenched Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the 1998 Brit Awards , actually intended to cause outrage with this sleeve .
Many stores refused to stock it and others covered it with a plain wrapper .
David Bowie , ‘ Diamond Dogs ’ ( 1974 ) On Diamond Dogs , Bowie was pictures as a man-dog , whose genitals were clearly visible on the reverse sleeve .
When record executives realized that this would cause a major stir , they had the offending area airbrushed out .
The original albums now command thousands of dollars from collectors .
6. Guns N’ Roses , ‘ Appetite for Destruction ’ ( 1987 )
This very disturbing picture of an alien and robot rape scene was the original graphics for the for the cover of Guns N’ Roses ’ debut album .
In the end they decided to use a completely different image , although this picture did still appear on the inside sleeve of the album .
Roger Waters , ‘ The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking ’ ( 1984 ) When this album ( a really under - appreciated album , by the way ) was released , complaints that it could be seen as encouraging rape meant that subsequent pressings were changed to have a black bar across the hitch - hikers ’ bum .
Jimi Hendrix , ‘ Electric Ladyland ’ ( 1968 ) Obviously this much nudity would n’t do in 1968 – the sleeve as it appears here was banned .
Even now , the version you ’ll see in the shops features Hendrix ’s face covering the album .
I guess they ran out of black bars to cover up the bad bits .
If you like this album , you should definitely check out the “ making of ” DVD .
Lynyrd Skynyrd , ‘ Street Survivors ’ ( 1977 )
In a fairly ironic twist of fate , only three days after this album came out several members of the band , including lead vocalist and primary songwriter Ronnie Van Zant , died in a plane crash .
Suddenly the flames on the sleeve seemed insensitive to everyone , so for many years the flames were airbrushed out .
The Mamas and the Papas , ‘ If You Can Believe Your Eyes And Ears ’ ( 1966 )
The original album cover showed a dirty toilet in the bottom right hand corner .
The one that was released ( shown ) was ‘ sanitized ’ .
A dirty toilet was obviously way too unsavoury for the general public in the 60’s .
Poison , ‘ Open Up and Say… Ahh !’ ( 1988 ) Somehow some retailers objected to this sleeve on the grounds that it was too “ raunchy ” .
The Residents , ‘ The Third Reich N’ Roll ’ ( 1976 ) The swastika on this cover caused quite an upror in Germany , where retailers refused to stock it .
It was n’t actually intended as a political statement , more of a cultural one – the figure in the foreground is Dick Clark .
The Rolling Stones , ‘ Sticky Fingers ’ ( 1971 ) A lot of people got pretty excited about this record cover because of the zipper .
Many thought it was too racy .
That being said , it only ever got banned in Spain , but not because of any moral issues – the zipper tended to scratch the records racked in front of it .
The Rolling Stones , ‘ Beggars Banquet ’ ( 1968 ) Another toilet cover that caused an uproar in the 60’s .
Th early versions of this sleeve were completely plain as pictures of public toilets were unforgivably vulgar in 1968 .
Roxy Music , ‘ Country Life ’ ( 1974 )
In some areas in the US and other parts of the world a different version of the sleeve was used – the women were airbrushed out completely , leaving only the green backdrop and the band logo .
Scorpions , ‘ Lovedrive ’ ( 1979 )
Often featured in ‘ worst album covers ever ’ lists , this bizarre sleeve was replaced in some markets with a more sensible black sleeve featuring a blue scorpion .
The album ’s artwork was named “ Best album sleeve of 1979 ” by Playboy magazine .
The Beatles , ‘ Yesterday And Today ’ ( 1966 )
After a public outcry over the “ butcher ” cover , the record company recalled copies of this record sleeve
U2 , ‘ Achtung Baby ’ ( 1991 ) You ’d have to study the back cover of this album very closely to discover that bassist Adam Clayton ’s penis is visible .
The US version of the album featured an ‘ X ’ over the genitals .
White Zombie , ‘ Supersexy Swingin ’ Sounds ’ ( 1996 )
Once again wal - mart comes to the rescue of the prudish american public – in American stores this model ’s modesty was covered by a blue bikini .
The Beautiful South , ‘ Welcome to the Beautiful South ’ ( 1989 ) This debut album sleeve featured a picture of a woman with a gun in her mouth .
After protests , in some markets the sleeve was changed to feature two cuddly teddy bears instead – an ‘ in - your - face ’ , sardonic move by the band .
Tin Machine , ‘ Tin Machine II ’ ( 1991 )
On the US version of this David Bowie sleeve , the statues ’ penises were airbrushed out … all in the name of public decency .
Jane ’s Addiction , ‘ Ritual de lo Habitual ’ ( 1990 ) Perry Farrell freaked out when people started calling for this cover to be banned .
To voice his outrage he had it replaced with plain white cover , blank except for the text to the First Amendment to the US constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech .
John Lennon & Yoko Ono , ‘ Unfinished Music No. 1 : Two Virgins ’ ( 1968 )
Many retailers stocked the album inside a brown paper bag .
Even the band was divided as to whether or not to release this album cover .
Andrew W.K. , ‘ I Get Wet ’ ( 2001 ) W.K. initially initially said that he struck himself in the face with a small piece of cinder block during the photo shoot , but later it was found out that the blood is actually that of an animal which he got from a butcher ’s shop .
Alice Cooper , ‘ Love It to Death ’ ( 1971 ) “ I see penises everywhere ! ”
Just like the Five Keys controversy , everyone thought that the thumb was a penis , and was subsequently airbrushed out .
Blind Faith , ‘ Blind Faith ’ ( 1969 )
This image accompanied the debut album by the band ( which included Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker ) .
The sleeve started bizarre rumors , including that the girl was Baker ’s daughter or was a groupie kept as a slave by the band .
In the US it was replaced with a photo of the band .
Updated
And so it begins .
Just hours after it launched here , we 're much obliged to patriotic reader Russ for the first image from Google 's Street View to capture the true spirit of Blighty .
Our tableau vivant is set in Shoreditch 's Curtain Road , which lies at the heart of London 's Nathan Barley country .
The star of the show is undoubtedly the chemically - disadvantaged fellow saying hello to the pavement in 256 colours .
We should n't overlook the strong supporting turn by his friend in the novelty antlers , however , who is displaying the kind of esprit de corps one only finds in the East End .
It 's enough to put you off your dinner , unless you are the young gentleman strolling past , apparently tucking into a traditional Hackney Christmas feast of deep fried chicken served in a cardboard box .
Keep them coming . ®
Update
Google apparently does n't want to show Britain in all its glory and has deleted the image .
Also thanks to those who pointed out that this is more likely an early evening tactical vomit on a stag night than a Christmas event .
We considered that interpretation , and chose to ignore it .
A research team from the Pastoral Commission for Peace and Ecology ( COPAE ) has confirmed , beyond all measure of doubt — that Goldcorp ’s Marlin mine in the municipality of San Miguel Ixtahuacan , Guatemala , is poisoning local water supplies .
On February 23 , a research team from COPAE found levels of arsenic as high as 70 ppb ( parts per billion ) or 0.70 mg/L , in a river downstream from the mine .
It ’s an “ alarming ” find , says Ing. Fausto Valiente from COPAE .
International standards for Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater have been established at a maximum limit of 0.1 mg/L by the World Bank , and 0.01 mg/L by the US Environmental Protection Agency , COPAE explains .
Local communities have always known that their water was being contaminated by the mine .
Indeed , they can feel it in their own bodies , and see it on the faces of their loved ones .
Rights Action , who recently conducted a series of interviews in the community , says that more than 60 % of those they interviewed report that someone in their immediate family has suffered from various types of health problems , which they never experienced before the mine opened in 2004 .
“ Similar skin rashes , hair loss and health problems have been documented after Goldcorp began its mining operations in Honduras in 2000 , ” Rights Action notes .
Goldcorp , however , maintains that it ’s not the result of exposure to any toxins , be it arsenic , cyanide , mercury , or any other chemical .
Instead , Goldcorp says , it ’s all the result of “ bad hygiene , ” a “ lack of water ” and “ fleas ” .
Recommended Action
Rights Action states , “ There is no easy way to help the mainly Mayan Mam villagers being harmed by this mine .
Goldcorp Inc. has the full support of the governments of Canada and Guatemala ; early on , the World Bank was an investor in and supporter of this mine .
It is fundamental that North American citizens hold Goldcorp Inc , its investors and shareholders and the American and Canadian governments accountable for the environmental and health harms and human rights violations being caused by Goldcorp Inc. in Guatemala , and elsewhere .
American and Canadian citizens should write to – and keep on writing to – their politicians , making them aware of these situations , demanding that our governments prioritize global human rights and environmental concerns over global business interests , demanding that our politicians use their power and authority to help hold our corporations accountable if / when they violate human rights and / or cause environmental and health harms .
Canadians and Americans should write to and keep writing to their own Pension Funds and Investment Brokers – including the Canadian Pension Plan , to find out what types of corporations and businesses they are investing in , to demand that our investors prioritize global human rights and environmental concerns over profits , to insist that investments be withdrawn if / when profits are being made at the expense of environmental and health harms and / or human rights violations .
This is slow , long - term work .
We need to make our governments , companies and investment firms accountable to us in all facets of global economic relations and policies .

Not since the assassination of Congressman Larry McDonald -- when the International Banking Cartel decided to murder the 290 passengers aboard KAL flight 007 over Soviet airspace and the coverup after as to the reason why -- has the issue not escaped Americans .
Just as former Senator John Tower and his daughter were among 23 persons murdered on April 5 , 1991 when the twin - engine commuter plane they were aboard crashed while trying to land at an airport in Brunswick , GA -- and the death of Senator John Heinz and six other people were killed on the previous day of April 4 , 1991 .
Heinz 's death occurred when a Bell 412 helicopter collided with the Senator 's Piper Aerostar plane over Merion Elementary School in Lower Merion Township , Pennsylvania .
All aboard the two aircraft and two first - grade girls playing outside the school were killed .
The helicopter had been dispatched to check out a problem with the landing gear of Heinz 's plane .
While moving in for a closer look , the helicopter 's rotor blades struck the bottom of the plane , causing both aircraft to lose control and crash .
These two Senators , who had seats on the Senate banking and Finance Committees , were involved with the Council on Foreign Relations .
Their deaths coincide with the efforts of McDonald and during June , 1989 , the battle , waged at the state level , had once again reached Congress .
Representative Henry Gonzalez of Texas , introduced House Resolution 1469 , calling for the abolition of the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System .
He also introduced House Resolution 1470 , calling for the repeal of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
During the same session , Representative Phil Crane of Illinois , introduced H.R. 70 , calling for an annual audit of the Federal Reserve , none of which ever made it to daylight .
Along with the death of Charles Lindbergh 's son , the poisoning of Louis McFadden , JKF and RFK and several other IBC assassinations , efforts to get to the heart of the Fed and it 's total corruption have been met with resistance .
Today , we can without hesitation make a stand to force our pathetic legislators to sponsor H. Res 1207 and get the accountability and action we have been denied for too many years .
Ron Paul 's legislation HR 1207 , The Federal Reserve Transparency Act , is gaining support .
HR 1207 has 91 co-sponsors and real potential to pass - BUT only if we educate and rally the people to support it and get our Congresspeople to put it to vote and pass it .

Opinion
A failed drug war 's rising body count
" The war on drugs is a failure , " the former presidents of Brazil , Colombia and Mexico wrote in the Wall Street Journal last month .
" Prohibitionist policies based on eradication , interdiction and criminalization simply have n't worked , " Fernando Henrique Cardoso , Cesar Gaviria and Ernesto Zedillo wrote .
In Mexico , an estimated 6,290 drug - related murders occurred last year .
On Feb. 20 , Roberto Orduna Cruz had to resign as chief of police of Cuidad Juarez after drug traffickers announced they would kill a police officer for every 48 hours Orduna remained on the job - and made good on the threat .
As Cardoso , Gaviria and Zedillo warned , " The alarming power of the drug cartels is leading to a criminalization of politics and a politicization of crime . "
Their countries have received billions in U.S. aid for drug interdiction , yet the former presidents suggested " the possibility of decriminalizing the possession of cannabis for personal use . "
Now that baby step is big .
They should have used the l-word , legalize , as decriminalizing drugs would leave trafficking and big profits under the control of violent cartels .
But as Eric Sterling , president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation , figures , " decriminalization is often used as a euphemism for legalization , " in part because voters perceive legalization as complete lawlessness , when it should entail regulation " by a state by state basis and a drug - by - drug basis . "
Which is why Norm Stamper , the former Seattle police chief , now speaks for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
He grew up in San Diego and has spent a lot of time in Mexico .
" I love the country and it's heartbreaking to see what 's happening , when we know there 's a solution for it , " Stamper told me .
" There 's a simple but profound stroke that can drive the cartels and the street traffickers out of business - end the prohibition model and replace it with a regulatory model . "
On March 7 , the Economist resumed its call for an end to the war on drugs : " Prohibition has failed ; legalization is the best solution . "
Noting that more then 800 Mexican police officers and soldiers were killed since December 2006 , the editorial noted , " Indeed , far from reducing crime , prohibition has fostered gangsterism on a scale that the world has never seen before . "
Thursday , CNN anchor Rob Marciano read parts of the Economist piece to Rep. Loretta Sanchez , D - Garden Grove ( Orange County ) , then asked her about legalizing drugs .
Sanchez responded ( please bear with this quote , it 's a bit garbled ) , " Certainly there is one drug - it 's called alcohol - that we prohibited in the United States and had such a problem with , as far as underground economy and cartels of that sort , that we ended up actually regulating it and taxing it .
And so , there has always been this thought that maybe if we do that with drugs , it would lower the profits in it and make some of this go away . "
San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano has introduced a bill to legalize and tax and regulate , " the state 's largest cash crop " - which would help with Sacramento 's chronic budget shortfalls .
I think it 's fair to assume that if the bill passed , California would see an increase in marijuana use - which is not good - but a decrease in drug profits and violence - which is good .
At a House panel hearing last week , Rep. John Tierney , D - Mass . , figured $ 15 billion to $ 25 billion in annual profits from U.S. drug sales bankroll Mexican cartels purchases of guns from America .
" The profits and guns - and drug precursors in some cases - then find their way back across the border to Mexico and fuel the increasing violence . "
Sterling said of the violence in Mexico , it " is not senseless .
It 's very deliberate .
The reason the violence becomes more gruesome is because it 's murder as message .
It 's an attempt to intimidate the government to make the government the way it used to be . "
Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told The Chronicle that 40 percent of Mexico 's drug sales are marijuana .
" What we have to do is change our policy and decriminalize marijuana . "
Think the l-word , instead , to put more kingpins out of business .
Except that to question the drug war is to risk losing tax money .
When the El Paso , Texas , City Council passed a resolution calling for " open , honest , national dialogue on ending the prohibition of narcotics , " state and national politicians threatened to withhold government funds .
The Associated Press reported on a letter by five Democratic state representatives warned that the resolution " does not bring the right attention to El Paso .
It says , ' We give up and we do n't care . ' " The El Paso mayor vetoed the measure and it died .
I 'd say that to not ask if prohibition actually works is give up and not care .
Now here 's a moral question :
How many Mexican police officers have to die because American parents believe that U.S. drug laws will keep their teenagers from doing something their kids may or may not do whether it is or is n't legal ?
Follow - up question :
Will parents feel safer if the drug cartel violence moves north ?
Is it because of the tasteless tomatoes we buy in grocery stores or the prices we pay for fresh veggies ?
Or is it just a healthy desire to get our hands back into the dirt ?
Whatever it is , the demand for seeds for veggies and herbs is skyrocketing this year .
Three big seed suppliers in the metro area report their spring sales are up as much as a third over last year .
“ Our year does n’t end until June 30 , but we believe our sales for vegetable seed packets are up about 30 percent , ” said Lori Townsend , operations manager and seed buyer for Lake Valley Seed Co. in Boulder .
“ The same is true for herb seeds .
Flower seeds are up about 10 percent . ”
She thinks the poor economy has left people with less money for groceries , so they ’re looking for ways to eat better food .
“ I think you ’ll see a big increase in storage , canning and freezing later in the season , ” she said .
Lake Valley is a wholesaler , selling about 9 million seed packets for home gardeners across the country each year , she said .
She ’s optimistic enough that she hired a second shift of workers in anticipation of an even greater demand in 2010 .
Sales at Rocky Mountain Seed Co. , which sells bulk seeds to commercial growers , farmers and garden centers as well as seed packets to home growers , are up 20 percent to 25 percent this year , said Ed Barraclough , who runs the 89 - year - old Denver company with his wife , Barbara .
“ Our largest customer base is the commercial farmers and greenhouses , where we ’re up 15 to 20 percent , ” he said .
“ Seed packets are up at least 25 percent , with organic seeds up about 22 percent .
I do n’t know if that ’s from a health concern or more from the economy being down . ”
The company prides itself in supplying seeds for free or at a deep discount for urban gardens for the indigent and for the more than 80 gardens operated in the metro area by the nonprofit Denver Urban Gardens .
Broomfield - based Botanical Interests , which sells about 5 million to 6 million seed packets a year , has seen about a 22 percent increase so far this year .
The company focuses on home gardeners , particularly those new to growing or those wishing to get better at it , selling to 2,400 stores , including all Whole Foods and Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage stores .
Each seed packet has elaborate graphics and contains extensive directions on preparation , growing , harvesting and consuming .
“ We joke that we ’re an information company that sells seeds , ” said Curtis Jones , who started the company 14 years ago with his wife , Judy Seaborn .
He estimates that about 15 percent of the increase is from existing customers buying more seeds .
The rest he attributes to new customers gardening for the first time .
Jones believes people feel a greater need to become self - sufficient .
“ Things are so bad now , I should be able to take care of myself , ” he said .
“ If there ’s a break in the distribution of food , or a natural disaster , people want to be able to take care of themselves . ”
Lake Valley ’s Townsend says experienced gardeners can grow roughly $ 600 worth of vegetables from $ 20 worth of seeds .
Jones estimates a 12 - inch pot could yield about $ 75 worth of basil , but acknowledges that in some communities , there may be more forces than the budget at work .
“ For Boulderites , it ’s more of a sustainability thing , ” he said .
“ Grow locally , use less fuel , smaller carbon footprint . ”

Grow your gardening skills
Experienced gardeners caution beginners against diving in too quickly and spending way too much , citing William Alexander ’s book , “ The $ 64 Tomato ” ( Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill , 2007 ) , in which he tells of the extremes he went to in taming nature to produce a table full of fresh vegetables for his family .
After wrestling with fancy hoes , pesticides , fertilizers and electric fences on his Hudson River garden plot , Alexander guesses in the final chapter that the heirloom tomato he is eating cost him about $ 64 to grow .
This does n’t have to happen to you .
Many towns and cities support community gardens — often staffed by master gardeners or populated by those who are really good at growing food — where you can get started on a manageable scale and get mentoring if you need it .
Here are a few to check out :
Denver Urban Gardens : Members pitch in with the work and with teaching others about gardening ( dug.org ) .
Growing Gardens :
This group manages eight community gardens in Boulder and Louisville ( growinggardens.org ) .
CSU Extension : Many extension offices have community gardens , and if they do n’t , they ’ll know where you can find one in your town .
Go to www.ext.colostate.edu, and search for your county office .

Couple strip off in full view of hotels , pubs and shops near Windsor Castle and only stop when police arrive
Tourists enjoying a day of sightseeing at Windsor Castle got more than they bargained for today when a couple were caught having sex on the Queen 's lawn .
Ignoring signs asking visitors to Please Keep Off The Grass , the man and woman , said to be in their early 30 , selected a spot near the castle 's Garter Tower and stripped off in full view of hotels , pubs and shops .
An employee at the Harte and Garter Hotel , which overlooks the castle , said guests went out to observe the scene and could not believe their eyes .
The woman , who asked not to be named , said : " People were shouting things like ' what are you doing ? ' but the couple did n't seem to care at all .
It was going on for about 10 or 15 minutes , which is quite a long time , considering the location . "
Another witness , Mark Robinson , 44 , said the couple carried on until police intervened .
He said : " The officers told them to stop and the sight of the uniforms seemed to snap them out of it .
They were unsteady on their feet and the guy pulled his trousers up and helped the girl put hers back on .
" The Japanese tourists were comparing their videos . "
A spokesman from Thames Valley police confirmed that two people had been arrested and cautioned for outraging public decency .
It is not known whether the Queen was in residence at Windsor Castle at the time .
Meet Brian Smith , a senior broadcast journalism major at Texas Christian .
He 's also a student reporter and had been a regular contributor to " On Campus Cam , " a talking heads - style show on The Mtn. where student reporters from conference schools are asked to give their opinions .
On an April 14 broadcast , Smith said that freshman quarterback Casey Pachall , who graduated early from high school to enroll at TCU , is good enough to unseat Andy Dalton as the starter .
" I think it 's going to be tough to tell if Andy 's really as solid a starter as everybody believes he is , " Smith said .
" And I think the reason for that is because Casey Pachall , a true freshman who enrolled in January , really looked good during drills and during the Purple and White game , and in my opinion he really could challenge Dalton for that starting spot .
" He can manage a game and he can play not to lose , but I do n't really think he 's the kind of guy who can win you a game .
And Casey Pachall is that kind of guy . "
In the long , often boring , and generally disappointing history of evolution , nothing has managed to capture our imagination quite like the dinosaurs .
1
The simple fact that there were once giant , terrifying reptiles with tiny brains who “ ruled the Earth ” 2 is enough to inspire awe , but that they then disappeared prior to the invention of the camera phone really compounds it .
On the cosmic scale of things , the fact that grizzly bears frighten us is a bit laughable , for if they stepped out of a time machine and into the age of the dinosaurs , grizzly bears would spend the majority of their short lives screaming like children and running away from everything they saw – including the plants , probably – and wondering what the hell was going on here ( and also kicking themselves for not just stopping the time machine in 1929 and shorting the stock market , like they had planned ) .
‘ I ’m short oil , I ’m short steel , I ’m short railroads … I ’m short pretty much everything .
Oh , I ’m from the future . ’
Of all the dinosaurs , none is so iconic as Tyrannosaurus rex ( lit .
‘ Tyrant - Lizard King ( not the band ) ’ ) .
Hailing from the late Cretaceous between 85 and 65 million years ago , Tyrannosaurus rex ( or T. rex , as it preferred to be called ) , was , from what we can suss out based on skeletal remains , one of the largest carnivores ever , standing 15 feet tall , reaching up to 40 feet long , and weighing somewhere around 7,000 pounds .
According to people who estimate things that are impossible to estimate , its 700 pound head could , with the aid of serrated teeth the size of bananas , tear off up to 500 pounds of meat in a single bite .
But what ’s most breathtaking about T. rex was that it was , at one point , real .
T. rexes roamed Western North America for millions of years , and in a time when dinosaurs ruled , they were king .
‘ More mead and serving wenches !
And tell my younger brother to calm down .
I ca n’t handle his psychodrama right now . ’
Or so we ’re led to believe .
The truth is that everything we know about T. rex comes from fossilized remains – reptilian bone slowly replaced by minerals over the course of millions of years – and a few Spielberg movies .
And from these sources , our best and brightest scientists can only make rough deductions about T. rex based on a knowledge of biomechanics and animal anatomy comparisons drawn from extant fauna .
What this means is that , while it certainly looked like a carnivorous tyrant - lizard king , for all we really know , T. rex actually liked eating flowers and hugging .
Only one thing is for sure — leaving behind a giant skeleton with massive teeth the size of bananas is a surefire way to get lots of kids books written about yourself .
His one wish was that some future species educate their offspring about his work .
As with all other dinosaurs , there are no T. rexes frozen in ice ( unlike the wooly mammoth ) , no T. rex photographs , no T. rex audio recordings , and only the crudest of T. rex diary entries , leaving a vast chasm of T. rex knowledge that is open to interpretation , speculation , and prolific grant - writing by bearded paleontologists who spend their adult lives hoping that PBS interviews them in their Indiana Jones hat at least once .
‘ Believe it or not , I ’m a bit of a rebel .
I mean , I got the hat and everything . ’
For instance , some paleontologists believe that all tyrannosaurs , including T. rex , must have been covered in feathers at some point during their life cycles ( most likely after hatching ) .
If nothing else , a feather - covered T. rex was surely a lot less intimidating , not to mention a lot more upsetting for his dad .
But we do n’t know .
We also do n’t know whether T. rex was a hunter or a scavenger .
While a massive dinosaur with a mouthful of banana teeth that could deliver a bite with 1440 pounds of force in the front part of its jaw and 3011 in the back would seem to be a bit of a no - brainer in the hunting department , some paleontologists suggest that their massive legs may have prevented them from running as fast as their potential prey ( biomechanics pins their top speed at about 18 mph , which is slightly faster than a human being can run ) .
They also had relatively large olfactory lobes , which could ( could ! ) mean a powerful sense of smell for locating rotten meat ( similar to New World vultures , which are award - winning , world - class scavengers ) .
And then , of course , there was the issue of T. rex ’s hilariously undersized forearms , which could not even reach their own mouth ( meaning that , however they got their food , they never wiped their mouth after dinner ) .
These almost vestigial forearms were likely little use for grasping prey , and they were almost certainly worthless in push up contests .
‘ Well they ’ll work just fine for Xbox .
When ’s that coming out again ? ’
But others dissent from this view and remain convinced T. rex was a hunter , pointing to its stereoscopic vision ( and , you know , the spiky banana teeth ) .
Still others think the shreds of rotten , bacteria - infested meat lodged in its numerous teeth gave T. rex a “ septic bite , ” which caused an initial bite wound to become infected , making these tyrannosaurs among the very first bioterrorists .
And , for what it ’s worth , this would also explain why two T. rex fossils have never been found locked in a passionate kiss .
The most complete T. rex skeleton ever found was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 .
Currently on display at the Field Museum in Chicago , ‘ Sue ’ has shed a great deal of new light on the Tyrannosaurus rex .
For instance , we now know that we do n’t know whether Sue was a male or a female .
We do know , however , that Sue died at some point in what is now South Dakota .
Probably .
For all we know , she or he passed away in what is now Montana , but the other T. rexes brought her to South Dakota for an incredibly elaborate funeral procession that featured a full marching band and several push up contests .
‘ By the way , I was also pink .
Everything was .
Long story .’
However , using a little bit of common sense , we can probably make the reasonable leap and conclude that T. rex was a hunter ; after all , T. rex-esque wounds have been found in other dinosaur skeletons .
Of course , these may have been inflicted post - mortem .
But let ’s be honest–does anyone think that something with banana teeth and a brain smaller than a quart of milk was reluctant to bite anything and everything around it ?
Obviously , grading an animal that no longer exists – and about whom so much remains murky – presents a challenge .
But after much meditation and consideration , one is stuck with the words ‘ banana teeth , ’ and grading T. rex , unlike every other aspect of its investigation , becomes quite simple .
GRADE : A +
1 The notable exception being the great white shark .
2 A small minority of experts think that the dinosaurs were brought down by an overextended state budget , bread riots , an overreliance on mercenaries , and general internal decadence .
This minority is very , very small .
Yesterday , March 19 , 2009 , a most amazing article appeared in the Seguin , Texas Gazette - Enterprise newspaper .
( http://www.seguingazette.com/story.lasso?ewcd=7067c6003405a409)
This is an amazingly chilling article for a number of reasons .
1 . For the first time , an American county is organizing a mock response drill to prepare health care workers , police , and " volunteers " for the coming , " inevitable " pandemic .
2 . The article completely ignores historical facts , and subscribes to the extremely flawed notion mindlessly parroted by the United Nations that killer " pandemics " are " acts of nature " that occur regularly in 100 - year cycles .
FACT : The 1918 Killer Pandemic had its origins in pathogenic - virus - contaminated typhus fever VACCINES that were injected into the veins of naive service personnel deployed during WW I.
FACT : Any " modern " pandemic will be started in exactly the same manner --- ( i.e. contaminated VACCINES ) in one way or another .
FACT : There was no " killer pandemic " that killed millions back in 1818 , no " killer pandemic " in 1718 , etc .
These lies and falsehoods MUST be corrected in order to understand the REAL AGENDA .
3 . The article utilizes three tried and tested tools of propaganda - FEAR - MONGERING , FALSE PRIDE , and CALLS FOR CITIZENSHIP .
It begins by creating a scenario that most people deeply fear --- billions of dead around the world , with a full one - third of the United States people in grave peril .
It then portrays the chaos that would likely paralyze the MASS VACCINATION CREWS -- with vehicle " lines " extending for hundreds , if not thousands of miles !
Furthermore , this article follows the Illuminati Master 's play book to the letter by skillfully utilizing PRS ( Problem - Reaction - Solution ) programming --- i.e. they create the Problem , manipulate the public 's Reaction , thereby forcing individuals into their prescribed Solution ( which is clearly MASS GENOCIDE just as Henry Kissinger , Zbignew Breszinski , et. al. prescribed in their Tri-lateralist publication titled " Project 2000 " ) .
How very convenient that our benevolent federal government has already prepared a " Strategic National Stockpile " of untested , untried , potentially lethal human - kidney - cell - based " Vaccines " manufactured in China ( in 2005 , China 's defense minister , Chi Haotian declared China would " clean - up America all at once " by using a potent , new " biological weapon " ) which have been " hidden in up to 2 dozen ' secret ' locations " since 2008 .
The article then calls for patriotic , civic - minded volunteers to sign up and help promulgate this insidious agenda , promising them that they would be repaid by being " the first in line " to receive the saving vaccines .
4 . Certain parts of the article contain clear Illuminati / Masonic symbolism .
For instance , the article talks about " Five Points of Dispensing " or PODs .
In satanically - inspired secret - society rituals ( Grand Dragon Albert Pike wrote in " Morals and Dogma " that the " light - bearer " of the Masons and Mormons evoked by the " Five Points " was none other than " Lucifer , Son of the Morning " ) practiced by Mormons , Masons , and others , initiates utilize something called " The Five Points of Fellowship " whereby they receive direct communication from certain , mystical inter- dimensional entities by means of touching five parts of the body to form the inverted five - pointed star , aka the PENTAGRAM .
Seehttp:// www.exmormon.org/boards/honestboard/messages/3224.html as well as the official Masonic " Grand Lodge of Texas " explanation athttp:// www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/degrees/degree_3rd_files/ the_five_points_of_fellowship_gltx.htm.
5 . I submit the specific DAY ( May 2 ) of the planned Texas " response drill " is also significant .
In witchcraft and other pagan / satanic cult circles , May 1 , aka Beltane , is a very sacred day , parallelling Samhain ( Halloween ) as a day where " the spirits of the dead " can be readily summoned and accessed according to organized witchcraft covens .
Beltane is the Black Sabbat where the male Phallus organ is worshipped , as well as incorporating a purifying process whereby human bodies are " cleansed " by means of repeatedly " going through the fire " .
FIRE is the Satanist / Illuminist / WICCAN cleansing tool .
Lucifer , ( according to his disciples such as Pike and Aleistar Crowley ) , seeks to " cleanse the earth " by fire .
See http://www.highvalley.org/beltane- ritual.html
I submit that FEMA and the CDC plan to use crematoriums to dispose of the millions of Pandemic Flu casualties fulfills this infernal agenda .
In the past few years , KBR , a subsidiary of Dick Cheney 's Halliburton , have been building and expanding mass concentration camps with crematorium facilities attached .
http://www.apfn.org/apfn/camps.htm
What is their purpose ?
What massive national catastrophe would cause government agencies such fear and loathing to make them declare martial law and imprison civilians in " forced quarantine " camps ?
An international " pandemic " makes perfect sense --- and would CLEANSE INFERIOR " Goyim " or Kissinger 's " Useless Eaters " by means of millions of burned corpses that have " passed through the cleansing fires " .
Moreover , the nation 's police chiefs and law enforcement officers are preparing for just such a " quarantine " event .

Something VERY WICKED INDEED , is surely coming this way .
Combine these five points , and what do you see ??
A Truly Bloody Mess !
By Ron Maloney The Gazette - Enterprise Published March 19 , 2009 SEGUIN - Around the world , up to two billion people have died - depending upon whose count one uses - and in the United States alone deaths could total one third of the population .
Somewhere in the federal government , the decision is made and secret medical stockpiles stored at secret locations are loaded into aircraft and , within 12 hours , moved to wherever they are most likely to be able to stop a pandemic that threatens mankind .
Local officials have 36 hours to treat their entire population - in Guadalupe County that would be 115,000 people .
A massive call - up of volunteers that , in this county alone would take 1,000 medical professionals and lay people is required to prepare and operate five Points of Dispensing ( PODs ) at which the life - saving medications can be distributed .
It may sound like the plot of a sci - fi thriller - but it's what would happen if the 1918 Spanish Flu that decimated the world happened today .
Guadalupe County emergency management and their counterparts around the country are preparing for just such a scenario because in the history of humankind it happens once every 100 years or so - and the time is coming for the next one .
Were it to happen tomorrow , though , local officials would fail in the effort because they lack the local volunteers needed to try to stop the outbreak .
Guadalupe County Emergency Management Coordinator Dan Kinsey and his volunteer coordinator , Kay Hays , are speaking to local large employers and service clubs , seeking to compile a list of volunteers who can help .
Wednesday they made presentations to a pair of organizations , including the Seguin Kiwanis Club .
Kinsey , who is responsible for coordinating the county 's response in times of natural or man-made disasters , made a presentation on the " Strategic National Stockpile " - those medical supplies the government has hidden in up to two dozen locations - and what the scenario would be like if part of it was distributed in Guadalupe County .
Kinsey and Hays are preparing for a May 2 dress rehearsal of a pandemic disaster at the Navarro ISD .
Volunteers will set up and operate a " drive through " POD in which they will take a practice run at registering , screening and pretending to inoculate 100 volunteers so they can identify whatever problems might come up and prepare to meet them .
The same procedures with minor changes would apply to any similar emergency , such as an outbreak of smallpox or an anthrax or ricin attack , Kinsey said .
The challenges are daunting ones when one considers the kind of response that would be required in Guadalupe County alone .
Kinsey 's done the math based on the size of the average family , average vehicle occupancy and average vehicle length including space between vehicles of .
Were Guadalupe County to attempt to handle such traffic in one lane in five locations , each line would be 41 miles long , Kinsey said .
For San Antonio , the lines would be more than 2,000 miles long - the distance from Calgary , Alberta to San Antonio .
And scenarios using license plate numbers to sort the lines are not viewed as likely to succeed , Kinsey said .
" If I tell you this half of this room is going to get your medication today and that half will get it tomorrow if there 's any left , are you going to wait ? "
Kinsey asked .
What Kinsey envisions is five " drive - through " PODs operating 24 hours a day until done on 12 - hour shifts that will require 100 volunteers for duties as varied as administering medications , filling out paperwork , distributing food or water , providing security or watching the children of other volunteers .
The five PODs would have to be able to accommodate 3,200 people each per hour , and to do that , they would have to be located in areas where the traffic can be controlled without resulting in gridlock - meaning relatively familiar rural areas where traffic might be " contra - flowed " to provide the most efficient access .
NISD is one such location , and at 10 a.m. on Saturday , May 2 , Kinsey wants to run his drill .
" We 're looking for 1,000 volunteers in all , but we need at least 100 for the May 2 exercise , " Kinsey said .
" This is not a big commitment - maybe three or four hours once a year - but it 's definitely a way you can help your community , your county and your country . "
There is another benefit to volunteering in case of a disaster , Kinsey said .
" Volunteers and their families will receive whatever countermeasures are required first , " Kinsey said .
" They 'll be needed because our goal is to do the most good we can and we need your help to do it .
I 'd love to see the Kiwanis or any service club or employer become involved . "
The Guadalupe County Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster , or VOAD , needs 100 volunteers for a May 2 emergency disaster drill at Navarro ISD .
In the long term , 1,000 volunteers are needed .

Biography : Michael Jingozian is the founder and CEO of AngelVision Technologies .
In 2007 , they were voted " One of the 15 Best Small Companies to work for in Oregon . "
Recently , AngelVision was ranked the 120th fastest growing company in the United States by Inc. Magazine .
Jingozian is also the founder of RESET America , which is a group dedicated to breaking the 2 party monopoly and increasing the number of candidates who run on 3rd party tickets to secure 3rd party ballot access and participation in national debates .
He is currently the Vice - Chairman of the Libertarian National Committee and is on working on a book titled , " Story Pollution , " to increase awareness for why American voters continue to support politicians who do not represent their best interests and what can be done to change these views and elect people who are committed to creating a more sustainable world .
Endorsement : I endorse the National Initiative for Democracy for many reasons .
First , I have had the great honor of meeting and campaigning with Senator Gravel while running for the Libertarian Party ’s Presidential nomination and I had the opportunity to talk to him in person about the National Initiative and why it makes sense for America .
My work in " Story Pollution " is about challenging ways of thinking that keep us in the past and to work , instead , for a future that sees a breakdown in the 2 party system and is more hospitable to 3rd party candidates who seek public office .
The National Initiative makes it possible for people to realize their potential to affect change , which could inspire a new generation of people who hold opinions not supported by either of the 2 major parties to run for local , state and federal government .
Not only is the National Initiative in line with democratic ideals in that it recognizes the power of the people to make laws , it also allows people to recognize their own power to serve themselves rather than just sending elected officials to Washington .
I grew up in Massachusetts and during that time , there was no such thing as a voter initiative .
When I moved to Oregon , I experienced , first - hand , the difference between a state with no voter initiative policy and one that put power into the hands of the people to make decisions regarding their own future .
Not only does this foster a sense of community because people are able to collaborate and to think about the best way to govern themselves , but it also allows for a more responsible government on the part of the state representatives who realize that they do not hold all of the cards .
The people are inspired and engaged in the process .
Synopsis
Dungeons & Dragons has long been a game about exploring new places and fighting dangerous monsters .
Usually these adventures are set either in an established campaign setting or a home brew world devised by the dungeon master .
This variant outlines a method in which both the players and the dungeon master can create a world together , creating a new method for world creation .
Basic Rules
This method of world creation is quite simple ; the dungeon master and the characters each take turns naming facts about the world , its geography , its people , its customs , and its legends .
Both the dungeon master and the players are encouraged to think creatively and to place locations and legends that they ’re interested in exploring and examining .
This is a simple process that has only a few basic rules .
Everything Exists :
Any information found in the core rules supplements exists in the world in some fashion .
No participant in this process can state a fact or legend that invalidates a choice found in the rules books .
The dungeon master and the players should be able to select any rules option in the books in this campaign setting .

No participant in this process can state a fact or legend that invalidates a choice found in the rules books .
The dungeon master and the players should be able to select any rules option in the books in this campaign setting .
The Basic Premise is True :
The basic premise of dungeons & dragons is still intact in this world .
Tieflings once hailed from Bael Turath , all of the core deities exist in some fashion , and adventurers still explore dark dungeons and buy magical treasures .
While individual facts about the common legends might change , the basic premise cannot be altered with stated facts ( though legends can offer different options ) .

While individual facts about the common legends might change , the basic premise cannot be altered with stated facts ( though legends can offer different options ) .
No Contradictions :
Once a participant in the world building process states a fact or legend , nothing can contradict this statement .
If a player states that the village of Green Hills exists in the Flowering Valley another player cannot then state that the village does n’t exist .
Once someone states a fact it becomes just that : a fact .
You can , however , append additional information to a stated fact .
In the above example a player could state that the village of Green Hills is linked to the Feywild and that it only actually appears during the daytime , disappearing at night .

Beware the Monkey ’s Paw :
While this is a cooperative world , the GM does hold ultimate power over the setting , mostly in order to ensure that the game is actually a challenge .
If you state that the town well holds powerful magical items the DM can alter this fact to ensure that 1st level characters do n’t start off with holy avengers .
Be careful what you wish for , as the DM can alter facts if they ’re clearly placed only to give an unfair advantage to the players .

Be Cooperative :
This is a group exercise and as such try not to rain on someone else ’s parade .
Work with everyone else at the table to make an enjoyable setting .
If someone raises a big objection to one of your facts ask them why they object and consider meeting them halfway .
While you have ultimate power on your turn you can and should talk to the other players if there ’s some question about your fact or legend .
Building the World
Filling in the map is an easy and enjoyable process .
Simply gather your group together , grab a piece of paper , and place a dot somewhere near the middle of the paper .
This is the starting village where the characters will begin their adventuring career .
You can name it now or leave the name as the first stated fact of the world building process .
Then elect one player as the scribe ( this is usually the GM ) .
The scribe writes down all the stated facts so that there ’s a written record of the world .
There are two smaller parts to the entire world building process .
The first part is the phase , which is a broad category of the world building process .
The phase determines what kinds of facts and legends each player can state during each round .
Each round every player can name one fact or legend for that phase .
Most phases consist of two to five rounds before the next phase begins .
Each round every player gets a chance to name a fact or legend appropriate to the phase subject .
These statements can either be a simple word or phrase that other players can elaborate on or a one or two sentence statement .
Players can make two types of statements .
A fact is something that is completely true ( so long as it follows the general rules above ) .
Examples of a fact would be the location of some terrain feature , a general truth about a race , or the name of a place or culture .
A legend is like a fact , save that the details of it can change to fit the story or the needs of the world .
Legends can also simply be keywords , adventure ideas , or common beliefs of the world .
Unlike facts , legends can be changed by the GM in secret to surprise the players .
Examples of legends would be a story that a dungeon exists in the Sunlight Plains , that dragons cannot see people who wear their own color or that when a wizard casts a spell his eyes glow .
The Phases
While there are no hard and fast rules for how many phases are used before play begins or for how many rounds each phase contains , the general outline below will produce a vibrant and adequately detailed region suitable for adventuring .
Phase One : World Myths [ 2 - 3 Rounds ]
World myths are almost universally legends rather than facts .
World Myths tend to include legends about how each race was created , vast world spanning legends , and facts that everyone should know .
This phase is intended to get everyone thinking about the broad theme of the world .
Phase Two : The Races [ 2 - 4 Rounds ]
This phase can contain both facts and legends about equally .
This phase allows the players to detail the races and how they might deviate from the core books .
This phase is most useful for players who want to come from a unique culture or for players who want to ensure that a race is either common or uncommon .
Phase Three : Local Geography [ 3 - 5 Rounds ]
In this phase the players begin to fill in the blank map with details about the local geography .
Everyone takes turns drawing in terrain features such as mountain ranges , rivers , plains , and other such things .
Players can either leave the places unnamed or given them a name that might suggest further facts .
Phase Four : The Village [ 2 - 4 Rounds ]
In this phase the players begin to name facts and legends about the starting village .
These can include the absence or presence of services or people , the local religion , the general feeling of the town , and other such things .
This phase can be expanded if the players expect to spend a great deal of time there .
Phase Five : Local Threats & Factions [ 1 - 3 Rounds ]
Once the world has been filled with a few terrain features and a local village , the players now need to place a few threats and monsters in the area .
Threats are generally found in the surrounding terrain while factions are generally reserved for the starting village or for neighboring nations .
Players can be quite vague here , leaving a lot of wiggle room for the GM to plan adventure around .
Phase Six : Local Legends [ 1 - 3 Rounds ]
This phase is entirely limited to legends , not facts .
Players should start listing common legends about places , people , and races .
These are intended to give the DM ideas for story seeds and adventures , so the more evocative and vague you are the better .
Phase Seven : The World Beyond [ 2 - 4 Rounds ]
During this phase the players all take turns filling out facts and details about the large world .
This can be where the roads lead to , neighboring towns or villages , facts about the local nation , or even the presence of another continent .
This is intended to provide locations for further adventures once the local area has been explored .
Phase Eight : Final Details [ 3 - 8 Rounds ]
This final phase is intended for a catch - all where players can name a few last details about the world .
No subject for facts or legends is forbidden and this phase is generally used to flesh out existing facts a bit further .
Bringing it All Together
Once all of the phases have been brought together , the DM should compile all of the information into one easy to read format .
This is now the beginning of the campaign world .
As play begins the DM and the players can further define the facts during play .
Should the characters find themselves lost for something to do they can simple start naming more facts that the DM can use to create further adventures .
When the players finally progress beyond their home region you can go through this process once again to create a new region ripe for exploration .
Simply start at phase three for the new area , keeping in mind that previous facts cannot be invalidated .
In this way you create the world a little bit at a time .
Final Word
This process is far from the final word on cooperative world building , and indeed it is not even that unique .
These are simply my suggestions for the process and you should change them to better suit your own group and play style .
Above all remember that building the world should be fun for everyone .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- California corrections officials released an updated prison photograph of Charles Manson on Wednesday , showing the balding and graying 74 - year - old , complete with his iconic forehead swastika .
A new photo of Charles Manson shows his graying beard and his legendary swastika tattooed into his forehead .
The picture was taken as part of a regular update of inmate images at the California State Prison in Corcoran , about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles , where Manson is serving a life term .
The release of the picture comes ahead of the 40th anniversary of the " Manson family " killings in August 1969 .
Manson and four others -- Susan Atkins , Patricia Krenwinkel , Charles " Tex " Watson and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two - night rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and seven others dead .
Van Houten , who was 19 at the time of the killings , was convicted in the murders of Leno LaBianca , a wealthy grocery store owner , and his wife , Rosemary .
Van Houten was accused of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca 14 to 16 times in the back .
Van Houten was also convicted of conspiracy in Tate 's death and four others at the actress ' Beverly Hills home .
Tate was 8 ½ months pregnant , and the baby also died in the attack .
Manson , Atkins and Krenwinkel were convicted for those murders .
All members of the " Manson family " have been up for parole multiple times over the past four decades , but it has never been granted .
Atkins , who has been declared terminally ill , was denied a compassionate release from prison in July 2008 .
Atkins has told police she was one of the people who stabbed Tate and scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski .
In May 2008 , authorities dug for bodies at the Inyo County , California , ranch where Manson and his followers once lived , after police learned that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there .
According to authorities , nothing was found .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House named three nominees on Sunday for senior jobs at the U.S. Treasury Department , which still is trying to fill out its top ranks while dealing with a financial crisis .

The three nominees were announced just days after two contenders for more senior posts withdrew their names from consideration .
A Treasury spokesman said the Obama administration nonetheless was ahead of prior administrations in getting its top Treasury officials in place and said a perception that its work was being hindered was incorrect .
The nominees announced on Sunday were :
-- Lawyer David S. Cohen , for the position of assistant Treasury secretary , terrorist financing .
Cohen , who worked at Treasury previously , was until recently a partner in the law firm WilmerHale ;
-- Economist Alan Krueger for the job of assistant secretary , economic policy .
Krueger taught at Princeton University and is widely published on a variety of economic issues ;
-- Financial specialist Kim Wallace , nominated for assistant secretary , legislative affairs .
Wallace previously was a managing director for the Washington research group at Barclays Capital and before that spent 14 years at now - defunct Lehman Brothers Group .
The positions require U.S. Senate confirmation .
All three of the nominees are serving as counselors to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
But there still is no deputy Treasury Secretary and two key undersecretaries -- for international policy and domestic finance -- have not yet been filled .
Undersecretaries are senior to assistant secretaries .
On Thursday , sources said former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Annette Nazareth withdrew from consideration to become a deputy Treasury secretary for personal reasons and that she would remain in her private securities law practice .
In addition , Geithner ’s choice for international affairs undersecretary , Caroline Atkinson , also pulled her name from consideration .
Atkinson , a senior official at the International Monetary Fund , has decided to remain at the institution , a person familiar with the decision said .
Both Nazareth and Atkinson had been vetted for the jobs but had not been formally nominated .
Lee Sachs , also currently a counselor to Geithner , is widely considered a top contender for undersecretary for domestic finance , but also has not been formally nominated .
Sachs was most recently a partner and fund manager at Mariner Investment Group Inc. and is involved in developing the Treasury ’s bank rescue plan .
The Word Problem for Free Groups
The word problem for free groups is in DLOG
Zeke Zalcstein worked , before he retired a few years ago , on the boundary between mathematics and computational complexity .
He started his career in mathematics , and then Zeke moved into computational complexity theory .
His PhD advisor was John Rhodes who is an expert on many things , including the structure of semigroups ; Rhodes has recently worked on the P=NP question himself ; more on that in another post .
The picture is John Rhodes since Zeke is camera shy .
I have known Zeke since I was a graduate student at Carnegie - Mellon and he was faculty there .
Later , Zeke worked at a number of universities , including Stony - Brook , and then spend the latter part of his career as a program director at CISE / NSF .
Zeke loves to laugh , he is funny , he knows tons of mathematics –especially algebra , but he is a character in the best sense of the word .
For example , he is very particular about what he eats and drinks , even his water cannot be just any water .
When Zeke was at Stony - Brook he discovered that there was a water source in a certain open field that had the best water in the world .
Not just Stony - Brook , the world .
The water source was a faucet coming out of the ground , in an otherwise empty field .
I asked Zeke where the water came from , the faucet was simply connected to a pipe that came out of the ground , no label , no sign , nothing .
Did it come from a spring , from a well , or from the city water main ?
Zeke said he just knew it was great water .
Unfortunately , one day Zeke fell and broke his arm so it was impossible for him to drive for several weeks .
While Zeke was incapacitated , a certain graduate student was kind enough to make periodic trips out to the faucet , fill up plastic jugs with the special water , and deliver them to Zeke .
I was once telling this story to John Hennessy , who is the President of Stanford University .
He started to laugh , and confirmed the story : John had been the graduate student who was kind enough to help Zeke .
Enough , on to the main topic of today ’s post .
Zeke and I worked together on a number of problems over the years , and today I will talk about one that has a curious history , a neat proof , and a interesting application that never really happen .
The Problem and Our Results
The problem is : what is the space complexity of the word problem for the free group on two letters ?
This is not how we first heard the problem , but it is equivalent to what we were asked .
The free group on two letters “ a ” and “ b ” is the group where the only relationships are :
It is called the free group since these are the minimal relations that can hold in any group .
As usual the word problem is to determine given any word over whether or not it equals .
For the rest , when we say word problem , we mean “ the word problem for the free group on two letters . ”
Zeke and I proved :
Theorem :
The word problem is in .
Actually we can proved more :
Theorem :
A probabilistic log - space machine that has a one - way read only input tape can solve the word problem with error at most , for any .
There is a simple linear time algorithm for the word problem .
The algorithm uses a pushdown store , which is initially empty .
The algorithm processes each input symbol as follows :
If the top of the pushdown is and , then pop off the top of the pushdown ; if not , then push onto the pushdown .
Then , go to the next input symbol .
When there is no more input symbols accept only if the pushdown is empty .
The algorithm clearly runs in linear time , and it is not hard to show that it is correct .
This algorithm uses linear space : a string that starts with many ‘s will , for example , require the pushdown to hold many symbols .
Thus , the goal is to find a different algorithm that avoids using so much space .
My on - going agenda , in these posts , is to explain the role people play in doing research .
In the next two sections I will explain the “ curious history ” of the question : who I “ think ” first asked the question , and why they may have asked the question .
Then , I will explain the how we solved the problem and proved a theorem .
You can skip the next two sections and get right to the proof method .
No history .
No background .
But , I hope that you find the history and motivation interesting .
Your choice .
Who Asked the Question ?
My memory for technical conversations is usually pretty good , but this question on the space complexity of the word problem has a murky history .
My version is that at a STOC conference , years ago , Juris Hartmanis mentioned a related problem to a number of us over a coffee break .
I instantly liked the problem , and during the next few months Zeke and I worked on the problem , until we found a solution .
At the next conference , FOCS , we told Juris our solution to “ his ” problem .
Juris said that he liked the problem , liked our solution , but he had never asked us the problem .
Who knows .
At least we did not call the paper : “ On a Conjecture of Hartmanis . ” I still believe , sometimes , that maybe Juris told it to us , but I must be confused .
Anyway I think you will like the method we used to solve it .
Why Did They Ask It ?
The problem that someone asked us , was not what is the space complexity of the word problem for the free group on two letters .
Instead we were asked a more “ language ” type question that is the same as the word problem .
We were asked : what is the space complexity of a certain language ?
Before defining it may help to explain where comes from .
Define the following language over the alphabet that contains two types of parentheses : “ ” and “ ” and “ ” and “ ” .
A string is in provided the application of the following rules eventually lead to the empty string :
Thus ,
is in the language , but
is not .
Note , is closed under concatenation .
The language consists of expressions with two types of parentheses that are well nested : sometimes it is called the Dyck language .
Each must have a matching and also each must have a matching .
Moreover , the two types of parentheses must not get in each others way , thus
is not in .
The Dyck language is a context - free language , and is central to the theory of context - free language theory .
Thus , another way to define is by the following context free grammar : ( The symbol is the empty string . )
The following is an easy theorem :
Theorem :
The language is in .
I will now explain how to prove this theorem ; to do this we need the notion of matching parentheses .
In a string say that matches provided and as we count left - to - right is the first time that starting with that the number of and are equal .
There is a similar definition for the parentheses and .
We call and left parentheses and and right parentheses .
Call a string good provided it satisfies the following :
for every left parentheses of either type there is a matching right one of the same type ; for every right parentheses of either type there is a matching left one of the same type ; if matches and matches , then and are disjoint intervals or one wholly contains the other .
The last means that there is no overlapping matches .
It should be clear that checking whether or not a string is good can be done easily in log - space .
Lemma :
A string is good if and only if is in .
It is easy to see that all strings in are good .
So suppose that there is a good string that is not in .
Select the shortest possible string .
The first symbol of must be a left parentheses by ( 2 ) .
So assume that .
There must be a right parentheses in by ( 1 ) so assume that is the first one .
Clearly , .
Suppose that .
Then , the previous must equal ; otherwise , would not be the shortest possible counterexample .
Thus ,
where are all left parentheses .
By ( 2 ) the matches some earlier , but the matches some later and this contradicts ( 3 ) .
Next suppose that .
Then , the previous must equal ; otherwise , would not be the shortest possible counterexample .
Thus ,
where again are all left parentheses .
By ( 2 ) the matches some earlier , but the matches some later and this contradicts ( 3 ) .
Now let us finally define the language
It is a variation of the Dyck language that allows a different type of pairing of the symbols .
This difference makes proving that it lies in harder .
This is the question , someone asked us–I guess not Juris .
Sometimes is called a “ two - sided ” Dyck language .
A string is in provided the application of the following rules eventually lead to the empty string :
and
The point of is that the parentheses have a type but no “ direction . ”
The trouble with is there does not seem to be a counterpart to the notion of matching ; a string of the form :
could have the match with a that comes earlier .
This is why I do not know a direct counting method to recognize .
I guess this is why someone asked us the question .
I wish I could remember who .
Our Solution
Zeke and I knew two insights , one trivial and the other based on a classic result from group theory .
The first is that is really the same as accepting the words from a free group on two letters .
and
The second insight is that the free group on two letters has a faithful representation over integer valued matrices ; this result was proved by Ivan Sanov in 1947 .
Theorem :
There are two integer matrices so that the mapping and is a faithful representation of the free group on .
Actually we can construct the matrices explicitly .
Consider the following two matrices : is
1 2 0 1
and is :
1 0 2 1
Both matrices are invertible and further their inverses are also integer matrices
The map that sends
defines a mapping from the free group on two letters , to : the latter is the matrices over the integers with determinant
This mapping is a group isomorphism .
That means that we can replace the word problem by : does a sequence of matrices over equal the identity matrix .
This transformation of the word problem into a problem about matrices is the key to our results .
For example ,
Here is how Zeke and I use this transformation to prove the our theorem .
We show how to check whether or not
is equal to where each is from .
The obvious way to do this is to compute matrix and see if it is equal to .
The difficulty with this approach is that the matrix may have entries that are too large and cannot be stored in log - space .
We solve this with the Chinese Remainder Theorem .
Suppose that is a prime with at most bits .
Let .
A log - space machine can pass over the input and compute the product : this means that we do all the arithmetic modulo , but we still are multiplying matrices .
Then , the machine checks whether or not .
If it does not , then clearly , and we can reject the input .
The machine does this for all primes of the given size .
If all , then the machine accepts .
We claim that this algorithm is correct .
The insight is that if is not equal to , then has some non-zero entry , which can not be too large .
Then , by the Chinese Remainder Theorem we have a contradiction , and so the algorithm is correct .
This uses the well known fact that
where the product is over primes and .
Finally , the probabilistic result follows in essentially the same way .
The only difference is that now the machine randomly selects one prime to check .
We then argue that the non -zero entry of is unlikely to be divisible by a randomly selected prime .
This relies the simple fact that the non-zero entry can only have a polynomial number of prime factors .
Thus , as long as we randomly select the prime from a large enough set , it is unlikely that the non-zero entry will be modulo the prime .
Karp - Rabin
What does the Karp - Rabin pattern matching algorithm have to do with our result on the word problem ?
Indeed .
Dick Karp and Michael Rabin are both famous for so many things , but one of my favorites of their results is their randomized pattern matching algorithm .
Rabin has told how they first thought of their algorithm .
They needed a way to hash strings that had a certain property , and our mapping from the free group to matrices modulo a prime worked perfectly .
So at one time they were using the same technology that we used to solve the word problem in log - space .
Unfortunately for Zeke and I , they quickly got rid of the matrix ideas and replaced them by a much simpler method .
But Michael has repeatedly told me that the matrix ideas played a role in his initial thinking .
Open Problems
Our proof method could handle a larger class of word problems , than just the word problem for free groups .
Suppose that is any linear group over the rationals .
Then , the word problem for this group can also be solved in .
One can even prove more , but see our paper for the details .
Thus , many infinite groups have word problems that can be done in log - space .
The power of matrix representation theory is something that you may be able to use to solve other problems .
I believe that we have not made as much use of the power of representation methods in other parts of computer science as perhaps we could .
In any event the mapping may itself be useful to you .
Now if I could only recall who initially asked me the problem
Do not let your fire go out , spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swaps of the not - quite , the not - yet , and the not - at - all .
Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach .
The world you desire can be won .
It exists .. it is real .. it is possible .. it ’s yours .

On January 29 , two sounding rockets simultaneously flew through the veil of an aurora to collect data from both the top and bottom edges of the arc .
Dr. Scott Bounds , the principal investigator for the Auroral Current and Electrodynamics Structure ( ACES ) mission , provided Universe Today with images from the flight , showing the rockets flying through the aurora , near Poker Flats , Alaska .
The above image shows a single - stage Black Brant V rocket that flew through the lower portion of the aurora .
It reached an altitude of nearly 83 vertical miles , flying for roughly eight minutes .
( See below for more images . )
Other rockets have flown through aurorae previously , but this is the first time two rockets were used together .
These two flights for the ACES mission will provide insight on the structural subtleties of the aurora , finding details that researchers may have missed when previous measurements were done using only a single vehicle ( see our original article on the flights ) .
The image here shows a two - stage Black Brant IX rocket launched at 12:49 a.m. on January 29 that reached an altitude of more than 226 miles and flew for just under 10 minutes .
Dr. Bounds of the University of Iowa said the payloads of each ACES rocket performed well during flight , and the ACES team will begin to analyze all of the data collected , which should keep them busy for the next year .
Bounds said this information will help refine current models of aurora structure , and provide insight on the high - frequency waves and turbulence generated by aurorae .
Thanks to Dr. Bounds for sharing these images with Universe Today , and to Dr. Craig Heinselman the photographer .
Below is an image taken by Dr. Bounds of an aurora in 2002 , taken where the ACES flights originate at the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks , Alaska .
Bob Lutz , a vice chairman at General Motors , offers a useful example of why price matters .
When Congress demands that Detroit make smaller , lighter , better mileage vehicles , but then refuses to put a higher price on carbon  like with a gasoline tax  so more consumers will want to buy these smaller cars , said Lutz , it is the equivalent of ordering all American shirtmakers to make only size smalls while never asking the American people to go on a diet .
You ’re not going to sell a lot of size smalls .

Have no doubt :
From right - wing tea parties to coal states to manufacturers , there is going to be a no-holds - barred campaign to kill any carbon price signal , including cap and trade .
A vast army of lobbyists is already working against it .
Only President Obama can blunt this .
Only he has the platform for framing and elevating the issue properly and taking it to the American people with the passion and clarity needed to move the country .
It will take more than one speech .
Here ’s one way to start : “ My fellow Americans , I want to speak to you about a new economic law .
You ’ve heard of Moore ’s Law in information technology .
I ’d like to speak to you about the ‘ Law of More ’ in energy technology .
Americans , Indians , Chinese , Africans , we all want more  more comfort in our homes , more mobility in our lives , more technologies with which to innovate .
But there is only one way all 6.3 billion of us can have more and not make this an unlivable planet , and that is by living our lives and running our businesses in more sustainable ways and properly accounting for it .
“ Right now we ’re paying a huge price  a tax  for everyone trying to achieve more in an unsustainable way .
But the ‘ More Tax ’ is not imposed by the U.S. government .
It is a tax imposed by the market and will continue rising indefinitely as more and more people want more and more stuff .
It will steadily drive up gasoline prices , home heating prices and factory electricity prices .
But because this ‘ More Tax ’ is set by the market and not the government , many opponents contend that there ’s nothing to be done : ‘ Oh , $ 4.50 a gallon gasoline  that ’s just the market at work .
We ca n’t do anything about that . ’
And then all that tax money out of your pocket goes to enrich oil companies and petro-dictators .
“ My proposal is that today we fix a durable price on carbon - based fossil fuels , but set it to begin only in 2011 , after we ’re out of this recession .
Every home builder , air - conditioning manufacturer , gasoline refiner , carmaker will know that it ’s coming and will , I believe , immediately look for ways to profit from and invest in more energy efficient systems .
Yes , the cost of gasoline or kilowatt hours will rise in the short term .
But in the long term , your actual bills and expenses will go down because your car , appliances and factory will become steadily more productive and give you more power for less energy .
As a night owl myself , I look at those who are bright and chipper early in the morning and think " why ? "
To me , being awake and functioning before 10 am is fairly difficult to comprehend .
Even looking back on my life , I have no idea how I managed to wake up , clean up , and drive the 30 minutes into the city each day for four years in high school .
Yet others will look at me with puzzlement when I state my usual bedtime — many of my Nobel Intent contributions have come from after midnight .
A new study , carried out by a team of Belgian and Swiss researchers and published in last week 's issue of Science , looked at the underlying cause of what makes one an early bird or a night owl , and what effects this has on day - to - day life .
The study consisted of 31 participants , 16 morning people , and 15 night owls — the night owls ' days were shifted an average of four hours later than those of the early birds .
Each participant was instructed to go about their lives , sticking to their bedtime / wake routines for a week before they spent two days in a sleep lab .
Once under the more controlled conditions of the lab , researchers examined the participants ' brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) while the subjects attempted a psychomotor vigilance task — a simple reaction time test .
Each person was given two rounds of fMRIs and cognitive tests , one day in the morning ( 1.5 hours after they woke up ) and the other day in the evening ( 10.5 hours after they woke up ) .
The evening test showed statistically different measures for the two groups : night owls maintained their response times better than the early birds .
The morning test found the two results to be statistically identical .
Using the data from fMRI imaging , the cognitive testing , and a measure of the individual 's circadian phase , the researchers found that behavioral differences manifested themselves only in the evening .
Using the results from the fMRI , which allowed them to see the active areas of the subject 's brain , the authors saw differences in the locus coerulues and in a suprachiasmatic area , the regions of the brain that are known to house the circadian master clock .
They conclude that there are behavioral differences between extreme chronotypes ( morning and evening people ) .
The optimal alertness of morning people is diminished in the evening hours because there is a more pronounced negative influence due to sleep homeostasis on the areas of the brain known to control our circadian rhythms .
With a known physiological basis for this phenomena , I need to send a copy to my bosses for the next time they give me a hard time for not showing up at the office at the crack of dawn .

Without naming BlackRock , federal auditors have warned that any private parties that purchase distressed assets on the government ’s behalf could use generous federal subsidies to overpay , artificially pushing up the price of similar assets that they manage for their own portfolios .
“ In other words , the conflict results in an enormous profit for the fund manager at the expense of the taxpayer , ” Neil M. Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , wrote in a report last month .
Some of BlackRock ’s advice to the government has in fact helped the company .
For example , in its role as an informal adviser , it urged the Fed to intervene in the markets in a way that made investors feel it was safe to put money back into money market funds , including BlackRock’s .
The Federal Reserve will not reveal what it is paying BlackRock , disclosing only that on one of its five contracts , it will pay at least $ 71 million over three years to BlackRock and other firms to manage a portfolio of mortgage assets once owned by Bear Stearns .
BlackRock says that rate is discounted and that the fees it collects on bailout - related work are only a tiny portion of its overall revenue .
BlackRock has many admirers for the range and the quality of services it has provided to the federal government .
James R. Wilkinson , who served until January as the chief of staff to the former Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , described BlackRock ’s co-founder and chief executive , Laurence D. Fink , as a “ patriot . ”
He added , “ He is willing to help our country when we need it most . ”
Mr. Fink said he was proud that his company was helping pull the economy back from the brink , and he bristled at the suggestion of impropriety .
Treasury and Fed officials have begun to take precautions .
Black Rock ’s dominance has prompted the Fed to seek an alternative partner as it prepares to expand its rescue efforts , a government official close to the situation said , requesting anonymity because the actions could affect the market .
This year , Obama ’s words and actions have inspired many people to serve their country .
Every day a new article appears in the press about the surge in Peace Corps applications .
But given budget constraints and the nomination system , who gets in and who does n’t is a bit of a lottery .
And not just because the applicant rolls are swelling .
Peace Corps ’s funding has been challenged in recent years due to the falling value of the dollar and rising expenses — so fewer Volunteers are invited .
And the qualifications for Peace Corps assignments are narrowly drawn .
The net effect is that “ generalists ” — well - educated people who could learn to do many things effectively — compete against each other for fewer and fewer Volunteer positions while demand for Volunteers is growing around the world .
Peace Corps assignments each have their own very specific qualifications attached .
For any given assignment it ’s all spelled out — the degree you need , level of language proficiency in specific foreign languages , amount of time in relevant volunteer or professional experience .
The requirements are there because host countries invite Peace Corps , determine the mission of the program there , and request specific skill sets among incoming Volunteers .
In the past , if you were an accomplished college grad with varied volunteer experience and few medical complications , your chances of getting into the Peace Corps were solid and fair .
You could vie for one of a few generalist assignments — Community Development , Health Extension , or English Teaching , for example .
Once in - country you ’d be trained with all the specific skills you ’d need to complete your service effectively .
Problem is , Peace Corps wants to place all of its talented generalists in these same assignments .
That ’s because the qualifications are broad : its nominees must have a Bachelor ’s degree in any discipline , and three to six months volunteer experience .
For a Community Development assignment , you could volunteer in any field to qualify .
Or you could volunteer for three to six months in a specific field , like health — educating people about HIV / AIDS prevention , for example — to qualify for a Health Extension assignment ; or English - language education — tutoring recent immigrants in English language — to qualify for an English - teaching assignment overseas .
The reason getting an invitation to Peace Corps becomes such a problem now is the way the nomination process works .
If you are n’t familiar , it may help to know that after you apply and interview , you can get nominated to join the Peace Corps from your local recruiting office .
Then your application travels to the headquarters office in Washington , D.C. , where your placement officer considers whether you are a good program fit for a specific country assignment , and invites you .
( In the mean time you undergo a medical and dental examination to be deemed physically fit to serve in a developing country where medical care is n’t always on par with that of the United States . )
Sounds easy , right ?
Well the problem is that Peace Corps regional recruitment offices throughout the country race against each other once , quarterly to get all their applicants nominated through an online system — and because the number of applicants has far outnumbered the openings , within 15 minutes of opening the online process , one day every three months , the generalist slots all get taken up .
If generalist positions made a small percentage of Peace Corps openings , the problem would n’t be so dire .
But generalist positions make up about half of openings .
Not only that , but the generalist contribution to Peace Corps is important .
The power of the Peace Corps is that it not only provides needed technical assistance to developing countries , but it also transforms people who do n’t necessary have a lot of prior international or development experience , who may otherwise never have the opportunity to live oversesas for that length of time , and to learn another language .
If you wanted to leave for Peace Corps in the summer of 2010 , and applied in March 2009 ( the current recommended 13 months ahead of time ) , for example , you may not even make it into the online nomination system this May .
Not because of something you wrote in your application .
But simply because on nomination day , your file is sitting underneath a stack of other great applications .
By the time your recruiter reaches for your file , she sees that the generalist nomination slots have all been filled — by applicants all over the country , whose recruiters at other regional offices have also been typing furiously to get their applicants into the system .
The process does n’t reward the applicants who are the best - qualified generalists in the pool .
It ’s a numbers game , a game of speed — can your local recruiter type in all of her applicants sooner than a recruiter sitting in a Peace Corps regional recruitment office in another city ?
Unless your recruiter pulls some strings for you ( at the expense of other applicants ) , it would be a roll of the dice whether you ’d get in .
Before the recent funding woes , this same nomination system worked much better — there were enough spots available for all qualified applicants .
The new scarcity of Volunteer openings and the recent onslaught of applications has made the system impractical .
Hearing the disappointing news that you have n’t gotten nominated , you can choose to stick around and hope for better luck next quarter .
But then it might be Thanksgiving 2010 before you ship out for your assignment .
To make yourself more marketable to Peace Corps , you could also work on your Spanish ( they are looking for people with intermediate - level Spanish ) , or you could take a year of French .
And if you have made a good impression as an applicant , instead of applying as a generalist , your regional recruiter may be inspired to write something called an “ almost match ” letter of appeal on your behalf .
An “ almost match ” means that your qualifications come close to those required by another assignment , but they do n’t meet the letter of the law .
So if your degree is n’t exactly right , and your experience is n’t exactly relevant , you could compete for other assignments against other specialists , rather than all of the generalists .
Before his election , Obama called for doubling the size of the Peace Corps , which would offer more qualified U.S. citizens a chance to serve overseas in a life - changing two years , among communities who value the skills the Volunteers bring with them .
He and Michelle Obama have inspired countless Americans of all ages to serve locally and abroad .
What ’s sad is that for many people ready to enter the Peace Corps application pipeline , that opportunity ’s just not going to be there .
And his budget , sadly , does n’t do anything to change that .
So as to avoid ending on such a sad note , let ’s say you could make it into the online nominating system .
You ’d still be competing with all the other nominees for even fewer invitation slots since more people are nominated than can be invited .
While waiting for your invitation to come through , it behooves you to keep volunteering and practicing your foreign language skills so , when you check in with your placement officer at Peace Corps headquarters in Washington , you can let them know you ’ve been working hard and deserve to serve your country as a Peace Corps Volunteer .
If you can show you ’ve been working harder than the other nominees , you might just have a chance of squeaking in .
If you are considering applying to Peace Corps , do n’t let the complications detailed here prevent you from trying .
Contact your local recruiting office and talk with a recruiter about your specific skill sets .
Ask the recruiter to recommend what you need to do to make yourself more competitive .
Recruiters are genuinely willing to provide that kind of personalized attention .
The phone number to reach all Peace Corps offices is 800- 424-8580 — follow the instructions to dial through to your regional office .
Peace Corps is a two - year international service experience for U.S. citizens and one of the best opportunities the U.S. government offers its citizens .
Assignments vary widely .
Volunteers earn a living allowance and receive comprehensive medical care , technical and language training , and two - way air travel .

I enjoy reading The Economist because most of the time it offers a dispassionate view of American politics .
This article on the Obama haters speaks for itself .
BY MOST people ’s standards Barack Obama has had an excellent week .
He enjoyed a counter - Carter moment when navy commandos rescued an American hostage , leaving three kidnappers dead .
He gave a measured speech on the economy .
And , to cap it all , he gave his daughters a Portuguese water dog named “ Bo ” .
What ’s not to like ?
Plenty , according to some people .
Mr Obama may be widely admired both at home and abroad .
But there are millions of Americans who do not like the cut of his jib — and a few whose dislike boils over into white - hot hatred .
The American Spectator , which came of age demonising the Clintons , has run an article on its website on Mr Obama entitled “ Il Duce , Redux ? ”
The internet crackles with comparisons between Mr Obama and various dictators ( Hitler , Stalin and Mussolini ) or assorted psychotics ( Charles Manson and David Koresh ) .
When Jonah Goldberg , a conservative pundit , praised Mr Obama over the dispatching of the Somali pirates , his e-mail inbox immediately overflowed , he said , with “ snark and bile ” .
A recent Pew poll showed that public opinion about Mr Obama is sharply divided along party lines .
Some 88 % of Democrats approve of the job that he is doing compared with only 27 % of Republicans .
The approval gap between the two parties is actually bigger than it was for George Bush in April 2001 .
Bush loyalists , led by Karl Rove , have duly over - interpreted this poll in order to soften their former boss ’s reputation as America ’s most divisive president .
Today ’s Republican base is significantly smaller than the Democratic base was in 2001 , so surviving Republicans are more likely to have hard - core views .
But there are nevertheless enough people out there who dislike the president to constitute a significant force in political life .
As The Economist went to press , the bestselling book in the United States was Mark Levin ’s “ Liberty and Tyranny ” .
Mr Levin frequently denounces Mr Obama on his radio show as an exponent of the second of those two qualities .
The new sensation in the world of cable is Fox News ’s Glenn Beck , who has already attracted 2.2 m regular viewers since his show was launched in January .
Mr Beck recently apologised to his viewers for saying that Mr Obama ’s America is on the path to “ socialism ” when it is really on the march to fascism .
Media Matters , a left - wing organisation that monitors the media , reports that , since the inauguration , “ there have been over 3,000 references to socialism , fascism or communism ” in describing the president .
Rush Limbaugh claims that he has seen an uptick in his audience since he announced that he hopes that Mr Obama fails .
He has no time for the idea that all Americans should wish their president well ( “ We are being told that we have to hope Obama succeeds , that we have to bend over , grab the ankles … because his father was black ” ) .
Mr Limbaugh is not the ankle - grabbing type .
He has also added Robert Mugabe to the list of people to whom Mr Obama can be likened .
Why are some people so angry ?
For all his emollient manner and talk of “ post partisanship ” , Mr Obama is just as much an embodiment of liberal America as Mr Bush was of conservative America — an Ivy League - educated lawyer who became a community organiser before launching a political career in one of America ’s most cosmopolitan and corrupt big cities , Chicago .
Mr Obama almost lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton because of his lack of rapport with white working - class voters .
In the general election he did worse than Michael Dukakis in the Appalachian states of Kentucky and West Virginia .
The economic crisis has transformed this cultural suspicion into a much more potent political force .
It is true that Mr Obama ’s solution to the recession — spending public money in order to stimulate demand and trying to prevent a run on the banks — is supported by most economists .
Mr Bush would have done much the same thing .
But it is nevertheless driving many Americans crazy .
April 15th — the last day on which Americans can perform the melancholy duty of filing their tax returns — saw rallies ( dubbed “ tea parties ” after the Boston one ) in every state , 500 or so in all .
The protesters , some of whom dressed in three - cornered hats and waved “ Do n’t tread on me ” flags , repeated a litany of criticisms that has been mounting since Mr Obama won the election — that he is a big government socialist ( or fascist ) who wants to take people ’s money away and crush their freedoms .
It is hard to judge so early in the game what the rise of anti-Obama sentiment means for the Obama presidency .
Bush - hatred eventually spread from a molten core of leftists to set the cultural tone of the country .
But Obama - hatred could just as easily do the opposite and brand all conservatives as a bunch of Obama - hating cranks .
What is clear is that the rapid replacement of Bush - hatred with Obama - hatred is not healthy for American politics , particularly given the president ’s dual role as leader of his party and head of state .
A majority of Republicans ( 56 % ) approved of Jimmy Carter ’s job performance in late March 1977 .
A majority of Democrats ( 55 % ) approved of Richard Nixon ’s job performance at a comparable point in his first term .
But today polarisation is almost instant , thanks in part to the growing role of non-negotiable issues such as abortion in American politics , in part to the rise of a media industry based on outrage , and in part to a cycle of tit - for - tat demonisation .
This is not only poisoning American political life .
It is making it ever harder to solve problems that require cross-party collaboration such as reforming America ’s health - care system or its pensions .
Unfortunately , the Glenn Becks of this world are more than just a joke .
In preparation for WIPO 's initiative on Exceptions & Limitations to Copyright , the US Copyright Office is currently soliciting comments on the topic of " facilitating access to copyrighted works for the blind or persons with other disabilities " .
Written comments are due next week ( April 21st , 2009 ) , and there will be a public meeting in Washington on May 18th .
EFF will be sending our own submission , as will many other IP and disability groups .
But if you 've worked on software or hardware to overcome your own visual or other disabilities , or co-operated informally ( perhaps in an open source project ) to provide wider access to content for users with disabilities , or have dealt with a publisher regarding the accessibility of texts , we 'd like to encourage you to send the copyright office your own stories — and cc : us at accessibility@eff.org .
Much of current IP law on increasing accessibility to content is concerned with exceptions for narrow conditions or traditional institutions .
For instance , the Chafee Amendment provides for free ebooks for the blind , but only through " authorized entities " — such as a dedicated government agency or non-profit organization ( e.g. Bookshare ) .
The Copyright Office 's triennial list of exemptions from the DMCA 's anti-circumvention laws includes a category for legally unlocking the DRM on ebooks — but if you do so , you are not allowed to market or share tools for removing this DRM to other disabled users .
Our experience of innovation in the digital world and its clash with existing IP law is that many overlooked examples come from individual technologists " scratching their personal itch " , as well as loosely - organized groups .
If DMCA 's anti-circumvention laws ( and ebook DRM ) have prevented you as an individual , for example , from format - shifting content to a form usable by assistive technology , or even changed the font size of an ebook to a readable level , please send your story .
Unexpected applications of new technology are important to raise too : if you are deaf , and wish to benefit from the possibility of " signing books " ( many who are deaf from birth have difficulties with learning to read , and benefit from visual hand - signs in the same way that the visually - impaired benefit from simultaneous text - to - speech ) , write in .
As the Register of Copyrights noted when considering the anti-circumvention exemption for ebooks , the transition of media to the digital world
perhaps for the first time offer an individual blind person the possibility of " self - help " in making a copy of a literary work perceptible .
We want to make sure that the Copyright Office hears from everyone who is helping themselves , and yet finds their way thwarted by clumsy law or unnecessary technological restrictions .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION :
Background
The United States is a Member State of the World Intellectual
Property Organization ( WIPO ) and an active member of the Standing
Committee on Copyright and Related Rights ( SCCR ) .
At recent meetings of
the SCCR , WIPO facilitated discussions on the topic of copyright
limitations and exceptions , including limitations and exceptions for
``blind , visually impaired and other reading - disabled persons . ' ' \ 2 \
At
its next meeting ( May 25 - 29 , 2009 ) , the SCCR will continue to consider
this topic , among others , and will exchange information and experiences
in order to deepen its collective understanding of the issues .
As part
of the process , the SCCR is looking to the copyright limitations and
exceptions that are currently available for the benefit of the blind ,
visually impaired and other reading - disabled persons around the world ,
and has invited Member States to provide supplementary information
regarding their national laws and experiences .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ 2 \ This term appears in some relevant WIPO documents .
See e.g .
``Conclusions of the SCCR , '' November 5 - 7 , 2008 , at http://
www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_17/sccr_17_www_
112533.pdf ( last visited on March 20 , 2009 ) .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In preparation for the meeting , the Copyright Office and the USPTO
have been gathering relevant information .
To date , the Copyright Office
and USPTO have participated in a series of informal meetings and
conference calls ( primarily with stakeholders from the blind community ,
but also with representatives of the library , book publishing ,
software , motion picture , and nonprofit sectors ) in which multiple
specific issues have been identified and a number of common points have
emerged .
On the basis of these preliminary discussions , the Copyright Office
and the USPTO understand that blind and other persons with disabilities
in the United States navigate many complex challenges when it comes to
accessing copyrighted works .
Common refrains include delays in
obtaining accessible texts ( with timeliness of accessible materials a
particular problem for students at all levels ) , compatibility problems
between available formats and the hardware devices employed by the
reader , and inconsistencies in the quality and accuracy of the
available , reformatted works .
At the international level , the Copyright
Office and the USPTO were made aware of the existing framework through
which accessible works move across borders ( i.e. through private
agreement and interlibrary
[ [ Page 13269 ] ]
programs ) , as well as some of the difficulties the framework presents .
Possible Actions
Through discussions with stakeholders and previous meetings of the
SCCR , the Copyright Office and USPTO are aware of some measures that
might be appropriate for action at the national or international levels
( through Member States , WIPO or other mechanisms ) .
Such possible
actions include the following : ( 1 ) Developing standardized
accessibility formats and other technical norms ; ( 2 ) establishing
trusted intermediaries to coordinate resources , eliminate unnecessary
duplication of accessible works , and ensure best practices ; ( 3 )
providing technical assistance , coordination , and educational outreach ;
( 4 ) promoting market - based solutions achieved through private sector
copyright licenses or other agreements ; and ( 5 ) developing binding or
non-binding international instruments , including a treaty that would
establish minimum requirements for limitations and exceptions for
blind , visually impaired and other reading - disabled persons .
The
Copyright Office and the USPTO are interested in learning how these
areas of focus might address existing difficulties with access to
copyright works , whether applied alone or in combination with each
other .
Suggestions as to measures not covered above are also welcome .
Please note that WIPO posts various documents from its meetings on
its Web site , including reports and agendas related to the
consideration of copyright limitations and exceptions .
Documents from
SCCR meetings that included consideration of this issue can be found by
starting at http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/topic.jsp?group_id=62
and
following the link to information for each specific meeting .
A study on
copyright limitations and exceptions for the visually impaired can be
found at http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_
id=75696 .
Subjects of Inquiry
At this time , in order to allow further opportunity for interested
persons to provide their views , the Copyright Office and the USPTO are
seeking comment on several focused topics related to the provision of
access to copyrighted works for blind and other persons with
disabilities .
Unless otherwise specified , the focus of the inquiry is
the experiences of interested parties residing or doing business in the
United States .
Nevertheless , parties should not feel constrained from
describing transnational experiences and situations if they are
illustrative of a problem or success .
A. Experiences of Persons Within the United States With Respect To
Accessing U.S. Works or Sharing Accessible Copies Within the United
States
In general , the Copyright Office and the USPTO seek to learn more
about the experiences of the blind or persons with other disabilities
with respect to accessing and sharing U.S. copyrighted works within the
United States .
Please reference any specific policies , practices and
projects that exist or are emerging in the education , library and
business sectors while considering the questions set forth below .
1. Applicable Statutory or Regulatory Provisions : The United States
has relevant existing limitations on exclusive rights in the Copyright
Act. Section 121 ( the so - called ``Chafee Amendment ' ' ) authorizes the
reproduction of copyrighted works for blind or other persons with
disabilities under certain circumstances .
Section 121 ( a ) contains
general language providing that it is not copyright infringement ``for
an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or
phonorecords of a previously published , nondramatic literary work if
such copies or phonorecords are produced or distributed in specialized
formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with
disabilities .'' Section 121 ( c ) provides a specific limitation
applicable to publishers of ``print instructional materials for use in
elementary or secondary schools '' so that they may create and
distribute electronic files consistent with the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) .
17 U.S.C. 21 ( c ) .
Those electronic
files must use the National Instructional Material Accessibility
Standard ( NIMAS ) .
Id .
How have the Chafee Amendment and related
statutory and regulatory provisions worked in practice ?
2. Private Sector Initiatives : The Copyright Office and the USPTO
are aware that book publishers have been involved in the development
and implementation of Section 121 and other laws applicable to
disabilities and education .
What are additional ways in which the
private sector facilitates , or plans to facilitate , access to
copyrighted works ?
Please identify and describe in detail any existing
business models , licensing schemes , or technological innovations that
are relevant , not only for books but for other copyrighted works , e.g. ,
magazines , newspapers , motion pictures , and software .
To date , what has
been the result of these efforts in terms of achieving accessible
content ?
Do best practices exist ?
Turning to the nonprofit sector , what
are the activities , business models , or technology platforms that have
emerged and what has been the result to date ?
What if any are the
additional projects under consideration ?
3. Library Programs : Libraries play an important role in providing
access to copyrighted works for the blind or persons with other
disabilities .
The Library of Congress , through its National Library
Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped , provides Braille and
audio materials ( e.g. , talking books ) to eligible borrowers through
cooperating libraries in the United States .
NLS also provides
interlibrary loan services to citizens of other countries through
qualified libraries or other institutions in those countries .
Private
organizations , such as Bookshare , provide access to digital materials
through an online searchable library .
What other sorts of libraries or
library services currently facilitate access to copyrighted works ?
What
physical and digital delivery methods are being used ?
What initiatives
have libraries taken to develop new services and to respond to evolving
needs and technologies ?
What coordination exists among national and
international library services ?
4. Standardized Formats , Programs and Devices :
In recent years ,
entrepreneurs and other representatives of the blind or persons with
other disabilities have made significant progress in efforts to upgrade
and standardize the technical formats , programs and devices that allow
access to books and other text .
These include the talking - book format
of DAISY ( Digital Accessible Information System ) that is compatible
with screen readers , as well as stationary and portable DAISY players
that feature synthetic - voices , and various versions of scan- and - read
software .
Paper - based Braille has evolved into digital formats that
offer refreshable displays and nonlinear search capabilities when used
with applicable devices .
Are there additional innovations in use or
under development today and , if so , what is their focus ?
What are the
impediments , and possible solutions , for improving existing
standardized formats , programs and devices , developing new ones , and / or
facilitating their interoperability ?
5. Resources :
To what degree is a lack of sufficient resources a
factor in providing access to the blind or persons with other
disabilities ?
What governmental , private sector , nonprofit , or
philanthropic resources exist ?
What types of resources are most needed ?
[ [ Page 13270 ] ]
What approaches to expanding available resources are most promising ?
What objectives could be met and in what time frame if additional
resources were available ?
B. Experiences of Persons Within the United States With Respect To
Accessing Foreign Works or Sharing Accessible Copies of U.S. Works With
Foreign Persons
Please comment on the experiences of the blind or persons with
other disabilities with respect to accessing foreign works within the
United States , or sharing accessible copies of U.S. works with
similarly - situated persons outside the United States .
What kinds of
specific policies , practices and projects exist or are emerging in the
education , library and business sectors ?
How do existing laws create
incentives or constrain efforts ?
Please describe the ways in which
technology has influenced or could assist in providing access to
foreign works or the sharing of accessible copies .
What are the legal
or practical impediments to transnational access and how are they
interrelated ?
C. Other Comments on Facilitating and Enhancing Access to Copyrighted
Works
Please comment on the likely success of measures identified above
under the subsection entitled ``Possible Actions '' under SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION .
How might the measures best be leveraged , alone or in
combination , to enhance access for the blind or other persons with
disabilities ?
Are there additional governmental or private sector
actions that might serve the objective of enhancing access to
copyrighted works for the blind or persons with other disabilities ?

BILLING CODE 1410-30 - P
Oxford scientists have discovered a type of parasite that infects rats and which , instead of hurting them directly , controls their mind making them fearless of cats and thus increasing their probability of being eaten .
The same parasite lives inside half of the human population .
The scientists wonder what influence it has on the human mind .
The parasite , called Toxoplasma , influences the rats because , as part of its life cycle , it needs to get into the gut of a cat .
It lays out eggs that get eaten by rats and other animals which often end up eaten by cats .
However , as cats do n't eat dead animals , the parasite has to deliver its host alive .
In order to do this it influences its host 's mind by producing blood cysts inside their brains .
Researchers have found that healthy rats have the ability of detecting the smell of cat urine and carefully avoid areas depicting such traces .
They are so careful and sensitive to such odors that scientists often use cat 's urine to test rats ' panic reactions .
On the other hand , infected rodents not only that do n't exhibit this negative reaction , but they are actually seeking those areas where the smell of cat 's urine is prevalent .
The parasite is literally controlling their mind and pushing them into the cat 's jaws .
This obviously does n't benefit the rodent in any way but benefits the parasite which is seeking to get into the cat 's gut .
This is a dramatic example of how a creature can exhibit a spectacular intentional behavior without even having a nervous system - and thus it 's obviously not aware of its own purposes .
But scientists wonder , if this parasite does such a thing to a mouse 's mind , what is its effect on humans ?
There is no definite answer to this question yet .
However , Dr. E. Fuller Torrey from the Stanley Medical Research Institute has noticed certain connections between the presence of the Toxoplasma parasite in humans and schizophrenia .
Doctors have found that schizophrenics have damaged glial cells ( which surround and support neurons ) ; taxoplasma is also associated ( although the cause - and - effect relation is not definitely proven ) with the presence of such damaged cells .
Moreover , scientists found that infected rats which were administered certain antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia , regained their fear of urine cat .
Thus , the effect of taxoplasma on humans might be to increase the probability of schizophrenia .
These parasites are not the only such mind - controlling creatures out there .
For example , there are certain microscopic parasites acting on insects : Dicrocoelium dendriticum controls its ant host to stay on the tips of grass baldes thus increasing its probability of being eaten by a ruminant animal , as the parasite needs to get into the gut of such an animal to complete its life cycle .
Trichastrongylidae sp. , a worm that lives inside grasshoppers , drives their hosts to jump into water pools ( and thus drown ) because its life cycle continues in the aquatic environment .
There are also some parasites specialized in controlling the minds of fish : Euhaplorchis californiensis causes its host to swim near the water surface in a shaky manner and even to jump above the surface so they could be more easily spotted and preyed upon by birds - inside which the parasite continues its life cycle .
Evolution can be quite scary sometimes !
