LONDON | David Axelrod could not have scripted a better week for his candidate .
Sen .
Barack Obama was pressured by his Republican rival to visit two war zones , and he traveled to eight countries amid fears he would make some crippling foreign - policy gaffe .
Instead , European leaders fawned over the Democratic presidential candidate , who was greeted by excited fans everywhere and attracted record crowds in Berlin .
He got an added boost from key Iraqi officials and even his opponent as they embraced a timetable for troop withdrawal .
There were few errors or dust - ups over the nine - day trip as Sen.
John McCain and Republican operatives back home hammered Mr. Obama for seeming to take a “ premature victory lap . ”
“ It is hard for me to understand Senator McCain ’s argument .
He was telling me I was supposed to take this trip , ” Mr. Obama told reporters during a press conference Saturday in front of 10 Downing Street after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
The Democrat said “ we had it planned ” before his rival made the trip suggestion , and noted that Mr. McCain , since wrapping up his party nomination in February , has visited “ every one of these countries … that I have , ” and also has given speeches in Canada , Colombia and Mexico .
“ It does n’t strike me that we have done anything different than the McCain campaign has done , which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president , commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies , ” he said .
The Arizona senator complained in his weekly radio address about all the press attention Mr. Obama received - a week of multiple network - anchor interviews that ends with his taped “ Meet the Press ” appearance Sunday .
“ This week , the presidential contest was a long - distance affair , with my opponent touring various continents and arriving yesterday in Paris , ” Mr. McCain said , rattling off the places where he campaigned in the meantime : Maine , upstate New York , New Hampshire , Maryland , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Colorado .
“ With all the breathless coverage from abroad , and with Senator Obama now addressing his speeches to ‘ the people of the world , ’ I ’m starting to feel a little left out .
Maybe you are , too , ” he said .
While the McCain radio address criticized Mr. Obama for being in France , Mr. McCain suggested at the same time that the French could be a model of energy independence for the United States to emulate and implicitly slammed Mr. Obama for his unease with expanding U.S. use of nuclear power .
“ I wonder if he noticed while he was in France that they draw 80 percent of their electricity from nuclear energy , ” he said .
“ Nations from Europe to Asia are expanding their use of this clean , proven and stable source of energy . ”
The Saturday morning press availability and meetings were Mr. Obama ’s last duties before heading back across the Atlantic after a trip filled with flattering footage that Mr. Axelrod , a chief Obama adviser , would not rule out using in some campaign commercials before the Nov. 4 election .
The British tabloids and TV stations mocked his visit - and the hundreds of thousands who attended the Berlin speech Thursday evening - as suffering from “ Obamania , ” but that did n’t stop them from joining in .
“ Can we get a wave ? ” photographers shouted at the senator from Illinois as they clicked their shutters hundreds of times for the perfect shot .
A German tabloid reporter wrote an exclamation - point laden story about how her heart pounded when Mr. Obama happened to be pumping iron in her hotel gym in Berlin - something McCain operatives mocked in their daily update e-mail .
Mr. Obama - who retains a slim national lead over Mr. McCain while some battleground states are tightening - said he would not be surprised if more than a week away from the United States might spark “ a little bit of a dip ” in the polls .
“ I am not sure that there is going to be some immediate political impact ” to the trip , he said .
“ People are worried about gas prices and home foreclosures . ”
But he said the trip was important to ensure the U.S. has strong partners abroad and “ to highlight or amplify how the international situation affects our economy back home . ”
“ Also hopefully to give people at home , but also leaders abroad , some sense of where an Obama administration might take our foreign policy , ” he said .
Before leaving London on Saturday , Mr. Obama held private meetings with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and with David Cameron , the leader of the opposition Conservative Party , who aims to fill Mr. Brown ’s shoes .
Mr. Cameron told reporters Mr. Obama could win an election in Britain : “ Oh , I think he would probably beat me . ”
The pool reporters present for the beginning of the private meeting to take photos heard a telling exchange between the two men .
“ You need to be able to keep your head together , ” Mr. Cameron said , asking if the candidate would get any rest soon .
Mr. Obama responded he’d be taking a week of vacation next month and said a former Clinton official recommended that if elected , “ the most important thing you need to do is to have big chunks of time during the day when all you ’re doing is thinking . ”
If you do n’t do that , “ you start making mistakes , or you lose the big picture , ” Mr. Obama said .
Mr. Cameron agreed , “ That is exactly what politics is all about .
The judgment you bring to make decisions . ”
“ That ’s exactly right .
And the truth is that we ’ve got a bunch of smart people , I think , who know 10 times more than we do about the specifics of the topic , and so if what you ’re trying to do is micromanage and solve everything , then you end up being a dilettante , but you have to have enough knowledge to make good judgments about the choices that are presented to you , ” Mr. Obama said .
There was no time for quiet moments over the past week , as Mr. Obama and a cadre of advisers and a plane full of press hopped around countries and got little sleep .
He began the trip with a private congressional delegation to Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan , and then held meetings with leaders in Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and Britain .
At each he discussed global challenges such as international business markets , terrorism , loose nuclear weapons and climate change .
He also talked about the delicate situation in Israel , meeting with officials from both sides of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
This was the riskiest portion of his trip , and he seemed to navigate the waters with success and without causing any controversy .
In Berlin , Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Democrat ’s speech there was a “ positive signal ” for Europe and also joked she “ would n’t resist ” a back rub from the Democrat should he win the election , a nod to one she received from President Bush .
He won warm reviews abroad for a speech to more than 200,000 people at Berlin ’s Victory Column , where he called for renewed international partnership .
An Internet - organized group aggressively questioned the intentions of the Berlin crowd , since two live bands offered entertainment before the speech , but the Obama team had not advertised any music , and the crowd remained after the music concluded to hear him speak .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy demonstrated overt affection for the Democratic candidate and said he was popular in his country .
But the week ’s best development for the Obama campaign came from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , who told a German magazine just before the candidate ’s Iraq visit that he liked the 16 - month withdrawal timetable proposed by the Democrat .
His office later tried to pull back from the comments , saying the translation was wrong , but newspapers obtained the audiotape and confirmed his statement was clear .
Other foreign leaders have been expressing support for a timeline , and the White House and Iraqi leaders recently agreed on a more general “ time horizon ” for bringing troops home .
Democrats gleefully sent reporters a Friday CNN transcript where Mr. McCain - while outlining the importance of conditions on the ground - said “ I think it ’s a pretty good timetable . ”
He caught himself and used the administration ’s term of “ horizons ” for withdrawal , rather than a “ timetable . ”
“ This success is … incredibly impressive , but very fragile , ” he said .
“ If we reverse this , by setting a date for withdrawal , all of the hard - won victory can be reversed . ”
Mr. Obama said Saturday that he was “ pleased ” to see support from Mr. McCain and Iraqi officials for a timetable , and said it is “ a good thing ” Mr. McCain agrees with him that more troops are needed in Afghanistan .
“ The point I have made throughout the course of this trip is that a lot of these foreign - policy issues have been seen through a prism of politics and ideology for too long , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Part of the reason I think you are seeing some convergence is that reality is asserting itself .
And you ca n’t argue with facts . ”
Mr. McCain , meanwhile , pushed his line that Mr. Obama has flip - flopped from opposing the surge of troops to Iraq to now saying it helped reduce violence there .
Pressed by a British reporter to weigh in with advice for Mr. Brown ’s political troubles , Mr. Obama demurred and offered a glimpse of his amusement of the constant ups and downs in the campaign cycle .
“ I will tell you that you ’re always more popular before you ’re actually in charge of things .
And then , you know , once you ’re responsible , then you are going to make some people unhappy , and that ’s just the nature of politics , ” he said with a wide grin .
“ Even during the course of this campaign , there have been months where I am a genius , and there are months where I am an idiot . ”

In post -9/11 America , the exercise of free speech is relegated to government mandated " free speech zones " and to insist the whole of the country is a free speech zone casts one in dark suspicion along with the likes Osama and the manufactured enemies of America .
9/11 Chronicles : Part One , Truth Rising is a testament to free speech , an endangered commodity in post September 11 , 2001 America .
Alex Jones ’ latest documentary is a vivid testament standing in complete and defiant opposition to former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer ’s admonishment that “ nowadays you have to be careful what you say and do , ” as if the orchestrated events of that horrible day have nullified the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
In Jones ’ latest documentary , filmed in cinéma - vérité style — an appropriate technique , as the phrase translates from the French as “ cinema of truth ” — we witness repeated instances of police insisting the First Amendment is a dead letter and citizens no longer have the right to speak their minds in public , especially citizens going up against the imposed political orthodoxy and Fleischer ’s counsel .
We Are Change activist Luke Rudkowski at Ground Zero .
Truth Rising also reveals that it is not only New York City ’s militarized police who believe the First Amendment is moribund , but many citizens do as well .
“ You ai n’t American , ” insists one such fine specimen at Ground Zero , angry over the possibility that somebody would actually dare contest the official version of events and ask questions and demand answers .
Others fling mindless and obscene epithets and swipe at the camera , as if incapable of tolerating , let alone understanding and respecting the First Amendment , an absolute freedom that occupies a preferred position in the pantheon of our liberties .
In post -9/11 America , the exercise of free speech is relegated to government mandated “ free speech zones ” and to insist the whole of the country is a free speech zone casts one in dark suspicion along with the likes Osama and the manufactured enemies of America .
Ari Fleischer ’s warning is particularly injurious when it comes to the families of 9/11 victims and first responders , the latter consistently ignored , especially by the corporate media .
In Truth Rising , first responder and former Iraq war vet David Miller , who is now reduced to toting around a respirator after his exposure to the toxicity of Ground Zero , takes the corporate media to task , rightfully characterizing this corporate cabal as “ propagandists , ” and “ professional lairs and tools who cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered journalists . ”
Miller , We Are Change , and unnumbered and mostly anonymous others have stepped forward to fill the imposed void of this deplorable corporate media silence — a deliberate suppression at the hands of their elitist taskmasters — with an indefatigable call not only for answers , but a demand that justice be delivered to the victims .
9/11 activist , former Iraq vet , and stricken first responder David Miller .
Manny Badillo , a 9/11 victim family member , reminds us in Truth Rising that “ 70 % of family members ’ questions were never answered during the 9/11 commission report .
What if one of our family members were murdered , would we be okay with 70 % of their questions never being answered during any trial ?
There still has never been a trial for those who have died , there still has been nobody held accountable . ”
The 9/11 Chronicles demands those who killed 2,819 innocents , including well over 300 first responders , be called out and brought to justice .
It is an effort to bring needed attention to the surviving first responders who are sick and dying in alarming numbers .
It is an urgently needed effort to counter the disparaging propaganda of the corporate media — in particular but hardly limited to Hearst Corporation ’s Popular Mechanics and its unscrupulous scheme to undermine the movement – a propagandistic media tasked with viciously mischaracterizing and slandering 9/11 truth activists as nothing short of crackpots and lunatics .
Truth Rising is an answer to dismissive accusations .
It documents a growing movement the corporate media refuses to cover without bias and detraction .
If you want to respond to these accusations , get 9/11 Chronicles : Part One , Truth Rising , and make copies , hand them out to your family , friends , and strangers on the street .
Alex Jones , Luke Rudkowski , and many others featured in this documentary are patriots and heroes , not fruitcakes and traitors , as the corporate media insists at the behest of the government .
Globalists and neocons within the government are afraid of the sort of truth so effectively presented in the 9/11 Chronicles .
They are desperate to make sure the people never know the truth .
“ How dare you ” respond to lies and false history and deliver the light of truth to the darkness of criminal mendacity , rebuked Bill Clinton in Truth Rising when confronted by We Are Change .
How dare you respond to one of the largest and most outrageous lies of American history ?
Clinton ’s response is evidence proof positive our rulers are afraid of the truth finally finding the light of day .
In Jones ’ film , Rockefeller minion Zbigniew Brzezinski demands truth “ sit down and shut up , ” but it is too late now for that .
Truth is on the street .
It will not be silenced and 9/11 Chronicles : Part One , Truth Rising will make sure it spreads far and wide .

The Cross in the Sand
April 's Lowdown
Harry Truman said , " No man should be allowed to be president who does n't understand hogs . "
That 's never been more true than it will be for the man or woman who walks into the White House on January 20 , 2009 .
If you 've ever entered an enclosed , industrialized hog facility where hundreds of fattening porcines live out their short lives , you know that the smell of pig excrement completely redefines " stink . "
This stench will knock you to your knees , sear your lungs and brain , and make you scream for mercy .
For nearly eight years , the White House has been a confined hog pen for corporate porkers , right - wing ideologues , imperialists , autocrats , and other swinish mess - makers .
America 's next president must not only set a new direction but will also have to clean up the mess and eradicate the stink left by the Bushites .
To help presidential contenders , congressional candidates and the rest of us get perspective on the odiferous legacy of the Bush - Cheney regime , the Lowdown is presenting a two - part factual accounting of the administration 's achievements since 2001 .
This issue will feature Bush 's domestic performance , and the May issue will highlight his international agenda .
Hold your nose -- and get out your scrubbers .
The 3 biggest hits to the economy
Bush 's tax cuts for the rich have reduced annual tax revenue available for public needs by $ 300 billion each year .
BushCheney 's occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq has cost $ 700 billion , according to the Congressional Research Service .
That 's about $ 400 million a day .
Nobel Prizewinning economist Joseph Stiglitz says the tab is well over $ 2 trillion when you add rehabilitation for injured vets , replacement of military hardware , and the value of things we could have produced ( but did n't ) with that money over the past seven years .
Bushites have finished off the deregulation of banking that began in earnest during Bill Clinton 's presidency .
This ideological madness has caused the collapse of investment funds , banks , and the stock value of corporations that depend on them ( which is to say most of Wall Street and much of the financial world ) , as well as a steep decline in the value of most homes in America and a sharp rise in the cost of living in them .

While military spending has grown 7.5 % since Bush took office , spending on almost all domestic discretionary programs has been cut .
" Discretionary " means that Congress and the administration can decide , year by year , how much each program deserves .
Under BushCheney , that means less of anything that serves the common good , like ( in order of size ) education , highways and other ground transportation , housing assistance , biomedical research , federal law enforcement , public - health services , regulation of air traffic , and space flight .
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has tracked federal spending over the course of BushCheney 's reign of error and concludes that almost all of these programs have shrunk when measured in relation to the growth of the economy as a whole .
The Center reports that outlays to mandated federal programs -- Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid - - have declined 2.4 % , while discretionary programs have been cut by 3.7 % .

It would be the most audacious and technologically challenging space mission since the Apollo programme landed Neil Armstrong and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin on the moon in 1969 .
An international team of scientists has put together detailed plans for a mission to bring back samples of rock , and possibly microscopic life , from the surface of Mars .
To be successful the mission , which is proposed for launch between 2018 and 2023 and could cost up to $ 8bn , would require expertise and funding from both Nasa and the European Space Agency , as well as other national space agencies .
" This is going to be extremely expensive and no one space agency can afford it , " said Professor Monica Grady , at the Open University , who co-chaired the expert panel that wrote the mission proposal .
She said it was a vital next step before a possible crewed mission to the Red Planet .
" If you can't bring a rock back you are not going to be able to bring people back .
There 's a real feeling that bringing samples back from Mars is absolutely essential if we are going to continue our Martian exploration programme . "
Sending people to Mars will probably not be possible before 2050 , but if a crewed mission were ever to go ahead scientists and engineers would need to demonstrate that it is possible to land a craft on the surface of Mars and bring it back to Earth safely .
There have been seven successful landings on the Red Planet since the US spacecraft Mariner 4 flew past Mars for the first time in 1965 , but no lander has ever taken off from the surface again or brought anything back to Earth .
The mission proposal is the result of an eight - month study by 31 scientists from around the world .
Grady and her colleagues presented it to delegates at a conference of the International Mars Exploration Working Group ( IMEWG ) in Paris last week .
The group is made up of delegates from national space agencies and puts together plans for future missions .
The heads of both Nasa and the ESA have received copies and the two agencies will decide in November whether to fund the mission 's next planning stage .
To hit the proposed timescale , technology development for the mission will need to begin by 2011 .
Professor Colin Pillinger , at the Open University , who led Britain 's unsuccessful Beagle II mission to Mars in 2003 , said returning samples from the Red Planet would allow scientists to carry out much more sophisticated analyses on the rocks and permit a more detailed search for simple Martian life forms .
" Everybody knows this is what you have got to do if you want to really get to the bottom of Mars , " he said .
But he said avoiding contamination would be extremely difficult .
" There 's a big caveat when you start playing with Mars , and that 's planetary protection .
You have to be very careful not to bring anything back that might be harmful to Earth , " he said .
" Your mission has to be guaranteed , and I really mean guaranteed , to get into the Earth 's atmosphere without damaging itself . "
If Martian microbes do exist they must be extremely hardy , having survived the planet 's freezing , desiccating surface and bombardment with UV radiation , so if the returning spacecraft blew up on re-entry scientists could not be sure that Martian life forms on board would be destroyed in the blast .
It would also be impossible to know what they would do to life on Earth .
Although samples have been returned successfully from space by robotic vehicles , the first attempt to bring samples from beyond the moon ended disastrously .
The Genesis probe , which carried particles collected from the solar wind , crash landed in the Utah desert in September 2004 .
The mission would involve the launch of two separate craft from Earth - a " lander composite " and an " orbiter composite " .
Both would make the trip to Mars , where the lander would touch down on the surface .
It would then release a rover which would collect a variety of rock samples totalling around half a kilogram .
It would bring these back to the lander , where the rocks , plus a sample of Martian atmosphere , would be encased in a sealed pod within the so - called Mars Ascent Vehicle - part of the lander composite .
This would then blast off from the surface and dock with the orbiter before transferring its precious cargo .
The orbiter would then return to Earth , enter the atmosphere and land .
At this point , scientists would rush in and transfer the samples to a top - level biosecurity lab , where they would be analysed for any possible signs of life .
Scientists have long fantasised about the possibility of bringing back rocks from the Red Planet .
But the backing of IMEWG is a significant boost for the current plan .
They have also been emboldened by the success of several recent missions to Mars , including Nasa 's Phoenix lander , which touched down in May .
If the mission is to get off the ground , though , it will need strong political backing both in Europe and from the incoming US president , said Pillinger .
Martian chronicles : Previous missions
After a string of failures in the early 1960s by both the Soviet Union and the US , Mariner 4 in July 1965 became the first spacecraft to fly past Mars and send back images .
Following other successful flybys , Nasa orbited Mars in November 1971 for the first time with Mariner 9 .
The orbiter mapped 80 % of the planet 's surface by taking 7,329 images .
The Soviet Mars 3 mission was the first to successfully land on the planet in December 1971 .
It was severely damaged in a Martian dust storm , though , and sent back just 20 seconds of data .
Nasa 's two Viking missions , which arrived at the Red Planet in 1976 , landed successfully and transmitted more than 50,000 images .
Nasa 's Mars Pathfinder mission , pictured , which touched down in July 1997 , was the first successful rover to probe the planet .
The European Space Agency 's Mars Express mission reached Mars in December 2003 and is still operational .
But its cargo , the British - led Beagle II lander , crashed on Christmas Day 2003 and failed to send back any data .
Nasa 's successful Spirit and Opportunity rovers arrived on Mars in January 2004 and are still operating .
The latest lander , Nasa 's Phoenix mission , touched down in May this year .
Open Source Platforms Arrive On IBM's Most Vulnerable List
by Ostatic Staff - Jul. 31 , 2008
IBM Internet Security Systems is out with its X - Force 2008 Mid-Year Trend Statistics report .
This is an extremely exhaustive look at security vulnerabilities in both proprietary and open source software .
It highlights trends in malware and phishing , and ranks vendors , open source projects , and even languages by security breach disclosures .
With the rise of open source software , including much more adoption in enterprises , it 's no surprise to see some open source platforms arrive on the top ten most vulnerable list , including one in second place , sandwiched between Apple and Microsoft .
Which open source projects qualified -- for the first time ?
The IBM study used a new standard to classify vulnerabilities by vendor and project this year : CPE , or Common Platform Enumeration .
According to the study 's authors :
" This new methodology plus some changes in the vulnerability
landscape has brought some newcomers to our top ten list : Joomla ! , an open - source content management system for web sites , " ... and ... " Drupal , another open - source content management system for web sites . "
WordPress , by the way , is also on the top ten list for the first time .
" An obvious trend demonstrated by the appearance of these vendors on the top ten list is the increasing prevalence of web - related vulnerabilities , " say the study 's authors .
In other words , hackers and phishers have their eyes on web - based targets more than ever before , so it follows that popular content management systems would pop up .
Then there 's this nugget :
" Another commonality between these three vendors is that they are all written in PHP .
If we look back over last year ’s disclosures and apply the new CPE methodology to them , we would uncover another newcomer to the top five list , PHP itself , which would rank number four in the 2007 top five vendor list . "
The top ten most vulnerable vendors / projects are ranked by " disclosures , " which refers to them disclosing the largest number of security vulnerabilities .
It 's also worth noting that Linux is on the top ten list -- barely .
Here 's how the list looks , and there is more in the IBM report :
Both presidential contenders Barack Obama and John McCain have found it necessary to disavow support they 've received from pastors they 've described as " spiritual mentors . "
While Barack Obama has to continually answer for things that have been said at Trinity United , SteveAudio finds that John McCain not only has escaped the same kind of scrutiny , but has actually not hurt himself at all with the religious conservatives to whom he tried to appeal by disconnecting himself from Hagee and Parsley .
No one on the right , NO ONE , cares about Hagee , with the possible exception of a few moderate genuine conservatives , that is .
All 3 of them .
But the far - right Evangelical end - times Christians , for whom Hagee is a dog whistle the size of a Marshall stack , will still support McCain , even more now than before .
Not only is he a " true believer " by courting and wedding Hagee , but now he 's been bloodied by the secular humanists that threaten the Christian way of life .
His rejection of Hagee 's support is n't a betrayal of Hagee 's prophecy , but a tactical retreat in the face of the abortionists , school desegregationists .
and gay - marriage supporters whose defeat his administration will hopefully bring about .
And thus is a stronger hero born .
It 's a no-lose situation for McCain .
Stay beside Hagee and he appears committed to the religious right that he derided in 2000 .
Disavow Hagee and the religious right sees it as proof of their persecution at the hands of the evil secularists , and rally around their perceived martyr .

Parents Who Prayed While Child Died Charged Dale and Leilani Neumann did not get medical help for their daughter 's diabetes .
April 28 , 2008  --
The parents of an 11 - year - old Wisconsin girl who prayed instead of seeking medical help for the diabetic child are facing homicide charges in connection with her death .
Dale and Leilani Neumann were charged with second - degree reckless homicide , Marathon County District Attorney Jill Falstad announced at a press conference today .
If convicted , the couple could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison .
" It is very surprising , shocking that she was n't allowed medical intervention , " Falstad said .
Madeline Kara Neumann , who went by the name Kara , died in March at a hospital in Everest , Wis .
Her parents called 911 after she stopped breathing on Easter Sunday .
A message left by ABC News with Gene Linehan , the Neumanns ' attorney , was not immediately returned .
A spokesman for the Everest Police Department said that the district attorney made an arrangement with Linehan for the couple to make their first appearance in court Wednesday .
The Neumanns told authorities they did not call for help earlier because they believe in the power of prayer .
Dale Neumann , a former police officer , told The Associated Press at the time that he started to perform CPR on his daughter " as soon as the breath of life left . "
But the Marathon County medical examiner said the condition , which apparently was never diagnosed , was treatable and the girl 's death could have been prevented .
Kara was the youngest child of the Neumanns , who had ties to the Unleavened Bread Ministries , a little - known sect with an online presence that shuns modern medicine in favor of prayer .
Kara died of " diabetic ketoacidosis , " according to the autopsy report .
Efforts were made to revive the little girl , whose diabetes had never been diagnosed , when she stopped breathing at the house , officials said .
She was transported to Saint Clare 's Hospital in Weston , where she was pronounced dead .
Aunt Makes Call
Ironically , county officials were on the way to the Neumanns ' home the same day to perform a welfare check on the girl after the Marathon County Sheriff 's Office got a call from Kara 's aunt Ariel Gomez of California expressing concern about Kara .
Before officials reached the home , a 911 call came from the Neumann house about a medical emergency .
Gomez called the sheriff 's office three times that day about her niece 's medical condition , according to the sheriff 's office .
" My sister - in - law is , her daughter 's severely , severely sick and she believes her daughter is in a coma , " Gomez is heard telling the dispatcher in one of the 911 calls released by the sheriff 's office .
" And , she 's very religious , so she 's refusing to take [ Kara ] to the hospital , so I was hoping maybe somebody could go over there . "
Gomez asked authorities to send an ambulance and warns the dispatcher that Leilani Neumann will fight attempts to intervene .
" We 've been trying to get her to take [ Kara ] to the hospital for a week , a few days now , " Gomez told the dispatcher in one of the calls .
Gomez reportedly learned about the girl 's condition from the child 's grandmother , who told investigators the Kara 's health deteriorated over several days , according to search warrant documents .
Unleavened Bread Ministries
Though the Neumanns are not official members of the Unleavened Bread Ministries , a statement posted on the organization 's Web site by the founder , David Eells , after the death , said the Neumanns " contacted one of our elders to ask that I call them to pray for their daughter .
That elder got in touch with me Saturday evening and I called the Neumanns . "
Eells also wrote that the Neumanns have posted testimonials on their Web site but are not " ' under ' our ministry . "
Eells says his church does not believe in medical intervention .
" We are not commanded in scripture to send people to the doctor but to meet their needs through prayer and faith .
As anyone here in the ministry will tell you , we are not against doctors for those who have their faith there and never condemn or restrict them in any way , " Eells writes .
" But we know that the best one to trust in for healing is Jesus Christ .
The foundation for receiving this benefit from Him is repentance and faith in His promises . "
Capt .
Scott Sleeter , a spokesman for the Everest Metro Police Department , said the Neumanns were initially cooperative with investigators .
But now the couple , who have three other teenage children , are " of the opinion that they 've talked to us and there 's nothing else they want to say , " he said .
In an interview with The Associated Press , the girl 's parents confirmed that they believe healing comes from God , but said that they did not want their child to die , that they are not zealots and that they do not have anything against doctors .
But authorities believe the girl , who was enrolled in a public school until last spring and this fall had been home - schooled , was likely ill for several days , perhaps longer , before her death .
' In God 's Hands '
In the AP interview , Leilani Neumann said that she is not worried about the police investigation because her family 's lives are " in God 's hands " and that family members know they did the best thing for Kara that they knew how to do .
A recent poem and writings by Leilani Neumann are posted at AmericasLastDays.com , the Web site of Unleavened Bread Ministries , which features the message , " These are America 's Last Days . "
The site describes the faith as nondenominational and founded by Eells , who spreads his message , teachings and interpretations of the Bible online and in books .
In one chapter of his book " Sovereign God for Us and Through Us , " Eells writes about the need to rely on God to face corporal sickness .
" We can not get anyone out from under a curse except through the Gospel , " Eells writes .
" Sometimes God is merciful , but we cannot guarantee God 's deliverance to those who do not walk under the blood . "
The Unleavened Bread Ministries is not the only church to attract the attention of law enforcement in connection with members refusing medical help .
Christian Science is one of the largest and perhaps best - known churches to favor divine spiritual healing over medicine .
The church generally considers sickness as the result of fear or sin and looks down upon drugs and surgery .
Still , the Christian Science church does not literally forbid church members from seeking medical attention .
Under the Jehovah 's Witnesses interpretation of the Bible , church members are prohibited from taking blood from anyone , a doctrine that can cause them to refuse blood transfusions .
" Our perspective is pretty straightforward and clear — if the surgery involves the transfusion of blood or a major component of blood , such as plasma , then we look as it as contrary to what is stated in scripture , " J.R. Brown , the spokesman for the Jehovah 's Witnesses World Headquarters in New York , told ABC News in December .
Beyond that restriction , Jehovah 's Witnesses can make medical decisions on a personal basis .
In November , a 14 - year - old Jehovah 's Witness in Washington state diagnosed with leukemia refused a blood transfusion that could have saved his life .
The decision was upheld by a judge .
The teen died shortly after a judge denied an emergency request by the state to mandate the transfusion .

The current kid-friendly pro-choice mantra is " Safe , legal and rare , " which reflects a popular understanding that while abortion is maybe not the best choice or the first choice or even any choice for some women , it should be a medically and legally viable , safe option for every woman .
A lot of women and men have fought very hard for many years to protect this right , against assassins and bombers and pushy protesters and fundie legislators and ballot initiatives and Supreme Court cases .
So , I guess it 's sort of understandable that some of them have maybe lost sight of the women for whom they are protecting these — in some cases , admittedly theoretical — rights .
Otherwise , how else does one explain the utter dearth of funding for pro-choice post- abortion counseling from within the pro-choice movement ?
Advertisement
Pro-Choice Resources is a non-profit group in Minneapolis that works " to provide a full span of reproductive health services to women and youth ; advocacy , access , education and empowerment . "
It also hosts a support group called Emerge for women who have had abortions .
Exhale is a post- abortion counseling hotline designed to fill a need due to " the lack of non-judgmental services available for women and their significant others after an abortion . "
It has served 15,000 women since 2002 .
Both are in danger of disappearing — and not because they 're being pressured by the right .
Both programs are dependent on donors and , like most donor - dependent non-profits , much of their revenue comes from foundations and other large organizations .
Because they 've waded into the area of counseling women who feel , at best , ambivalent about their abortions or , at worst , regret them , they have trouble attracting donations from reproductive rights groups .
Because they are dedicated to abortion counseling , they have trouble attracting money from more traditional health foundations .
Basically , they 're screwed either way .

Aspen Baker , Exhale 's co-founder and executive director , spoke to a group of pro-choice donors in Washington recently and had to explain why they should fund an operation that likes to call itself " pro-voice . "
Baker pointed out :
Forty percent of women who have abortions identify as Christian or Catholic , for example , and may also consider themselves pro-life .
Few women want to talk about politics when they call Exhale , Baker says ; many just want to tell someone they 've had an abortion , and talk through feelings ranging from relief to grief .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
She did n't get that much money out of the meeting : they 're still well short of their $ 450,000 goal for 2008 .
These groups are exactly what the pro-choice movement needs to be a part of , rather than allowing them to whither and leaving pro-choice women to be counseled and co-opted by the anti-choice movement as spokespeople — as the plaintiff in Roe v.
Wade has been .
And yet we 're too scared of our own shadows , too scared to give the antis ammunition , too focused on spending our money fighting legal battles to look at what our movement needs to be able to continue to hold on politically to the very women who have made the difficult choice and then needed to talk it out .
It 's time to stop letting them portray us as humorless , ivory - tower intellectual baby - killers , and start helping the women who need our emotional support before they turn to the people who would 've denied them their rights in the first place .

The Abortion Counseling Conundrum [ The American Prospect ]
Related : Exhale
Emerge
This interesting Volokh Conspiracy post on jury nullification reminded me that I ’ve been called for jury duty on Tuesday .
Suppose that I ’m asked to sit on a trial of a person for possessing and / or selling illegal narcotics .
Suppose that he ’s obviously guilty .
Should I vote to convict or not ?
If America were substantially free , I would be somewhat more inclined to oppose jury nullification , on the grounds that any bad laws can and perhaps ought to be repealed by the legislature or struck down by the appeals courts .
Moreover , to engage in jury nullification might seem to be an attack on the principle of the rule of law , as it would permit juries to decide willy - nilly whether to enforce the law of the land or not .
However , I ’m not convinced that that ’s right for two reasons .
First , that approach involves sending people to prison ( or inflicting some other punishment ) for something that they have a perfect right to do .
That seems to be a moral sanction of the unjust law , not to mention participating in a blatant rights violation .
Second , jury nullification on a high profile case can serve as a major public rebuke to an overreaching legislature .
( That happened in some of the sedition cases in America ’s early years . )
Moreover , the judicious use of jury nullification in select cases is not tantamount to anarchy , I do n’t think .
It can and ought to be used selectively and purposefully .
However , America today is not a substantially free society , so the case for jury nullification is even stronger .
In fact , as concerns drug laws , America is far closer to a police state than a free society .
The most recent mind - numbing case is the raid on the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo : “ A Prince George ’s County , Maryland SWAT team raided the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo last night , shooting and killing his two black labs in the process . ”
The man was totally innocent : drug dealers sent a 30 pound package of marijuana to his house , planning to intercept it .
The police treated him as guilty until proven innocent , despite the fact that all evidence pointed to his being an upstanding citizen .
( You can find links to more posts on the story here .
Here ’s another horrific case .
In general , Radley Balko is a good source for news about the frightening tactics of police in pursuit of the war on drugs .
He ’s on vacation now , however , so other people are guest - blogging for him . )
So … back to my original question :
If I ’m picked for a jury , should I send a person to jail for an action that ought not be a crime at all — on the grounds that I ought to respect the rule of law , even when I disagree with the particular law in question ?
Unless someone offers a good reason for me to think otherwise , I ’ll have to say “ no way , buster . ”
You ’ve got until Tuesday morning to convince me otherwise , if you wish !
Also published at my web magazine , The Public Record .
The White House lost an appeal to keep secret visitor logs containing the identities of evangelical Christian leaders who visited the White House and Vice President Dick Cheney ’s home , according to an opinion issued Friday by a federal appeals court .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Bush administration ’s claims that Secret Service visitor logs are the property of President George W. Bush and are not subject to Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests .
The White House assumed control of the visitor logs when watchdog groups and the media sought access to the files .
The panel of three appeals court judges essentially upheld a December decision by a U.S. District Court judge who said the visitor logs were public documents subject to the FOIA .
They sent the case back to District Court Judge Royce Lamberth for consideration

Is It Easy To Spot Replica Chanel Bags ?
If you are wondering that all replica Chanel bags can be easily spotted , then stop !
Times have changed , ladies .
It is no more easy to differentiate between a replica Chanel bag and an authentic Chanel bag .
It was in earlier times when it was quite easy to spot a Chanel replica with just a good look at it .
The difference in color , material quality , bag handler , screw heads , and zippers was quite evident back then .
If not these , then a close look at the stitching was enough to determine it as duplicate .
With changing times and technology , machines have taken over manual labor .
With machines at work , precision and accuracy are not compromised .
Presently , Chanel replica bags are produced with high - end precision .
They are made in almost the same manner as the original Chanel bags .
Therefore , they are completely identical .
Even a person with an experienced eye cannot spot the difference .
However , there are still dealers who sell poor quality replica handbags .
These are the ones that can be easily spotted as a fake .
Therefore it is your responsibility to research and double - check before buying anything online .
Even though identical and affordable , there are still people who shy away from buying fake or copy products .
They always have second thoughts while buying duplicate products .
Buying duplicate products are usually related to shame .
If you like something , then how does it matter if it is original or not ?
At last , it is you who must be satisfied .
It rather seems to be a wiser choice .
The amount of money you would spend to buy one original will buy you 7 - 10 top model replicas .
Ten different Chanel replica against one original seems much more tempting .

How Identical Is A Chanel Replica To The Real Ones ?
Well , this is the most asked question about Chanel replica bags .
People refrain from buying replicas .
They fear people will make fun if they know about the fake designer bag .
With Pluscoin , you need not worry about the similarity of your replica Chanel to the real Chanel .
You can say they are as identical as twins are .

How To Distinguish Between Good And Bad Quality Chanel Replica Online ?
It is an undeniable fact that replica designer bags are even more popular than the authentic designer bags these days .
Replicas are affordable , so they are easily accessible to many people .
There are plenty of websites and online platforms that sell Chanel replica bags .
These websites will try to lure you in with attractive offers but do not immediately trust them .
They post manipulative pictures of these bags , and you might end up with an ugly replica at your doorstep .
These are the ones who can be determined as fake at the very first glance , even from far off .
So , before walking into such websites , do some research .
Know the difference between good and bad quality Chanel replica bags .
After all , you are going to pay for it ; however , less the price may be .
It is a waste if you get a product not worth the money you paid .
Distinguishing Between Good And Bad Quality Chanel Replica Bags
To be able to distinguish between a good and bad quality Chanel replica , first carefully and closely examine the original Chanel handbag .
Cover every detail , no matter how minute it may be .
It is better to make a list of these details so that you do not miss out on any vital detail while buying .
Next , check the material of the replica bag .
It should be pure leather .
Replica made of pure leather is closest to the authentic Chanel bag .
Bad quality Chanel replica is made of artificial leather .
Now check the color of the replica and match it with the original .
It should be the exact same .
Poor quality Chanel replica has a very trivial yet distinguishable different shade of the original color .
Many people are outplayed in terms of color because of the many shades of the original color available .
Next , you should carefully check the Chanel logo .
Poor quality Chanel replica bags usually come with defective logos .
Some defects are easily visible , while others are so trivial that you do not notice even after physically seeing them .
These false logos are so creatively crafted that sometimes the defect is right in front of your eyes , but you unconsciously neglect it .
Another essential detail that needs close inspection is stitching .
Stitching is the very first thing a person looks at to determine whether the handbag is original or not .
Closely compare the stitching of the replica Chanel and the original Chanel to find out whether your replica is of good quality or a bad one .
Screw heads and zippers are an important adornment of the Chanel replica bags .
It is very difficult to find a Chanel replica with the exact same hardware as that of the original .
So if you do not find identical screw heads or zippers , then look for the closest matching ones .
Apart from personally examining the replica , what you can also do is look for customer reviews of the same bag .
Preferably go for the ones that consist of the photograph of the replica .
This is the best way to get answers to most of your queries regarding your favorite Chanel replica .
Lastly , believe your instincts .
If you have even the slightest feeling that something is off , immediately go for a double - check .
Now that you know the major differences between good quality and a bad quality replica , you can easily buy the perfect Chanel replica .
You only need to keep your eyes wide open while comparing different Chanel replica designer bags online .
The replica market is vast , with bags ranging from the best to the ugliest , so be cautious .
If not , you might easily get tricked into buying low quality and less identical replica Chanel bags .
Difference Between Real Chanel And Replica Chanel
There have been cases where manufacturers of big designer handbag brands secretly manufacture replicas .
After manufacturing a good number of original bags , they manufacture a couple of high - quality replica designer bags .
They use the same way and sometimes even the same leftover material .
Since the manufacturer is the same and many times the material as well , there is hardly any difference in the look of the replica and the original .
Only someone with an in - depth knowledge of the authentic Chanel replica bags might be able to spot some tiny difference .
In the case of high - end replica designer bags , the only difference that can exist is of zippers and screw heads .
It is difficult to find the exact shape , size , and design of screw heads and zippers as that of the original one .
Another difference can be the mirror image replica .
It is quite rare for high - quality replica bags , but a common occurrence in the poor quality ones .
You must be cautious of these mirror image knock off handbags .
They look alike at first glance , but it is later than you realize the difference .
These are the only few differences between a high - quality Chanel replica designer bag and an authentic Chanel bag .
Sounds amazing , right ?
You must by now be having the urge to buy Chanel replica bags as well .
Well , you are in the right place !

The " Obamacans " that Sen. Barack Obama used to joke about - Republican apostates who whispered their support for his candidacy - have morphed into a new phenomenon , or syndrome , as detractors like to call it : the Obamacons .
These are conservatives who have publicly endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee , dissidents from the brain trust of think tanks , ex-officials and policy magazines that have fueled the Republican Party since the 1960s .
Scratch the surface of this elite , and one finds a profound dismay that is far more damaging to the GOP than the usual 10 percent of registered Republicans expected to switch sides during a presidential election .
" The untold story of the Bush administration is the deliberate annihilation of the Reaganite , small - government wing of the Republican Party , " said Michael Greve , director of the Federalism Project at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank .
" A lot of people are very bitter about it . "
Many conservatives and their brethren , the free - market , socially liberal libertarians , are deeply skeptical of Obama 's rhetorical flirtations with free - market ideas and view his policies as orthodox liberalism .
Yet one measure of their rupture with the GOP is their open disregard for Republican nominee John McCain and their now almost - wistful view of a president the Republicans tried to impeach .
" When he leaves the room , everybody thinks he just agreed with them , " Greve said of Obama .
" We do n't know if you 're really buying a pig in a poke here .
It could be the second coming of the Clinton administration .
If people have any confidence in that , I think a whole lot of conservatives would vote for him . "
Such sentiments reflect a collapse of the " big tent " conservative coalition that Republican President Ronald Reagan forged in 1980 , uniting free - market , small - government types , Christian evangelicals , cultural traditionalists and anti-communists , now called neoconservatives .
The neoconservatives , whose intellectual leaders include New York Times columnist David Brooks and Weekly Standard publisher Bill Kristol , remain firmly inside the GOP and strongly back McCain , who appeals to their model of " national greatness . "
So do mainstream conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation , which issues regular attacks against Obama 's economic plans , and the traditionalist magazine National Review .
The left often lumps these factions together , but the Iraq war and President Bush 's " compassionate conservatism " that led to an expansion of government have ruptured the coalition .
Many conservatives are aghast at the rise in spending and debt under the Bush administration , its expansion of executive power , and what they see as a trampling of civil liberties and a taste for empire .
" I do know libertarians who think Obama is the Antichrist , that he 's farther left than John Kerry , much farther left than Bill Clinton , and you 'd clearly have to be insane to vote for this guy , " said David Boaz , executive vice president of the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank .
" But there are libertarians who say , ' Oh yeah ?
Do you think Obama will increase spending by $ 1 trillion , because that 's what Republicans did over the past two presidential terms .
So really , how much worse can he be ? '
And there are certainly libertarians who think Obama will be better on the war and on foreign policy , on executive power and on surveillance than McCain . "
Libertarians are tired of Christian evangelicals , who they believe captured the GOP under President Bush .
Evangelicals , for their part , are skeptical of McCain , who in 2000 called Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson " agents of intolerance . "
McCain has tried to make amends , promising to stand firm on abortion and same - sex marriage , and appoint conservative Supreme Court justices , but mistrust runs deep .
Douglas Kmiec is former chief of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations , and now a constitutional law professor at Pepperdine University and a devout Catholic .
Kmiec endorsed Obama earlier this year , despite his conviction that Obama " believes in a pretty progressive agenda . "
Kmiec said his support deepened after meeting with Obama and other faith leaders last month , during which the busy candidate spent 2 1/ 2 in a freewheeling discussion with people who differed with him .
" I think he 's the right person at the right time to re-establish principles of constitutional governance that have been ill treated by the current administration , and to free us from the tar paper that we know is Iraq , " Kmiec said , adding that many Republicans privately agree .
" I think he 's a man in the market for every good idea he can find , and he does n't care what label it comes with . "
David Friedman , the son of late conservative icon and Nobel economist Milton Friedman , has also endorsed Obama .
Calling McCain a " nationalist , " Friedman , an economist at Santa Clara University , thinks Obama could turn out like the liberals who deregulated New Zealand 's economy .
" Of the two , Obama is less bad and at least has a chance in some ways of being good , " said Friedman .
Friedman likes Obama 's University of Chicago advisers such as Austan Goolsbee and Cass Sunstein , who he believes are trying to forge a new leftism that incorporates free - market views .
" I do n't expect to agree in general with them , " Friedman said , " but I certainly would be happy if the left became more libertarian , since the right seems to be less libertarian than it used to be . "
Many see the Iraq war as hostile to conservative values and as a " friend of the state " - something that inherently expands the reach of the government , as Milton Friedman once described war .
" People do n't understand that there has always been a small but very significant element of conservatives who have been against the war from day one and who , like me , also hate George Bush and think he's the most incompetent president in American history , " said Bruce Bartlett , a supply - side economist who coined the term Obamacons .
" The few people who are slavishly pro-Republican , live or die , slavishly pro-Bush like the Weekly Standard crowd , have gotten lot more publicity than they deserve . "
Many conservatives are looking for a Clintonesque " Sister Soulja " or " end welfare as we know it " moment from Obama , a concrete demonstration of a willingness to abandon Democratic dogma .
" The Republicans have left the libertarian baby on the doorstep , but Democrats wo n't open the door , " said Boaz .
" There are people saying Obama 's a University of Chicago Democrat , and you can't spend 10 years at the University of Chicago without having some appreciation for markets .
I 'd like to believe that .
I just do n't see the rubber meeting the road . "
Matt Welch , editor in chief of the libertarian Reason Magazine and author of " McCain , the Myth of a Maverick , " thinks Obama 's conservative support " comes as much anything else from people being exhausted with the Republican coalition , who are mad at one wing or another , and they just think it 's time for them to lose .
It 's just , ' Look , we 're out of ideas , we 're exhausted , it 's not working , we do n't know what our principles are anymore , let 's take one for the team and have a black guy be the president for a while . ' "
Obama is actively trying to switch one prominent Republican to an Obamacan : former Secretary of State Colin Powell , who met with both candidates last month .

Its name somewhat anachronistically means “ assembly of old men . ” George Washington famously — and , it must now be admitted , with excessive optimism — characterized it as an institutional saucer intended to cool legislation passed in the intemperate heat of the moment .
Its members demand , with entirely unwarranted self - approval , to be called , collectively , the World ’s Greatest Deliberative Body .
Sober observers understand it to be the most corrupt legislative assembly in human history .
To those characterizations of the United States Senate we must now add another , perhaps the final one : Gravedigger of the republic .
With the Senate ’s passage of the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac bailout last Saturday ( July 26 ) , the United States of America has now become the world ’s first full - service kleptocracy , a form of government described earlier in this space as a government of , by , and for the robbers .
We are supposed to pretend to believe that the Senate , so great was its anxiety over the nation ’s economically distressed homeowners , met in a rare Saturday session for the sole purpose of administering the balm of Gilead on hardworking families who confront the bleak prospect of foreclosure .
There may be people who believe such a thing , or at least profess to do so .
They are pretty much the kind of people who believe that peace , prosperity , and progress will magically ensue after next January 20 , when the Holy One , Barack Obama ( peace be upon him ) ascends to the presidency , not astride a White Horse , but rather mounted upon a flying unicorn that emits healing rainbows from its butt .
No , it ’s not the travails of the productive that would earn such attention from the Senate .
When the Senate sacrifices so much as a minute of its down time , it does so not to relieve our burdens , but to add to them in the interest of their fellow parasites .
When Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913 , it did so in a lame - duck session .
The Fed ’s proponents described its handiwork as an independent entity that would prevent “ panics ” and maintain the integrity of our currency and financial system .
The Fed was presented to the public in pseudo - populist drag :
It was supposedly the bane of the big banking interests .
This was , in every particular , a conscious inversion of the truth .
The Fed was , is , and every shall be a product and protector of those interests .
It has practically destroyed the value of US currency , and engineered numerous financial crises , including the one currently unfolding .
The measure passed last Saturday is being described to the public as a “ homeowner ” bailout .
It is nothing of the sort .
It supposedly creates an independent oversight mechanism to rein in the excesses of Fannie and Freddie .
This , too , is an unalloyed falsehood .
Let us disambiguate the key issue right now .
This is a measure to nationalize Fannie and Freddie , plundering the population at large — through direct taxation , the more insidious tax called inflation , or both — to bail out two fascist entities that have been used to enrich the politically connected super - rich through the most corrupt means imaginable .
Furthermore , this measure prefigures the eventual nationalization of the entire financial system under the supervision of an executive branch official with practically unlimited power to appropriate and allocate funds without congressional action .
OK , sure , he has to file a report with Congress regarding his expenditures .
But this takes place after the fact , and Congress will be able to do nothing but complain , if it can bestir itself even to that extent .
Congress has yielded its war powers to the executive branch .
It has now effectively surrendered the power of the purse , as well .
What , then , remains by way of the legislative branch ’s ability to check the executive ?
Nobody responsible for this is willing to admit that truth ; they ’re too busy taking refuge in contrived ambiguities .
The figure sent out to pollute headlines and palliate a nervous public last week was that fixing Fannie and Freddie will cost “ at least ” $ 25 billion .
That ’s a bit like saying there are “ at least ” 25 gallons of water in Lake Michigan .
The Congressional Budget Office , in an artful display of tactical equivocation , said that the bailout could cost anything from $ 100 billion down to “ nothing . ”
That latter estimate would be dismissed as magic thinking were it not a transparent and cynical effort to propagate such delusion among that part of the public paying attention to the ongoing economic collapse .
As the Wall Street Journal summarized , the $ 25 billion figure was arrived by following a time - honored government accounting algorithm : Some accountant at the CBO threw a dart at the wall .
In fact , the bailout measure places in the hands of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the discretionary authority to pour as much money into Fannie and Freddie as he deems necessary .
He can extend an unlimited credit line to either or both of those government - chartered companies ; he can use federal funds to buy shares in either , or both .
There is no limit to what can be spent on the bailout , or the extent of government involvement it will entail .
In his efforts to lobby congressional Republicans on behalf of the bailout , Paulson reportedly assured them that he has “ no intention ” of using those extraordinary powers .
This means , of course , that they will be used immediately .
It also means , inevitably , that Fannie and Freddie will be nationalized , and that taxpayers will pay the full burden of the bailout .
Senate Republicans — clap - torn whores , every one of them — put up a show of reluctance , perhaps because the White House likes a little role - playing action of that sort .
This meant that Treasury Secretary Paulson had to convene several meetings with Republicans in order to pretend to overcome their reluctance to support a measure that will impecuniate their constituents in order to pay off the imponderably huge bad debts assumed by politically protected thieves .
The Fannie / Freddie bailout is another example of the familiar equation behind corporatism ( or , to use the more loaded synonym , fascism ) :
The risks are subsidized , the losses are socialized , and the profits are privatized .
There are former corporate executives who spend their days looking at striped sunlight and showing with their backs to the wall for crimes identical to those of former Fannie CEO Franklin D. Raines and his comrades .
But because Raines and his posse used a Government - Sponsored Entity to commit their crimes , they ’re free to enjoy nearly all the fruits of their fraud .
I find it remarkable that next to nothing has been said by way of condemning Raines and his fellow corporatist thieves .
Doing so is nearly as unthinkable as permitting those two government - sponsored companies to fail , as they should .
According to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , the bailout would n’t be necessary if people were willing to do their part by throwing their money away without the government forcing them to do so : “ Emergency legislation was necessary because market participants were unwilling to buy Fannie and Freddie ’s debt ; investors doubted that the government - sponsored enterprises were healthy enough to repay it and did not draw sufficient reassurance from the implicit guarantee of federal support . ”
This is why , according to Summers , “ Anyone who cares about the health of the US economy should welcome the … rescue plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac… . ”
Imagine an armed robber lecturing his victim that it would n’t have been “ necessary ” to threaten the victim ’s life , and the lives of his family , if they had simply handed over their money on demand , and you ’ll have a suitable moral parallel to the statement above .
Eventually — and for that , read “ pretty damn soon ” — the entire daisy - chain of fraud we call our financial system will devolve into a scene of violent chaos akin to the denouement of Reservoir Dogs , only immeasurably bigger and unimaginably bloodier .
Already , the robber ’s pact holding the system together is starting to fray , as fractional reserve banks start gagging on each other ’s IOUs .
Witness the fact that cashier ’s checks being issued by California ’s newly federalized IndyMac bank are n’t being honored by other banks :
Customers who cash out of IndyMac are finding that they wo n’t be able to access their funds for up to two months .
It ’s not difficult to imagine the impact this will have on households who expected to use those funds to make mortgage or tax payments , or have other irrepressible financial needs .
It took roughly a tithe of FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund to bail out IndyMac .
Last week ’s bank failures — First National Bank of Nevada and Arizona ’s First Heritage Bank — involved combined assets of about $ 3.6 billion .
With Wachovia , Washington Mutual , and many other major banks primed to blow , the day will soon come when — in the words of James Kunstler — the FDIC will simply “ choke and croak on this wad of losses … .
When American depositors get screwed out of their deposits ” — as they already are ; vide the observation above regarding IndyMac ’s dodgy cashier ’s checks — “ the full force of the fiasco will drag the dollar underwater like the legendary Kraken of old preying on a babe thrown overboard .
Then the forces of darkness will really be loosed . ”
Last week , Congress went on record regarding its priorities :
With a handful of noble exceptions ( conspicuous among them the stalwart Rep. Ron Paul of Texas ) , they demonstrated a willingness to ruin what remains of the dollar and destroy the Middle Class in order to rescue — temporarily — the ber-rich Robber Class .
The people responsible for this betrayal will be campaigning in their districts during the coming weeks .
It would be instructive to them , and may be heartening to their victims , to see at least a few of them on the receiving end of timely and forceful rebukes , delivered in language — and other expressive conduct — appropriate to the occasion , and prevailing security environment .
The Best of William Norman Grigg
Hollywood is often described as a dream factory , but really it ’s just as often a salvage yard .
Anxious studio executives would rather bet their $ 100 - million budgets on nostalgia than on new ideas , which is why , against all odds , Sid and Marty Krofft are back in business .
The Krofft brothers , both now in their 70s , have a showbiz story that dates back to the final days of vaudeville .
But for children of the Nixon years , their name is the brand behind some of the era ’s strangest TV programming : shows such as “ H.R. Pufnstuf , ” “ Lidsville , ” “ Land of the Lost ” and “ Sigmund and the Sea Monsters . ”
Those low - budget shows had rubber - costumed actors , fluorescent puppets and psychedelic sets that were by the 1980s hopelessly dated ; and by the end of that decade , the same could be said of the Kroffts .
Today , though , thanks to the Hollywood appetite for all things kitschy and high - concept , the Kroffts are poised for the biggest payday of their career -- unless , of course , they strangle each other first .

“ Things did get lean , but we never gave up , ” said Sid , 78 , the smiling , soft - spoken dreamer of the two .
His brother , sitting next to him at their Studio City office , rolled his eyes .
“ We ?
I would n’t let you give up , ” snapped Marty , still the deal maker at 71 .
“ I would n’t let us sell the rights to our old shows .
That is why we are where we are today . ”
And where they are is n’t a bad place to be .
Universal Pictures has just finished principal photography on a $ 100 - million adaptation of “ Land of the Lost , ” the mid-1970s Krofft show about a family stranded in a jungle teeming with dinosaurs and hissing reptile - men called Sleestak .
The remake is a comedy starring Will Ferrell , and Universal has circled it as its big popcorn movie for summer 2009 .
The Kroffts -- who will speak about the franchise today at the Comic - Con gathering in San Diego in front of 6,000 - plus fans -- will get a percentage of the profits and make a mint from licensing deals .
The Kroffts , however , are bickering all the way to the bank , which is no surprise .

“ To hear Marty talk , I ’ve never worked a single day , ” said Sid , who at age 15 joined the Ringling Brothers circus as a puppeteer and proved so adept that he would go on to become an opening act for the Andrews Sisters , Judy Garland and Cyd Charisse .
Marty had joined the act by the late 1950s , and from then on the two puppeteers were locked in a contest to prove who was really pulling the strings .
Sid was the creative force , but Marty was the one who made sure the act actually made it to the stage .
“ Oh , I ’ve earned my pay , believe me , ” Marty said .
“ It ’s not easy for two brothers to work together . ”
An example came up almost immediately .
Sid was sharing one especially windy tale when his brother groaned , “ Sid , I thought you were telling a story about ‘ Land of the Lost . ’
What happened to that ? ”
“ I ’m getting there , Marty , ” Sid said .
“ You know I can tell long stories too , just the way you do . ”

Marty answered through a clenched smile : “ That was n’t very nice . ”
A few minutes later , Sid decided to clear his conscience by revealing a 50 - year - old family secret -- “ We ’ve been living with this lie for decades , ” he said -- and his younger brother was apoplectic .
“ Now ?!
This moment , right now , you decide you need to tell all of this ? ”
Sid , the man who dreamed up deliriously strange Saturday - morning characters such as Weenie the Genie , Horatio J. HooDoo and Cha- Ka the ape - boy , looked bewildered by his brother ’s fury .
“ Well , Marty , I do n’t see the harm .
It ’s history now . ”

There are still plenty of young dreamers , oddballs and colorful hucksters in the entertainment industry , but , really , the modern corporate era has wiped away most of its greasepaint charm .
In the flashbulb era , big stars were bigger and tall tales were taller .
For example , take the celebrated Krofft family history : Sid and Marty are supposedly fifth - generation puppeteers , dating to the opening of the Krofft Theater in the early 1700s in Athens .
It is a truly amazing tale and cited in almost every article every written about them , and it ’s the first line of their bio .
It is also not true .
It was cooked up by a New York publicist in the 1940s .
The brothers have carried it with them ever since , until Sid suddenly decided to clear his conscience in an interview for this story .
“ It became a trap , ” Sid explained , shaking his head .
“ I was telling Marty the other day how bad it is that some of his children even have heard it and believe it . ”

There are other vivid moments in the Krofft biography that test credulity .
Marty , for instance , says that Beatles manager Brian Epstein called him seeking tapes of “ H.R. Pufnstuf ” so the band could keep up to date on the psychedelic Saturday - morning show .
Of course , Epstein died in 1967 , two years before “ Pufnstuf ” went on the air .
But , at some point , subjecting the old Hollywood to too much Digital Age scrutiny becomes a crass exercise .
Really , should the men who brought the world “ Lidsville , ” a live - action show about giant talking hats , be expected to keep real - world details straight ?
Their father was actually a clock salesman .
He took his family south from Canada to Providence , R.I. , to find more opportunities .
The family ended up in New York .
Young
Sid ’s flair for puppet design and puppetry ended up opening a door for the whole family .
His father joined him on tour -- which inspired the “ fifth - generation ” fib -- as “ pretty much an apprentice , ” Sid said .
Father and son were performing in Paris when , back in New York , Marty rummaged through his older brother ’s trunks and borrowed his puppets to begin making money on stage himself .
In 1958 , the act was the Krofft brothers and the venue was the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas , where they were opening for Garland .
The critics raved about the act but , when they took it on tour , Marty was haranguing his brother every night about the bottom line .
Advertisement
“ My brother was getting $ 1,500 a week from Judy Garland , and it cost $ 2,000 a week to travel the act , ” Marty said .
“ But always , Sid would spend what we made -- and more -- on the show . ”
Sid smiled .
“ If we did n’t put everything in the shows , they would n’t have been as good as they were .
. . .
That ’s all that people see , what ’s up on the screen .
That ’s where the magic is . ”
In 1961 , they premiered an adults - only puppet show , “ Les Poupees de Paris , ” at a dinner club in Los Angeles called the Gilded Rafters .
Mae West , Richard Nixon and Liberace were in the audience on opening night .
Johnny Carson caught a performance and deadpanned that it was the only performance he had ever seen by “ naughty pine . ”
The Kroffts began renting out their puppet and production savvy .
They designed stage productions for fairs and amusement parks , took corporate work from Ford and Coca - Cola , and did some work for Walt Disney as well .
Marty had crossed paths with the entertainment icon in 1959 ; Marty was at the Polo Lounge having drinks with Charisse when Disney stopped by to chat and gave him a bit of advice .

As Marty remembers it : “ He told me , ‘ The one thing to remember is , do n’t ever sell anything you create and always put your name above the title , whatever you do .
They ’ll fight you off from doing it , but stick to it . ’
The only thing he did n’t tell me was how to save money . ”
--
Afew weeks before the Studio City interview , Marty was roaming the set of “ Land of the Lost ” out near the Trona Pinnacles , the eerie tufa rock formations that jut up from the desert floor past Palmdale .
The spires , formed beneath the water of an ancient alkaline lake , have been used as a Hollywood location dating back to the ‘ 60s TV series “ Lost in Space . ”
“ Look at this place .
I never thought I would live to see one of our shows become something like this , ” Marty said as he shaded his eyes from the sun .
He nodded toward the trailers , tents , cameras , sets , props and a small army of crew members .
“ They spend more in one day than we spent in a year of making our shows . ”

That ’s a common pattern these days .
Any character ever featured on a child ’s lunchbox is fair game for a big - budget Hollywood treatment .
Superhero films , of course , are a full - on bonanza , with “ The Dark Knight ” setting box - office records by the day .
The movie adaptation of “ Land of the Lost ” looks like the last great hurrah for the Kroffts , but if you listen to Marty ’s relentless pitch , the windfall is just the beginning .
He said the Krofft library may now be worth as much as $ 25 million and could become “ the next Marvel Comics , ” a reference to the comic - book company that has watched its 1960s creations ( Spider - Man , the X - Men , Iron Man , etc. ) take flight as 21st century blockbuster films .
“ The Krofft era , ” Marty declared , “ is starting right now . ”
Perhaps , but not all the Saturday - morning shows in the Krofft library are easy fits as feature films .
The brothers say they have a former writer for “ The Simpsons ” working on a script for “ Sigmund and the Sea Monsters , ” the show that had Billy Barty portraying a skittish little marine monster with tentacles ( he resembled a pea- colored SpongeBob SquarePants with seaweed for hair ) who is taken home by two boys .
A movie could be a sort of meld of “ E.T. : The Extra - Terrestrial ” and “ Splash , ” the Kroffts hope .

Most of all , the brothers would love to make a feature film of “ H.R. Pufnstuf , ” the show Sid describes as “ our first baby . ”
The plot was about a teen , portrayed by Oscar - nominated “ Oliver ! ” star Jack Wild , who finds himself on Living Island ( where everything -- houses , books , plants , candles -- can talk ) .
He meets the title character , a rotund dragon , and matches wits with the shrill Wilhelmina W. Witchiepoo .
The brothers , by the way , deny the popular perception that they were gobbling major amounts of LSD while making the shows .
“ I ’m a runner , and I thought of them during my runs on the beach at Santa Monica , ” Sid said .
“ That ’s where they came from . ”
After watching Tim Burton ’s “ Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , ” Marty knows who he wants to see wearing the witch ’s crooked nose .
“ How great would Johnny Depp be as Witchiepoo ?
Maybe he ’ll read this , right ?
Look , all we need is a star .
And a story .
Hey , you know what Michael Eisner has said about the Kroffts for years ?
He said , ‘ The Kroffts always have one more show in them . ’ ”
The Kroffts certainly were willing to try anything , and they went well beyond Saturday - morning shows .
They launched the teeny - bopper variety show “ Donny and Marie ” for ABC in 1976 and a year later brought the cast of “ The Brady Bunch ” back on the air as stars of a variety show .
That show was met with howls , but even worse was the infamous “ Pink Lady and Jeff , ” an NBC variety show built around the Japanese pop duo Pink Lady .

“ The network made the deal and gave them the show , ” Marty said , “ but that ’s when we found out that they really could n’t speak English .
That was a problem .
But what can you do ? ”
The show must go on , and “ Pink Lady ” did -- for a few deliriously awkward episodes .
The Kroffts bounced back -- their “ Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters ” was a hit , teaming the country stars with Krofft puppets in the early 1980s .
But the tide was turning against them .
The variety - show format was dying .
They could no longer find a foothold with their live - action morning children ’s programming ; Saturday mornings by that point belonged to cartoons .
More than that , the business of TV had changed .
The Kroffts were true independent producers ; they had made their shows on their own ( usually small ) budgets and then brought the finished product to the networks .
By the ‘ 90s , that model was outdated .
Advertisement
Plenty of people approached the Kroffts about buying their library , usually at fire - sale prices .
They said no to every offer , even the one from pop superstar Michael Jackson .
“ The biggest thing as an independent is to survive .
No one else really survived out there , ” Marty said .
“ Either they ’re dead or they sold the company .
We ’re lucky . ”
Sid still gets misty every time he meets some 40 - year - old who recognizes his name and reminisces about talking flutes or gentle , goggle - eyed sea monsters .
“ There are n’t many things , ” he said , “ that we take in our lives and carry for so long . ”
Marty nodded in agreement .
The shows were lucky in love , he said , but not in lucre .
Advertisement
Maybe that will change now that the Kroffts , after five decades in a small spotlight , are getting a late - in - life chance at the big time .
“ How much money are we going to make ? ” Marty asked .
“ I ’m not counting anything .
I just want to be alive when the picture opens .
It opens July 17 , 2009 .
Do n’t forget to put the date in the story . ”

GAZA ( Reuters ) - A U.N. agency suspended its aid operations in the Gaza Strip on Thursday after an emergency shipment of fuel designated for its use was blocked by petrol - hungry Palestinian farmers .
Mahmoud al - Khuzundar of the Association for Petrol Station Owners in the Gaza Strip said 50,000 liters ( 13,209 gallons ) of diesel was meant to be delivered to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) to help aid distribution .
But a group of Gaza farmers who wanted fuel to be distributed openly beyond UNRWA blocked the tanker from reaching the terminal where fuel is pumped into the Gaza Strip , forcing the aid agency to suspend operations .
“ We did not receive any fuel today and therefore the distribution of food supplies has been suspended , ” said Adnan Abu Hasna , UNRWA ’s media advisor in Gaza .
Israel stepped up its blockade of Gaza in June after Hamas seized the territory , home to 1.5 million Palestinians , from its Fatah rivals .
Israel says it has limited fuel and other deliveries in response to cross - border rocket attacks by militants in Gaza .
Abu Hasna said the food suspension will affect at least 700,000 refugees in the Hamas - controlled territory .
UNRWA said 50,000 liters of fuel should be enough to last about a week .
The petrol station owners ’ association has been on strike , refusing to collect the fuel near Nahal Oz crossing -- the only border terminal used to pump fuel to the Gaza Strip -- in protest at Israel ’s cutbacks in supplies to the territory .
UNRWA warned on Wednesday it would be forced to suspend food distribution to Palestinians on Thursday unless it received fuel supplies .
The European Union called on Israel to ensure fuel deliveries to Gaza .
“ It is unacceptable that the U.N. should find itself having to consider suspending its humanitarian operations simply for a lack of fuel for its vehicles , ” EU aid commissioner Louis Michel said in a statement .
“ It is also unacceptable that public services , such as garbage collection , sewage treatment , or hospitals are on the brink of collapse for the same reason , ” he said .
“ It ’s essential that the fuel supply to Gaza is resumed , and in particular that fuel provision for the United Nations agencies , as well as basic services be guaranteed immediately . ”
Colonel Nir Press , head of Israel ’s Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza , said Israel had coordinated with UNRWA Thursday ’s disrupted delivery and that he hoped it would be renewed on Friday .
“ There is about a million liters ( 264,170 gallons ) of diesel and petrol in storage tanks on the Palestinian side of Nahal Oz .
For a month now , the Palestinians have not been taking the diesel and petrol , ” Press said .
Press accused the Islamist Hamas group of preventing its distribution and creating the fuel shortage .
Palestinian militants attacked the Nahal Oz fuel terminal two weeks ago , killing two Israeli civilians .
DRAMATIC SITUATION
The French medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) said its operations , which have already been hampered by the shortages , will also end unless it receives new deliveries .
“ Currently MSF is functioning on its emergency stock and only has 10 days of fuel left .
If supplies are not restored , the situation could become dramatic very quickly , ” said mission chief Duncan Mclean .
Israel allowed one million liters of EU - funded diesel fuel to be pumped to Gaza ’s only power station on Wednesday after Kanan Abaid , deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Authority in the Gaza Strip , warned the plant would have to shut down unless supplies resumed .
A European Commission official said there was enough fuel at the plant for about three days , but that it would have to shut down on Sunday if no new deliveries were allowed through .

The “ death ride ” — welcome to 21st century torture , says Khalid Amayreh in occupied East Jerusalem Israeli maltreatment of Palestinian captives and political prisoners has reached unprecedented levels of brutality , according to lawyers , human rights groups and newly - released prisoners .
There are currently as many as 12,000 Palestinian detainees languishing in Israeli detention camps , many of them without charge or trial .
They include hundreds of university professors , engineers , school teachers as well as religious and civic leaders , students , resistance fighters and women activists .
Two years ago , the Israeli occupation authorities abducted hundreds of democratically - elected officials , including mayors , members of local city councils , law - makers , and cabinet ministers , many associate with Hamas ’s political wing .
Israel employs a set of draconian laws , some dating back to the British mandate era , to torment Palestinian prisoners .
The same laws are also used to lend a façade of legality to other harsh treatment of Palestinians , such as house demolitions , land confiscation and deportation .
Normally , the harsh treatment meted out to Palestinian detainees starts in earnest with crack Israeli soldiers raiding a given Palestinian home in the quiet hours before dawn .
There , the undisciplined soldiers normally ransack the house , vandalise property and furniture , smash house appliances and terrorise the entire family , before blindfolding and handcuffing their victim and dragging him away to a military truck that takes him to one of the dozens of interrogation centres all over Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories .
Upon arrival at the interrogation centre , the detainee is instantly subjected to an array of harsh treatment techniques designed to shock him and destroy his psychological immunity .
These include sleep deprivation and solitary confinement as well as sporadic beating .
Then the victim is made to go through the routine technique called shabh whereby he is forced to sit on a 25 cm high stool , with his hands tied to his back .
He can be kept in this extremely uncomfortable position for weeks or even months except for short periods to go to the toilet and eat .
The main purpose behind the harsh treatment is ostensibly to extract confessions from the victim .
On many occasions , the victims confess to having committed fictitious violations only to escape the harsh and intolerable torture .
Eventually , however , if no confessions are extracted , the detainee is sentenced to administrative detention , or open - ended captivity without being charged or tried .
Torture , which the Israeli judicial authorities euphemistically refer to as “ moderate physical and psychological pressure ” , is officially sanctioned by Israel ’s law .
Indeed , several Palestinian detainees have recently died in Israeli jails either due to torture or medical negligence .
According to the Palestinian Prisoner Club , which monitors Israeli treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails , 167 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since 1967 .
However , while torture was normally performed on detainees mainly in order to extract confessions , the Israeli prison authorities have been using torture for the purpose of simply tormenting and humiliating Palestinian detainees .
“ Their goal is to make us suffer , to torment us , to humiliate us .
They want to punish us further for our survival , for refusing to die and disappear as a people , for refusing to collapse .
Perhaps they think that by tormenting us , they get the feeling that they are avenging the holocaust , at least vicariously , ” said Mohamed Abu Zneid , from Dura , who was released recently from an Israeli detention camp near the Egyptian borders .
“ But I can say that such behaviour can only come from a sick people , a sadistic people .
Otherwise , why would normal people behave this way ? ”
“ Administrative detention ” which is a mere euphemism for prolonged and mostly unlawful captivity as punishment for one ’s political thoughts and attitudes has become of late the modus operandi of Israeli treatment of Palestinian prisoners .
Today , Israel is detaining hundreds of mostly innocent Palestinians in detention camps all over Israel , such as the notorious Kitziot concentration camp in the Negev desert .
A few years ago , Mustafa Shawar , a detainee at Kitziot , informed this writer that on several occasions he had appealed to the Jewish military “ judge ” at the Treblinka - like facility to tell him why he was being incarcerated so that he would n’t commit the same violation again once he was released .
Shawar , a senior lecturer at the University of Hebron , said the judge paid no attention to his just request .
“ He told me that he would n’t grant me the privilege of knowing why I was in jail because , as he said , the Jews are the masters and non-Jews are the slaves and the chosen people are under no moral or legal obligation to explain to the inferiors why they are being mistreated . ”
Today , Shawar is still languishing at Kitziot for the fourth successive year , not knowing why he is being tormented by a state that claims to be a “ light unto nations ” and the “ only democracy in the Middle East ” .
Shawar is not an exceptional case .
He epitomises the fate of thousands of Palestinian detainees and hostages languishing in Israeli detention camps , mostly for harbouring ideas and thoughts that the Ashkenazi establishment deems too dangerous .
Similarly , Azzam Salhab , professor of comparative religion at Hebron University , has been languishing in the same desert concentration camp for eight years on vague charges such as “ constituting a danger to the safety and security of Israel and the Jewish people . ”
According to the Nafha Society , a human rights group defending Palestinian prisoners ’ rights , the Israeli occupation authorities issue dozens of administrative detention orders per month .
Earlier , this week , the Israeli army renewed the “ administrative detention ” for Radi Sami Al - Asi for additional six months .
Al - Asi , a journalist from the northern West Bank town of Nablus , was arrested on unspecified charges .
However , when it became clear that there was no evidence indicting him , the Israeli military judge decided to sentence him to six months in jail , renewable for as long as the occupation authorities deem fit .
So far , Al - Asi has spent more than 38 months in administrative detention without knowing why .
Farhat Asad , a 40 - year - old father of three children from Ramallah , was sentenced to a sixth term of administrative detention on 16 June .
All in all , Asad has spent more than 100 months in administrative detention .
According to Tawhid Shaaban , a prominent lawyer from East Jerusalem , some detainees have spent nine years in Israeli captivity without charge or trial .
“ Yes , this happens in a state that claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East . ”
The so - called “ death ride ” is one of the most agonising and nightmarish experiences a detainee undergoes .
It starts with a sudden raid of a given ward by the notorious Nahshon squad , which is specialised in repressing Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails .
Then a prisoner or several prisoners are ordered to board an extremely filthy , hot and nearly hermetically sealed white vehicle , allegedly in order to appear before a judge several hundred kilometres away .
The hateful vehicle would move very slowly from one prison to the other to carry additional prisoners , including dangerous Jewish criminals .
The car would stop every hour for refreshment , while the inmates are sweating in the back chamber .
The nightmarish journey , which could last for 24 hours , is first and foremost meant to make the prisoners suffer as much as possible in the oven - like metal chamber where there is very little oxygen .
The prisoners are barred from using toilets for close to 16 hours , and some are forced to urinate and defecate inside the lock - up car .
Saed Yassin , a human rights activist describes the “ death ride ” as “ an intolerable and unbearable form of torture .
They do n’t treat you as a human being but as cattle or a piece of luggage .
People are left to rot and suffer in these oven - like chambers for up to 24 hours without food , without water , and with very little oxygen .
And if they want to torment a given person , he is forced to undergo this nightmare every few days . ”
In addition to the death ride , the Israeli Prison Authority has been introducing additional forms of punishments , aimed at breaking the prisoner ’s will .
These include barring family visits for an extended period of times for the slightest and pettiest violation of outstanding instructions .
Moreover , the Israeli occupation authorities have been barring family visits for more than 900 Gazan prisoners in Israeli jails under the pretext of the 18 - month harsh blockade which Israel has been imposing in Gaza .
The Red Cross asked Israel on several occasions to allow Gazans to visit their beloved ones , but to no avail .
Israel recently resorted to “ unorthodox tactics ” to harass Palestinian prisoners , including raiding and vandalising their homes and mistreating their wives and children , imposing hefty financial fines on them , and carrying out surprise searches usually after midnight .
Last week , lawyers and newly - released prisoners reported that the Israeli Prison Authorities have naked Jewish women , probably prostitutes , harass prisoners , especially religious inmates , through sexually suggestive behaviour .
A spokesman for the prison authorities refused to confirm or deny the revelation .

An old coat hanger bent into a wire loop and a good recipe for bubble mixture – some of the hi-tec essentials for producing great images
Our recent post on photographer Jason Tozer ’s images of bubbles prompted a fair few calls of “ how did he do that ? ”
Well , we were in his studio on the day of the shoot and can reveal all here …
Unexpectedly Intriguing !
We 're stealing part of our post title from Jim Hamilton , as he unofficially commissioned this tool in the comments section of his blog post !
In his post , Jim ran very convincing numbers that fly in the face of what Tim " Drive Less " Haab might prefer as a course of action and in doing so , provided a workable solution for those for whom less driving may not be a viable option .
Drawing on a 1998 study by the U.S. Department of Energy , Jim recognized that most gasoline - powered vehicles in the U.S. are operated at speeds at which they do achieve their peak level of fuel efficiency .
At highway speeds , for instance , the forces of aerodynamic drag can substantially increase the amount of fuel an automobile engine has to burn in order to sustain a high velocity .
A quick back - of - the - envelope calculation reveals that the amount of drag force that a car being driven at 75 miles per hour sees is some 33 % higher than the same car being driven at 65 miles per hour would see .
Meanwhile , as Jim notes , your car will burn more fuel at slower speeds compared to higher speeds , as automakers have optimized your car 's engine to operate most efficiently at higher speeds .
Somewhere in between lies a sweet spot into which you can get the most distance driving out for your fuel consumption dollar .
And you can do so all without having to spend any extra out - of - pocket money .
As an added bonus , if you do it right , you would even come out ahead of where you do today !
And that 's where the tool we 're introducing today comes in !
We 've reverse - engineered the Fuel Economy vs Speed average vehicle profile developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and combined it with Jim 's math to demonstrate how you can either positively or negatively affect your pocketbook by driving either faster or slower than you do today .
Just enter your driving data into the tool below .
We 'll assume that your standard ( non-hybrid ) automobile shares the same fuel economy vs speed profile as the DOE 's average vehicle , and then show how driving at a different speed than you do today for a given trip might affect your personal finances :
Driving , Gas and Trip Data Input Data Values Trip Distance [ miles ] Gasoline Price [ $ USD / gallon ] Typical Mileage Your Car Gets on Trip [ mpg ]
Your Normal Driving Speed for Trip [ mph ] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Speed You Would Consider Driving for Trip [ mph ] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Estimated Time , Fuel Consumption and Costs Calculated Results Normal Speed Alternate Speed Difference Time to Drive [ minutes ]
Fuel Consumed [ gallons ] Consumed Fuel Cost for Trip [ $ USD ] Equivalent Measures of Change in Driving Speed Calculated Results Values Your Vehicle 's Approximate Mileage at Alternate Speed [ miles per gallon ] Equivalent Cost of Gallon of Gas Consumed ( Compared to Normal Driving Speed ) Equivalent " Tax Free Income " [ $ USD per Hour ]
The cool thing about this tool is that you now have more weapons in your arsenal to help fend off the effects of higher gasoline prices !
Armed with this information , you can now make whatever trade - offs you might need to your greatest advantage .
For example , if getting the greatest possible savings is most important to you , you 'll want to drive at speeds that produce the lowest equivalent cost per gallon of gas compared to your normal driving speeds .
If you want to save gas money and time , you 'll want to drive at speeds that give you the greatest equivalent " tax free " income compared to how you drive today .
Speaking of which , if you want to find out what fuel saving tips really work , Edmunds.com has done a number of real world tests to find out .
Here 's the short list of what really works , with our brief comments :
Stop driving like a maniac .
Moderate driving is better than aggressive ( fast accelerating , brake slamming ) driving .
Update : Aaron notes in the comments at Jim Hamilton 's original post that brisk acceleration , as perhaps opposed to " aggressive " acceleration is desirable from a fuel economy perspective .
Lower speeds save gas .
Not necessarily .
The real secret is to drive consistently at speeds that enhance your vehicle 's fuel efficiency , compared to either driving much faster or slower , which is the whole point being made by our tool above !
Use cruise control .
You just can't adjust your speed as often or as efficiently as your car 's computer can !
Do n't idle your car for more than a minute .
Going nowhere burns a lot of gas ....
And here 's what does n't work :
Turning your car 's air conditioning off and opening windows .
People who suggest this option in the summer are not your real friends .
They really just want to see you suffer .
Inflating tire pressure to maximum recommended levels .
This is supposed to reduce your car 's rolling friction .
In reality , where fuel efficiency is concerned , your car just does n't notice it that much .
And that concludes our contribution to Jim 's public service announcement .
And Art Carden's .
And Bryan Caplan's .
Etc....

The guild has taken no strike vote .
It was widely expected to delay that step until it learned the outcome of a vote by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists , another actors ’ union with overlapping membership , on a tentative agreement with terms that guild leaders have called inadequate .
The vote results are expected to be released next week .
Set for release by Warner Brothers next Memorial Day weekend , the fourth installment in the “ Terminator ” series , this one directed by McG , began shooting in May .
Principal photography is not set to wrap until well into August .
The movie ’s cast , including the lead , Christian Bale , would be pulled off the set if actors chose to strike .
( Arnold Schwarzenegger is not starring . )
That would leave its independent producers  including the Halcyon Company and Intermedia Films  with half a movie and a tangled mess of equipment , sound stages , locations and crew members on hold .
Yet “ Terminator Salvation , ” like the “ Da Vinci Code ” sequel “ Angels & Demons ” from Sony Pictures and “ Transformers 2 ” from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks , has moved forward , largely because the film industry ’s needs have overwhelmed any conviction that actors will actually walk out .
“ Around April or May , they just started making plans , ” Lisa Strout , director of the New Mexico Film Office , said this week during an interview at her Santa Fe headquarters .
She was referring to a shift by studios , which earlier had promised to shut down rather than get into a game of chicken with the actors .
“ We ’re expecting a very strong summer and fall , ” Ms. Strout added .
Steve Koreivo passed up an opportunity to see Ohio State play at Penn State last October because he had tickets to a college football game of greater significance : Idaho at Nevada .
“ Now that might sound crazy , ” said Koreivo , 51 , who lives in Stanhope , N.J. “ But those were the last two teams left for me to see . ”
By watching the Vandals and the Wolf Pack , Koreivo accomplished a mission that took 32 years to complete .
He has watched each of the 119 college football teams in the Bowl Subdivision ( formerly Division I - A ) play in person at least once .
Koreivo plans to see Western Kentucky in 2009 when it becomes the 120th full member .
His endeavor is documented on his Web site , collegefootballfan.com .
“ Now that my goal has been achieved , my wife is asking me why I ’m still going to these games , ” said Koreivo , a purchasing manager in the chemical industry .

Influential former Pentagon official Richard Perle has been exploring going into the oil business in Iraq and Kazakhstan , according to people with knowledge of the matter and documents outlining possible deals .
Mr. Perle , one of a group of security experts who began pushing the case for toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein about a decade ago , has been discussing a possible deal with officials of northern Iraq ’s Kurdistan regional government , including its Washington envoy , according to these people and the documents .
It would involve a tract called K18 , near the Kurdish city of Erbil , according to documents describing the plan .
A consortium founded by Turkish company AK Group International is seeking rights to drill there , the documents say .
Potential backers include two Turkish companies as well as Kazakhstan , according to individuals involved .
AK ’s chief executive is Aydan Kodaloglu , who , like Mr. Perle , has been involved with the American Turkish Council , an advocacy group in Washington .
She did n’t respond to requests for comment .
Phyllis Kaminsky , who identified herself as the U.S. contact for Ms. Kodaloglu , said she herself was aware of the drilling plan but referred questions about it to Mr. Perle .
“ Richard would know the most , ” Ms. Kaminsky said .
“ He is involved , I know that . ”
People with knowledge of the discussions said they involve Alexander Mirtchev , a Washington consultant and adviser to the government of Kazakhstan , and an associate of his , Kaloyan Dimitrov .
Mr. Perle has attended events promoting the interests of Kazakhstan , an oil - rich nation whose ruler , Nursultan Nazarbayev , is involved in a long - running U.S. investigation of 1990s - era oil - company bribery .
Mr. Perle has publicly lauded President Nazarbayev as “ visionary and wise , ” according to a publication distributed by the Kazakh embassy in Washington .
Mr. Perle said by email that Mr. Mirtchev is a friend of his who once spent a night at his vacation home in France .
Mr. Perle said Mr. Mirtchev is “ justly … proud of his influence on the liberalization of the Kazakh economy . ”
Asked about pursuing oil concessions , Mr. Perle said , “ I am not involved in any consortium involving Mr. Mirtchev or Mr. Dimitrov , nor am I ‘ framing plans for a consortium ' ” involving either one .
He declined to elaborate .
Brian Shaughnessy , a lawyer for Mr. Mirtchev , said his client “ is not working on oil related projects in Kazakhstan or Kurdistan with Richard Perle , nor have they done any business deals of this nature . ”
A lawyer for Mr. Dimitrov did n’t respond to questions about oil discussions .
A spokesman for Qubat Talabani , the Kurdistan regional government ’s representative in the U.S. , confirmed that the envoy had been approached by Mr. Perle .
In a statement , Mr. Talabani said “ one of my duties …is to seek out potential investors for our new , growing economy in Iraqi Kurdistan as well as respond …to all legitimate requests for investment information . ”
Kurdish authorities have been granting oil - drilling contracts even though Iraq ’s central government and the Bush administration want them to hold off until a national oil law is passed .

7 Das Uberboy
Real Name : Unknown
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Uberboy 's name is being kept secret , presumably to protect the lives of his loved ones once Uberboy dons a mask and begins patrolling the streets of the world righting wrongs .
Superpower : Bona fide Super - Strength .
One day in 1999 a little baby boy was born in Germany , at first glance no different from any other .
But , the nurses noticed that the baby 's muscles were twitching and called the doctors to check him out .
We can only assume Uberbaby was showing off his guns to the ladies since when doctors examined the kid , they reached a unanimous conclusion : he was ripped as hell .
But how did this happen ?
Was there a fully equipped gym inside his mom 's uterus ?
No , as it turns out that 's an extraordinarily stupid idea .
It 's actually a real X - Men - style genetic mutation that changes the way his body controls muscle growth .
Cattle farmers have been intentionally using it for years to breed huge , muscular cows .

It 's not clear what will happen as Uberboy grows up .
All we have is this quote that is from The Washington Post despite sounding like it's from a Marvel origin : " But inasmuch as no one has ever encountered a child such as this boy or studied animals with defective myostatin genes into old age , his health -- and eventual strength - - remains unknown . "
What we do know is that at 4 - years - old , Uberboy could lift six times more weight than an average kid .
If in a few years you see a guy clubbing a bank robber in the head with a minivan , you 'll know what the hell is going on .
Scientists , instead of building giant laser shooting robots to hunt him down , decided to study him and try to find ways to use this new knowledge to help people with muscle dystrophy .
And by that we assume they mean turn regular people into muscle - bound supermen to populate their Army of Doom .
This is great .
1 . How will this affect battery life ?
Battery life on iPhone 3G is abysmal compared to the first iPhone .
2 . Does me no good ...
I applied to their dev program the day it was announced and I still have not been accepted .
Yes , I can get the SDK and such , but I have n't been granted the wonderful opportunity to pay Apple $ 99 to publish my app .
Guess nobody will ever see my push notification flashlight app .
That really is n’t the name of this recipe .
However , when I told Madison I was making Goulash she told me that The Beast from Maggie and Ferocious Beast ( it ’s a show on Noggin for those of you who do n’t have kids ) LOVES goulash .
Hence , we came up with this name , and I do n’t remember what its really called anymore .
As you can hopefully see from the picture on the left ( if not , Will has it all over his face and hair ) , this easy to make recipe is a huge hit with everyone here !
The Beast ’s Goulash Author : Lisa Ingredients 2 2/3 cups uncooked rotini pasta
1 lb ground beef
1 1/2 cups chopped celery ( about 3 stalks )
1 cup chopped onion ( about 2 medium onions )

Not everyone believes this but the emotional and mental aspects of a person , when combined , leads to better self improvement .
Emotions love to dominate
Our actions
Reactions
You will go to work angry ,
Tired , and your mind will wander .
Please Bookmark Us and enjoy it
even though we do not want it to happen sometimes .
The society often see emotions as a sign of weakness , so people are used to putting them aside and focusing on the rational aspects more and more .
No matter how strict and logical you may be , you will always feel .
One way or another , someone or something will get through you .
Positive emotions are a lifelong goal for many of us concerned about emotional health and self improvement .
What is more important ; the amount of money you made during your life or the times you laughed out of sheer joy ?
People tend to put their positive emotions behind their negative feelings .
This is one of the biggest problems that people come across during their lives .
There is no clear way to ignore a negative experience and try to replace it with a positive one .
Life just does not work that way .
For example , when you were a child , if your goldfish dies , you would be heartbroken .
Your parents will probably buy you another goldfish but the sorrow is still there .
Things get even more complex when you become an adult .
A fight with your spouse the night before will affect your entire day .
On the way home from work you will not notice the sun shining on you .
All this because that one negative thought has contaminated the way you perceive the reality around you .
In this moment you will realize finding a safe place to relax your mind will do wonders for your emotional and mental improvement .
That place is relatively easy to find .
It can be an actual place or an imaginary location .
The best idea is to totally lose yourself in it .
Let us say you have a problem on your mind and it just would not go away .
for example : Go bowling .
Do not know how ?
Just give it a shot .
Or do what ever gets you to that place
Get caught up in the game .
Your mind will drift away from the negative thoughts that dominated your last hours or days and start processing a whole new kind of information .
A safe haven can take many forms .
It can be a song , a movie , even a person or animal .
The main thing is allow yourself to get completely involved with this new activity .
You might still get flashes of the problem every now and then .
Ignore it and get even more absorbed in what you are doing .
When the bowling game , the song , or the movie ends you will abruptly return to reality .
You will probably want to retreat back to the safe place .
Do not do it .
The safe place exists only as a helping hand , not as a solution to your life 's problems , may it be a small or big .
It serves only as an escape route .
You will return from your safe zone with an increased energy level .
You will feel better about yourself and gain more confidence .
You will see that any issue can be resolved .
This is how a small escape from a harsh reality can increase your emotional and mental health .
If you want more techniques .
Then I suggest emotional freedom technique ebook .
EFT ( Emotional Freedom Technique ) , the Art of Tapping to Release All Negative Emotions Stored in Your Memory .
DR Callahan has been teaching EFT for several , but now he compiled his researches and knowledge in one book calledand by tapping to release all your negative emotional stored memory , you can eliminate all these problems .
Even as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama held their first joint campaign appearance today in New Hampshire , new polls show Obama is rapidly consolidating his sizable leads among women in general and Clinton supporters in particular .
Which means that John McCain chose the wrong day to make a wife - beating joke .
As the Huffington Post reported , McCain in an interview with the Las Vegas Sun headed for the gutter while trying to explain why he did not choose Republican Governor Jim Gibbons ( now in the midst of a messy divorce and previously the subject of sexual assault allegations ) as his Nevada campaign chair :
McCain : I appreciate his support .
As you know , the lieutenant governor is our chairman .
Q : Why snub the governor ?
McCain : I did n't mean to snub him .
I 've known the lieutenant governor for 15 years and we 've been good friends .... I did n't intend to snub him .
There are other states where the governor is not the chairman .
Q : Maybe it 's the governor 's approval rating and you are running from him like you are from the president ?
McCain : ( Chuckling )
And I stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago ...
At an Ohio press conference today , McCain only dug himself a deeper hole .
Trying to evade a reporter 's question about Barack Obama 's assertion that " John McCain , if he 's elected , is going to pick a Supreme Court that will roll back every gain women have made in the last 50 years , " a testy McCain claimed " I think my record speaks clearly for itself . "
And that could be a problem for Mr. Straight Talk .
As Jon at Perrspectives notes in a discussion about the supposed maverick 's failing outreach to Clinton supporters , leave aside for the moment McCain 's horrendous stands on the issues most important to women voters .
It 's McCain 's horrendous behavior towards American women , including those closest to him , that should send Clinton backers fleeing for the exits .
UPDATE : Many commenters seem to think that this is no big deal and that I 'm unfamiliar with the famous " gotcha " question of " When did you stop beating your wife ? " .
Those commenters are missing the bigger picture .
The response -- especially from a man with a reputation for being a hothead -- is wholly inappropriate , kind of like Donald Trump saying his daughter was hot .
A presidential candidate should not be making a joke like that which can be so easily taken out of context ... can you imagine how the media would have played and played it if Barack Obama - - or worse , Bill Clinton - - had said the same thing in the same context ?
Further , McCain is supposed to be trying to win over some of Hillary Clinton 's supporters ... the point of the post is asking how this kind of tone - deafness and latent misogyny ( again , something the blogosphere seems to find untroubling , which I personally find disturbing ) is going to attract those supporters .

" Dear Dennis ,
I was trying to understand the exact difference between Registry Cleaner software and Spyware Cleaner ( antiSpyware ) software .
Actually , I am confused between these two kinds of software .
Could you please tell me the difference , and also does the ' Adaware SE - lavasoft ' clean both the System Registry , or does it just clean Spyware ; if it does not clean the Registry , then what software do you suggest to clean the registry ?
I do appreciate your time .
Thank You . "
My response :
Before answering your question , first let me briefly explain what the System Registry does , incase anyone else is wondering .
In a nutshell , the System Registry ( otherwise known as the " Windows Registry , or " the Registry " ) is one of the most important components of the Windows Operating System .
The Registry is actually a database that stores everything about your computer , including : all your installed applications , hardware drivers , program settings , and the like .
Spyware typically embeds itself deeply into the System Registry ( among other areas ) .
Spyware Cleaners often modify the System Registry to remove an infection .
Alternatively , one might seek " manual Spyware removal instructions " when Spyware Cleaners can't remove a stubborn infection ; this often entails editing the System Registry by hand .
Having said that : Spyware removers such as Lavasoft Adaware are * not* dedicated registry cleaners , even though they clean part of the registry when removing a Spyware infection .
Comparatively , a dedicated Registry Cleaner , such as Registry Mechanic , can streamline the registry by removing orphaned entries .
Orphaned registry entries are no longer used by the system and essentially point to nothing , take up space , and otherwise cause congestion which slows down the operation of your PC .
In short : a streamlined registry = a smoother running machine because Windows relies heavily on the registry for almost every function .
A registry cleaner , such as Registry Mechanic , also works to resolve erroneous entries in the registry which may result in strange error messages .
Spyware cleaners do not .

Turley fears Dems will let alleged ' Bush crimes ' stay buried forever David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This George W. Bush has been more sparing than most presidents in handing out pardons , but it is starting to seem that the conclusion of his term in office may be marked by a generous use of the pardon power to let members of his own administration off the hook .
What 's more , constitutional lawyer Jonathan Turley believes that the Democrats will let him get away with it .
" The Democrats are trying very hard to show ... that they 're not going to re-open these issues and that the Bush crimes will remain buried for all time , " Turley told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Tuesday .
" It would start a new administration on the same level that George Bush left it .
And that 's a very sad thing . "
Turley was particularly concerned about a recent statement by law professor Cass Sunstein , an Obama adviser , that only " egregious " crimes by Bush officials should be prosecuted by an Obama administration .
" We 've had eight years of moral relativism and the avoidance of legal process , " stated Turley .
" And to start a major campaign with the suggestion that we 're going to distinguish between egregious and non-egregious crimes promises more of the same . "
" Did we just see accountability go out the window for good ? "
Olbermann asked Turley .
" That would probably wrap it up , " Turley replied .
" There are very few obligations that a president has to do under the Constitution , but one of them is not to violate the laws that he is supposed to enforce , " explained Turley .
" And what really concerns me about Cass Sunstein 's statement is that I do n't know what a non-egregious crime by a president or by an administration might be .
I think that all crimes committed by the government , particularly the president , are egregious . "
Turley further pointed to Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's refusal to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president , saying , " I do n't understand why some Democrats can't just simply accept a very straightforward proposition , that we 'll prosecute any crimes committed by this administration , an Obama administration , a McCain administration .
Because they 're crimes .
They 're all egregious . "
Sunstein 's remarks followed a story in last week 's New York Times , which reported that " several members of the conservative legal community in Washington said in interviews that they hoped Mr. Bush would issue such [ pre - emptive ] pardons .
...
They said people who carried out the presidents orders should not be exposed even to the risk of an investigation and expensive legal bills . "
Former Reagan Justice Department official Victoria Toensing -- recently best known for arguing that no crime was committed in the outing of former CIA officer Valerie Plame -- told the Times flatly , " The president should pre-empt any long - term investigations . "
Turley noted that the Bush administration does n't seem to care whether pre-emptive pardons would be an implicit admission of guilt .
" I think this would be the ultimate and final show of contempt by this president for the rule of law , " he concluded .
" I think this president would find it very consistent to say , ' I can tell prople to commit crimes and then I can pardon them for it . '
What is very troubling is that there appear to be Democrats on the other side who would welcome that . "

Video Voyeurs Under Fire for Taping Lesbians
Two college students who were taped during intimate encounter are taking action .
June 13 , 2008  --
Two female college students who were filmed during an intimate encounter without their knowledge are seeking justice .
Massachusetts College of Art and Design students Rosanne Strott and Emily Niland were in bed together when at least two young men videotaped them from a Wentworth Institute of Technology dormitory across the alley .
The video was uploaded to a shared Wentworth student network and had been in circulation for months before Strott and Niland discovered it in April .
" When I found out , I immediately vomited , " Strott said .
" It was a really strange thing for me .
I had never felt so violated without being touched before . "
Two of the men involved in the September videotaping have been identified by Boston police as Wentworth juniors David Cunha and David Siemiesz , who 've been charged .
According to a police account , the two men apparently filmed the incident from their dorm room , which directly faces Strott 's at Massachusetts College of Art and Design .
Cunha could not be reached for comment by ABC News or the Boston Globe , which first reported the story .
But Siemiesz told the Boston Globe this week that he sensed it was wrong to film the young women .
" I felt like it was kind of wrong , " Siemiesz told the Boston Globe , when asked to describe how he felt while taping the women .
" We did n't understand the severity of the situation when we were taping it . "
But that admission was not enough for Niland and Strott , who said they could n't believe the degree to which their privacy was violated .
" I was just disgusted , absolutely disgusted that someone would , first of all , videotape that , and second of all , distribute it to their friends , " Niland , 20 , said .
" It 's shocking that anybody would violate my privacy like that and not have any remorse for it . "
Taking It To Court
Niland and Strott , 19 , said they were dealt another blow last week when the Roxbury District Court assistant clerk held off on issuing a criminal complaint against the young men until Wentworth college finishes its investigation .
Wentworth would not comment on the investigation because it is ongoing but said investigators expected to finish within two to three weeks .
For Strott , a Wentworth investigation is simply not enough .
" I would really like to see them expelled from Wentworth , but there should be criminal action as well , " she said .
" What they did was a crime . "
Video Voyeurism in the Digital Age
Video voyeurs are nothing new .
But in the age of instant file sharing , improved video technology and the popularity of social networking sites , the effects for people on both sides of the camera have changed dramatically .
In January , for instance , a Mississippi man lost his appeal and was sent to prison for 15 years for videotaping a young woman in her home .
At least 34 states have made it a felony under some circumstances to film or distribute images of people in places where they expect a reasonable expectation of privacy .
In Massachusetts , which is n't one of those states , police said this kind of video voyeurism is illegal even when flimed from one 's own room .
Boston police have charged Cunha and Siemiesz with videotaping a person nude or partially nude without consent , a misdemeanor that could result in two to 2½ years in prison .
Wentworth Institute of Technology took down the shared network where the video appeared after becoming aware of its existence .
But the footage had already been downloaded on computers and e-mailed to students in other schools .
Strott said that she was " most disturbed " when a Boston University student she had never met before saw the video and told Strott she was " famous . "
A Common Problem ?
While the videotaping was a particularly extreme violation of privacy , Strott and Niland said that this kind of voyeurism is nothing new at their school .
Indeed , Siemiesz told the Boston Globe that " I did n't feel like a Peeping Tom .
I felt like this type of things happens a lot .
" This all would have never happened if their windows were closed . "
Strott said that she and her roommates had been pointed with lasers from students across the alley when they were changing before and that she had also heard of this happening to other students in her building during intimate acts .
The Massachusetts College of Arts and Design acknowledges the gravity of the incident .
" We respect the right to privacy of all our students , and we take the situation very seriously , " the school said in an official statement .
" We are confident that our colleagues at Wentworth and others do as well . "
Niland believes these violations are all too common , but that victims do n't speak out about them because they are ashamed .
She hopes that making her personal experience public will help change that .
" It takes a lot of power away from the victim when you can manipulate them with shame , " Niland said .
" Blinds open or not , I have nothing to be ashamed about .
I might be embarrassed , I might feel violated , but I have nothing to be ashamed about .
They are the ones who have something to be ashamed of . "
The cash from the milk accumulated , and Beatrice ’s parents decided that they could now afford to send their daughter to school .
She was much older than the other first graders , but she was so overjoyed that she studied diligently and rose to be the best student in the school .

An American visiting the school was impressed and wrote a children ’s book , “ Beatrice ’s Goat , ” about how the gift of a goat had enabled a bright girl to go to school .
The book was published in 2000 and became a children ’s best seller  but there is now room for a more remarkable sequel .
Beatrice was such an outstanding student that she won a scholarship , not only to Uganda ’s best girls ’ high school , but also to a prep school in Massachusetts and then to Connecticut College .
A group of 20 donors to Heifer International  coordinated by a retired staff member named Rosalee Sinn , who fell in love with Beatrice when she saw her at age 10  financed the girl ’s living expenses .
A few years ago , Beatrice spoke at a Heifer event attended by Jeffrey Sachs , the economist .
Mr. Sachs was impressed and devised what he jokingly called the “ Beatrice Theorem ” of development economics : small inputs can lead to large outcomes .
Granted , foreign assistance does n’t always work and is much harder than it looks .
“ I wo n’t lie to you .
Corruption is high in Uganda , ” Beatrice acknowledges .
A crooked local official might have distributed the goats by demanding that girls sleep with him in exchange .
Or Beatrice ’s goat might have died or been stolen .
Or unpasteurized milk might have sickened or killed Beatrice .
In short , millions of things could go wrong .
But when there ’s a good model in place , they often go right .
That ’s why villagers in western Uganda recently held a special Mass and a feast to celebrate the first local person to earn a college degree in America .
Fawzia al - Kurd 's home is nothing special .
She has lived within its walls for the past quarter of a century , in the heart of East Jerusalem 's Sheikh Jarrah district .
The house is tidy .
But at first glance , it would not appear to be worth $ 10 m .
That is the sum that the al - Kurd family claim they were offered by Israeli buyers as an incentive to move on , a figure confirmed by their lawyer .
Fawzia refused to make a deal , whatever the price .
It would have hurt her ' integrity ' to take it and leave , she said .
So last week she received an eviction notice , based on an arcane legal claim to the site that her husband first called home in 1956 .
If she and her family are forced to leave as a result , ultra-Orthodox Israeli settlers from a company called Nahlat Shemoun - linked to a nearby Jewish shrine - will take over half of the house .
Settlers have already occupied her illegally built extension .
The Kurd house may soon be draped with Israeli flags - as is another a handful of metres distant - and Arab East Jerusalem will have shrunk perceptibly once more .
' Their objective [ in trying to evict me ] is political ' , said Fawzia .
' They are claiming as theirs something that is not . '
The story of Fawzia 's house reflects the larger battle for the future of Jerusalem , a city contested with an intensity and urgency unmatched anywhere else in the world .
In the interminable saga of the Middle East peace process , agreement on the ' final status ' of the Holy City remains as elusive as ever .
As Fawzia pondered her eviction notice , Gordon Brown arrived in town to tell the Knesset that he favoured Jerusalem as a shared capital of two separate states : Israeli and Palestinian .
US presidential hopeful Barack Obama followed , and adroitly back - tracked on a recent assertion that the city , as the capital of Israel , ' must remain undivided ' .
' Final status , ' he said , would be for the ' two sides to negotiate ' .
What is at issue now is what has been at stake since Israel 's foundation and before : how can two peoples ' claim on a city as the centre of their national ambitions ever be reconciled ?
Since the ' uniting ' of Jerusalem in the Six Day War of 1967 , when Israeli troops overran Jordanian positions on the east side of the city , Palestinians have largely watched , furious but impotent , as Israeli construction in Arab East Jerusalem has proceeded apace .
Israeli flags dotted around Palestinian quarters bear defiant testimony to Jewish insistence on a unified city and capital .
And despite the evidence that some now in Israeli politics , not least Vice - President Haim Ramon , would like to see the city shared , with special arrangements made for the so - called Holy Basin at its heart - home to the major shrines - the ' facts on the ground ' point to a concerted Jewish expansion into the Palestinian east of the city .
Small settlements - like those encroaching on Sheikh Jarrah and other neighbourhoods - have set their sights on the east 's strategic points , a series of stepping - stones linking Jewish West Jerusalem via East Jerusalem with the Old City .
Larger ones such as Har Homa and Ma'ale Adumim have expanded as ever - growing buffers which hem in the Arab neighbourhoods , linking the Israeli settlements ever closer to the centre .
All that is left for Arab Jerusalemites is resistance in the Israeli courts , the dream of a capital and the hope that frightens Israelis most - that their increasing demographic advantage will save the city for them in the long run .
' Final status ' notwithstanding , the city is divided already - psychologically , culturally and politically .
There is the Jewish west of the city with its vast hinterland of malls and cafes and street musicians .
There is the beleaguered Arab quarter of the Old City , where large families cram into improbably small apartments .
And there are places where the two sides do meet - like the Mamilla Mall just outside the Old City 's Jaffa Gate , where wealthier Palestinians mingle , under the pavement umbrellas , sipping orange juice and black coffee with secular and religious Jews - and among the apartment blocks up on French Hill near the Hebrew University .
In recent months Jewish West Jerusalem has been forced to re-examine its assumptions about its Arab neighbours - which it had believed posed considerably less threat than those living on the West Bank - after three attacks launched by residents living in the city 's east , all of them apparently unrelated to organised militant groups .
There was a ' copycat ' attack last week in which a resident of East Jerusalem went on the rampage with a bulldozer on the eve of Obama 's visit , leaving two Israelis injured and the driver shot dead by a settler .
A similar incident earlier this month made headlines around the world and led to calls for a security crackdown in the east of the city .
In the immediate aftermath of last week 's attack , one elderly Jew at the scene asked anyone who would listen whether it was not time to ' screen '
Arab employees of the municipality more carefully .
The comments follow the revelation last week that in the first six months of this year 71 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem had been arrested on terrorism charges , double the number for last year .
The struggle for the city 's heart and soul seems to be accelerating even as polls show that the majority of Israelis - if not Jewish Jerusalemites - say that they would make concessions on the city as part of a lasting and final peace .
Palestinian suburbs have been separated from the inner city by Israel 's separation wall , while the new light railway , which when completed will connect West Jerusalem to Pisgat Ze'ev , will also separate Palestinian neighbours , further fragmenting the city 's Arab population .
The key battle , however , is the one being fought in East Jerusalem over the corrosive issue of who is entitled to reside inside the city and to hold the blue ID card that brings with it entitlement to healthcare and social services .
The growing proliferation of ' facts on the ground ' in East Jerusalem , combined with a lack of opportunity for Palestinians to build , has depressed Ziad al - Hammouri of the Jerusalem Centre for Social and Economic Rights .
Hammouri says that fewer than 5 per cent of permits to build in East Jerusalem are processed , and that when they are they are often too expensive for Palestinians to be able to afford them .
The result is an inevitable pressure not to remain .
' You know I feel Jerusalem is a hopeless case .
I really feel that it is finished , ' he says .
' The Israelis seem to have a plan to connect the west side of the city through the east to the west of the Old City via building and settlement .
It will push Palestinians to leave the city . '
The perception of a siege mentality in many Palestinian neighbourhoods is understood by some Israeli analysts , among them Professor Shlomo Hasson , who is a lecturer in geography at the Hebrew University and a former town planner .
' The building of the separation wall has split the east of the city from the West Bank , ' Hasson said .
' It blocks the exit opportunity for the Palestinian population and makes them feel besieged .
The result is a blockade of Palestinians in the city .
' They are not concerned so much about nationalism , ' he suggests .
' They are concerned now about survival . '
In the Arab quarter of the Old City those words are borne out in street after street .
Many families who kept tiny homes in the Old City also had larger houses beyond what is now the separation wall .
But fear of losing their Jerusalem IDs has led to an influx of people into these lanes to preserve their status as Jerusalemites , resulting in terrible overcrowding .
To preserve that status requires the production of multiple proofs that the resident 's ' centre of life ' is in Jerusalem , not elsewhere .
In a small courtyard behind a metal door just off the Via Dolorosa lives the extended family of Abu Azim , an electrician , and his brothers - 40 people in all - occupying a series of tiny apartments .
' It is too expensive to live elsewhere , ' Azim says .
' And if we find somewhere else our IDs are at risk .
So people stick to their small shops to keep their residency status . '
As we talk an unseen woman shouts down : ' Do n't mention me !
I 'll get in trouble with the ministry . '
A neighbour - who asks to be identified only as Umm Ibrahim - describes what kind of trouble .
' My daughter got married three years ago .
She has a child and lives in a room next door , ' he said .
' When she went to apply for her child allowance they came to make a site visit to prove that she was here .
She was out - at the market or the kindergarten .
Now they say she does not reside here and is not entitled to her allowance . '
Hasson believes that one outcome is that those on the ' Israeli side ' of the wall may undergo the same process of assimilation as Israeli Arabs did .
But Israel Kimhi , head of research at the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies , and a former town planner , is not optimistic that a solution to the problem of Jerusalem can easily be found .
' It 's best to talk to God on that one , ' he said , only just managing to laugh .
' There is no question about it .
The wall has caused a lot of problems for East Jerusalem .
It is harming the economy of the entire city .
These acts of violence by those from East Jerusalem this year , it comes from individuals , not groups .
But it is a bad indicator . '
Earlier this month the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , claimed that the Israeli - Palestinian peace process was edging ever closer to a successful outcome .
Many Palestinians raised their eyebrows at that suggestion .
But on all sides it is acknowledged that the future of Jerusalem remains intractable .
In the battle to come , one new force may be coming to the fore .
The ultra-Orthodox - once a minority in the city - have swelled in numbers and political power , now controlling the municipality .
More than 56 per cent of Israelis generally are ready to give up control of Arab neighbourhoods in Jerusalem in exchange for peace .
But 76 per cent of the ultra-Orthodox are against it .
And if the majority of the ultra-Orthodox are committed to keeping hold of the Holy Basin - Jerusalem 's heart and home to the major shrines of three religions , Judaism , Islam and Christianity - for others it is simply a question of nationalist sentiment .
' Just look at the facts , ' said Barbara Noble heatedly in Ben Yehuda Street .
' I do n't think that there is anything left for us to give back .
We give back terrorists [ to Hizbollah in Lebanon ] including one who clubbed a child to death .
And they give us back dead soldiers .
' There is always this insistence that we can make things right in the end by giving something up .
But when was the last time Britain or the US gave up some of their territory ?'
A Navigable Arctic Northeast and Northwest Passages Both Free of Ice
For the first time ever , both the Northwest and the Northeast Passages are free of ice .
Shipping companies have been waiting for this moment for years , but they will have to wait a little while longer before they can make use of the Arctic shortcut .
I dislike electronic toys for children , such as so - called “ educational ” toys made by LeapFrog .
As I have stated before , I think that children learn more from playing with wooden blocks than any battery operated gizmo can teach them , but what about other tech devices , such as iPods and digital cameras ?
At what is it appropriate for a child have these “ grown up ” toys ?
Ever since my daughter could hold our camera , we have shared it with her .
Last year , her grandmother decided to buy her a digital camera for her birthday .
At first , we looked at several digital cameras designed for children ; however , in the end , we decided to buy her a real camera that would last her many years .
The quality of children ’s digital cameras is poor , and we have made a commitment to giving gifts that last our children as many years as possible .
As an eco mom , I wo n’t buy junky toy emulations of technology designed for children that will only break and end up in a landfill .
As an artist and a photographer , I felt a good camera would help my young child develop her artistic expression .
Her compositions amaze me , and her photographs help me view the world through her “ lens ” .
I can see what is important or interesting to her by what she photographs .
For two years now , my daughter has been asking for an iPod .
Even though we live in a very small community , and she only goes to school with seven other children in a one room schoolhouse , iPods are the hottest things around .
For two years I have stalled , not only because of the expense , but because of the risk of hearing loss associated with ear buds and headphones .
Then I realized , I got my first stereo in second grade for my Catholic first communion .
It was a gem of an eight - track , and my first tapes were Adam Ant ’s “ Strip ” , John and Yoko Ono ’s “ Double Fantasy ” , and John Denver ’s “ Greatest Hits ” .
Music has always been a big part of my life , as you can tell from my first eclectic choices , and my daughter has already formed her own opinions about music ( her favorite song is off Music for a Green Planet ) .
Since Eco
Dad does n’t use his iPod , we decided to let her have it and gave her a docking speaker to play it in her room .
This has been a GODSEND , as her little brother and her spend hours in her room listening to music and playing now ( with blocks ! ) .
We do n’t have cell phone coverage in our area , and given the safety concerns regarding cell phone useage , I doubt I would let my seven - year - old daughter have her own phone .
At some point , I can see it would be convenient to be able to reach her at anytime when she is older and away from home , but at what age is this appropriate ?
I would n’t want to prematurely encourage the disconnect from family that happens when the social world takes over for teenagers by giving my child a cell phone .
Mark Randall , vice president of the toy and baby store at Amazon.com , explains why kids want tech devices , “ Children want to emulate their parents , whether they are on the phone , using a digital camera or on their computers and online . ”
My ipod and camera are a big part of my life , as is my laptop , so it only make sense my daughter would want to share these devices .
My daughter has n’t asked for her own laptop yet , but I suppose that is next .
I do n’t want tech devices to take my children ’s childhood away prematurely , so I ask our readers :
What age do you think is appropriate for a child to enter the world of technology ?

Last weekend Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) appeared on CBS ’s " Face the Nation " with Bob Schieffer .
Sen .
Lieberman used his appearance to promote his fear - mongering , pro-war agenda and to attack Barack Obama .
That in itself is not terribly surprising since Lieberman , the former Democratic Vice - Presidential nominee , has come out in support of John McCain .
In fact , Lieberman has been one of McCain ’s most visible surrogates thus far and some have even speculated that Lieberman could once again run for Vice President , only this time as a Republican .
The attack on Barack Obama in itself was reprehensible , but what is worse is the back - stabbing context in which it took place .
First , here ’s what Sen. Lieberman said to Bob Schieffer :
" Our enemies will test the new president early .
Remember that the truck bombing of the World Trade Center happened in the first year of the Clinton administration .
9/11 happened in the first year of the Bush administration . "
Lieberman implied that if we elect Barack Obama , the terrorists will attack .
To add effect , the Senator from Connecticut prefaced this comment by discussing John McCain ’s and even Hillary Clinton ’s credentials as potential commanders - in - chief .
The timing of this comment was also suspicious , coming on the heels of comments made by chief McCain strategist , Charlie Black , in which Black claimed a terrorist attack against the United States would be good for John McCain ’s campaign .
The incitement of fear of a terrorist attack seems to be a theme of McCain ’s Campaign this week .
What makes all of this worse , however is the previous relationship that Senator Obama had with Senator Lieberman .
In 2006 , Sen. Lieberman was about to face the political fight of his life .
Lieberman ’s unapologetic support for the Iraq
War made him vulnerable to a potential primary challenger in his re-election bid for his Senate seat .
Sure enough , that challenger came along in the form of Ned Lamont , the president and founder of a small telecommunications network in the Northeast .
Lamont was the anti-war candidate and Lieberman sensed that he was in very real danger of losing his Senate seat before the General Election even began .
So , Lieberman did what any smart Democrat at the time would do .
He called rising political superstar Barack Obama and enlisted his help in convincing Connecticut Democrats that despite his stance on the war , Lieberman was the only right man for the job .
Except Lieberman did n’t just ask for Obama ’s support , he begged .
According to Greg Sargent over at Talking Points Memo , a former Lieberman Campaign official who was involved in securing Barack Obama ’s support described the Illinois Senator ’s favor to his candidate like this :
" It was a favor as huge as we could have gotten -- it was like a drowning man getting thrown a life preserver .
Just when Ned [ Lamont ] was trying to establish himself as a credible alternative on the war , Barack Obama came in and said , ‘ Hey , I disagree with him on the war , but you should send him back to the Senate . ’ "
That same campaign official also said :
" We needed him [ Obama ] to strongly validate us as a candidate that liberal Democrats should not desert .
We went to the Obama operation with a very urgent plea for him to come out for us . "
Barack Obama did not owe Joe Lieberman any favors , and he agreed to support Lieberman in an attempt at Party Unity , something Lieberman clearly rejected just months later when he lost to Lamont in the primary and then promptly registered as an Independent in order to run against the Democrat in the General Election .
Lieberman went on to win his Independent bid for re-election and retained his seat .
He continued to caucus with the Senate Democrats , allowing them to gain a one seat majority over the Republicans and therefore control of The Senate .
But since 2006 Lieberman ’s Joe-mentum has been carrying him farther and farther away from the Democratic Party , to the point where now , he has endorsed a Republican for President , and he has viciously and unfairly attacked a man who made a huge effort , with major political risks , to help him out .
Barack Obama ’s stance on almost all issues has not changed since Lieberman used the Senator from Illinois to help convince the voters of Connecticut to re-elect him .
If anything , Obama has drifted slightly closer to Lieberman ’s political world - view .
The only thing that has changed between Barack Obama and Joe Lieberman is that now Obama is running against Lieberman ’s candidate .
The point is not that Lieberman should not be allowed to support McCain , the point is that if he had even an ounce of integrity , he would highlight McCain ’s strengths and be tactful enough not to launch these attacks against his recent ally that are filled with fear - mongering and wild and unfounded speculation about the results that Obama ’s policies may produce .
Joe Lieberman is a back - stabber and sadly , this is a prime example of why if you want a friend in Washington , you better get a dog .
For a little more on this story , here 's liberal blogger , Michael J.W. Stickings take titled " Joe Lieberman , Jerk Extraordinaire . "
And also , here is a news story with clips of Obama speaking in support of Lieberman :
My Bloody Valentine
2007 was the year of reunions , but 2008 does n’t fall too much behind neither , with more and more previously iconic acts getting back together .
One of these acts is also the shoegazing pioneers My Bloody Valentine , a true sensation of the late ’ 80s .
Back in November , frontman Kevin Shields , announced the band ’s reforming and moreover fueled rumors that a new LP is in the making .
Soon after fans were ecstatic to find out the band will tour through much of Europe , but at the same time fans over the ocean were left brokenhearted .
Well my dear American friends , you can now rejoice as My Bloody Valentine is coming to play in New York City , this fall !
That ’s right folks , you ’ve heard it right .
For the first time in 16 years the band will set foot on US soil to perform .
The reunited My Bloody Valentine will headline and curate a new upstate New York branch of the All Tomorrow ’s Parties festival on Sept. 19 - 21 .
According to the Daily Swarm , MBV will also perform in six to eight additional U.S. cities .
Playing alongside MBV , at the NY leg of the ALl Tomorrow ’s Parties festival , is a stellar lineup , comprised of over 30 awesome acts , including :
Built to Spill performing Perfect From Now On
Meat Puppets performing Meat Puppets II
Thurston Moore performing Psychic Hearts
Tortoise performing Millions Now Living Will Never Die
Shellac
Mogwai
Polvo
Fuck Buttons
Autolux
The Drones
Low
Wooden Shjips
Edan with Dagha
Thee Silver Mount Zion Orchestra
Awesome , indeed .
In the spirit of the British ATP tradition , the NY leg will also be very intimate , to the despair of the thousands of MBV fans from the US .
Only 3000 people will be allowed to enter the festival and all attendants must stay on the site for three days , staying in motel and hotel rooms .
No single day passes will be available .
Tickets go on sale this Friday , April 25 , at the ATP website .
It 's a condition that can make leaving one 's house a terrifying ordeal .
Asking someone out on a date can induce panic attacks .
And the thought of speaking up in class or at a meeting can be so frightening that sufferers will try to avoid the situations entirely .
It 's called social anxiety disorder or social phobia , and while often debilitating — a new survey underscores its harmful effect on relationships — it 's treatable .
At times , the disorder is difficult to distinguish from normal shyness , and some experts claim it 's overdiagnosed and overtreated .
Most estimates place the number of Americans with social phobia at about 15 million , but critics counter that those estimates include many people who are merely shy , not sick .
Puzzlingly , people with social anxiety are often gregarious and outgoing individuals — in certain contexts .
Many have little trouble interacting with close friends and family in familiar settings .
But when they are taken out of this comfort zone , their reactions can take a damaging toll on their relationships , education , and careers .
" Those with social phobia tend to marry later in life , if at all , and regularly have trouble dating for fear of embarrassment , " says Jerilyn Ross , president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America .
The April survey , which Ross 's association conducted among 287 people with the disorder , found that 35 percent thought their social phobia caused them to avoid intimacy with their partners .
Yet it also highlighted the benefits of getting help :
After receiving treatment , 59 percent reported improvements in their romantic relationships .
Other research has found that socially phobic people tend to avoid participating in classroom activities and may drop out of school or college entirely .
Many are underemployed and may even forgo career advancement if it means assuming public speaking roles or managing other employees .
As with many psychological conditions , the symptoms of social phobia lie on a spectrum of severity .
Some people experience the anxiety only in specific situations — talking on the phone , for example , or using a public restroom .
Others have a more generalized phobia that makes most kinds of human interaction stressful .
Still others may be comfortable onstage and yet have trouble with one - on - one encounters .
Some sufferers even have physical symptoms , including severe blushing , hand tremors , dizziness , excessive sweating , and heart palpitations , says Ross .
Paralyzed .
At the heart of the condition , say experts , is not merely shyness but a paralyzing fear of humiliation or being judged negatively as boring or unintelligent .
A shy person will eventually acclimate to an anxiety - inducing situation .
Someone with pathological and pervasive social anxiety will not .
Such fear of stumbling socially or embarrassing oneself in front of others may not be entirely unfounded , a recent study suggests .
Researchers found measurable deficits in social interaction when subjects with social phobia were asked to hold one - on - one conversations .
On the other hand , the study , published online in the February edition of the Journal of Anxiety Disorders , also found that the same people tend to overestimate their shortcomings when giving a speech or performing in front of a crowd .
Some experts contend that the definition of social anxiety disorder is overly broad , sweeping up those with normal personalities and rational fears .
Northwestern University research Prof. Christopher Lane , for example , says the line between shyness and social phobia should be drawn to " limit diagnosis to those chronically impaired . "

Citing " brutal crimes , " President Bush on Monday authorized the execution of an Army private convicted of a spree of rapes and murders in North Carolina in the 1980s .
It was the first time a commander in chief has affirmed a military death sentence since 1957 , half a century ago .

The solider , Ronald A. Gray , committed the crimes in the Fayetteville area while stationed at Fort Bragg .
Gray has been on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , for 20 years .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement on Monday evening :
" President Bush this morning accepted the recommendation of the Secretary of the Army to approve a sentence of death for Army Private Ronald A. Gray , affirming the sentence that resulted from a general court martial for multiple charges of murder and rape committed while serving as a member of the Armed Services .
While approving a sentence of death for a member of our Armed Services is a serious and difficult decision for a Commander - in - Chief , the President believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted .
Private Gray was convicted of committing brutal crimes , including two murders , an attempted murder , and three rapes .
The victims included a civilian and two members of the Army .
Because additional legal challenges are expected in this case , we will decline to comment further .
The President ’s thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these heinous crimes and their families and all others affected . "
Here 's a White House backgrounder on the issue :
The military death penalty
• In the military justice system , a member of the Armed Forces cannot be executed until the President “ approves ” the death sentence .
Thus , unlike the civilian context , where the President may be asked to exercise his clemency authority to stop an execution , in the military system , the President effectively orders the execution .
This is an important distinction .
• This is very rare .
The last President to act on a military death sentence was John F. Kennedy in 1962 , when he commuted a death sentence to confinement for life .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the last military execution in 1957 ; it was carried out in 1961 .
• In accordance with the UCMJ , the Secretary of the Army submitted a formal recommendation to the President recommending he approve the sentence .
Facts of this case
Army Private Ronald A. Gray engaged in a spree of four murders and eight rapes in the Fayetteville , North Carolina , area between April 1986 and January 1987 .
• Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes ( in addition to other offenses ) in North Carolina State court ; he was sentenced to three consecutive , and five concurrent , life terms .
• Gray was then tried by general court - martial at Fort Bragg ( 82d Airborne Division ) for separate offenses involving three women , two of whom served in the U.S. Army , one of whom was a civilian .
...
• In April 1988 , the court - martial convicted Gray of premeditated murder ( two specifications ) and unanimously sentenced him to death .
Since then , his sentence has been approved by his command , the Army Court of Military Review , and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces .
The Supreme Court has denied certiorari .
• In accordance with the UCMJ , the Secretary of the Army recommended the President approve the sentence .
• Although not required by statute , the President asked the Attorney General to confirm that the President had full legal authority to approve , commute , or remit the death sentence .

DETROIT 
For the last two months , as scandal swirled on and on , residents here knew that their mayor , Kwame M. Kilpatrick , was under criminal investigation .
Still , when a county prosecutor announced charges against him on Monday , Detroit was left reeling at the scope and seriousness of them .
Mr. Kilpatrick , 37 , was charged with eight felony counts , including perjury , obstruction of justice , conspiracy to obstruct justice and misconduct in office .
He turned himself in to the authorities just after 5 p.m. , and was released on his own recognizance .
He has vowed not to resign .
The prosecutor , Kym L. Worthy , painted a portrait of a mayor who had lied under oath , fired a police official and agreed to pay $ 8.4 million in taxpayer money to settle lawsuits  all to prevent the public from learning of his personal entanglements , including a romantic relationship with his former chief of staff , Christine Beatty .
Emphasizing that her investigation of Mr. Kilpatrick , who is married and has three sons , was not a private question of “ lying about sex , ” Ms. Worthy said : “ Public dollars were used , people ’s lives were ruined , the justice system was severely mocked , and the public trust trampled on .
This case is about as far from being a private matter as one can get . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan will start a trial system for carbon trade this year , Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Monday , unveiling a climate change policy that set a goal for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , but stopped short of what environmentalists say is key .
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda leaves after a news conference at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo June 9 , 2008 .
Japan will start in the autumn a trial system for carbon trade , Fukuda said on Monday , unveiling a new climate change policy that set a goal for cutting greenhouse gas emissions for 2050 -- but not for 2020 .
REUTERS / Issei Kato
Japan will aim to cut its emissions by 60 - 80 percent by 2050 and announce an interim target sometime next year , Fukuda said in a speech one month before hosting a G8 summit , where global warming is high on the agenda .
Tokyo will also contribute up to $ 1.2 billion to a new multilateral fund with the United States and Britain that will help developing countries fight global warming , Fukuda said .
The world ’s fifth - largest emitter , Japan estimates it can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 14 percent by 2020 from current levels , Fukuda said , in a nod to pressure to set a firm interim target as host of the G8 summit next month .
“ When talking about the near future , we no longer have the luxury of encouraging others or spending time playing a game of setting targets for political propaganda , ” said Fukuda .
Environmentalists , however , were disappointed .
“ The G8 leaders need to make concrete steps forward to a low carbon world , and Japan ’s Prime Minister Fukuda needs to push hard to trigger that leadership , ” said Kathrin Gutmann , WWF Climate Policy Coordinator , in a policy statement .
“ In this light , Fukuda presents only a blurred vision and the lack of a 2020 target for emissions reduction is utterly disappointing , ” Gutmann said in a statement .
WWF chided Fukuda for setting the base year for reductions at current levels rather than 1990 , as used by the European Union , because Japan ’s emissions have risen since then .
Japan hopes to clinch agreement on a “ shared vision ” to halve global emissions by mid-century at the Group of Eight summit , where a climate change session will also be attended by big emerging countries such as China and India .
“ It is impossible to achieve this goal without the participation of major emitter countries and unless all the countries of the world take part in some form , ” Fukuda said .
TRIAL CARBON TRADE
The European Union , which has set a target of reducing emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , and developing countries argue rich nations should take the lead by setting bold 2020 targets for reducing emissions that cause global warming .
But the United States , a top emitter along with China , has said it will only accept binding emissions curbs on condition major emerging countries also agree , something they have so far refused to do so .
Washington ’s stance , however , is likely to change after a new president takes office in January 2009 .
Opposition party lawmakers and environmentalists had urged Fukuda to take a bold stance on an interim target to persuade industry and voters to get serious about climate change and convince emerging countries to join a new global framework .
On Monday , the opposition Democratic Party charged his proposals fell short .
“ The content is extremely meager , ” said Democratic lawmaker Katsuya Fukuda , sponsor of a bill to set a mid-term target to cut emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels .
“ It is completely unclear how he will confront the G8 summit with such content and what he will try to achieve . ”
Fukuda said Japan would introduce in the autumn a trial system for carbon trading , seen as one effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
But he steered clear of giving a date for the launch of a full - scale trading scheme .
Unlike the European Union , which imposes a cap - and - trade system to bind polluters to mandatory emissions limits , Japan has encouraged voluntary reduction pledges from industries .
Some Japanese industries , such as steelmakers , oppose a European - style system , saying it would hurt their global competitiveness .
Fukuda proposed raising the proportion of Japan ’s energy from “ zero emission power ” sources such as nuclear , solar , wind and hydro power to more than 50 percent from the current 40 percent , and said an environment tax should be considered as part of overall tax reforms to be debated later this year .
Japan is the only one among the world ’s top five emitters under pressure to meet a Kyoto Protocol target .
Domestic industries still resent the tough target of reducing emissions by 6 percent set for Japan under Kyoto , which binds 37 industrialized nations to cut emissions by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .

The Silicon Zoo is a collection of logic cells found in silicon chips .
The collection is provided freely for the study , comparison , and reverse - engineering of silicon implementations .
Each logic cell on silicon chips performs a simple function such as inverting a single bit ( INV ) , computing the logical AND of two one - bit values ( 2 - AND ) , or temporarily storing a bit ( flip - flop , FF ) .
In most modern chips , the logic cells are picked from a library of cells , called standard cell library .
These libraries vary for different manufacturers and process generations .
The Silicon Zoo wants to make as many as possible of these libraries available to researchers .
Contributions to the collection are greatly appreciated .
We welcome the submission of pre-parsed cell images like those provided below , but also images of the lower two layers of silicon chips from which we can extract the cells .

Diving Into …
I started using Emacs as a Linux IDE for a C++ project .
At that moment I was also using IntelliJ IDEA for my personal Java project and wondered if I could have a comparable environment for C++ under Linux .
My first try was to use Eclipse with CDT , but the experience was frustrating — CDT was slower than IDEA and in addition uncomfortable .
The main reason for slowness was that CDT tried to do honest parsing of all our project and imported headers .
Also it was failing miserably on some non-trivial parts due to high complexity of C++ itself .
Obviously , I needed something more lightweight , albeit not very primitive .
By that time I already had had a positive experience of Windows development using only FAR ’s built - in editor accompanied by some plugins , mainly Colorer and AutoCompletion .
So , what about simple yet powerful programmer ’s editors for Unix ?
As everybody knows , there are lots of Unix - based editors that real programmers use , of which two can be viewed as IDEs : Emacs and Vim .
I chose Emacs based on editors comparison done by Eric Raymond in “ The Art of Unix programming ” book and Steve Yegge ’s evangelical posts on Emacs ( see links in the last section ) .
Mainly , I did n’t like the idea of interaction modes in Vim .
As Jef Raskin said in his book “ The Humane Interface ” : “ Modes are a significant source of errors , confusion , unnecessary restrictions , and complexity in interfaces ”
This made my choice .
So I grabbed “ Learning GNU Emacs ” and “ GNU Emacs Manual ” and dove into .
It took just about an hour do learn the basic stuff .
What amazed me first in Emacs is the idea of ubiquitous text buffers .
Everything in Emacs is a text buffer .
Thus , you can trivially transfer contents between them and use the same commands for editing and navigation .
And the greatest benefit is that you can use search just everywhere .
This is much more productive as opposed to “ common ” IDEs , where you have tree and list views , pop-up boxes , wizards and other stuff , all having different interaction behavior and abilities .
The Real Project
Having a confidence that Emacs is really useable and convenient , I started using it for a C++ project .
Again , I was pleasantly surprised how good is Emacs at C++ coloring and indenting .
Then , I attached etags , and this covered 90 % of my auto - completion needs .
Really , you do n’t need to do a sophisticated parsing of source code in order to do good enough auto -completion .
So , using Emacs , I was able to do comfortable editing of C++ sources , Makefiles , SQL files , shell scripts and all other stuff that we used in the project .
It was also easy to compile the project and navigate back to errors in the source code , do project - wide searching and perform non-trivial renamings with regexp search and replace .
I was also talking to our version control system from Emacs .
And all this by means of text buffers .
Extensions , Extensions , Extensions !
In parallel to my main project , I was also studying functional programming in Haskell and Scheme .
Immediately I found excellent Emacs editor extensions for both ( in Emacs , extensions are called “ modes ” , but they are not those evil interaction modes that are used in Vim ) [ Note : I ’ve seen people complaining that Emacs ’ modes are “ evil modes ” too , because your keyboard gestures are dependent on the current mode .
That ’s correct .
But in Emacs mode is connected to a buffer , and you know in what buffer you are now .
While in Vim , you switch mode , while staying in the same editing window .
I find this confusing , and other people too . ]
This is what really amuses me in Emacs — name any programming language , version control system , feature of shell , whatever — and you always can find an extension to Emacs which allows you to interact with it .
Really , “ good ol ’ C-x M-c M- butterfly … ” in action !
For examples of Emacs extensions varieties , take a look at EmacsWiki .
Thousands of people are publishing their extensions and short code snippets in Emacs Lisp that can solve any particular task .
What ’s really amazing is the wise Emacs internal architecture that allows those myriads of extensions to work together .
Eclipse tries hard to achieve this , and the concept of plugin extension points is really similar to “ hooks ” in Emacs , but …
But it ’s almost impossible to write a useful Eclipse extension with just a few lines of Java code — too many low - level overhead .
While in Emacs , you just write several lines of Emacs Lisp code and it works , and you can publish it , and everybody can just paste your code , and now it works for them , too ( well , of course , I ’m idealizing — but often this is true ) .
You ’ll never finish learning Emacs — it is a really deep barrel of extensions .
I always find something new in it .
For example , here are my recent discoveries : the windmove package that allows you to navigate between tiled editing buffers easily ; mmm for text coloring and indenting in mixed - language files like html with javascript , jsp , C++ withinline assembler , etc ; good ol ’ ediff that has features of highlighting changes inside line and dynamically re-comparing files as long as you editing one of them .
And these are really well - known and obvious extensions , for using Emacs as an editor .
But I know people who literally live in Emacs .
They read mail and news in it , organize their time and projects , surf the Web , write their blog posts , chat using IM extensions and use many - many more features including awesome Emacs ’ interface for visually impaired people .
How Should I Start ?
So , what can you read to study Emacs ?
You can begin with inspiring Steve ’s articles : “ My .emacs file ” , “ Tour de Babel ” ( here search for “ Lisp ” ) , “ Effective Emacs ” , “ Saving Time ” ; read introductory pages of EmacsWiki ; take a look at blogs dedicated to Emacs : minor emacs wizardry and M-x all - things - emacs ; and do n’t forget about built - in “ info ” system in Emacs itself .
As for the books , you can grab Richard Stallman ’s GNU Emacs Manual for free , and read through “ Learning GNU Emacs ” and “ GNU Emacs Pocket Reference ” .
And the last tip : as Emacs is very keyboard - intensive , the first thing that you need is a good cheatsheet for keyboard combos .
Although I ’ve seen many over the Web , the one that I like the most is that I made myself .
Here it is .
Happy emacsing !
MUMBAI , India ( Reuters ) - Hollywood ’s Warner Bros. , which owns the rights to the Harry Potter movies , is suing an Indian production company whose new film is called “ Hari Puttar : A Comedy of Terrors , ” the studio said on Wednesday .

The studio had started proceedings against the makers of “ Hari Puttar ” over similarities to the international film and literary phenomenon , said Warner Bros. spokeswoman Deborah Lincoln .
“ We confirm that we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled ‘ Hari Puttar ’ , ” Lincoln told Reuters in an e-mail .
“ Warner Bros. values and protects intellectual property rights , ” she said .
The producers of “ Hari Puttar ” said they had registered the title more than two years ago and the film bore no resemblance to the “ Harry Potter ” franchise .
“ All I can say is that the title is not at all similar to Harry Potter and nor is our story line , ” said Munish Purii , chief operating officer of the film ’s producers , Mirchi Movies .
Purii said the Delhi High Court began hearing the case on Monday .
“ Hari Puttar ” , slated to open in cinemas on September 12 , is the story of a young boy fighting two criminals who are trying to steal a secret formula devised by the boy ’s scientist father .
In October last year , an Indian court allowed a community group in the eastern state of West Bengal to create a replica of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , rejecting a petition from author J.K. Rowling for copyright breach .
The British creator of the boy wizard Harry Potter and Warner Bros. , which controls the rights to the series in India , had sought 2 million rupees ( $ 50,000 ) in compensation from the group , which had erected the structure for a Hindu festival .
Warner Bros. is a unit of Time Warner Inc .

Obama learns from past Dem missteps
CHICAGO — When Barack Obama looks out at the Democrats assembled in Denver this week , he 'll see a handful of party luminaries who sought the White House before him : Al Gore , John F. Kerry , Howard Dean , Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton .
They 'll be publicly lauded , of course , as revered elder statesmen and integral players in the party ’s present .
But Obama has run a campaign that views each in decidedly different terms : as cautionary tales , examples of an old politics to be avoided at all costs .
Advertisement
Obama ’s campaign , staffed by veterans and close observers of past Democratic efforts , has focused on avoiding many of the pitfalls of campaigns past — the internal dramas , the charges of inauthenticity and the dramatic promises that masked organizational chaos .
After decades of party musings about a different kind of Democrat , Obama has actually run a seminally different campaign — one steeped in a decade of Democratic failure and ambivalence toward the successes of the Clinton years .
Aides say that in many ways , he had no choice — that the very audacity of Obama 's historic candidacy freed him to mount an effort that pays little or no attention to the standard Democratic narrative .
Senior aides say it was clear from the beginning of the primary season that voters would either accept him on his own terms — a young black man with an unusual , if inspiring , story — or they would reject him .
He could n't be shoehorned into the familiar categories , and there was no use trying .
And so the campaign was driven by a series of unconventional choices .
They took a Howard Dean - style movement and turned it into a bureaucracy managed by old political hands .
They ignored the early handwringing of donors and the Washington media .
And they viewed leaks and internal drama as a profound threat .
" Obama and [ chief strategist David ]
Axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right — and what they did wrong , " said Bob Shrum , an architect of the Kerry and Gore campaigns .
Obama 's primary victory left his aides confident that they will succeed where predecessors failed .
The Chicago brain trust is also willing to resist another round of Beltway concern about whether he 's moved fast enough to define John McCain or whether he 's punched hard enough , whether his message is too vague and conceptual for the moment .
Obama , Axelrod and campaign manager David Plouffe will treat the other Democrats in Denver with respect .
But do n't expect them to take their advice .
Dean ’s shadow
The shadow looming most ominously over Obama 's campaign was that of then - Vermont Gov. Howard Dean , who four years ago had harnessed the same Democratic outrage at the Iraq war to create an online fundraising sensation and the feeling of a national movement , but failed to win a single major primary .
Obama 's campaign moved swiftly to take what was best of Dean 's campaign — its energy and its grasp of the potential of the Internet .
But while Obama 's aides spoke of their " movement , " they left the movement 's chaotic ethos at the door of their crisp Chicago office tower .
From the beginning , his organization was crisply bureaucratic and detail - oriented , with staff neatly divided into discrete tasks .
When senior adviser Anita Dunn joined the campaign last January amid the chaos of the early primaries , she was surprised to find a " gigantic room " beside the reception area full of staffers working solely on the primaries of February 5 and beyond .
From Dean , Obama also learned the difference between an online phenomenon and a concrete campaign .
" There were lessons we really learned from Howard Dean 's primary , "
said Steve Hildebrand , Obama ’s deputy campaign manager .
" You ca n't just have this Internet presence — it has to be real on the ground . "
And so every aspect of Obama 's campaign — even the giant rallies and enthused students that recalled Dean 's early success — was connected firmly to the very earthly realities of retail politics .
The campaign ’s website , My.BarackObama.com , encouraged supporters to create local groups and to participate in local volunteer activities -- something that would account for much of Obama 's success in states from Minnesota to Connecticut , where organizers arrived to find full - scale volunteer operations in place .
The giant rallies , too , served a practical purpose :
They were tools for gathering the names , telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of potential voters and volunteers , put on a form as the price of admission .
As the sprint turned toward a marathon in January 2007 , Obama 's message - makers concluded the rallies could be counterproductive , the image of the candidate exhorting a crowd from a high stage turning off some women and other voters .
But his organizers insisted the rallies were key to building their ground organization .
The compromise , an aide said : Rallies would only be held at night , too late for images on the evening news .
Keeping control
Democrats look back on Kerry 's 2004 campaign with a sense of missed opportunity .
But Obama ’s view of Kerry 's campaign was more nuanced .
He adopted Kerry 's central strategic insight in the primary , that the race would be won or lost in Iowa .
And , after Kerry 's early , key endorsement , Obama made Kerry himself a key surrogate on issues of national security .
But Obama 's aides also saw Kerry as driven to bad , even panicky , decisions by the whims of the Washington media , whose opinions they approach with a self - conscious disdain .
Obama notably resisted waves of conventional wisdom in the primary :
It was written that he needed to work harder to consolidate black support , that he needed to attack Clinton more frontally and that his all - or - nothing gamble on Iowa was folly .
Kerry has cited one of his own decisions , in particular , as a mistake -- the choice , consistent with the principles of The New York Times editorial board and with Kerry 's stated views , to accept public financing for the general election .
It was a choice that cut off what some thought would have been a massive financial advantage against President Bush .
Even more crucially , it also meant that Kerry 's ground operation would be outsourced to a new group called America Coming Together , which was barred by law from coordinating with Kerry 's own campaign .
Elements of his media campaign were outsourced to another group , The Media Fund .
Obama 's aides view these moves as Kerry relinquishing control of key aspects of his campaign , and as a mistake they would not repeat .
Obama insistently shut down attempts to build new organizations to attack McCain on television .
And the central ground organization for the fall campaign is also taking place in - house , hitting a crescendo with a massive Labor Day voter registration drive .
Authenticity
Kerry , Gore and Democratic candidates stretching back to Michael Dukakis and beyond were beset by the perception -- fed by the GOP -- that they were inauthentic , effete poseurs pretending to be regular Americans .
They lost control of their public images behind photographs -- Dukakis in a tank , Gore in a sweater and Kerry in a hunting vest – evidence of Democrats trying too hard to mimic the values of the voters they were trying to court , and instead repelling them .
Obama -- again , perhaps because of his biography and heritage -- had no real option other than to be who he is .
" He 's just comfortable in his own skin , " said an Obama aide .
That comfort -- and the candidate 's own ability to communicate -- has also allowed Obama to respond to crucial challenges head on .
In what was probably the most dangerous moment of the year , television networks this spring broadcast sermons by Obama 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , which harshly criticized America and brought the specter of racial grievance -- which Obama 's candidacy sought to banish -- rushing back .
Instead of trying to bat down the controversy or ride out the storm , Obama went big .
Summoning the national press to the Constitution Center in Philadelphia , he delivered a Whitman - esque command performance .
He denounced Wright 's words without ( yet ) denouncing the man , and returned to his biography and to his message of racial reconciliation in a way that seemed to satisfy his critics and which essentially ended the conversation .
Unlike his Democratic predecessors , Obama defended the core of who he is , rather than looking for a different costume to wear .
" It was a genuinely difficult moment in the campaign for them and him , and he did a risky thing -- gave an extremely well - received speech and came out of it stronger , if anything , " said Howard Wolfson , who was then a chief strategist for New York Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama 's main rival .
" There are very few politicians who would have been capable of that -- not only demonstrating the willingness to confront it , but also coming out ahead of it at the end of the confrontation . "
The Clintons
Obama 's relationship with the Clintons is profoundly ambiguous .
An admirer , and imitator , of some of their muscular politics , he was also a critic of Bill Clinton 's centrist compromises in the 1990s .
The implicit premise of his campaign and its slogan -- " Change You Can Believe In " -- was that the Clintons had turned politics into a cynical game .
In reaction to Clinton campaigns past and present , Obama and Plouffe established an early organizational construct : " No drama . "
The phrase governed their hiring -- they sought competence and collegiality over showy brilliance and ego -- and it was posted on signs around the office as the campaign got under way .
Obama 's staff was drawn largely from a quadrant of the Democratic Party that either never fell in love with the Clintons or had long fallen out of love with them .
At times , Obama campaigned explicitly against the Clinton era of the 1990s .
But Obama ’s inner circle also took lessons from its pugnacious rivals .
Starting almost as soon as the campaign launched , Obama showed a willingness to attack stories from news organizations as varied as Fox News and the Los Angeles Times with detailed rebuttal campaigns .
Obama 's campaign also arrived at the general election ready for partisan war -- though they 'd eschewed the term " war room , " popularized and embraced by successive Clinton campaigns , as inconsistent with Obama 's intent to remake politics .
Still , on a recent day in the packed pair of horseshoe - shaped cubicles that make up his communications department , Obama 's aides were engaged in a very Clintonian act : Destroying the reputation of an author who was trying to destroy Obama , Jerome Corsi .
Working the phones , they ensured that Corsi would be harshly challenged even by CNN's Larry King , who read Corsi 's most inflammatory past statements , provided by the campaign and its allies .
It was an echo of a tactic perfected by the Clintons : the all - out , no -holds - barred attack on an attacker .
And the Obama campaign has earned , in the end , the grudging admiration of Clinton 's aides , who watched him chart a steady course as her campaign veered and zigzagged day after day , depending on who had the upper hand in its endless internal struggles .
" They were very good at waking up every day and knowing what they wanted to say about Barack Obama , and what they wanted to say about us , " said Wolfson of the primary .
" It seems like a basic thing , but we proved it was n't so easy . "

Prompted by claims of hacking and a policy of censorship , Google may finally quit China April 10 2010 , Google “ may announce ” on March 22 .
An unnamed company source told the China Business News on Friday the announcement next week was imminent .
However , Google officials declined to confirm or deny reports .
update ( 2010-03 -22 ) : A reporter waiting on front of , but Google China keep mute
“ I have received information saying that Google will leave China on April 10 , but this information has not at present been confirmed by Google , ”
the unnamed agent told the newspaper .
“ Accusation that the Chinese government participated in cyber attack , either in an explicit or inexplicit way , is groundless and aims to denigrate China , ”
the spokesman said .
“ The United States often gossips about other countries ’ policies on administering the Internet , but at the same time it takes similar measures to minimize the spread of illegal information , ”
“ That shows that the United States takes a strict line with other countries , but not with itself . ”
the news service wrote in the editorial .
Anyway , it is not only Google ’s China problem , but also China ’s Google problem .
We can NOT say Google is right or China is right , but Google as a company with mantras “ Do n’t Be Evil ” , the time of cast this event is doubt .
What we need to do is only document the fact .

As Denver dignitaries gathered Tuesday for Mayor John Hickenlooper ’s State of the City address , City Council president Michael Hancock introduced singer Rene Marie to perform the national anthem .
But that ’s not what she did .
Instead , Marie performed the song “ Lift Every Voice and Sing , ” which also is known as the “ black national anthem . ”
She sang the words to the tune of “ The Star - Spangled Banner . ”
The proceedings then continued , without the customary singing of the national anthem , leaving some in the audience bewildered .
Marie said she made the change without informing the mayor ’s office , which had expected her to sing “ The Star - Spangled Banner . ”
“ I pulled a switcheroonie on them , ” Marie said later .
She explained that she decided months ago to switch the lyrics because she will no longer sing the national anthem .
She said that she made the decision after a Russian broadcaster interviewed her and asked her what it was like to be an American .
At that moment , she said , she realized that as an African - American she at times feels like a foreigner in her home country .
“ And I was going to correct her , ” Marie said .
“ And I realized I did n’t feel like an American , and that bothered me a great deal . ”
Marie , a popular jazz singer and actress who performs with the Shadow Theatre Company , said she never informed the mayor ’s office she planned to switch the lyrics because she did n’t think they would let her go through with it .
Hickenlooper said he had talked to Marie about the situation after her performance .
“ She was very apologetic , ” the mayor said .
“ She meant no disrespect , and she was singing an artistic expression she thought represented love and hope for her country . ”
Others were less charitable .
“ I was surprised , ” said Hancock , who said he thought Marie should have cleared her plans with the mayor ’s office .
“ But you go on with the show . ”
By Tuesday afternoon , Hancock had received several telephone calls from citizens and the media .
The anthem , written by James Weldon Johnson and first performed in 1900 , was intended to commemorate nearly 40 years of freedom for blacks in America on the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln ’s birthday .
The song , which appears in many church hymnals including the United Methodist hymnal , is an expression of hope and faith , and an appreciation and lamentation for the suffering of prior generations .
Still , Councilman Chris Nevitt said the replacing of the national anthem ’s lyrics with those written by Johnson “ was the weirdest damn thing . ”
And Councilman Charlie Brown took to the airwaves , appearing on several radio stations to discuss the issue .
“ There is no substitute for the national anthem , ” Brown said .
“ I was shocked .
It just puts everyone in an awkward position . ”
All you need to know about today ’s Audi tuning
In this article we would like to enlist today ’s most widely used IT computerised tuning methods for Audi car tuning .
The highly personalised mapping , remapping and tuning can really turn your car into becoming YOUR car with all the features you like and having all consumption highly optimised .
Let ’s see what the options are for you .
ECU Remapping
The Engine Control Unit is the brain in today ’s cars : making sure everything works as expected , controlling and checking the functionalities all the time .
While factory provided ECU systems are generally set to work on around a 70 - 80 % of the total capability in order to stay on the safe side , customised tuning can turn this all around for you .
ECU remapping is great if you want to optimise your fuel consumption , modify speed limit and make the car go smoother without the need for excessive gear changes and so much more .
Remapping has several ways and subtypes but most importantly it only needs a software , never a hardware .
Chip tuning
Chip tuning basically equals today ’s ECU remapping but for older cars .
As the ECU system is only a general solution in today ’s cars , chip tuning is generally used for all cars manufactured before 2000 .
Chip tuning is a tried and tested method and it ’s the first appearance of using IT to optimise performance .
EGR Removal
EGR valves have a key role when it comes to fuel combustion and consumption .
When they get clogged because of carbon deposits they may affect consumption negatively and also these valves are not a necessity in today ’s cars .
The removal of the EGR system is a very positive step for a car and it generally happens with the stopping of the exhaust ’s input and reprogramming of the ECU to maintain the fuel ’s economy even in lowered temperatures .
DFF Removal
Diesel Particular
Filter in cars serves to decrease air pollution by providing a solid filter to the exhaust fumes .
However this filter needs a constant servicing and changing otherwise it can badly affect the car ’s overall abilities .
The changing procedure is often and costly , however the removal has lots of advantages :
Decreases consumption and makes the car more economical
Cost effective
A bad filter can cause car ’s engine to work with a lowered power .
This wo n’t happen if the DFF is removed .
Speed Limiter removal
Your car ’s factory settings will enable you to use about 80 % of its full potential .
If the limiter is removed , then you will be able to use your Audi Quattro to its full potential .
This is great if you are a skilled and avid driver of it you deal with professional or amateur racing of any sort .
Bearing risks :
Apart from all the benefits today computerized tuning can provide , there are several factors you need to keep in mind before you decided on having your car tuned , meaning especially the insurance of your car and keeping data private when you sell an iphone 8 that you owned with sensitive data Consult with your insurer and some tuning specialists to be aware of all the benefits and risks in the same time .
How Fair is Monopoly ? by Ian Stewart
Reproduced with permission of the author
This fact is no doubt one reason why the game 's designers put cheap properties near the start .
The expensive but lucrative Park Place and Boardwalk are several turns around the board , by which time , presumably , the probabilities have evened out .
But have they ?
To tackle that question , I shall introduce another simplification .
Instead of considering a throw of both dice , let 's imagine that they are thrown one at a time .
Each player is allowed to make two moves : a " ghost " move , in which he ignores where he lands , and a real move .
Similarly , we will adopt a mathematician 's view of the game board .
For convenience , number the squares from zero to 39 .
Square 40 " wraps around " to square zero , Go , and we can think of the numbers as being counted modulo 40 - meaning that anything larger than 39 can be replaced by what remains when it is divided by 40 .
Now imagine a single player making repeated throws of a single die , moving accordingly .
What is the probability of landing on a given square after a given number of throws ?
We would hope that when the number of throws becomes large , this probability nears 1/40 , for any of the 40 squares .
In other words , they should all become equally likely .
The way to find these probabilities is to see how their distribution " flows " over time .
Each distribution can be represented by a sequence of 40 numbers , giving the probability of landing on each square individually .
At the start of the game , the player is on square zero ( GO ) , having a probability I ( or always ) .
So the probability distribution is 1 followed by 39 zeros .
After a single ghost toss , the distribution becomes 0 , 1/6 , 1/6 , 1/6 , 1/6 , 1/6 , 1/6 , O , ... , 0 that is , the probability of landing on the first six squares is 1/6 , and the player cannot reach any others .
Notice that the total probability of 1 - originally concentrated on square zero - has been split into six equal parts and distributed to the squares that are one to six units farther along .
This procedure is general .
After each toss of the die , the probability on a square is divided by six .
These six equal parts flow clockwise on to each of the next six squares .
So on the next throw , the 1/6 on square one is redistributed as follows : 0 , 0 , 1/36 , 1/36 , 1/36 , 1/36 , 1/36 , 1/36 , O , ... , 0 .
The 1/6s on squares two through six are similarly redistributed but shifted along one step each time .
Finally , we add up the probabilities that have landed on each particular square .
For example , square six acquires 1/36 from each of the first five sequenc-es , but 0 from the last one , so the total is 5/36 .
The final result is 0 , 0 , 1/36 , 2/36 , 3/36,4/36,5/36 , 6/36 , 5/36,4/36 , 3/36 , 2/36 , 1/36 , O , ... , 0 . Notice that this distribution matches our earlier expectations for tossing two dice .
But now we can continue .
On the third ( ghost ) throw , we multiply every term in the new sequence by 1/6 , then shift it up one , two , three , four , five and six terms .
Next , we add the numbers on each square .
It 's easy to write a computer program to calculate these probability distributions one by one .
The results are repre- sented in the illustration at the right , starting with the " triangular " distribution obtained on the second throw .
On each subsequent throw , the probability graph moves one step forward in the figure .
You can see that the probability peak moves several squares to the right at each step .
( In fact , on average , it moves 3.5 squares , the mean value of the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . )
If you continue the computer simulation , you find that the triangular shape eventually flattens out , and all the values are pretty much the same .
But why does the simulation follow this pattern ?
For an explanation , we need Markov 's theory , which provides a systematic method to track the probability flow .
it begins by writing down the so - called transition matrix for the first figure .
The matrix , call it M , is a square table having 40 rows and 40 columns , each numbered zero through 39 .
The entry in row r and column c of the table is the probability of moving , in one step , from square r to square c .
The value is 1/6 if c = r + 1 , r + 2 , ... , r + 6 ( modulo 40 ) , and 0 otherwise .
Next comes a technical calculation carried out using M .
The result shows that after many throws , the probability does indeed approach 1/40 for any given square .
So , with a little help from Markov , we can prove that a game as complicated as Monopoly is fal ; in the sense that - in the long run -no particular square is more or less likely to be landed on .
Of course , the first player still has a small advantage , but this bonus is mitigated by the finiteness of his or her bank balance .
I am 71 years old .
In my youth the strongest ( pleasant ) fragrance of any flower was that of the carnation .
Modern carnations do n't seem to have that fragrance ; some seem to me to have no odor at all .
If I were a cynic I would suspect that florists had bred the odor out of carnations for their own selfish purposes .
With age my upper frequency threshold of hearing has decreased , and it is possible that my other senses have been impaired as well .
If that is not the case , however , I would like to find some heritage seeds for old fasioned carnations .
I am retired and I have plenty of time to stop and smell the roses , but they do n't satisfy me .
Thanks in advance for any help you can give me .

Mike Huckabee , speaking a bit more freely in his new capacity as a Fox News contributor , used a " Hannity & Colmes " appearance last night to offer a candid assessment of McCain 's performance last week .
Huck used two words that dare not speak their name in McCainworld : " Dole " and " anger : "
ESTRICH : He went to a German restaurant that did n't go very well .
He had the time at the cheese counter at the grocery store .
I mean , I have to tell you , if I were John McCain I would be glad I did n't get a lot of press last week .
What is wrong with the McCain campaign ?
HUCKABEE : Well , I think he missed an opportunity .
Instead of having some fun with it and showing sort of a buoyant 'hey , do what you 've got to do , let Obama go play basketball , I 'm solving problems . '
Do it with tongue and cheek .
Frankly , I thought he looked more like Bob Dole in the last days of the 1996 campaign saying ' look at the record , look at the record , ' and there was some anger and sense of frustration there .
He should n't show that .
He needs to show that nothing is getting to him , it 's rolling off his back , and I think he missed an opportunity to do that last week .

“ The Sunni -Shiite conflict is in the open now , it ’s been triggered and operationalized , ” said Paul Salem , director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut .
“ This is a deep wound , and it ’s going to have serious repercussions if it ’s not immediately and seriously addressed . ”

 The blood is boiling here ,  he said .

Lebanese political leaders have tried hard to avoid stirring sectarian sentiment , emphasizing the religious diversity of both the governing coalition and the Hezbollah - led opposition movement .
In a speech delivered the day before Hezbollah supporters seized the capital , the group ’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah , went out of his way to deny that Sunni - Shiite tensions were an issue .
But after Hezbollah supporters humiliated Lebanon ’s main Sunni political leader , Saad Hariri  crushing his weak militia , forcing his party ’s television station off the air and burning two of his movement ’s buildings  many of Mr. Hariri ’s supporters were enraged , and they said they would look to another Sunni leader who would help them fight back .
That sentiment has stirred fears that moderate , secular Sunni leaders like Mr. Hariri could lose ground to more radical figures , including the jihadists who thrive in Lebanon ’s teeming Palestinian refugee camps .
Fatah al Islam , the radical group that fought a bloody three - month battle with the Lebanese Army in a refugee camp in northern Lebanon last year , issued a statement Thursday condemning Hezbollah ’s actions .
The group also gave a warning : “ He who pushes our faces in the dirt must be confronted , even if that means sacrificing our lives and shedding blood . ”
A New Kind of Conflict
The Sunni-Shiite conflict is relatively new in Lebanon , where the long civil war that ended in 1990 revolved mostly around tensions between Christians and Muslims , and their differences over the Palestinian presence in the country .
But after Iran helped establish Hezbollah in the early 1980s , Lebanon ’s long - marginalized Shiites steadily gained power and stature .
They have also grown in numbers .
Although there has been no census since 1932 , Shiites are widely believed to be more numerous than Sunnis or Christians , the country ’s other major groups .
Tensions began to rise in 2005 after Syrian troops ended their long occupation of Lebanon , leaving the country ’s factions to broker a power - sharing agreement .
Hezbollah established a crucial alliance with Michel Aoun , a former general and one of the country ’s most powerful Christian leaders , to oppose the Western - backed government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , a Sunni .
In late 2006 , sectarian street battles began taking place in mixed Sunni - Shiite neighborhoods , mostly among young followers of Mr. Hariri ’s Future Movement and the Amal Party , a Hezbollah ally .
The fighting was prompted by hard feelings after Hezbollah ’s withdrawal from the cabinet and its subsequent campaign to bring down Mr. Siniora , who refused to step down despite the resignation of all the cabinet ’s Shiite ministers .
This is the fourth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lecture six , which is on the topic of Order Statistics .
The problem of order statistics can be described as following .
Given a set of N elements , find k- th smallest element in it .
For example , the minimum of a set is the first order statistic ( k = 1 ) and the maximum is the N - th order statistic ( k = N ) .
Lecture six addresses the problem of selecting the k-th order statistic from a set of N distinct numbers .
The lecture begins with discussing the naive algorithm for finding k- th order statistic -- sort the given set ( or array ) A of numbers and return k- th element A[k ] .
Running time of such algorithm at best is O ( n·log ( n ) ) .
Erik Demaine ( professor ) presents a randomized divide and conquer algorithm for this problem ( my second post covers divide and conquer algorithms ) , which runs in expected linear time .
The key idea of this algorithm is to call Randomized - Partition ( from previous lecture ) subroutine on the given array and then recursively conquer on the partitioned elements on the left and right of the chosen pivot element .
Here is the pseudo code of this algorithm :
Randomized - Select( A , p , q , k ) // finds k- th smallest element in array A [ p..q ] if p == q return A[ p ] r = Randomized - Partition ( A , p , q ) n = r - p + 1 if k == n return A[r ] if k < n return Randomized - Select ( A , p , r - 1 , k ) else return Randomized - Select ( A , r+1 , q , k-n )
The lecture continues with intuitive and then mathematically rigorous analysis of the algorithm .
It is concluded that the expected running time of this algorithm is O(n ) and the worst case ( when the Randomized - Partition algorithm chooses bad pivots ) is O ( n2 ) .
At the last minutes of the lecture a worst - case linear time order statistics algorithm is presented .
This algorithm was invented by five scientists - M. Blum , R. W. Floyd , V. Pratt , R. Rivest and R. Tarjan .
I found the original publication of this algorithm by these gentlemen : Time Bounds for Selection .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The concept may be radical , but it might just have to be if the worst predictions of climate change are realized .
The Lilypad as imagined by architect Vincent Callebaut moored off the coast of Monaco .
more photos »
The Lilypad , a floating ecopolis for climatic refugees , is the creation of Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut .
" It is " he says , " a true amphibian , half aquatic and half terrestrial city , able to accommodate 50,000 inhabitants and inviting biodiversity " .
Callebaut imagines his structure at 250 times the scale of a lilypad , with a skin made of polyester fibres coated in titanium dioxide which would react with ultraviolet light and absorb atmospheric pollution .
The Lilypad comprises of three marinas and three mountain regions with streets and structures strewn with foliage .
" The goal is to create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature , " said Callebaut .
With a central fresh water lagoon acting as ballast , the whole construction would be carbon neutral utilizing solar , thermal , wind , hydraulic , tidal and osmotic energies .
With high density populations living in low - lying areas -- The Netherlands , Polynesia , Bangladesh -- the ecopolis , its creator believes , could be the answer to mass human displacement that global warming is predicted to cause .
In its most recent 2007 report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels will rise by 60 - 90 cm during this century .
Some climate scientists like James Hansen think that if greenhouse gas emissions are n't checked then those figures might be much , much worse .
In practice , Callebaut envisages the Lilypad sailing the seas , following currents like a futuristic cruise ship .
He also thinks that it could " widen sustainability in offshore territories of the most developed countries such as Monaco " .
You can't help thinking that the well - heeled residents of the Principality might have a thing or two to say about 50,000 climatic refugees bobbing around in the harbour , but you cannot fault Callebaut 's ambition .
His previous creations -- showcased on his website -- reveal an imagination working at full throttle with sustainable design lying at its heart .
Anti-Smog -- a prototype of depolluting architecture and Ecomic -- an ecotower rising up from the foundations of Aztec ruins are two further examples of his eco design credentials .
The Perfumed Jungle , Fields in Fields and The Fractured Monolith may sound like titles for various genres of novel but are , in fact , names for sustainable projects in Callebaut 's growing portfolio .
Now all he needs is to find someone brave enough to build on the vision he has created .

David Perry was in Belfast to pick up an honorary doctorate
Computer games experts have devised a way to beat the pirates who cost their industry a fortune .
Manufacturers plan to give away their games for free .
The scheme was revealed by one of the industry 's leading entrepreneurs , Lisburn - born David Perry .
His best - known creations include Enter the Matrix , Earthworm Jim and Messiah .
" The next big thing will be free games , " he said .
Mr Perry said the plan " sounds crazy " but it had already proved successful in Asia .
" They had so much piracy that they decided to stop charging for the games .
Instead , there 'll be a charge for things you might want to use in the game , " he said .
" Your character might have a plain white T - shirt .
If you wanted a nicer one you could have it for a dollar .
Or perhaps you could buy a magic sword for a knight for a dollar . "
He said this approach had already proved successful in Asia .
" It 's going to turn our industry on its head and I want to see the same thing happening in the USA and Europe . "
Mr Perry was speaking in Belfast after being awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen 's University for his pioneering work in computer game development and design .
In 2002 his Shiny Entertainment company was sold to Atari for $ 47 m .
Games piracy is a huge problem according to ELSPA , the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association .
A spokesman said : " It 's estimated that over £ 2bn is lost every year by UK industry to games software counterfeiters . "
CHILDREN have a lot to contend with these days , not least a tendency for their pushy parents to force - feed them omega - 3 oils at every opportunity .
These are supposed to make children brainier , so they are being added to everything from bread , milk and pasta to baby formula and vitamin tablets .
But omega - 3 is just the tip of the nutritional iceberg ; many nutrients have proven cognitive effects , and do so throughout a person 's life , not merely when he is a child .
Fernando Gómez - Pinilla , a fish - loving professor of neurosurgery and physiological science at the University of California , Los Angeles , believes that appropriate changes to a person 's diet can enhance his cognitive abilities , protect his brain from damage and counteract the effects of ageing .
Dr Gómez - Pinilla has been studying the effects of food on the brain for years , and has now completed a review , just published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience , that has analysed more than 160 studies of food 's effect on the brain .
Some foods , he concludes , are like pharmaceutical compounds ; their effects are so profound that the mental health of entire countries may be linked to them .
Last year , for example , the Lancet published research showing that folic - acid supplements — sometimes taken by pregnant women — can help those between 50 and 70 years old ward off the cognitive decline that accompanies ageing .
In a study lasting three years , Jane Durga , of Wageningen University in the Netherlands , and her colleagues found that people taking such supplements did better on measures of memory , information - processing speed and verbal fluency .
That , plus evidence that folate deficiency is associated with clinical depression , suggests eating spinach , orange juice and Marmite , which are all rich in folic acid .
Another suggestion from Dr Gómez - Pinilla 's review is that people should eat more antioxidants .
That idea is not new .
Antioxidants are reckoned by many to protect against the general effects of ageing .
Vitamin E , for example , which is found in vegetable oils , nuts and green leafy vegetables , has been linked ( in mice ) with the retention of memory into old age , and also with longer life .
Dr Gómez - Pinilla , however , gives the antioxidant story a particular twist .
The brain , he observes , is peculiarly susceptible to oxidative damage .
It consumes a lot of energy , and the reactions that release this energy also generate oxidising chemicals .
Moreover , brain tissue contains a great deal of oxidisable material , particularly in the fatty membranes surrounding nerve cells .
That suggests , among other things , the value of a diet rich in berries .
These have been shown to have strong antioxidant effects , though only a small number of their constituents have been evaluated in detail .
One group that has been evaluated , the polyphenols , has been shown in rodents to reduce oxidative damage and to boost the ability to learn and retain memories .
In particular , these chemicals affect changes in response to different types of stimulation in the hippocampus ( a part of the brain that is crucial to the formation of long - term memories , and which is the region most affected by Alzheimer 's disease ) .
Another polyphenol , curcumin , has also been shown to have protective effects .
It reduces memory deficits in animals with brain damage .
It may be no coincidence that in India , where a lot of curcumin is consumed ( it is the substance that makes turmeric yellow ) , Alzheimer 's disease is rarer than elsewhere .
Peas of mind
Though the way antioxidants work in the brain is not well known , Dr Gómez - Pinilla says it is likely they protect the synaptic membranes .
Synapses are the junctions between nerve cells , and their action is central to learning and memory .
But they are also , he says , the most fragile parts of the brain .
And many of the nutrients associated with brain function are known to affect transmission at the synapses .
An omega - 3 fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , for example , provides membranes at synaptic regions with “ fluidity ” — the capacity to transport signals .
It also provides “ plasticity ” — a synapse 's capacity to change .
Such changes are the basis of memory .
Since 30 % of the fatty constituents of nerve - cell membranes are DHA molecules , keeping your DHA levels topped up is part of having a healthy brain .
Indeed , according to the studies reviewed by Dr Gómez - Pinilla , the benefits of omega - 3s include improved learning and memory , and resistance to depression and bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , dementia , attention - deficit disorder and dyslexia .
Omega - 3s are found in oily fish such as salmon , as well as in walnuts and kiwi fruit , and there is a strong negative correlation between the extent to which a country consumes fish and its levels of clinical depression .
On the Japanese island of Okinawa , for example , people have a strikingly low rate of mental disorder — and Okinawans are notable fish eaters , even by the standards of a piscivorous country like Japan .
In contrast , many studies suggest that diets which are rich in trans - and saturated fatty acids , such as those containing a lot of deep - fried foods and butter , have bad effects on cognition .
Rodents put on such diets show declines in cognitive performance within weeks .
In the past few years , several studies have looked at the effect of adding omega - 3s to people 's diets — particularly those of children .
One such , carried out in the British city of Durham , was controversial in that it was funded by a maker of children 's omega - 3 supplements and did not include a control group being given a placebo .
Despite the publicity this study has received , Ben Goldacre , author of a book called “ Bad Science ” that includes an investigation of it , says the results will not be released .
Work by other researchers , however , has suggested such supplements do improve the performance and behaviour of school - age children with specific diagnoses such as dyslexia , attention - deficit disorder and developmental co-ordination disorder .
Moreover , although more work is needed to elucidate the effects of omega - 3s on healthy school - age children , Dr Gómez - Pinilla says that younger children whose mothers took fish - oil supplements ( which contain omega - 3s ) when they were pregnant and while they were breast - feeding do show better cognitive performance than their unsupplemented contemporaries .
Eating well , then , is one key to a healthy brain .
But a word of warning — do not overeat .
This puts oxidative stress on the brain and risks undoing all the good work those antioxidants have been up to .
For those who would like a little practical guidance , The Economist has some suggestions for dinner ( see menu ) .
So why not put the Nintendo brain trainer away tonight , and eat your way to intelligence instead ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The top U.S. securities regulator plans to propose a new short selling rule in the next few weeks which would be broader than an emergency order covering just 19 financial stocks which ended last week .
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said on Tuesday the proposal “ will focus on market - wide solutions . ”
He said it is not intended to have any impact on the direction of stock prices .
Cox also said the agency is still considering proposing that investors be required to publicly disclose substantial short positions in stocks .
Substantial long positions in stocks already have to be disclosed .
“ Our proposal will be designed to ensure the smooth functioning of the markets , ” Cox told reporters .
“ We support the equally important role of bets on the upside and on the downside . ”
The SEC imposed an emergency rule on July 21 that required short sellers to pre-borrow stock in mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N and 17 major Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs GS.N before executing a short trade .
Short sellers arrange to borrow shares they consider overvalued and sell them in hopes of making a profit when the price drops .
It is a legitimate form of trading but often blamed when a company ’s shares fall .
The SEC ’s emergency rule was aimed at cracking down on illegal naked short selling , when an investor sells stock that has not yet been borrowed .
Cox said on Tuesday that failures to deliver stock “ were reduced substantially ” for the stocks covered by the emergency rule .
“ It was a very effective order from that standpoint , ” Cox said .
He said the SEC ’s emergency rule was never intended to prop up the stock prices of the 19 companies .
“ We expected and intended to have no impact whatsoever on the direction of prices , ” Cox said .
“ That ’s not the purpose of regulations . ”
Investors who bet on falling stock prices also had been required to deliver the securities by the settlement date .
Short trading on the 19 stocks reverted to rules governing other shares on August 13 .
Home Non-Deterministic Recursive Ascent Parsing Non-Deterministic Recursive Ascent Parsing , Renee Leermakers .
1991 conference on European chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics .
A purely functional implementation of LR - parsers is given , together with a simple correctness proof .
It is presented as a generalization of the recursive descent parser .
For non-LR grammars the time - complexity of our parser is cubic if the functions that constitute the parser are implemented as memo- functions , i.e. functions that memorize the results of previous invocations .
Memo-functions also facilitate a simple way to construct a very compact representation of the parse forest .
For LR ( 0 ) grammars , our algorithm is closely related to the recursive ascent parsers recently discovered by Kruseman Aretz [ 1 ] and Roberts [ 2 ] .
Extended CF grammars ( grammars with regular expressions at the right hand side ) can be parsed with a simple modification of the LR - parser for normal CF grammars .
How LR parsers worked always confused me until I learned about their presentation in terms of recursive ascent .

President George W. Bush holds a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington July 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House on Thursday threatened to veto legislation being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives that would force oil companies to give up undrilled federal leases and ban the export of crude drilled in Alaska .
The bill , which the House was to vote on later on Thursday , has a “ use it or lose it ” provision that requires oil companies to diligently develop their existing federal leases or turn them back to the government before they could obtain new acres to drill .
“ By blocking some firms from competing for new leases , this legislation would further increase gasoline prices that already exceed $ 4 per gallon and result in unintended consequences due to litigation , ” the White House said in a statement .
“ Even though new leases will take years to develop , oil markets are forward - looking , and an expected decline in future supply will raise prices today , ” the White House said .
The White House also said it opposed the bill ’s language banning the export of crude oil produced in Alaska .
The Congress allowed exports of Alaskan oil in 1995 , but virtually none of the state ’s crude has been shipped to other countries in the past eight years .
“ Such a ban would make virtually no additional oil available to U.S. consumers , and would not lower oil prices that are set in a world market , ” the White House said .
“ At the same time , such export restrictions are detrimental to the efficient operation of global energy markets and would send the wrong signal to our trading partners who may face pressure to impose similar trade restrictions . ”

CHEYENNE , Wyo . ( AP ) 
The American Civil Liberties Union said on Saturday that it would investigate the actions of federal officers who had arrested five members of the Rainbow Family in western Wyoming during the group ’s annual gathering .
The federal Forest Service said a mob of about 400 members of the Rainbow Family , a group of hippie types and eccentrics who hold a weeklong national gathering on public land each year , threw rocks and sticks at Forest Service officers who tried to arrest a member of the group .
The agency would not give a reason for the original arrest .
About 60 federal and local officers responded , Forest Service officials said , and fired pepper balls  pellets that disperse a pepper solution  at the crowd .
As many as 7,000 members of the Rainbow Family camped out this year on Forest Service land .
Linda Burt , executive director of the A.C.L.U. ’s Wyoming affiliate , said on Saturday that the organization planned to accept collect calls from Rainbow Family members for the next two weeks to hear their version of events .

A classic conspiracy - broken

The FDA has finally been forced by lawsuits and a court order to admit the obvious :
It 's hazardous to put mercury in people 's mouths .
People often wonder about " conspiracies . "
" How is it possible , " they ask " for big secrets to be kept for years ?
How can that many people keep a secret for that long ? "
Mercury fillings is a classic example of how conspiracies work .
For years , using mercury in tooth fillings was illegal .
Then World War II came along and the US government needed to bring tens of thousands of GIs up to dental " health " fast .
The multi -decade ban on mercury amalgams was lifted - and never restored .
Not only was the ban not restored , but the use of mercury in fillings was pushed and pushed hard .
This is spite of the fact that mercury is a very dangerous toxin and dentists must apply strict controls on mercury in their possession .
Conspiracy 101 : Buy off the media ( and profession ) and threaten the dissenters
Dentists who had concerns about the use of mercury were warned by the American Dental Association not to discuss them with patients .
In some cases , outspoken dentists were threatened overtly with lawsuits and professional censure .
That 's how a multi- decade conspiracy was maintained .
Now finally , some small , but public cracks are finally in the official story .
From claiming that mercury was " no problem at all , " the FDA was forced by court order to publish this statement recently :
" Dental amalgams contain mercury , which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetus . "
Moms Against Mercury ( MomsAgainstMercury.org ) and others filed the lawsuit against the FDA .
Yes , that 's what it takes a lawsuit to get the Food and Drug Administration to post plain vanilla truth about a dangerous substance on their web site .

Corsi 's publisher unscathed
Largely staying out of the controversy around Jerome Corsi 's book has been his publisher , Simon & Schuster , whose Threshold imprint is run by GOP operative Mary Matalin .
The house does n't seem to have suffered any collateral damage , or provoked public complaints from any of its prominent liberal authors -- largely because the Obama campaign has chosen to drive the outrage toward Corsi himself and , when possible , toward McCain .
A series of Simon & Schuster authors -- including Michael Moore and Alexandra Pelosi -- did n't respond to questions about Corsi 's book yesterday .
A couple , however , did , including Senator Hillary Clinton .
" Threshold has absolutely nothing to do with the people at Simon & Schuster who have published her books , " said Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines .
" As for the book itself , I guess if at first you do n't succeed , lie lie again . "
Paul Begala , who also has a book coming out from a different unit of Simon & Schuster , emailed :
Mr. Corsi deserves a thorough de-lousing .
His lies about John Kerry , his smears of Pope John Paul the Great and his sleazy attacks on Barack Obama are the unholy trinity of slime .
I can assure you the folks at Threshold have had nothing to do with my upcoming book on John McCain , which , unlike Mr. Corsi 's work , is 100 % factual .
In a similar situation in 2005 , Al Franken vocally criticized his publisher , Penguin , for publishing Ed Klein 's " The Truth About Hillary . "
CORRECTION : I 'd initially written that Begala did n't respond to a question about Simon & Schuster .
In fact , I initially managed to mis-send the email to him .
His response is above .
UPDATE : A reader points out that Reines is n't , strictly speaking , correct : According to the company 's press release , Threshold is managed by David Rosenthal , the publisher of Simon & Schuster and Clinton 's publisher .
The most painful and frustrating economic policy blunder of the past 50 years was the Great Inflation of the 1970s .
Painful , because it was the catalyst for three damaging recessions ( 1973 - 75 , 1980 , 1981 - 82 ) , all the while eroding living standards and seriously undermining confidence in America .
It was also deeply frustrating .
Despite the teaching of Milton Friedman -- which clearly explained that inflation was caused by too much money chasing too few goods -- a combination of bad economic models , denial and political expediency ...
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican troops seized a small submarine smuggling drugs in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday , the military said .
A navy plane spotted the craft about 140 miles south of the tourist resort of Huatulco , setting off a three - hour chase , Rear Adm .
Hector Mucharraz told Reuters .
The green - colored submarine , carrying what was believed to be cocaine , was about 32 feet long and appeared to be a makeshift or modified vessel .
“ The submarine traveled almost at the surface of the sea and when it came up we took advantage , ” said Capt .
Benjamin Mar , a navy spokesman .
Special forces troops swooped on the submarine from a helicopter and subdued the crew of four , he said .
The Mexican government is increasingly using the military to fight drug smugglers who move South American cocaine through Mexico and into the United States .
President Felipe Calderon has sent thousands of troops to drug trafficking hot spots since he took office in December , 2006 .
Smugglers have moved drugs in Mexico through tunnels under the U.S. border and hidden in canned food and dolls , but the navy said this is the first time it had seen them use a submarine .
CNN 's AC 360° on Friday took a look at both of the Democratic and Republican candidates and their wives , and the short bio they did on John McCain gave viewers little reason , if any , why he would be very well suited at all to become our next President or our military 's Commander in Chief .

In fact , it helped reveal a McCain who was an underachieving party boy during his military career - lucky to have graduated at all , much less fifth from the bottom of his class in the Naval Academy , and reminded viewers of his involvement in one of the biggest financial scandals to touch the capitol in the 80s and 90s .
As the CNN report tells it , the lessons John McCain learned during his time as a POW were " that one of the most important things in life - along with a man 's family - is to make some contribution to his country , " and that his involvement in the Keating 5 scandal which resulted in the Congressional finding that he had exercised poor judgment for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of his good friend and largest political contributor / fundraiser , Charles Keating , led to his becoming " a crusader for campaign finance reform and transparency . "
While the lessons learned parts may sound nice , what the segment did n't reveal was the fact that his own actions have in large part belied that account .
The McCain that learned the importance of family as a POW returned to divorce his first wife in a manner that offended many of his friends and colleagues to this day , and his supposed commitment as a crusader for campaign finance reform and transparency went out the window when he began skirting or breaking many of the very campaign finance laws he used to champion just as soon as they would have applied to him during this campaign .
Seriously , what part of John McCain 's past would lead anyone who actually looked at it to believe he's the one who should lead this country forward ?
What part of what little we know about his military record suggests he 's leadership material ?
Is " there any significant policy position that John McCain currently holds , on any topic , that he 's consistently held " about anything ?
MUMBAI : An Air India Jaipur - Mumbai flight flew well past its destination with both its pilots fatigued and fast asleep in the cockpit .
When the pilots were finally woken up by anxious Mumbai air traffic controllers , the plane was about half way to Goa . ( Watch )
This nap in the sky took place about a fortnight ago on the domestic leg of a Dubai - Jaipur - Mumbai flight ��� IC 612 ��� which had about 100 passengers on board .
" The plane took off from Dubai at 1.35 am IST and then from Jaipur at 7 am .
After operating an overnight flight , fatigue levels peak , and so the pilots dozed off after taking off from Jaipur , " said a source .
The flight schedules of pilots prior to this flight is not known .
The aircraft was supposed to take the A 474 South route ��� a designated route to Mumbai ��� and since it was on autopilot , it headed in that direction .
" It was only after the aircraft reached Mumbai airspace that air traffic controllers realized it was not responding to any instructions and was carrying on on its own course , " said the source .
Said an air traffic controller : " The aircraft should have begun its descent about 100 miles from Mumbai , but here it was still at cruising altitude .
We checked for hijack and when there was no response we made a SELCAL ( selective calling ) . "
Every aircraft has its own exclusive code .
When the ATC uses this high frequency communication system ��� which it does very rarely and only when other communication draws a blank ��� a buzzer sounds in the cockpit .
Jolted by the sound of the SELCAL buzzer , the pilots woke up and brought the plane back to Mumbai safely .
Kanu Gohain , directorate general of civil aviation , was not available for comment .
Contacted for its version on Wednesday evening , Jitendra Bhargava , director , public relations of Air India , said , " The director , operations , is getting information on the matter . "
' Aircraft had communications failure '
General manager , Mumbai aerodrome , M G Junghare , denied that the pilots were asleep behind the control column .
" The aircraft had a radio communications failure and so could not be contacted .
It had gone only 10 or 15 miles off Mumbai and after we ascertained that it was not hijacked we made the SELCAL , " he said .
Commanders , however , pooh - poohed this claim and said the lapse was being hushed up .
" There is a strict procedure which is followed during a radio communications failure whereby the aircraft should have descended to a holding point .
Instead , it flew over Mumbai .
Also , every flight has an Expected Time of Arrival ( ETA ) , so why did it not begin its descent even after crossing its ETA ? " argued a check pilot .
For the last one month , airlines have been following an old set of pilot rest rules that has no scientific backing .
This happened after DGCA issued a circular in May asking airlines to the old and outdated Flight Duty Time Limitation that essentially lengthened flight duty hours .
DGCA withdrew the new timing schedule introduced in July last year and which was based on scientific studies by Nasa .
The pilots protested this .
A Joint Action Committee of Airlines Pilots ' Association has recently moved the Bombay HC to quash the DGCA circular stating that shorter breaks between long - haul flights and even ultra-long haul flights could compromise safety .
" If you get home past midnight and then by noon the next day you are in a car back to the airport , and if this happens every other day and you do not even know your weekly off in advance , the buildup of exhaustion is huge , " said a commander .
The latest incident , an index of fatigue in the skies , could strengthen the pilots ' case .
" Had the aircraft flown over Hyderabad they would not have been able to contact the pilots since SELCAL is available only at old airports like Mumbai and Chennai since it is an obsolete technology and not used in newer airports .
Moreover , a SELCAL cannot be made in certain weather conditions , " the commander said .
A similar incident in the US in February suggests that pilots do n't have it easy there either .
The difference is that the US authorities were not only open about it , but initiated corrective measures .
Two ' go ! ' airline pilots fell asleep while flying from Honolulu to Hilo , cruising past their destination for 18 minutes before waking up and returning safely .
The two pilots had been flying for three arduous days .
Following the incident , the US's National Transportation Safety Board highlighted the need for new rules .
It recommended working hour limits for flight crews , aviation mechanics , and air traffic controllers based on fatigue research .

A US air strike in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday killed 47 civilians , 39 of them women and children , an Afghan government investigating team says .
Reports at the time said that 20 people were killed in the airstrike in Nangarhar province .
The US military said they were militants .
But local people said the dead were wedding party guests .
Correspondents say the issue of civilian casualties is hugely sensitive in Afghanistan .
President Hamid Karzai has said that no civilian casualty is acceptable .

N EW YORK — From affluent shoppers at Saks to bargain - hunters at Target , from Home Depot to office supplier Staples , consumers are pulling back , and that 's hurting retailers and raising more concerns about how they 'll do the rest of the year .
The latest round of second - quarter reports show more signs of financial stress on shoppers , as Target 's customers stick to necessities and have trouble making their credit card payments .
Saks says it 's now seeing high - end designer consumers cut back , whereas previously it was only the aspirational customers who were retrenching .
While falling gasoline prices in recent weeks should provide some relief , economists say that wo n't be enough to offset all the other economic problems out there , from a housing slump and a weakening job market to soaring food prices and tighter credit .
Stocks down
Investors were n't pleased with the latest reports , either , sending retail stocks down along with the broader market .
Home Depot 's shares fell nearly 4 percent , while Staples ' dropped more than 4 percent and Saks ' stock tumbled more than 8 percent .
The increasing frugality among consumers is challenging even Target 's forte in cheap chic .
The discounter , whose performance has been lagging Wal - Mart Stores , reported a 7.6 percent drop in profit as its customers focused on necessities like food and paper towels .
Target offered a cautious outlook for the third quarter amid an erratic start to the back - to - school season and said it would slow its store expansion in fiscal 2009 .
Home Depot , the nation 's largest home improvement retailer , saw its profit drop 24 percent and reiterated its weak outlook for the year .
Still , the results were n't as bad as Wall Street expected , and the retailer benefited from a return of do - it - yourselfers .
Saks loss surprises
Saks , meanwhile , reported a wider - than - expected loss for the second quarter and forecast weak same - store sales growth in the second half .
Staples , which is set to post final second - quarter results on Sept. 3 , warned that results , excluding its acquisition of Corporate Express , would be softer than anticipated , dragged down by lower customer traffic and smaller orders .
At Home Depot , executives said one bright spot was basic repair jobs that shoppers are undertaking , even as bigger - ticket purchases continue to fall .
Net income for the three months ending Aug. 3 fell to $ 1.2 billion from $ 1.59 billion a year earlier .
Revenue slid 5.4 percent to $ 21 billion and same - store sales fell 7.9 percent .
Target said it earned $ 634 million for the three months ended Aug. 2 , down from $ 686 million a year earlier .
Sales grew 5.7 percent to $ 15 billion , while same - store sales slipped 0.4 percent .
Saks said it lost $ 31.7 million for the quarter , wider than its net loss of $ 24.6 million in the year - ago period .
It expects same - store sales for the second half of the year to be flat to a decline in the low - single digits .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two weeks ago , it seemed the most pressing foreign policy problem for the next occupant of the White House would be extricating the United States from Iraq , or deciding how many troops to move to Afghanistan .

Now a resurgent Russia , its tanks and troops humiliating U.S. ally Georgia , has propelled itself to the top of the next American president ’s agenda .
“ It ’s not the relationship we would have wanted to inherit , ” Stephen Biegun , a foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate John McCain , said of ties with Russia .
“ It ’s going to be in pretty bad shape for the next president of the United States , ” said Biegun , who was executive director of the National Security Council in President George W. Bush ’s first term .
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama ’s advisers expect him to inherit a weaker negotiating position with the Russians if he wins the November election .
“ American leverage is much weaker after the invasion , ” said Michael McFaul , Obama ’s adviser on Russia and a political science professor at Stanford University .
Since the conflict in Georgia erupted on August 7 - 8 , McCain and Obama have offered similar ideas on how Washington should respond , but their positions before the crisis offer clues about the strategy each would pursue in the Oval Office .
For supporters of the 71 - year - old Republican , the invasion of Georgia is a vindication of McCain ’s years of warnings about the deterioration of democracy in Russia and Moscow ’s attempts to bully its neighbors .
For Obama ’s campaign , events in Georgia have produced a different kind of “ I - told - you - so : ” Look what can happen elsewhere while the United States is tied down with an unnecessary war in Iraq .
The Illinois senator opposed that war from the start .
“ There is a reason why they ( the Bush administration ) were not focused on Abkhazia and South Ossetia ( Georgia ’s separatist regions ) , because they were focused on Iraq , ” McFaul said .
ENERGIZED
While Bush said in 2001 that he had looked into Russian leader Vladimir Putin ’s eyes and got a “ sense of his soul , ” McCain quipped in October that “ When I looked into Mr. Putin ’s eyes , I saw three letters : a K , a G and a B . ”
McCain a former Vietnam war prisoner of war and four - term Arizona senator who touts his national security credentials , appeared energized by the crisis .
He wrote an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal headlined “ We are all Georgians ” and announced he would send two fellow senators , Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman , to the former Soviet republic .
In the wake of the Georgia violence , the Bush administration is considering something McCain has long urged : ousting authoritarian Russia from the Group of Eight nations .
The other seven members are all western - style democracies .
Obama , 47 , is part of a younger generation with a different Cold War experience .
He was just one year old during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and far too young to serve in Vietnam .
On August 7 , Georgian forces tried to recapture South Ossetia , a pro-Russian province that threw off Georgian rule in the 1990s .
Russia responded with its biggest deployment outside its borders since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 .
While McCain may have been prescient in warning about Russian bullying , McFaul says Obama was prescient in warning both sides against a slide to war in the Caucasus .
On July 23 , two weeks before Russian tanks invaded Georgia , Obama urged Russia to “ roll back the aggressive actions it has taken in the last three months ” against its southern neighbor .
Obama added this warning : “ The Georgian government must resist the temptation to be drawn into a military conflict . ”
In April , Obama called on Tbilisi ’s government and regional leaders , backed by international organizations , to hold talks about Georgia ’s separatist regions .
“ Had we done that , this would not have happened , ” McFaul said .
“ Working with allies , working with international institutions to prevent the crisis , that is Barack Obama ’s approach to this issue and others , ” he said .
Now the invasion has taken place , Obama and McCain appear to share some ideas about how to respond .
Both have warned Russia of severe , long - term consequences .
Both still favor offering Georgia and Ukraine a path to NATO membership despite misgivings in Europe that such western support helped spawn the crisis in the first place .
“ There ’s no virtue in mollifying a resurgent imperial Russia , ” Biegun said .
“ The appetite will only grow with the eating . ”
Still , he said , it should not be a U.S. objective to have a bad relationship with Moscow .
McCain , he said , also had urged Europe to wean itself from energy dependence on Russia .
Obama on Tuesday criticized Russian actions and called for another $ 1 billion in U.S. reconstruction aid for Georgia .
“ We must help Georgia rebuild what has been destroyed , ” Obama said in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , a major U.S. veterans organization .
THE CULTURAL DEVASTATION OF AMERICAN WOMEN
Nancy Levant
August 22 , 2006
NewsWithViews.com
You may have read the article by the same title , which was the forerunner to the book , and that is now in print and available via Amazon.com .
Many thanks to my readers who waited patiently for the bookï¿½s release .
But , onward we must go with the subject of American women and the damage caused to our gender by the global culture in the making .
The institution of marriage , children , and the condition our public school system and churches demands that we consider very carefully the freedom and rights given to women in this nation .
Have we abused or mishandled this freedom ?
American women are perhaps the luckiest women in the world .
We have , however , taken for granted the fact that we were given rights in a world where rights for women is still curtailed , limited , and at times , non-existent .
Many women on the planet are not free in any sense of the word .
Many women are still owned entities .
So , the question begs - why are American women , whose culture and males allowed them to have freedom from gender bondage , so incredibly stupid with their freedom ?
Let us consider a small list of shallow stupidities :
We are free to take vanity to bizarre standards and measures ï¿½ those created by the beauty , health , and media industries ï¿½ that mandate skeletal thinness , life - long photo - youth looks , tanning bed skin color , Botox shots in the face , fake breasts , fake fingernails , waxing , manicured eyebrows , plastic surgery of every make and measure , bleached teeth , and unending and life - long diets .
We are free to fall into the trap of the mandatory mental health industry ï¿½ supporting big pharma and the New Freedom Initiative on Mental Health ï¿½ by our addictions to anti-depressants to the tune of millions and millions of American women now zoning out on a daily basis with mood - altering drugs .
We are also free to become useless in our homes .
We now hire maid services , landscapers , pool cleaners , painters , interior decorators , cooks , nannies , teachers and tutors , caterers , therapists , party planners , massage therapists , laundry services , etc. , while losing every intuitive instinct of our female natures .
We are free to have extra-marital affairs , multiple lovers , to abort children , to disrespect and ignore the traditions of our families and religions , to use men like ATMs , to back - stab our friends and family members , and to take thousands upon thousands of family dollars for personal use in our missions to look like ( and act like ) teenagers .
We are free to have children with as many men as we choose , and to bankrupt multiple men with mandatory child support payments .
We are then free to ignore children by paying far more attention to maid - cleaned , spotless , and magazine - cover homes , where no cooking is achieved , no family memories are created , and no shoes are allowed to be worn on the white carpets of the ï¿½newï¿½ American home .
We are free to give our children computer software to keep them addictively occupied for YEARS , and then complain about their lack of social skills .
We are free to completely ignore the FACT that our children are SUFFERING with mean - spirited and incompetent mothers ï¿½ children who are hungry , starved for attention , and mistreated by non -stop extracurricular sports regimens , drive - thru bags of dangerous food , teachers and public school indoctrination camps , completely ignored spiritual needs , and disrespect and contempt of their childrenï¿½s fathers .
Sadly , this list has become the typical ï¿½homeï¿½ scenario for Americaï¿½s children and husbands .
ï¿ ½Homeï¿½ has become sterile because the women in American homes have lost their senses under the highly political guise of ï¿½liberation .ï¿½
So , another question begs ï¿½ what does liberation mean to American women ?
Does it mean the freedom to vote ?
Freedom from historical gender bondage ?
Freedom from ownership ?
I donï¿½t think so .
Todayï¿½s American female is free to be an idiot ï¿½ a shallow , self - involved , pathologically vain , completely incompetent , and angry person ï¿½ angry to the tune of making the anti-depressant industry the largest profit maker , bar none , for big pharma .
Stupid is what stupid does .
American children do not have happy homes .
They are television and computer addicts thanks , primarily , to mothers .
So sorry , but facts are facts .
American children have so many video games , movies , and ï¿½equipment , ï¿½ that we now have to have ï¿½media roomsï¿½ to contain the sheer numbers of purchases made to very purposefully ignore our children .
Then add to the mix that American women canï¿½t and donï¿½t cook .
They donï¿½t know how , and furthermore , between jobs , beauty and ï¿½healthï¿½ regimens , and chronic diets , todayï¿½s mothers feel like crap most of the time , which translates into anger in the home .
Just ask dad ( or boyfriend ) .
My fear ?
I look at the history of women in other countries ï¿½ nations without freedom ï¿½ and our rapid march toward and beneath a new form of government ï¿½ one in which freedoms are being incrementally dismantled and removed from the people .
I observe state governors who are implementing reproductive legislation , as we speak , to curtail the rights of procreation , which , as we know , means the unalienable , primordial , and biological rights of women .
I see men who are becoming more and more disenchanted with marriage ï¿½ who fear what will happen should divorces ensue .
I see the slutting up of American women in dress , demeanor , and attitude , and I see young American girls following suit .
And I think of women in other nations , who have never had rights , and their treatment under nations and laws that label them as chattel , property , and for the most part , primarily vaginas and wombs .
I worry about the mass , or shall we say ï¿½globalï¿½ disenchantment of men with women .
This history could ( and has ) set women back thousands and thousands of years .
Therefore , let us think candidly about freedom .
Let us not continue to be foolish , cruel , stupid , lazy , shallow , and mean - spirited when it comes to the freedoms that America and her male gender allowed to transpire on our shores .
We are very lucky women in this nation .
To mishandle that freedom is dangerous specifically to women and children .
And in todayï¿½s world , we are desperately needed to be intelligent handlers of our homes and children .
We need to educate our children in the home .
We need to eliminate family debt and to stock and store our home pantries and family supplies .
We need to reconnect to our biological and intuitive natures , and with that said , we must reconnect to our spiritual natures and needs as women .
We must be ultimately careful that we do not become what we loathe .

What you need to save
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
America 's middle class is increasingly squeezed by sagging incomes and soaring expenses , experts told Congress on Wednesday .
Adjusted for inflation , median household income dropped by $ 1,175 between 2000 and 2007 , said Elizabeth Warren , professor at Harvard Law School , in written testimony before the Joint Economic Committee .
At the same time , the average family is spending $ 4,655 more on basic expenses , such as gas , housing , food and health insurance .
Gas alone costs $ 2,195 more for a family making the same commute in May 2008 as it did eight years earlier .
Families with children saw their child care costs soar .
Those with children under age 5 spent an additional $ 1,508 a month , while after - school costs for older children rose $ 622 .
To cover these soaring expenses , many people have had to turn to credit cards .
Nearly 10 % of total disposable income in the United States goes to paying off such debt , Warren said .
" There have never been since the Depression so many families standing right on the edge , " Warren said .
" Families have tightened their belts .
They have cut down in every discretionary spending area they possibly can . "
" These costs are tearing a hole in the family they simply can't make up , " she added .
" You ca n't cut out enough lattes to pay for health insurance in America . "
Gains go to the wealthy
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , who chairs the committee , convened the hearing to examine the impact of rising costs and stagnant wages on the economy .
" There is a silent cry going out as middle class families gather around their dinner tables each night to talk about how to pay their ballooning bills , " he said .
" Middle class families are the engine of our economy , but their earning power and economic security has actually declined in the last seven years . "
Lawmakers focused their questions on comparing the great strides made in productivity with stagnation of wages .
Increasing economic inequality is to blame , testified Jared Bernstein , senior economist with the liberal - leaning Economic Policy Institute .
While the middle class is contributing to productivity , the rewards are increasingly going to the wealthy .
But David Kreutzer , senior policy analyst for the more conservative Heritage Foundation , said it 's more accurate to follow the wages of actual workers over time , not to compare the median wage figure .
A Treasury Department study released last year , which followed nearly 170,000 taxpayers , found median income of those workers rose 24 % between 1996 and 2005 .
To help those struggling , Congress should pass a second stimulus package , Bernstein said .
But this effort should funnel funds to the states , particularly for infrastructure projects .
This could serve as an important source for much - needed jobs .
" Smartly crafted , it has the potential to help generate more economic growth until the imbalances and necessary corrections in key markets play themselves out , " Bernstein said .
" Infrastructure investment serves a dual role of deepening investments in public capital while creating good jobs for workers that might otherwise be un- or underemployed . "
Warren and Bernstein also called for more regulation and oversight of the financial markets , particularly the credit industry , to avoid abuses that lead to bubbles .
The last two or three economic downturns were caused by such runups .
These bubbles are " a major contributor to the middle class squeeze , " Bernstein said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Disinfectant wipes routinely used in hospitals may actually spread drug - resistant bacteria rather than kill the dangerous infections , British researchers said on Tuesday .
An empty operating room is seen in a hospital in a file photo .

While the wipes killed some bacteria , a study of two hospitals showed they did not get them all and could transfer the so - called superbugs to other surfaces , Gareth Williams , a microbiologist at Cardiff University , said .
The findings presented at the American Society of Microbiology ’s General Meeting in Boston focused on bacteria that included methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA .
“ What we have found is there is a high risk , ” Williams , who led the study , said by telephone .
“ We need to give guidance to the staff on how to use the wipes because we found there is a possibility of cross transfer . ”
MRSA infections can range from boils to more severe infections of the bloodstream , lungs and surgical sites .
Most cases are associated with hospitals , nursing homes or other health care facilities .
The superbug can cause life - threatening and disfiguring infections and can often only be treated with expensive , intravenous antibiotics .
Experts have been saying for years that poor hospital practices spread dangerous bacteria , and yet many studies have shown that health care workers , including doctors and nurses , often fail to even wash their hands as directed .
The findings from a study of intensive care units at two Welsh hospitals suggest that even cleaning with antimicrobial wipes may not be enough depending on how staff use them .
The researchers found that many health care workers cleaned multiple surfaces near patients , such as bed rails , monitors and tables with a single wipe and risked sweeping the infections around rather than cleaning them up .
“ We found that the most effective way to prevent the risk of MRSA spread in hospital wards is to ensure the wipe is used only once on one surface , ” Williams said .
Police on Sunday said they are investigating the death of a 16 - year - old high school girl who hanged herself on Thursday apparently after receiving an anonymous message on her school blog telling her to die .
According to police , the girl -- a student at Mihagino Girls ' High School -- hanged herself in her room at home on Thursday morning .
Her parents notified police and the school .
The parents told police that she had left a suicide note saying that a message on her blog had told her to kill herself .
A school official said the message had been sent to the girl 's blog on Monday .

The powerful speaker of Iran ’s parliament warned Wednesday that his nation could take drastic steps in response to economic , political and military pressure meant to halt controversial parts of its nuclear program .
Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran ’s parliament and a former nuclear negotiator , said there was “ only a little time left ” for talks before Iran would make unspecified moves that the West would regret .
Larijani , who is close to supreme leader Ali Khamenei , did not specify what Iran would do .
But Tehran ’s options include kicking out International Atomic Energy Agency monitors now keeping an eye on Iran ’s nuclear program or stepping up its uranium enrichment program to produce weapons - grade material .
Iran currently produces only reactor - grade uranium suitable for energy production .

“ A little time is left for having interaction with Iran , ” Larijani told lawmakers , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
“ The final whistle is going to be blown for your defeated game . ”
Tehran insists its nuclear program is meant only to meet civilian energy needs .
The U.S. , some European powers and Israel allege the effort is meant to ultimately produce nuclear weapons .
They are using diplomatic pressure , economic sanctions and hints of future military action along with offers of potential business , political and security cooperation .
The carrot - and - stick approach is meant to cajole Iran into halting its expanding uranium enrichment efforts at its facility near the city of Natanz .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana presented a package of incentives on a trip to Tehran this month .
Iranians say they are considering the proposals , though they insist they will not halt enrichment .
But Western media reports that Israel was practicing military operations aimed at Iran ’s nuclear program and the EU ’s decision this week to slap sanctions against Iran ’s largest bank have angered officials in Tehran .

“ If you are willing to hold talks with Iran over the proposed package , then why have you adopted a confrontational approach before the package was studied ? ” Larijani asked .
Larijani ’s remarks Wednesday capped two days of defiant rhetoric against Western pressure .
Many Iranians fear the U.S. is preparing for a possible military attack before President Bush leaves office .
“ We advise U.S. officials to be careful not to face another tragedy , ” Mohammed Hejazi , an official in the military ’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , said Wednesday , according to the Islamic Republic News Agency .
“ If you want to move toward Iran , make sure you bring walking sticks and artificial legs because if you come , you will not have any legs to return on . ”
A day earlier Khamenei , Iran ’s top political and military authority , called the White House “ the most resented rulers and policymakers ” of the world .
Advertisement
“ The ‘ Death to America ’ slogan , which was once coined and chanted by the Iranian nation , has now spread to other nations too , ” he said .
Former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami , a relative moderate who tried unsuccessfully to liberalize Iran ’s foreign and domestic policies , told an audience in Norway on Tuesday that U.S. policies had made the world more insecure , unstable and violent .
“ The United States has to realize that they cannot resolve all their problems through aggression and force , ” Khatami said at a conference in Oslo promoting dialogue between the Islamic world and the West .

Bacchanalia of colors that can be lethal
Not all beautiful frogs depicted here are poisonous , but those who are - can be very deadly indeed .
The most poisonous animal is not a snake or a spider .
It 's a beautiful little frog !
" Most frogs produce skin toxins , but the dart poison frogs from Central and South America are the most potent of all .
The golden poison frog , called terribilis ( the terrible ) , is so toxic that even touching it can be dangerous .
A single terribilis contains enough poison to kill 20,000 mice or 10 people .
It is probably the most poisonous animal on Earth . " ( source )
Click to enlarge :
And finally , the aforementioned " Most Poisonous " Golden Poison Dart Frog :
" Mint " flavour :
Phyllobates terribilis , shown above , has enough poison to kill 100 humans ( source )
" Their poison contains toxins that dull the nerves and produce heart and repiratory ( sic. ) failure .
The skin of an adult P. terribilis has enough batrachotoxin to kill 20,000 mice , or 100 adult humans .
Two - tenths of a microgram of batrachotoxin is lethal in the human blood stream and each adult P. terribilis contains nearly 200 micrograms . "
Some of the Latin names of frogs depicted above :

The EU is being urged to take action to stop a biofuel trading scam that exploits US agricultural subsidies and undermines the fight against global warming .
Up to 10 % of biofuel exports from the US to Europe are believed to be part of the rogue scheme reaping big profits for agricultural trading firms .
The " splash and dash " scam involves shipping biodiesel from Europe to the US where a dash of fuel is added , allowing traders to claim 11 p a litre of US subsidy for the entire cargo .
It is then shipped back and sold below domestic prices , undercutting Europe 's biofuel industry .
The trade is not illegal , but flouts the spirit of producing green fuel by transporting it needlessly across the Atlantic at a time when campaigners are voicing concern about emissions from global shipping .
The producers ' body , the European Biodiesel Board , has uncovered the trade as part of its investigation into why British , German and Spanish producers are in financial trouble at a time when biodiesel prices remain high .
The board will call for retaliatory action against the US over subsidies for its leading biofuel .
Biofuels are plant - based oils from crops such as soy and corn .
They are expensive to produce but have become relatively cheaper as the price of crude oil has risen to more than $ 100 a barrel .
It is estimated that 10 % of the 1m tonnes of biodiesel exported from the US to Europe is part of the splash and dash trade .
Doug Ward , director of a Scottish biofuel company and British representative on the board , said a full report on the impact of US fuels would be finalised within days .
It is expected to recommend that the European commission initiate an anti-dumping action against Washington for the subsidy .
" We could have sold our product cheaper if we took it over to the US and brought it back , " he said .
" No one is doing anything illegal , but environmentally it's a disaster , " he said .
The cheap cost of shipping makes the trade profitable for those involved .
Ian Waller , a biofuel consultant at the firm FiveBarGate said he visited the southern states of the US last October and spoke to firms about splash and dash .
" You get the subsidy for the act of blending , so people are bringing boats of soy or palm - based biodiesel from Europe and then mixing it with a bit of local biodiesel - or even fossil - fuel diesel - and then shipping it back , " he said .
US producers worried about the trade also call it the U - boat trade because vessels arrive and then almost immediately return , he said .
Andrew Owens , chief executive of Greenergy , a biofuel supplier part - owned by Tesco , said his company was doing all it could to eliminate the rogue practice .
" We are rigorous about our supply chain and careful about where we source bioethanol and biodiesel , but it can always sneak in if we have to buy a one - off cargo in Rotterdam to fill a gap ...
We try and avoid splash and dash at all costs , " he said .
The European Biodiesel Board has been encouraged to act against subsidised US exports of biofuel because Britain and other European countries have complained that their industries are being destroyed .
Producers are concerned the US is flooding the market with subsidised fuel when facilities are standing empty in Germany .
D1 Oils , a Teesside - based biofuel business , is considering halving its workforce due to the problems caused by US imports .
A competitor , Biofuels Corporation , was taken off the stock market after suffering its own problems , but BP said it was pressing ahead with a biobutanol plant at Hull in cooperation with Associated British Foods .
In a fortnight Britain will introduce demands that 2.5 % of all petrol and diesel is made up of non-carbon fuels .
The rules will require companies to provide information about sourcing their biodiesel , potentially cutting out splash and dash .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. Marine videotaped throwing a puppy over a cliff while on patrol in Iraq has been kicked out of the Corps , and a second Marine involved has been disciplined , according to a statement released by the Marines .
YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site 's terms of use .
Lance Cpl. David Motari , based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion , 3rd Marine Regiment , is being " processed for separation " and received non-judicial punishment , officials said in the statement Wednesday night .
The Marine Corps would not specify what that punishment was because of privacy regulations .
The statement said Motari received the punishment for his role in the " episode which generated international attention . "
The incident appeared on the Internet web site YouTube in March , sparking outrage from animal rights groups around the world .
In the video , Motari is seen throwing the dog off a cliff as it yelps .
A second Marine , San Diego - based Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion , received non-judicial punishment as well .
Janice Hagar , a spokeswoman for the Marines in San Diego , said Encarnacion shot the video .
Marine officials at the Pentagon would not disclose the severity of the disciplinary action against Encarnacion , also because of privacy regulations .
CNN did not receive a response from the Marine Corps in San Diego to questions about the case .
The statement said the Marines conducted an investigation as soon as the YouTube video came to the attention of commanders .
" The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated , " according to the statement .
On the video , Motari smiles as he is holding the puppy and then hurls the dog over a cliff .
An unknown person operating the video cameras is heard laughing and another voice saying " that 's mean , Motari . "
In a statement , the Humane Society of the United States applauded the Marine Corps ' decision to punish those involved .
" The bad actors in this case have been dealt with by the Marine Corps , which rightly recognizes that harming animals is unacceptable conduct , " said Dale Bartlett , the group 's deputy manager for animal cruelty issues .
" Now , the Department of Defense and the Congress must step up protection from cruelty for all animals under the law governing military conduct . "

Europeans are besotted with Obama .
UK Prime Minister Brown is planning his schedule right around Obama ’s visit and Germans are happily fighting about whether it ’s appropriate to have Obama speak from the Brandenburg Gate .
But George W. Bush will still be President for a while .
The Times concentrates on the here and now in American politics .
And in the here and now favours are granted for cash .
Stephen Payne will arrange meetings with the powers at large in the White House , but for a price .
During an undercover investigation by The Sunday Times , Payne was asked to arrange meetings in Washington for an exiled former central Asian president .
He outlined the cost of facilitating such access .
“ The exact budget I will come up with , but it will be somewhere between $ 600,000 and $ 750,000 , with about a third of it going directly to the Bush library , ” said Payne , who sits on the US homeland security advisory council .
He said initially that the “ family ” of the Asian politician should make the donation .
He later added that if all the money was paid to him he would make the payment to the Bush library .
Publicly , it would appear to have been made in the politician ’s name “ unless he wants to be anonymous for some reason ” .( read more )
So , that ’s what Presidential libraries are for , money laundering ?
Small wonder Bill Clinton adamantly refuses to publish a list of donors .
The Independent is worried about the incresing “ tit for tat ” politics around the nuclear ambitions of Iran .
The ongoing bickering may finally evolve into the military conflict we fear and some would welcome .
What began in 2003 as a legitimate attempt to persuade Iran to desist from its hitherto secret enrichment programme has snowballed into a confrontation between the US and Iran embroiling pretty much the entire Middle East , worrying Russia and China and potentially affecting the daily lives of Europeans .
Tit for tat is likely to continue and , unchecked , could lead to wars nobody wants .
Is there a way out ?
Can Europeans do something effective ?
The answer to both questions is “ Yes ” .

By the way , the Iranian missile tests were not only propagated with doctored pictures , they were a propaganda sham entirely .
Der Spiegel is preoccupied with Bush still , too .
Gabor Steingart invites George Bush to take a walk and have a look at the real world , but
However , the president does n’t want to understand and he does n’t even want to go for a walk .
That ’s why at the meeting of the world ’s eight most industrialized nations the most powerful man in the world had to have the world explained to him by seven less powerful leaders .
They encouraged him to finally contemplate a future without oil , and they persuaded him that the aim of reducing CO2 emissions by 2050 was possible .
The US president did n’t lead , he followed .
The world ’s only superpower has seldom looked quite as small as it did this week .

The Guardian / Observer is voicing a desire for a normal relationship with the United States and sets it ’s hopes on Barack Obama .
Barack Obama will arrive in Europe this week to a tumultuous reception .
Europe – and the rest of the world – has watched in awe the amazing political theatre that has surrounded his bid to be America ’s first black President .
Should he win in November Obama ’s priorities will be domestic ones but he also has a formidable opportunity to help recast America ’s relationship with the world .
It is this relationship which took such a battering during the Bush presidency as anti-Americanism took root across the globe ( though not , it has to be said , in large parts of Africa where the current American President did much of his best foreign work ) .
The euphoria surrounding his presidential bid offers him a brilliant opportunity to repurpose the relationship between America and the world .
And all of us would benefit .
( read more )
The Telegraph has a similar standpoint .
Both Tory leader David Cameron and Prime Minister Gordon Brown will take whatever time it takes to meet Obama :
The Democratic presidential candidate is due to visit London as part of a major foreign tour of Europe and the Middle East but he has been unable to finalise his itinerary , leaving the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition dangling .
Downing Street officials are relaxed about the scheduling problems and say the government has made clear they are happy to accommodate the White House frontrunner whenever he can fit them in .
The Tory leader , who has previously forged links with John McCain , Mr Obama ’s Republican rival , is understood to be equally keen .

Well Gordon Brown can indeed use some glamour , he is almost as popular as George W. Bush and the coming elections will most probably put an end to his premiership .
I wish you all a good Sunday , grab a coffee and read .

The first layout of Saint Mark 's Square goes back to the beginning of the 9th century A.D. In 832 A.D. the first church dedicated to the Evangelist Saint Mark , was consecrated .
According to legend , the remains of the saint were stolen by two Venetian seamen from a monastery in Egypt , and brought to Venice .
The symbol of the winged lion , proper attribute of the Evangelist , became the symbol of the city .
St. Mark became its patron saint .
Louis - Jacques - Mandé Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in 1839 .
European and American photographers greeted the process with enthusiasm .
Celebrities and political figures were invited to photographers ' studios in the hopes of obtaining a likeness for display in their windows and reception areas .
A negative was not used in the daguerreotype process .
The image was captured on a mirror like plate of copper , which had been coated with silver .
After exposure to light , the plate was developed over hot mercury until an image appeared .
The clarity of the images was stunning .
The final product was the plate itself .
They were called " mirrors of truth " .
The process I employ in the computer darkroom does not involve heavy plates , long exposure times , nor toxic chemicals .
However , as with the early pioneers , the final image is a function of light , tone and composition .
Relieved of the dangers associated with the original process , I can only hope to some day master a technique that " mirrors the truth " .
At Time Less Image we continue to seek exquisite beauty in our images , exploring all techniques , old and new .
I am by no means ready to die !

Scientists have used embryonic stem cells to generate blood – a feat that could eventually lead to endless supplies of type O - negative blood , a rare blood type prized by doctors for its versatility .
" We literally generated whole tubes in the lab , from scratch , " said Robert Lanza , chief science officer at Advanced Cell Technologies .
People usually require blood transfusions that match their own blood type : A mismatch can be fatal .
Type O-negative can be safely transferred into anyone , but is only possessed by about 7 percent of the population , leaving supplies perpetually short .
The new technique , devised by Lanza and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic and University of Illinois , is still preliminary .
Its safety has n't yet been proved in animals , much less humans .
But because blood cells are short - lived and cannot divide , there 's reason to believe that stem cell - derived blood cells could pose fewer complications than other therapeutic stem cells , which can divide unpredictably .
" The beautiful thing is that you start with one line , expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want , " said Lanza .
" It 's a literally inexhaustible source of cells for therapy . "
Lanza 's team allowed a small culture of embryonic stem cells – naturally capable of becoming any other type of tissue in the body – to divide until it numbered a few billion cells .
These they treated with a chemical cocktail that coaxed the cells into whatever type they wanted : A , B or O .
If they 'd started with a type O - negative line , said Lanza , they could just as easily have made that , too .
Tests showed the blood cells to be identical to each other , and able to carry oxygen as efficiently as their natural counterparts .
The Red Cross described the work , published today in Blood , as " pioneering . "
However , they warned against premature celebration .
" At this stage , the work is very promising , but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent " to natural cells , said the organization in a statement .
" Much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality . "
The most pressing uncertainty is safety : Embryonic stem cells are sometimes unpredictable and can develop genetic mutations during chemical reprogramming , leading to future side effects .
Blood cells , however , do n't have any DNA – they lose their nuclei as they develop from stem cells – and do n't divide , instead being broken down by the body when their four - month life cycle ends .
That , said
Lanza , should reduce the possibility of complications .
" You do n't have to worry about anything lifelong , " he said .
" They 'll be gone no matter what . "
The ethics are potentially problematic , as embryonic stem cells ultimately originate in an embryo that is destroyed during their harvest – a process that some religious conservatives equate with murder .
But Lanza said his technique could also work with stem cells produced by de-differentiation , a new and ethically trouble - free process during which adult cells regress into an embryonic state .
De -differentiated cells have a tendency to go cancerous – but because blood cells are DNA - free , said Lanza , they could be safe in this particular application .
If Lanza 's technique works , it will be a boon wherever blood transfusions are needed , but especially in places where type O - negative blood is not immediately available , such as emergency rooms and battlefields .
" There 's always a great demand for type O blood , " said Red Cross spokeswoman Molly Dalton .
" It 's always a worry that we do n't have enough . "

Correction : I originally stated that Lanza 's team made type O - negative blood ; it was type O blood that they made – still versatile , but not quite the universal grail of type O-negative .
However , Lanza said that the technique could just as easily make O - negative , provided one started with an O - negative stem cell line – something they did not possess ( and does not appear to exist in any of the embryonic stem cell lines currently eligible for federal research funding . )
" As soon as you get one line , it 's immortal , " he said .

There have been few stories about Bill O’Reilly ’s softer side ( I ’m sure he has one ) , and while Shepard Smith ’s amazing reporting in New Orleans got some play , he was not cast as one of the journalistic heroes of the disaster .
The fact that Roger Ailes has won both Obie awards and Emmys does not come up a lot , nor does the fact that he donated a significant chunk of money to upgrade the student newsroom at Ohio University , his alma mater .
Instead , Mr. Ailes and Brian Lewis , his longtime head of public relations , act as if every organization that covers them is a potential threat and , in the process , have probably made it far more likely .
And as the cable news race has tightened , because CNN has gained ground during a big election year , Fox News has become more prone to lashing out .
Fun is fun , but it is getting uglier by the day out there .

A little more than a week ago , Jacques Steinberg , a reporter at The New York Times who covers television , wrote a straight - up - the - middle ratings story about cable news .
His article acknowledged that while CNN was using a dynamic election to push Fox News from behind , Fox was still No. 1 . Despite repeated calls , the public relations people at Fox News did not return his requests for comment .
( In a neat trick , while they were ignoring his calls , they e-mailed his boss asking why they had not heard from him . )
After the article ran , Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy of “ Fox and Friends , ” the reliable water carriers on the morning show on the cable network , did a segment suggesting that Mr. Steinberg ’s editor was a disgruntled former employee 
Steven V. Reddicliffe once edited TV Guide , which was until recently owned by the News Corporation  and that Mr. Steinberg was his trained attack dog .
( The audience was undoubtedly wondering what the heck they were talking about . )
The accompanying photographs were heavily altered , although the audience was probably none the wiser .
Mr. Reddicliffe looked like the wicked witch after a hard night of drinking , but it was the photo of Mr. Steinberg that stopped traffic when it appeared on the Web at Media Matters side by side with his actual photo .
In a technique familiar to students of vintage German propaganda , his ears were pulled out , his teeth splayed apart , his forehead lowered and his nose was widened and enlarged in a way that made him look more like Fagin than the guy I work with .
( Mr. Steinberg told me that as a working reporter who covers Fox News , he was not in a position to comment .
A spokeswoman said the executive in charge of “ Fox and Friends ” is on vacation and not available for comment but added that altering photos for humorous effect is a common practice on cable news stations . )
It ’s a particularly vivid example of how the Fox response team works , but hardly the only one .
Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal wrote a profile of Roger Ailes in 2005 .
Again , her coverage was right up the middle , but that is not the way that Fox News saw it , and she was held out for ridicule over and over in items on various blogs penned by Fox News staff when she jumped the gun on the start date for the Fox business channel .
( Ms. Angwin is on book leave and did not answer a message left on her cellphone . )
Earlier this year , a colleague of mine said , he was writing a story about CNN ’s gains in the ratings and was told on deadline by a Fox News public relations executive that if he persisted , “ they ” would go after him .
Within a day , “ they ” did , smearing him around the blogs , he said .
( I did not ask him for a comment because the information was of a private nature . )
A new method for swiftly producing proteins to fight infections could mean the difference between life and death during future pandemics .
Researchers report in Nature today that they have perfected a way to manufacture monoclonal antibodies capable of destroying diseases such the avian flu , which have the ability to swap genes with human flu varieties and jump from birds to people .
Their research is a dramatic advance , because it marks the first time that scientists were able to rapidly generate the disease - killing proteins , according to study co-author Patrick Wilson , an immunologist at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation ( OMRF ) in Oklahoma City .
He says that researchers could one day spare scores of lives and nip potential epidemics in the bud by whipping up a treatment within a month from natural antibodies that survivors developed against the threatening disease .
Until now , he says , it took as long as three months to produce enough monoclonal antibodies to protect huge populations , because the immune system only pumps out small quantities in response to infections .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , called the new work a " significant advance , " noting in a statement that it " opens the way to producing [ monoclonal antibodies ] that potentially could be used diagnostically or therapeutically " for the flu as well as other infectious diseases such as hepatitis C and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which can lead to full - blown AIDS .
The new technique , pioneered by Wilson and fellow researchers at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , saves time by using antibodies produced by so - called B cells ( white blood cells that produce and then ferry them to infection sites to battle invading germs ) in response to vaccines instead of to actual infections .
According to Wilson , monoclonal antibodies from ( deliberately infected ) animals were routinely used in the first half of the 20th century to try to treat diphtheria ( an upper - respiratory illness that killed roughly 15,000 people annually in the early 1920s until a vaccine was formulated against it in 1924 ) and tetanus ( a potentially fatal infection also known as lockjaw , because one of the muscles it destroys is in the jaw ) .
There were , however , compatibility issues :
The human immune system in most cases viewed the animal antibodies as alien and rejected them — or lacked the ammunition to destroy them , thereby making patients sicker .
To avoid these problems , researchers have been trying to perfect and speed up procedures for extracting monoclonal antibodies from humans , replicating them in a lab , and then injecting them into victims suffering from the diseases they were formed to fight .
The key to collecting these antibodies has been to remove B cells that bear them from survivors of , say , a particular flu strain — or alternatively , someone who has been vaccinated against the flu ( because the flu vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus ) .
Until now , scientist have run into problems trying to recreate large enough quantities quickly enough to spare lives .
Wilson says the process traditionally has taken so long that by the time enough new B cells were generated , the flu strain targeted already had mutated into a form no longer vulnerable to the captured crop of antibodies .
In the new method , the researchers isolated B cells from humans who had been vaccinated against — and therefore had built up specific antibodies to — the seasonal flu .
But instead of prodding extracted B cells to proliferate , Wilson says , the teams simply plucked the antibody - producing genes from them and inserted those into existing B - cell lines , thereby increasing their protein output .
The type of B cells that the scientists tapped for the coveted proteins are known as antibody - secreting plasma cells ( ASCs ) .
ASCs are among the first - line defenders that the immune system sends out when it detects an infection ( including weakened vaccine versions ) .
These cells are tasked with scoping out potential danger and signaling the backup germ fighters required to knock out invading armies .
ASCs are short - lived , because they serve more as scouts than as combat soldiers .
The teams found that up to 80 percent of the ASCs that they isolated during their peak ( seven days after vaccination ) contained monoclonal antibodies to the flu strain they had injected .
" The reason this is so exciting is that the same kind of B cell could be present in people [ who ] have primary infections , " says Wilson , noting that researchers thus far have only showed this works with antibodies created in response to vaccines .
The team now plans to test the method on people infected with the flu or another virus .
Antonio Lanzavecchia , director of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona , Switzerland , stresses that the effectiveness of Wilson 's technique depends on the relatively short time span during which ASCs are active .
Lanzavecchia believes that his own research is more promising :
He has harvested antibodies against both severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and avian flu using so - called memory B cells , which are immune cells that store antibodies from all vaccines and previously beaten viruses — and remain in the blood permanently .
" If you have a spontaneous disease , you have only a short window of time where you can get [ ASCs ] , " he says , " so targeting memory B cells [ from someone who has beaten the illness ] may be an advantage . "
The problem is , Wilson says , that a person has relatively few memory B cells — " on the order of one in thousands " — making the process of extracting antibodies from them a time - consuming task , because they first must be located .
" We are making new antibodies that [ are potentially more effective because they ] are binding to very specific strains of a virus , " he says .
He adds that the new technique might also be employed to pin down the flu strain someone has by testing the effectiveness of extracted antibodies against it .
Wilson says that the new technique could become widely available in a few years if it is proved safe and effective during human clinical trials .
Hospital 's Double Jeopardy for Twin Mix Up
Twins accidentally separated as infants ; third child believed she was a twin .
MADRID , Spain May 27 , 2008  --
Spanish twins who were separated at birth through a hospital error -- then reunited as adults through a fluke -- are suing for millions in damages , as is a third woman who grew up thinking , erroneously , that she was one of the twins , a lawyer said Tuesday .
The real twins finally met each other in 2001 .
The case has been working its way through the courts since 2004 .
A decision is expected soon on whether the three women deserve damages , said Sebastian Socorro Perdomo , a lawyer for one of the twins .
He would not release the names of any of the women , who are all 35 years old .
Socorro Perdomo said in an interview that his client is seeking $ 4.7 million from the government of the Canary Islands , where the error occurred in 1973 in the city of Las Palmas .
The other two women are also suing , he said .
He said his client was taken out of her crib as her twin sister lay in one right next to her , mistakenly replaced by another baby girl , and ultimately raised by the family of that child .
The other two girls were brought up in the mistaken belief they were twin sisters .
" It does not take a lot of effort to put yourself in the position of any of these people in order to understand the damage that has been done , " Socorro Perdomo said .
Of the three , he said his client -- taken away from her twin sister and real family -- is the most devastated .
" Since this discovery , her world has turned a bit upside down , " he said .
" The first right of any child is the right to their own personal and family identity , " he said .
" In this case , that right has been violated . "
The error emerged a generation later through a chance encounter at a clothing store in Las Palmas .
A friend of Socorro Perdomo 's client worked in the shop .
When a woman who was the spitting image of that client came in and failed to recognize the employee , the clerk was dumbfounded .
When the dead ringer came by the store a second time , the clerk began to put two and two together and arranged for the women to meet .
DNA tests proved they were identical twins , the lawyer said .
iRobot announced it has purchased technology from the University of Washington .
Seen here are the components of Seaglider , an underwater AUV ( Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ) .
Seaglider works by diving down and then surfacing .
When it surfaces , it ’s antennae is in the air and it can determine its position via GPS .
It also sends in its data via a satellite and gets any new instructions .
Seaglider is 1.8 m long and weighs 52 kg , a small enough size to launch or retrieve from a small boat by two people .
Helen Greiner , co-founder and chairman of iRobot , said the company has a strong track record of transferring new technology from research initiatives into products that support military missions an stated ,
Ten years ago we transformed the original PackBot into a combat - proven robot used today by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan and licensing the Seaglider from the University of Washington will help our robots conquer new underwater frontiers .

Four Senate Democrats called on EPA chief Stephen Johnson to resign Tuesday , alleging that he gave misleading testimony to Congress and repeatedly bowed to pressure from the White House to avoid regulating greenhouse gases .
California Sen. Barbara Boxer , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , and three other Democrats on the panel - Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey - also announced they are urging Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate whether Johnson made false statements to Congress .
Mukasey 's office said it was still reviewing the request late Tuesday .
The pressure on Johnson is part of an escalating battle between Democrats in Congress and the White House over climate change policy .
Democrats are seizing on new evidence that Johnson overrode the opinions of Environmental Protection Agency scientists and reversed two of his own decisions at the request of the White House .
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar fired back at Boxer for what he called a political attack .
" Administrator Johnson 's record is one of aggressive , health protective environmental standards .
Sen .
Boxer 's record is one of press conferences and political tirades , " Shradar said .
Democrats insist that Johnson misled Congress when he testified before Boxer 's committee Jan. 24 about his decision to reject California 's effort to set the nation 's toughest limits on emissions from vehicles .
The EPA chief testified that he listened to all sides before deciding that California had failed to make its case .
" I made the decision .
It was my decision .
It was the right decision , " Johnson said at the time .
But last week , a top Johnson aide contradicted his testimony .
Former EPA deputy associate administrator Jason Burnett , who resigned last month in frustration with the administration 's climate - change stance , testified that Johnson had initially supported granting at least a partial waiver after concluding that California met the legal criteria .
But Burnett said Johnson changed his stance when the White House made clear that President Bush opposed California setting its own fuel economy standards .
" The administrator knew the president 's preference for a single ( national ) standard , " Burnett said .
Klobuchar said the testimony showed that Johnson not only overruled his own staff but also misled the public about who really made the decision .
" If we can't trust the top EPA official to tell the truth to the American people , then he must go , " she said .
The lawmakers also allege that Johnson yielded to White House influence in a recent EPA decision over whether climate change endangers human health .
The decision was critical because if the agency had made such a finding , it would have been required to start regulating greenhouse gases .
In December , EPA officials sent an e-mail to the White House stating that Johnson supported the EPA staff 's view that global warming threatens human health .
" In sum , the Administrator is proposing to find that elevated levels of [ greenhouse gas ] concentrations may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public welfare , " the document read .
The White House refused to open the e-mail and later asked EPA officials to retract it .
When Johnson recently announced that EPA was starting a new rule - making process to determine whether climate change poses a health risk , he never mentioned this previous finding .
Boxer said she was frustrated that EPA officials have stonewalled congressional inquiries into those recent decisions .
Johnson refused to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week about EPA 's dealings with Congress .
Last week , the White House released the e-mail with EPA 's draft of the endangerment finding but would not allow senators to make copies .
Lawmakers were allowed to read it only while being watched by two White House lawyers .
Boxer said the final straw was an e-mail sent to EPA staffers last month that directed them not to speak to the press , congressional investigators or to EPA 's own inspector general , and to forward the inquiries to their superiors .
Boxer said Johnson " has become a secretive and dangerous ally of polluters , and we cannot stand by and allow more damage to be done . "
But the White House is standing behind Johnson .
White House spokesman Trey Bohn said Johnson 's critics are attacking him because they disagree with the administration 's policies on energy and climate change .
" In every sense , administrator Johnson has cooperated fully with Congress , and the facts bear that out , " Bohn said .
Federal prosecutors , capping a yearlong investigation , are preparing to file criminal charges against managers of two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds whose collapse helped mark the start of the credit crisis .
The U.S. Attorney 's office in Brooklyn is slated to complete interviews of witnesses and other key people in the case this week , and has indicated to lawyers with interest in the case that indictments could be imminent , according to people familiar with the matter .

今月の情報処理学会誌( 2008年8月号 ) が届いた。
情報爆発に関する特集も知らないことが書いてあったりして参考になる。たとえば「情報爆発時代のための新しい超高速アルゴリズム」には
最初に提案されたアルゴリズムはaprioriとよばれるもので，ディスク上のデータへのアクセス回数を最小化するようデザインされている．その後，データがメモリに収まるようになると，メモリにデータの必要部分を格納し，深さ優先的に山登り探索を行う第２世代のアルゴリズムが提案された．現在の主流は，探索中に必要ないレコードやアイテムを再帰的にデータから消去して圧縮を行う第３世代のアルゴリズムである．
( p.898 ) とあり、さらにLCMという新しいアルゴリズムを開発したのだという。自然言語処理的にはどういう局面でこのあたりのアルゴリズムが役に立つのか分からないが、こういう解説記事で知っておくとなにかのとき使えるかな?
あと楽しみにしていたのがミニ小特集「コンピュータ将棋は止まらない 」(「 ミニ 」 「 小特集 」 は 「馬から落馬する」的な表現のような……)。今年の世界コンピュータ将棋選手権での優勝プログラムがアマ名人2人と特別対局して連覇した、というのは知らなかったのだが、コンピュータ将棋もとうとうここまで来たのか、という感じ。
小特集の中でも何回か触れられているが、羽生や森内あたりのトッププロも悲観的に見て2015年、楽観的に見たら2010年までには確実に勝てるようになっているだろうな……。中学生のころは「自分の生きている間になるかどうか」なんて思っていたのだが、予想していたより遥かに速いペースである。
技術的なブレークスルーは2005 年の Bonanza による評価関数の自動学習のようだが、今はまだ有効な特徴量の発見に使うくらいに止め、具体的なパラメータは人手でチューニングする手法も互角に戦えているらしい。職人芸的に(将棋の強い開発者が自分の知識を用いた)パラメータチューニングする時代から、とにかく利きそうな素性を放り込んで膨大な棋譜の中から統計処理・機械学習するという時代に移行するという、どうやら他の分野でも見たような流れの真っ只中にいるようだ。
膨大にデータがあるなら将棋に全く詳しくない(ルールが分かるくらい)の人でもプログラムが作れるというのが統計的手法のおもしろいところで、かな漢字変換でもそれなりの大きさのデータセットが(無料かもしくは数千円程度で)公開されていればもっと流行るのかなあと思ったりもする。

The schedule for the Senate 's return on July 8 allows for three amendments to be introduced to the FISA Amendments
Act , which in its current form would grant immunity from the law to phone companies who engaged in illegal spying .
One amendment , from Senators Dodd and Leahy , would strip immunity from the bill altogether .
A second , from Senator Specter [ PDF ] , would would allow the court to deny immunity if it found that the government 's surveillance activities were unconstitutional .
EFF is particularly optimistic about the third , an amendment introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman [ PDF ] of New Mexico and co-sponsored by Senators Specter and Casey , a sensible and bi-partisan proposal that could be a game - changer .
The current version of the Senate bill calls for an investigation into the President 's warrantless wiretapping program by the Inspectors General of the Department of Justice and other US government intelligence agencies .
The IG investigation , while no substitute for an independent court ruling , is likely to uncover some of the details of the program that the White House has been trying to suppress .
Unfortunately , the current bill puts the cart before the horse , by granting immunity from the law to phone companies before the investigation has even begun .
If the Senate is resolved to pass legislation granting immunity , it it ought to at least know what conduct it 's immunizing —
It should give itself an opportunity to revisit the issue after it has the IG Report in hand .
That 's where the Bingaman amendment comes in .
The Bingaman amendment would prevent Congress from granting immunity in the dark , as described in the press yesterday , by " stay[ing ] pending cases against the telecoms and delay[ ing ] the effective date of any immunity provisions until 90 days after Congress received a report from the inspectors general of the intelligence agencies on the warrantless surveillance program " .
By placing a temporary hold on immunity and on the litigation until 90 days after the IG Report is submitted to Congress , the simple amendment would give Congress and the American people an opportunity to revisit the issue of telco immunity next year , in light of the audit 's findings .
EFF has signed an open letter in support of the Bingaman Amendment [ PDF ] along with the ACLU and eleven other civil liberties organizations , and urges all members of the Senate who care about civil liberties and the rule of law to champion it .
The amendment would n't cure all of the problems with the bill , and is no replacement for a strong no vote on final passage , but at this moment it looks to be the last best shot at saving the litigation against the telcos from an early death .
We especially hope that Senator Obama recognizes how important his leadership could be on this amendment .
It is an immeasurable tragedy that as July 4th approaches , Congress appears poised to pass a bill that would betray the spirit of 1776 by radically expanding the president 's spying powers and granting immunity to the companies that colluded in his illegal surveillance program .
We hope that all Americans who care about this issue will celebrate the Fourth of July this year by demanding that their Senators uphold the rule of law by supporting the immunity amendments and , most importantly , voting NO on final passage of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 .
Updated June 30 2:40 pm PT : An earlier version of this post mistakenly identified the amendment 's cosponsor as Senator Carter .
The actual cosponsor is Senator Casey .
Rural highways are some of the deadliest in the country , studies have shown , so some researchers have created a new interactive map that drivers can use to see exactly how safe — or fatal — the roads are where they live .
Driving is one of the most dangerous activities people engage in ; the lifetime risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident for U.S residents is 1 - in - 100 .
About 57 percent of highway deaths happen on rural roads , according to the Federal Highway Administration .
To help educate drivers on the hazards they might face on the road , researchers at the University of Minnesota 's Center for Excellence in Rural Safety ( CERS ) have mapped out every fatality in the nation at www.saferoadmaps.org.
The researchers plan to unveil the new Web site Monday at an annual conference on rural safety in Santa Rosa , Calif .
Drivers can enter their address and are then shown a map or satellite image of all the road fatalities in their area .
" When drivers type in their most common routes , they 're shocked how much blood is being shed on it , " said Tom Horan , research director for CERS .
Web site users can narrow down the search to see the age of the driver , whether speeding or drinking was a factor in the accident , and if the driver was wearing a seatbelt .
" When it 's a route you or your loved ones use , the need to buckle up , slow down and avoid distractions and drinking suddenly becomes much more personal and urgent , " Horan said .
The new tool also lets users know what policies , such as strong seatbelt laws , are in place in the area .
Last year , CERS researchers tabulated the 10 states that have the highest proportion of accidents occurring on rural roads .

10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction
Is Flying Safer Than Driving ?
I return today from a week - long trip to Anchorage , Alaska .
I spent the week enjoying the beautiful mountains , and the exciting science being presentented at the Conference for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( CVPR 2008 ) [ here are some links to lots of papers from the conference ] .
This was my first trip to this conference , and I must say that I was impressed with the quality of the work presented .
Below , I list some of my favorite papers and give a ( very ) brief overview :
Edge Finding
Using Contours to Detect and Localize Junctions in Natural
Images .
Michael Maire , Pablo ArbelÃ¡ez , Charless Fowlkes and Jitendra Malik .
CVPR , 2008 . [ paper ]
Maire et al .
Make significant progress in edge detection and junction detection by using very clever insights into the way humans perceive and draw images .
They also demonstrate using convincing metrics that their methods are the state of the art and rapidly approaching human - level of accuracy .
Stereo and 3D
I was impressed with the amount of focus on 3D reconstruction from either stereo cameras or monocular video cameras .
This is something that I have been interested in for some time .
Due to the apparent focus on this I may pursue this further in the coming months and try to add myself to this list !
Recovering Consistent Video Depth Maps via Bundle Optimization .
Guofeng Zhang , Jiaya Jia , Tien - Tsin Wong and Hujun Bao. CVPR , 2008 . [ project website ]
This was one of the first talks I saw and I was floored by the results .
The authors use a single video stream to compute beautiful 3D models of the scene .
The algorithm makes use of the temporal consistency of video as well as visual similarities between subsequent frames .
Stereoscopic Inpainting : Joint Color and Depth Completion from Stereo Images .
Liang Wang , Hailin Jin , Ruigang Yang and Minglun Gong .
CVPR , 2008 .
Here , authors combine the ideas of in - painting ( filling missing areas in an image automatically ) and stereo depth estimation to dramatically improve both disciplines .
By using in - painting methods , occlusions in stereo pairs can be accurately completed , and by supplementing visual in - painting with depth estimates , better results can be obtained .
3D Point Clouds
The analysis of shapes and 3D objects often relies on the use of a cloud of points on the surface of an object .
Although this was n’t as popular as stereo at CVPR , it was still a noteworthy discipline … and one that is likely to grow .
Three - Dimensional Point Cloud Recognition via Distributions of Geometric Distances .
Mona Mahmoudi and Guillermo Sapiro .
CVPR , 2008 .
[ google cache of paper ]
Shape recognition is a very complicated problem .
Here , Mahmoudi and Sapiro take a very refreshing new approach .
By computing histograms of features such as pair - wise distances , and curvature they create a system capable of matching shapes very well to ones in large databases .
Their method simplifies this hard task and yields excellent results .
Particle Filtering for Registration of 2D and 3D Point Sets with Stochastic Dynamics .
Romeil Sandhu , Samuel Dambreville and Allen Tannenbaum .
CVPR , 2008 .
Cry nepotism if you like , but this is excellent paper from my colleague Rome Sandhu .
Lining up point clouds is a task that crops up all over .
This technique allows registration of small bits of data onto known models and even bits of data onto other bits of data .
The results are simply incredible considering it would be a challenge to do this even for a human !
Visual Summary
Summarizing Visual Data Using Bidirectional Similarity .
Denis Simakov , Yaron Caspi . Eli Shechtman and Michal Irani .
CVPR , 2008 . [ project website ]
I was amazed last year by a technique called Seam Carving used to re-size images without losing or shrinking important information .
This technique accomplishes the same goal , and sometimes does a far better job .
The approach is two - fold : 1 ) make sure the smaller image has as much data as possible from the original , 2 ) make sure the smaller image does n’t have any * new * data .
The second constraint ensures that no artifacts develop .
Skeletonization
Geometric Modeling of Tubular Structure .
Huseyin Tek and M. Akif Gulsun. MMBIA( CVPR ) , 2008 .
I am currently working on vessel analysis myself , and have been reviewing different methods of construction a “ skeleton ” or stick - like model of a vessel structure .
Tek and Gulsun of Siemens Corporate Research have a very clever solution wherein they find the best line through a structure by measuring the “ roundness ” of the surrounding data .
My Work
Localized Statistics for DW - MRI Fiber Bundle Segmentation .
Shawn Lankton , John Melonakos , James Malcolm , Samuel Dambreville and Allen Tannenbaum . MMBIA( CVPR ) , 2008 . [ pdf paper ]
Just in case you were wondering , this is the paper that brought me to Alaska to take part in this conference .
I use a method that looks locally at image differences in brain scans to find the shape of neuron bundles that run through the brain .
A four - year college degree , seen for generations as a ticket to a better life , is no longer enough to guarantee a steadily rising paycheck .
Just ask Bea Dewing .
After she earned a bachelor 's degree -- her second -- in computer science from Maryland 's Frostburg State University in 1986 , she enjoyed almost unbroken advances in wages , eventually earning $ 89,000 a year as a data modeler for Sprint Corp. in Lawrence , Kan .
Then , in 2002 , Sprint laid her off .
" I thought I might be looking a few weeks or months at the most , " says Ms. Dewing , now 56 years old .
Instead she spent the next six years in a career wilderness , starting an Internet café that did n't succeed , working temporary jobs and low - end positions in data processing , and fruitlessly responding to hundreds of job postings .
The low point came around 2004 when a recruiter for Sprint -- now known as Sprint Nextel Corp. -- called seeking to fill a job similar to the one she lost two years earlier , but paying barely a third of her old salary .
In April , Ms. Dewing finally landed a job similar to her old one in the information technology department of Wal - Mart Stores Inc. 's headquarters in Bentonville , Ark. , where she relocated .
She earns about 20 % less than she did in 2002 , adjusted for inflation , but considers herself fortunate , and wiser .
A degree , she says , " is n't any big guarantee of employment , it 's a basic requirement , a step you have to take to even be considered for many professional jobs . "
For decades , the typical college graduate 's wage rose well above inflation .
But no longer .
In the economic expansion that began in 2001 and now appears to be ending , the inflation - adjusted wages of the majority of U.S. workers did n't grow , even among those who went to college .
The government 's statistical snapshots show the typical weekly salary of a worker with a bachelor 's degree , adjusted for inflation , did n't rise last year from 2006 and was 1.7 % below the 2001 level .
College - educated workers are more plentiful , more commoditized and more subject to the downsizings that used to be the purview of blue - collar workers only .
What employers want from workers nowadays is more narrow , more abstract and less easily learned in college .
To be sure , the average American with a college diploma still earns about 75 % more than a worker with a high - school diploma and is less likely to be unemployed .
Yet while that so - called college premium is up from 40 % in 1979 , it is little changed from 2001 , according to data compiled by Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal Washington think tank .
Most statistics he and other economists use do n't track individual workers over time , but compare annual snapshots of the work force .
That said , this trend does n't appear due to an influx of lower - paid young workers or falling starting salaries ; Mr. Bernstein says when differences in age , race , marital status and place of residence are accounted for , the trend remains the same .
A variety of economic forces are at work here .
Globalization and technology have altered the types of skills that earn workers a premium wage ; in many cases , those skills are n't learned in college classrooms .
And compared with previous generations , today 's college graduates are far more likely to be competing against educated immigrants and educated workers employed overseas .
The issue is n't a lack of economic growth , which was solid for most of the 2000s .
Rather , it's that the fruits of growth are flowing largely to " a relatively small group of people who have a particular set of skills and assets that lots of other people don't , " says Mr. Bernstein .
And that " does n't necessarily have that much to do with your education . "
In short , a college degree is often necessary , but not sufficient , to get a paycheck that beats inflation .
Economists chiefly cite globalization and technology , which have prompted employers to put the highest value on abstract skills possessed by a relatively small group , for this state of affairs .
Harvard University economists Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin argue that in the 1990s , it became easier for firms to do overseas , or with computers at home , the work once done by " lower - end college graduates in middle management and certain professional positions . "
This depressed these workers ' wages , but made college graduates whose work was more abstract and creative more productive , driving their salaries up .
Indeed , salaries have seen extraordinary growth among a small number of highly paid individuals in the financial sector -- such as fund management , investment banking and corporate law -- which , until the credit crisis hit a year ago , had benefited both from the buoyant financial environment and the globalization of finance , in which the U.S. remains a leader .
Richard Spitzer is one of those beneficiaries .
He received his undergraduate degree in East Asian studies in 1995 from the College of William and Mary and graduated from Georgetown University 's law school in 2001 .
The New York firm for which he works , now called Dewey & LeBoeuf , has a specialty in complex legal work for insurance companies .
There , Mr. Spitzer has developed an expertise in " catastrophe bonds . "
An insurance company sells such bonds to investors and pays them interest , unless an earthquake , a hurricane or unexpected surge in deaths occurs .
Experts in these bonds are " probably a rarefied species -- there 's only a few law firms that do them , " says Mr. Spitzer , 35 years old .
He typically spends two to four months on a single deal , ensuring that details like timing of payments or definition of the triggering event are precise enough to avoid disputes or default .
Mr. Spitzer 's salary has doubled to $ 265,000 since joining in 2001 , in line with salaries similar firms pay .
But not all law graduates are so fortunate ; many , especially those from less - prestigious schools , have far lower salaries and less job security .
Similarly , some computer - science graduates strike it rich .
But their skills are not as rare as they were in the early 1980s , when the discipline took off , and graduates today must contend with competition from hundreds of thousands of similarly qualified foreign workers in the U.S. or overseas .
That helps explain Ms. Dewing 's experience .
She was raised in a family that prized education .
Both her parents went to college on the G.I.
Bill , which pays tuition costs for servicemen and some dependents .
Four of their six children earned college degrees .
In 1979 , she earned a bachelor 's degree in government and politics from George Mason University in Virginia .
Several years later , then a single mother , she decided to get a degree in computer science .
Her first job out of college was with the federal government , earning about $ 35,000 in today 's dollars .
" For 16 years I had no trouble at all finding jobs , " she said .
Earlier this decade she ended up at Sprint designing databases -- a specialty called " data modeling " that is n't widely taught in schools and usually requires hands - on experience .
In 2002 Sprint , reeling from the collapse of the telecommunications industry , initiated a wave of layoffs that eventually totaled 15,000 workers in 13 months , Ms. Dewing among them .
She remained in the Kansas City area , posting her résumé on job boards .
When recruiters called , she would usually put her expected salary at something close to her old salary .
As time went by without an offer she lowered it steadily , to $ 60,000 .
She found herself competing for jobs with employees of outsourcing firms brought over from India on temporary visas , such as the H - 1B .
A few months ago , Ms. Dewing got a call from a recruiter calling on behalf of Wal - Mart .
Company officials pressed her during her interview on how she had kept up her data - modeling ability during her six years away from the specialty .
She noted that while at Sprint she had revived the Kansas City chapter of a data modelers ' professional association and , long after being laid off , continued to attend its seminars where invited experts would describe the latest advances .
She even cited her short - lived Internet café as evidence of how she could solve diverse problems .
When she landed the job , she says , " I felt , ' All right , I 'm a professional again . ' "
Even so , Ms. Dewing has a newfound appreciation for how insecure any job can be and how little a college degree by itself stands for .
" There is enough competition for entry - level positions that employers are going to ask , ' What else have you done in your life besides go to college ? ' " she says .
" And in information technology , a portfolio of hands - on experience with programming is a really good thing to have . "

In a bid to counter Google , Facebook is going open - source .
A year after its launched its much - heralded Facebook Platform – a way for third party developers to write programs that work inside the social network – the Palo Alto , Calif. , company says it is making a “ significant part ” of its platform code open - source .
That means developers and companies working in the Facebook ecosystem will be able to see how the code works , manipulate it and give any improvements they make back to the company and other developers .
“ The goal of this release is to help you as developers better understand Facebook Platform as a whole and more easily build applications , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We ’re also hoping you use Facebook Open Platform in ways we ’ve never thought of . ”
Though it is posing the announcement as something of an altruistic gift , there ’s a bit of a chess strategy behind Facebook ’s move .
Google launched the competing Open Social initiative last November , a common set of software tools that developers can use to write programs for a variety of social networks , such as MySpace and LinkedIn .
Open Social gives Facebook some formidable competition for the hearts and minds of developers , whose work is seen as integral to making social networks a fun and enduring place for people to spend their time on the Web .
“ Developers and users are fickle .
They are going to go where barriers to entry are the lowest , ” said Jeremiah Owyang , an analyst at Forrester Research .
Facebook , he said , “ needs to continue to build relationships with these developers or it is just going to be one of many platforms . ”
IMAGINE GETTING
A bee sting ; then imagine getting six more .
You are now in a position to think about what it means to be poor , according to Charles Karelis , a philosopher and former president of Colgate University .
In the community of people dedicated to analyzing poverty , one of the sharpest debates is over why some poor people act in ways that ensure their continued indigence .
Compared with the middle class or the wealthy , the poor are disproportionately likely to drop out of school , to have children while in their teens , to abuse drugs , to commit crimes , to not save when extra money comes their way , to not work .
To an economist , this is irrational behavior .
It might make sense for a wealthy person to quit his job , or to eschew education or develop a costly drug habit .
But a poor person , having little money , would seem to have the strongest incentive to subscribe to the Puritan work ethic , since each dollar earned would be worth more to him than to someone higher on the income scale .
Social conservatives have tended to argue that poor people lack the smarts or willpower to make the right choices .
Social liberals have countered by blaming racial prejudice and the crippling conditions of the ghetto for denying the poor any choice in their fate .
Neoconservatives have argued that antipoverty programs themselves are to blame for essentially bribing people to stay poor .
Karelis , a professor at George Washington University , has a simpler but far more radical argument to make : traditional economics just does n't apply to the poor .
When we 're poor , Karelis argues , our economic worldview is shaped by deprivation , and we see the world around us not in terms of goods to be consumed but as problems to be alleviated .
This is where the bee stings come in : A person with one bee sting is highly motivated to get it treated .
But a person with multiple bee stings does not have much incentive to get one sting treated , because the others will still throb .
The more of a painful or undesirable thing one has ( i.e. the poorer one is ) the less likely one is to do anything about any one problem .
Poverty is less a matter of having few goods than having lots of problems .
Poverty and wealth , by this logic , do n't just fall along a continuum the way hot and cold or short and tall do .
They are instead fundamentally different experiences , each working on the human psyche in its own way .
At some point between the two , people stop thinking in terms of goods and start thinking in terms of problems , and that shift has enormous consequences .
Perhaps because economists , by and large , are well - off , he suggests , they 've failed to see the shift at all .
If Karelis is right , antipoverty initiatives championed all along the ideological spectrum are unlikely to work - from work requirements , time - limited benefits , and marriage and drug counseling to overhauling inner-city education and replacing ghettos with commercially vibrant mixed - income neighborhoods .
It also means , Karelis argues , that at one level economists and poverty experts will have to reconsider scarcity , one of the most basic ideas in economics .
" It 's Econ 101 that 's to blame , " Karelis says .
" It 's created this tired , phony debate about what causes poverty . "
In challenging decades of poverty research , Karelis draws on some economic data and some sociological research .
But , more than that , he makes his case as a philosopher , arguing by analogy and induction .
This approach means that he remains relatively unknown , even among poverty researchers .
The book in which he laid out his argument , " The Persistence of Poverty : Why the Economics of the Well - Off Can't Help the Poor , " was n't widely read when it was published last year .
A few , though , have taken notice , and are arguing that Karelis does have something important to say .
" There 's not much evidence in the book , and there are a lot of bold claims , but it 's great that he 's making them , " says Tyler Cowen , an economics professor at George Mason University .
It " was a really great book , and it was totally neglected . "
The economist 's term for the idea Karelis takes issue with is the law of diminishing marginal utility .
In brief , it means the more we have of something , the less any additional unit of that thing means to us .
It undergirds , among other things , how the US government taxes people .
We assume that taking $ 40,000 in taxes from Warren Buffett will be a lot less onerous to him than to an elementary school teacher , because he has so much more to begin with .
In many cases , Karelis says , diminishing marginal utility certainly does apply :
Our seventh ice cream cone will no doubt be less pleasurable than our first .
But the logic flips when we are dealing with privation rather than plenty .
To understand why , he argues , we need only think about how we all deal with certain familiar situations .
If , for example , our car has several dents on it , and then we get one more , we 're far less likely to get that one fixed than if the car was pristine before .
If we have a sink full of dishes , the prospect of washing a few of them is much more daunting than if there are only a few in the sink to begin with .
Karelis 's name for goods that reduce or salve these sort of burdens is " relievers . "
Karelis argues that being poor is defined by having to deal with a multitude of problems :
One does n't have enough money to pay rent or car insurance or credit card bills or day care or sometimes even food .
Even if one works hard enough to pay off half of those costs , some fairly imposing ones still remain , which creates a large disincentive to bestir oneself to work at all .

The protracted fight between Ron Paul activists and the Nevada Republican Party over Nevada ’s delegates to the Republican National Convention is finally over .
Last week , the state party ’s executive board decided to appoint the delegates recommended by its nominating committee .
In a statement announcing the decision , state party Chairwoman Sue Lowden said appointing delegates “ was the best course of action . ”
“ We had every hope to reconvene the State Convention but feel strongly the nominating committee has chosen a wide range of delegates who will make our party proud , ” Lowden said .
Nominees were not asked which presidential candidate they supported , the party said .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won the Jan. 19 Republican caucus with 51 percent of the vote ; Paul placed second with 14 percent and ( now - presumed ) Republican nominee John McCain was third with 13 percent of the vote .
Republicans ended their April 26 convention without finalizing the 34 delegates to the national convention after procedural maneuvering by hundreds of well - organized Ron Paul supporters grounded the convention to a halt .
In early June , the state party announced it would reconvene the convention on Saturday , July 26 , to finish the party ’s business .
However , Lowden announced a week before the planned do - over convention that an insufficient number of credentialed delegates confirmed they would attend , leaving the party without a quorum .
“ With so many people concerned about the economy , it simply would n’t fair for us to ask delegates from all over the state to spend money to attend a convention if we know that a quorum wo n’t be present , ” Lowden said .
The party instead called a special meeting of the executive board to handle the issue .
Paul officially ended his presidential bid in June , but a spokesman for his ongoing movement — the Campaign for Liberty — told CQ Politics they were disappointed .
“ It ’s our position and our hope that the delegate votes should be counted and counted fairly , and it ’s disappointing that apparently they have not done so , ” spokesman Jesse Benton said .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
We made it through the bursting of the Internet bubble and now the bursting of the real estate bubble .
Next we may be approaching the end of the most worrisome bubble of all : the standard - of - living bubble .
That conclusion comes from the latest data on credit card debt .
It 's growing fast , but the problem is bigger than that - and to understand what it means , we have to take a few steps back .
For the past several years , the average inflation - adjusted total pay of American workers has n't been increasing .
That means we have n't been building a foundation for increases in our living standard .
You might be tempted to say that by definition our living standard could n't have increased , but that 's not quite right .
Even with stagnant real incomes , we can always live a little better every year through borrowing and pretending that our living standard is still rising , just as it was for decades .
So the Great Bull Market made us feel rich , and we felt justified in saving less and borrowing - and spending - more .
After stocks collapsed , home prices took off , making us feel rich all over again .
So we continued saving less and spending more , creating the illusion that our living standard was still rising .
In 2005 our personal savings rate went negative , but even that did n't slow us down , because our homes were still appreciating - and rising home values meant that household net worths were n't declining .
( Do n't be fooled by that saving - rate spike in this year 's second quarter ; it was probably a one - time event resulting from the federal stimulus payments . )
Of course , we do n't hear those assurances anymore .
Stocks are back where they were eight years ago , and home prices are where they were five years ago .
But personal debt is much higher than ever before , and average pay is still going nowhere in real terms .
So now how do we live as if our living standard is still rising ?
End of easy money
That 's where the credit card reports come in .
Last year , just as the subprime crisis happened , credit card debt took off .
The home - equity ATM had been shut down , so people turned to the last source of easy money they had left , the most expensive debt on the menu , credit card borrowing .
Since credit card debt has been growing much faster than the economy - more than 8 % in last year 's third and fourth quarters and over 7 % in May ( the most recent month reported ) - people are apparently using it as a substitute for income .
Thus , for the past year or so we have still maintained the standard - of - living illusion .
But a big crunch is coming - and here 's why .
Credit card debt , like mortgage debt , gets bundled , securitized , and sold off by banks .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , one of America 's largest credit card lenders , just reported that it lost $ 176 million in the second quarter through securitizing such debt .
That happens when the buyers of those securities observe rising delinquency rates and rising interest rates , and decide the debt is worth less than Citi thought .
More generally , the amount of credit card debt that is securitized nationwide has plunged by more than half in the past five months because it 's getting riskier .
That means credit card issuers will be charging customers higher interest rates , and since the banks can't offload as much of the debt as before , they 'll have less money to lend to cardholders .
The squeeze has already started , which is why Congress is in the process of passing the Credit Cardholders ' Bill of Rights , which would prevent issuers from changing rates and terms without warning , among many other provisions .
But bottom line , the credit card money window is going to start closing - and soon .
So now what ?
It 's hard to see where consumers can turn next .
Home prices seem highly unlikely to start rising again soon .
Stocks ?
You never know , but the Great Bull Market looks like a once - in - a - lifetime event .
Homes and stocks are households ' biggest asset classes by far .
There is n't much else to borrow against .
It may be that the standard - of - living bubble finally has to deflate .
Sustainable increases in living standards have to be earned , not borrowed , and that means performing ever higher value work that can't be outsourced .
We have n't been meeting that challenge very well ; doing so will probably require much more and better education for millions of Americans , which takes time and money .
The result may feel like deprivation , but I do n't see it that way .
Who knows - we might even find that living within our means and saving a little money actually is n't so bad .
MIRANSHAH , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Militants shot and killed an Afghan woman accused of being a U.S. spy in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan region , and dumped her body in a sewer , a witness and intelligence officials said on Wednesday .
The pro-Taliban militants in North and South Waziristan have killed dozens of people they accused of being Pakistani government supporters or spies for U.S. forces based in neighboring Afghanistan .
The killing of women , however , has been rare .
The body of Gulzada Bibi , a woman in her mid-thirties , was found with three bullet wounds in her chest near Degan village , some 35 km ( 22 miles ) west of Miranshah , the main town of North Waziristan , the officials said .
“ A note pinned to her body said she belonged to Afghanistan ’s Paktia province and was caught with a satellite phone she had been using to spy for the U.S. , ” said , Abdullah , a resident of the village .
The killing came two days after a suspected U.S. missile attack killed six people in neighboring South Waziristan , that Pakistani intelligence officials said had killed an al Qaeda chemical and biological weapons expert named Abu Khabab - al - Masri .
Many Taliban militants and foreign al Qaeda members fled to Pakistan ’s semi-autonomous tribal regions after U.S. - led forces ousted the radical Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001 .
Ultra Compact digital cameras are easily slipped into a pocket or purse , making them a great choice for photographers on the go .
Do n’t let their small size fool you , however — while they may not offer all the manual controls of their heftier counterparts , these are serious cameras that can take superb pictures without weighing you down .
1. Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS

4. Kodak EasyShare C653
You get a lot for relatively few dollars in the EasyShare C653 : 6.1 - megapixel imaging , a 2.4 - inch LCD screen , and good - looking photos .
On the downside , the EasyShare C653 runs on AA batteries , which lasted just 160 shots in our tests , far fewer than the average of 260 frames .
But its simplicity is a perfect fit for someone who just wants to take the occasional family snapshot
5. Nikon Coolpix L10
This latest version of Nikon ’s Wi-Fi camera captures nice images and lets you e-mail them straight from the camera via T - Mobile or private access points , but since it lacks a browser you ca n’t gain access to most free Wi-Fi access points .
6. Nikon Coolpix S500
The tiny Coolpix S500 delivers top - notch image quality .
In a compact camera so small , you still find features such as face detection and image stabilization , to make shooting faultless photos easy .
However , the Coolpix has no room for an optical viewfinder , so you must compose all of your shots on the LCD screen .
7. Fujifilm FinePix A610
The FinePix A610 has few manual controls , so it ’s best for people who rarely make camera adjustments .
Overall , the FinePix A610 ’s scores in our image quality tests were about average , but impressive for a budget - priced camera .
8. Fujifilm FinePix F05fd
The Fujifilm FinePix F50 fd may look dull , but its looks are only shell - deep .
Though it weighs more than most of the units in this roundup , it also has a larger - than - average LCD panel , at 2.7 inches , and a higher resolution ( 12 megapixels ) than most .
Fujifilm gave the FinePix F50fd all the latest gee - whiz digital camera features too , including image stabilization .
9. Canon PowerShot A460
The sophisticated and durable - looking Canon PowerShot A460 has a 4X optical zoom , whereas most cameras at this price level have only a 3X zoom .
The A460 starts up quickly , in 2 seconds , and offers both an eye - level viewfinder and a bright 2 - inch LCD screen .
A simple mode dial lets you select full auto , manual ( still automatic , but with some user settings ) , scene modes , and movie mode .
10 . HP Photosmart R37
The HP Photosmart R937 may be the coolest touch - screen toy you could carry .
It features a huge 3.6 - inch LCD that is touch - sensitive , making the Photosmart R37 a breeze to operate .
11 . Canon PowerShot A470
The 7.1 - megapixel PowerShot A470 , an inexpensive compact camera , performed as well as several far more expensive compact models .
The PowerShot A470 lacks a viewfinder , so you have to rely on the 2.5 - inch LCD screen .

A hapless Daily Mail hack 's failure to understand Googlebombing has led to her becoming victim of her own twisted definition of the mischief - making practice .
In her piece last Friday , " Blears falls prey to ' Google Bomb ' Attack Of The 50 - inch Woman " , Julie Moult hung a tissue - thin story about an alleged " Googlebombing " of Hazel Blears on the fact that a silly Photoshopped movie poster ( by b3ta.com regular Beau Bo d' Or ) of her is indexed by Google image search .
Probably the best known example of real Googlebombing is the George W Bush " miserable failure " campaign .
By coordinated linking of the anchor text " miserable failure " to the official White House presidential biography , website owners were able to manipulate Google 's algorithms to index Dubya at the top of the search rankings for " miserable failure " .
A genuine Googlebomb is thus slightly more sophisticated than typing " Hazel Blears " into Google and finding a daft picture of , er , Hazel Blears .
" Last night , the prank raised the possibility that she was the victim of ' Google Bombing ' , when internet enthusiasts manipulate rankings on search engines , " Moult wrote , wildly incorrectly .
Bloggers have leapt on the error , with predictable results .
We have a little sympathy with Moult and her non-story .
It 's the scrag - end of August and news is hard to come by , especially for the Daily Mail : the Royal Family are away badger racing , paedophiles have retreated to their subterranean volcano lairs and even swan- roasting Albanian asylum seekers have gone south to avoid the Global - Warming - Chaos of the British summer .
But the web is less forgiving .
Guess what happens when you Google " Julie Moult " now *...
Quite literally hoist by her own Googlepetard . ®
* Note to Julie : this is not a Googlebomb either .
Pervasive security cameras do n't substantially reduce crime .
There are exceptions , of course , and that 's what gets the press .
Most famously , CCTV cameras helped catch James Bulger 's murderers in 1993 .
And earlier this year , they helped convict Steve Wright of murdering five women in the Ipswich area .
But these are the well - publicised exceptions .
Overall , CCTV cameras are n't very effective .
This fact has been demonstrated again and again : by a comprehensive study for the Home Office in 2005 , by several studies in the US , and again with new data announced last month by New Scotland Yard .
They actually solve very few crimes , and their deterrent effect is minimal .
Conventional wisdom predicts the opposite .
But if that were true , then camera - happy London , with something like 500,000 , would be the safest city on the planet .
It is n't , of course , because of technological limitations of cameras , organisational limitations of police and the adaptive abilities of criminals .
To some , it 's comforting to imagine vigilant police monitoring every camera , but the truth is very different .
Most CCTV footage is never looked at until well after a crime is committed .
When it is examined , it 's very common for the viewers not to identify suspects .
Lighting is bad and images are grainy , and criminals tend not to stare helpfully at the lens .
Cameras break far too often .
The best camera systems can still be thwarted by sunglasses or hats .
Even when they afford quick identification — think of the 2005 London transport bombers and the 9/11 terrorists — police are often able to identify suspects without the cameras .
Cameras afford a false sense of security , encouraging laziness when we need police to be vigilant .
The solution is n't for police to watch the cameras .
Unlike an officer walking the street , cameras only look in particular directions at particular locations .
Criminals know this , and can easily adapt by moving their crimes to someplace not watched by a camera — and there will always be such places .
Additionally , while a police officer on the street can respond to a crime in progress , the same officer in front of a CCTV screen can only dispatch another officer to arrive much later .
By their very nature , cameras result in underused and misallocated police resources .
Cameras are n't completely ineffective , of course .
In certain circumstances , they 're effective in reducing crime in enclosed areas with minimal foot traffic .
Combined with adequate lighting , they substantially reduce both personal attacks and auto - related crime in car parks .
And from some perspectives , simply moving crime around is good enough .
If a local Tesco installs cameras in its store , and a robber targets the store next door as a result , that 's money well spent by Tesco .
But it does n't reduce the overall crime rate , so is a waste of money to the township .
But the question really is n't whether cameras reduce crime ; the question is whether they 're worth it .
And given their cost ( £ 500 m in the past 10 years ) , their limited effectiveness , the potential for abuse ( spying on naked women in their own homes , sharing nude images , selling best - of videos , and even spying on national politicians ) and their Orwellian effects on privacy and civil liberties , most of the time they 're not .
The funds spent on CCTV cameras would be far better spent on hiring experienced police officers .
We live in a unique time in our society : the cameras are everywhere , and we can still see them .
Ten years ago , cameras were much rarer than they are today .
And in 10 years , they 'll be so small you wo n't even notice them .
Already , companies like L - 1 Security Solutions are developing police - state CCTV surveillance technologies like facial recognition for China , technology that will find their way into countries like the UK .
The time to address appropriate limits on this technology is before the cameras fade from notice .

We 've seen alarm clocks institute some fairly unorthodox methods of waking users up , but this is exceptionally high on the list of " oh , no they didn'ts . "
Alice Wang 's Tyrant , which we can only assume is a concept , actually dials a random number in one 's mobile contact list for every three minutes that the sleeper does n't address the obnoxiously loud ringing .
In other words , unless you pick yourself up out of bed within ten minutes of the alarm going off , you 'll have three angry friends wondering why they 're getting phone calls from you everyday at O - five - hundred hours .
Brilliant .
Pure , sadistic , barbarous brilliance .

An economy drive requiring trainee Royal Navy gunners to shout " bang " instead of firing live shells has been condemned .
Iain Duncan Smith , the Shadow Defence Secretary , said the procedure called into question the quality of their training , even if £ 5 million was being saved .
Recruits at the land - based HMS Cambridge near Plymouth , Devon , reportedly load shells and set their aim before shouting " bang " into a microphone .
There will be question marks about the quality of their training
Iain Duncan Smith
Mr Duncan Smith told GMTV's Sunday Programme if the claims were true it was neither " laughable " nor " good husbandry of resources " .
He added : " I notice in Sierra Leone there are frigates there who are preparing to use their guns in support of British troops , ranges up to 15 or 16 miles which will cover the airport , and they will need to be accurate and well trained .
" If of course the people , let 's say in two years ' time , coming through are the same ones going " bang " instead of firing their guns there will be question marks about the quality of their training . "
Mr Duncan Smith said the ban on live fire training should be seen in the context of the Government cutting £ 800 million annually from the defence budget .
Some of the world 's biggest tobacco firms researched the lethal radioactive substance polonium – present in cigarettes – over a 40 - year period but never published the results , according to a new scientific article .
Experts have examined more than 1,500 internal documents from tobacco companies .
Polonium 210 is known to cause lung cancers in animals and studies suggest it is responsible for 1 per cent of all lung cancers – equivalent to 11,700 deaths globally – each year in the US .

It is also the substance that poisoned the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 .
Yet tobacco companies , while attempting but failing to remove the substance from their products , have kept quiet about their research , experts say .
One of the documents – all of which were made public through legal actions – said publication would be " waking a sleeping giant " .
The authors of the article , published in the September edition of American Journal of Public Health , also say tobacco companies feared possible litigation .
The quoted studies show polonium is present on the tobacco leaf and inside it as part of its chemical make - up .
Tobacco company scientists spent years trying to remove the substance by washing the leaf , achieving only partial success .
Attempts at genetic modification and creating filters to remove it also failed .
The research article , led by Monique Muggli , from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , says : " Philip Morris documents show the majority of the company 's internal reports regarding PO - 210 [ Polonium 210 ] were not published .
One manuscript believed by some Philip Morris scientists to be favourable to the tobacco industry was withheld from publication for fear of heightening public awareness of PO - 210 . "
It then quotes an internal document that says publication of that research , from 1978 , " has the potential to wake a sleeping giant " .
Ms Muggli added that , while tobacco companies tried to obscure other health controversies , their line on polonium seemed to be simply not to raise the issue .
" Unlike other smoking and health issues , where the industry line was to create doubt , in relation to polonium 210 and the radioactivity of cigarettes , the companies wanted to hide from that issue publicly .
They continue to minimise the recognition of radioactivity in their products in smoking and health litigation , " she said .
A spokeswoman for British American Tobacco said it was not known which constituents of cigarette smoke caused cancer and argued that polonium 210 is also present in food .
" It 's fairly common knowledge polonium 210 is in cigarette smoke because it 's present in all such plant types , including strawberries , " she said .
" There was a 1977 study that found , of the daily intake of the polonium 210 in a smoker , 77.3 per cent came from food and 17 per cent from tobacco .
The World Health Organisation is trying to determine which constituents of tobacco smoke are most important in diseases including lung cancer , but as yet have not concluded polonium 210 is a priority constituent . "
A spokesman for Philip Morris said many reports into polonium and cigarette smoke had been published over the last 30 years and links were available on their website .
He added that Philip Morris had published some of its research but no company would publish all its internal findings .
TORONTO  James Corey Glass , apprentice mortician and United States Army deserter , was keeping an unusually close eye on the text messages coming into his cellphone .
He was hoping to hear that a court had blocked the Canadian government ’s attempt to send him back to the United States .
On Wednesday afternoon , the message came : Mr. Glass , 25 , could remain in Canada while he appealed his removal order by the country ’s Immigration Department .
It was a welcome reprieve , he said , but well short of a guarantee that he and other deserters could make Canada their new home .
The Canadian government ’s effort to remove Mr. Glass contrasts with the warm reception given to deserters and draft avoiders from the United States during the war in Vietnam .
And although the war in Iraq has very little support among Canadians , the situation of Mr. Glass and others who abandoned their military positions provokes a wide range of responses .
For American soldiers seeking an escape , Canada is no longer a guaranteed haven .
“ It ’s quite clear that the current Canadian government does not want to annoy the U.S. government on this issue and will not give any ground , ” said Michael Byers , a professor of politics and international law at the University of British Columbia .
It 's an HTTParty and Everyone Is Invited !
So I ’ve made a boatload of gems that consume web services ( twitter , lastfm , magnolia , delicious , google reader , google analytics ) .
Each time I get a bit better at it and learn something new .
I pretty much am only interested in consuming restful api’s and over time I ’ve started to see a pattern .
The other day I thought , would n’t it be nice if that pattern were wrapped up as a present for me ( and others ) to use ?
The answer is yes and it is named HTTParty .
The Pattern
Every web service related gem I ’ve written makes requests and parses responses into ruby objects .
So first let ’s start with requests .
The request methods that you make the most use of are get and post , with put and delete occasionally sliding in .
I do n’t know about you but I constantly forget how to use net / http .
First , make the http , then the request .
Is it get or post ?
How do I get the response body ?
Maybe I ’m forgetful , but I always needed to have net / http ’s rdoc open when working with it .
Not anymore , though , cause now I just HTTParty like it ’s 1999 .
A Princely Example
To find something that I have n’t written a gem for , I hopped over to programmable web ’s API directory .
I chose
Who is my representative ‘s API because , frankly , I did n’t know it existed and it was really basic .
So let ’s say we want to get who my rep is :
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty end puts Representative.get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/whoismyrep.php?zip=46544').inspect
# " < result n= ' 1 ' >< rep name= ' Joe Donnelly ' state= ' IN ' district = ' 2 ' phone= '( 202 ) 225-3915 ' office= ' 1218 Longworth ' link = ' http://donnelly.house.gov/' /></result > "
Yep , that is it .
Include HTTParty and you are good to go .
So , that was easy .
Now we can make requests , but our response was just plain old xml .
We want ruby objects !
Let ’s require rexml or install hpricot or libxml - ruby next , right ?
Wrong !
Just set the format .
Automatically Parse XML
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty format :xml end puts Representative.get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/whoismyrep.php?zip=46544').inspect # { " result " =>{ " n " = > " 1 " , " rep " = > { " name " = > " Joe Donnelly " , " district " = > " 2 " , " office " = > " 1218 Longworth " , " phone " = > " ( 202 ) 225-3915 " , " link " = > " http://donnelly.house.gov/ " , " state " = >" IN " }}}
Yep , I ’m not joking .
That works , but let ’s wrap things up a little bit and make a prettier API for the developer that will eventually use our Representative library .
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty format :xml def self.find_by_zip( zip ) get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/whoismyrep.php', : query => { :zip => zip} ) end end puts Representative.find_by_zip(46544 ) .inspect # { " result " =>{ " n " = > " 1 " , " rep " = > { " name " = > " Joe Donnelly " , " district " = > " 2 " , " office " = > " 1218 Longworth " , " phone " = > " ( 202 ) 225-3915 " , " link " = > " http://donnelly.house.gov/ " , " state " = >" IN " }}}
There , that is a little better .
One simple module include ( HTTParty ) and we can make requests and automatically get our xml responses parsed .
Not to mention it ’s so easy my mom could do it .
What ?
Oh , you want to see JSON .
Sure , no problem .
Automatically Parse JSON
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty format : json def self.find_by_zip( zip ) get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/whoismyrep.php', : query => { :zip => zip , : output => ' json'} ) end end puts Representative.find_by_zip(46544 ) .inspect # { " results " =>[ { " name " = > " Joe Donnelly " , " district " = > " 2 " , " office " = > " 1218 Longworth " , " phone " = > " ( 202 ) 225-3915 " , " link " = > " http://donnelly.house.gov/ " , " state " = >" IN " } ] }
Holla !
You thought you had me but you did n’t .
Let ’s make our example a little bit more complicated and add another method to get all the reps by name .
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty format : json def self.find_by_zip( zip ) get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/whoismyrep.php', : query => { :zip => zip , : output => ' json'} ) end def self.get_all_by_name(last_name ) get ( ' http://whoismyrepresentative.com/getall_reps_byname.php', : query => { : lastname => last_name , : output => ' json'} ) end end puts Representative.get_all_by_name( ' Donnelly ') . inspect # { " results " =>[ {" district " = > " 2 " , " last " = > " Donnelly " , " first " = > " Joe " , " state " = > " IN " , " party " = > " D " } ] }
Notice any problems with that ?
I do .
I ’m repeating the domain and the output format in each request .
Let ’s fix that .
Helpers To DRY
Things Up
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Representative include HTTParty base_uri ' whoismyrepresentative.com ' default_params :output => ' json ' format : json def self.find_by_zip( zip ) get ('/whoismyrep.php ' , : query => { :zip => zip} ) end def self.get_all_by_name( last_name ) get('/getall_reps_byname.php ' , : query => { :lastname => last_name} ) end end puts Representative.get_all_by_name( ' Donnelly ') . inspect # { " results " =>[ {" district " = > " 2 " , " last " = > " Donnelly " , " first " = > " Joe " , " state " = > " IN " , " party " = > " D " } ] }
I used base_uri to remove the duplication of the domain and default_params to automatically append : output => ‘ json ’ to each request .
The previous examples give you a really good example of what HTTParty can do , but there is one last example I ’ll show .
HTTP Authentication
The only thing we have n’t covered is authentication .
API keys are simple , just add them to default_params I showed in the last example , but what about http authentication ?
Twitter uses http authentication , so our next example will use them .
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Twitter include HTTParty base_uri ' twitter.com ' basic_auth ' username ' , ' password ' end puts Twitter.post ('/ statuses/update.json ' , : query => {:status =>
" It 's an HTTParty and everyone is invited ! " } ) .inspect # { " user " =>{ " name " = >" Snitch Test " , " url " => nil , " id " => 808074 , " description " => nil , " protected " => true , " screen_name " = >" snitch_test " , " followers_count " = > 1 , " location " = >" Hollywood , CA " , " profile_image_url " = > " http://static.twitter.com/images/default_profile_normal.png "} , " favorited " => nil , " truncated " => false , " text " = >" It 's an HTTParty and everyone is invited ! " , " id " =>870885871 , " in_reply_to_user_id " =>nil , " in_reply_to_status_id " => nil , " source " = > " web " , " created_at " = >" Mon Jul 28 20:07:52 +0000 2008 " }
Cool .
Wait , HTTP Authentication has to go in the class ?
No silly , Trix are for kids !
The basic_auth method is just a class method so you can use it wherever class methods are acceptable .
Try this on for size :
require ' rubygems ' require ' httparty ' class Twitter include HTTParty base_uri ' twitter.com ' def initialize ( user , pass ) self.class.basic_auth user , pass end def post ( text ) self.class.post ('/ statuses/update.json ' , : query => { :status => text} ) end end puts Twitter.new ( ' username ' , ' password ' ) .
post ( " It 's an HTTParty and everyone is invited ! " ) . inspect # { " user " =>{ " name " = >" Snitch Test " , " url " => nil , " id " => 808074 , " description " => nil , " protected " => true , " screen_name " = >" snitch_test " , " followers_count " = > 1 , " location " = >" Hollywood , CA " , " profile_image_url " = > " http://static.twitter.com/images/default_profile_normal.png "} , " favorited " => nil , " truncated " => false , " text " = >" It 's an HTTParty and everyone is invited ! " , " id " =>870885871 , " in_reply_to_user_id " =>nil , " in_reply_to_status_id " => nil , " source " = > " web " , " created_at " = >" Mon Jul 28 20:07:52 +0000 2008 " }

TSA Snafu Grounds Nine Planes at O'Hare Field American Airlines : ' It 's an Unfortunate Situation '
August 19 , 2008  -- Nine American
Eagle airplanes were grounded Tuesday after a TSA inspector , conducting an overnight security check , used sensitive instrument probes to climb onto the parked aircraft at Chicago 's O'Hare Airport , aviation sources tell ABCNews.com .
A TSA official confirmed the incident .
At least forty regional commuter flights were delayed throughout the day , according to American Airlines .
" We think it 's an unfortunate situation , " American airlines spokesperson Mary Frances Fagen told ABCNews.com .
The TSA agent , as part of spot inspection of aircraft security , climbed onto the parked aircraft using control sensors mounted on the fuselage as handholds , according to a TSA official in Chicago , Elio Montenegro .
" Our inspector was following routine procedure for securing the aircraft that were on the tarmac , " Montenegro told ABCNews.com .
The TSA agent was attempting to determine if someone could break into a parked aircraft , according to Montenegro .
Pilots were furious at the TSA misstep .
" The brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers , " one pilot wrote on an American Eagle internet forum .
" They decided this instrument , the TAT probe , would be adequate to use as a ladder , " the pilot wrote .
Another pilot wrote the TSA agents , " are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives , and the lives of our passengers at risk . "
The TSA has been conducting such overnight spot checks at airports around the country .
Another airline , Mesa Air Group , told its employees earlier this month that " 48 percent of all TSA investigations involving Mesa Air Group involve a failure to maintain area / aircraft security . "
Mesa said it was imposing a " zero - tolerance " policy for such violations , threatening employees with dismissal .

There were 56 men who put quill to parchment during the Summer of Independence in 1776 .
Most of the signers would be unrecognized today , even if they turned up on Dancing with the Stars .
In their time , they were colorful men , prominent patriots and leaders of their colonies .
So this Independence Day weekend , let us reacquaint ourselves with five of these forgotten Founding Fathers .
Carter Braxton — Virginia ( 1736 -1797 )
One of the few signers from Virginia whose name was n't Jefferson or Lee , Carter Braxton nevertheless belonged to the colony 's plantation - owning aristocracy .
He sired 18 children — surely qualifying him as a founding father by anyone 's standards .
His first wife , who brought him a small fortune that augmented his own , died in childbirth two years after their marriage .
His second wife went on to give birth to their last 16 offspring , and outlived her virile husband by 17 years .
In 1761 , the same year his second marriage began , Braxton , then 25 , was elected to the House of Burgesses for King William County , in southeast Virginia .
By the spring of 1775 , tensions with the British were running high .
The day after shots were fired in anger at Lexington and Concord , Massachusetts , the British colonial governor of Virginia seized the gunpowder stored in Williamsburg .
Local militias were itching to fight to retrieve the powder .
Cooler heads " “ among them Braxton 's and George Washington's " “ convinced most of the militiamen to stand down .
Still , one militia , led by Patrick Henry , threatened to retaliate unless the British returned the gunpowder or paid for it .
Braxton intervened .
He set up a meeting with the king 's receiver - general , who happened to be Braxton 's father - in - law .
Braxton convinced him to pay for the gunpowder .
Revolution in Virginia was saved for another day .
In early 1776 , Braxton went to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia to fill the seat of a Virginia delegate who had died .
Historical sources disagree about Braxton 's initial position on independence , but in the end he signed on .
His is the final name in the Virginia delegation , the bottom - most name on the entire parchment .
Button Gwinnett — Georgia ( 1732 or 1735 - 1777 )
Even by the standards of the revolutionary period , Georgia 's Button Gwinnett practiced X - treme politics .
He was born in England and arrived in Savannah in 1765 , when the colony of Georgia was just 33 years old .
He bought land for a plantation , but failed as a gentleman farmer .
Where Carter Braxton was moderate and conciliatory , Gwinnett was incendiary .
As the split with Britain widened , he became a leader of Georgia 's radical faction of patriots .
In 1776 , he was elected to the Continental Congress .
His signature on the Declaration of Independence is the first of Georgia 's three - man delegation , at the far left of the document .
Back home in 1777 , Gwinnett participated in the convention that drew up Georgia 's first state constitution .
He also sought the leadership of the Georgia militia , a position that went to Col.
Lachlan McIntosh , a prominent member of a rival political faction .
Gwinnett's " ambition was disappointed , "  the Rev. Charles A. Goodrich wrote in Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence ( 1856 ) , " and being naturally hasty in his temper , and in his conclusions , he seems , from this time , to have regarded Colonel McIntosh as a personal enemy . " 
After the president of Georgia 's Committee of Safety ( the state 's executive council ) died , Gwinnett was appointed to finish his term .
The only vote opposing Gwinnett 's candidacy was cast by George McIntosh — Lachlan 's brother .
As council president Gwinnett was Georgia 's commander - in - chief , and he proposed an attack on British East Florida to secure Georgia 's southern border .
The McIntosh brothers and their circle condemned the plan as politically motivated .
Gwinnett had George McIntosh arrested for treason .
Amid the power struggle between Gwinnett and Lachlan McIntosh , the Florida expedition failed , and when a new legislature convened , it declined to elect Gwinnett governor .
It also cleared Gwinnett of charges of wrongdoing in the Florida debacle .
This infuriated Lachlan McIntosh , who denounced his rival publicly .
Gwinnett , following the script of the times , sought satisfaction from McIntosh 's attack on the field of honor .
" They fought [ with pistols ] at the distance of only 12 feet , "  the Rev. Goodrich wrote .
" Both were severely wounded .
The wound of Mr. Gwinnett proved mortal ; and on the 27th of May , 1777 , in the forty - fifth year of his age , he expired . " 
Gwinnett 's name lives on in suburban Gwinnett County , northeast of Atlanta , and in the value placed by collectors on his signature , the rarest of the Founding Fathers .
Robert Treat Paine — Massachusetts ( 1731 - 1814 )
During two trials in 1770 , as John Adams argued for the defense of the British soldiers who carried out the Boston Massacre , the man who faced him as prosecutor was friend and fellow Harvard graduate Robert Treat Paine .
Adams proved to have the superior courtroom strategy .
Juries acquitted the British commander and six soldiers for the murder of five Americans .
Two other soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter , punished and released .
Adams described Paine as conceited , but enjoyed his quick wit , and he was elected to the Massachusetts colonial assembly the same year as the trial .
Paine was chosen a delegate to the first and second Continental Congresses , where he acquired the nickname " Objection Maker "  as independence from Britain was being argued .
" He seldom proposed anything , but opposed nearly every measure that was proposed by other people ... " said Benjamin Rush , a semi- forgotten Founding Father from Pennsylvania .
Nevertheless , Paine signed the declaration " “ one of five Massachusetts men to do so .
He went on to become the new state 's attorney general , served on the committee that drafted the Massachusetts constitution , and was a founding member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston .
In 1796 , he accepted a seat on the Massachusetts Supreme Court , where he served until increasing deafness and poor health forced his resignation in 1804 .
" It would divert you to witness conversation between my ancient friend and colleague Robert T. Paine and me , "  an elderly John Adams wrote in 1811 .
" He is above 80 .
I can not speak and he cannot hear .
Yet we converse . " 
Edward Rutledge — South Carolina ( 1749-1800 )
In 1774 , just a year after returning to his native Charleston upon completing his legal studies in England , Edward Rutledge was elected to the Continental Congress .
Two years later , at age 26 , he was the youngest man to sign the Declaration of Independence .
( Benjamin Franklin , at 70 , was the oldest . )
Edward and his elder brother John were both central figures in South Carolina politics and the fight for independence " “ John gave up his seat in Congress before independence was declared to help rewrite South Carolina 's constitution " “ thus missing the chance to have his own section in this article .
Meanwhile , in Philadelphia , Edward was working to delay the moment independence was declared .
" Rutledge firmly believed that the Colonies should first confederate and nurture foreign alliances to strengthen themselves for the perilous step they were about to take , "  according to a biography published by the National Park Service .
In a vote on independence on July 1 , Rutledge led the South Carolina delegation in opposing a break with Britain .
Nine of the 13 colonies were in favor , so Rutledge proposed another vote the next day .
On July 2 , South Carolina sided with the majority for independence .
By the end of August , the British had occupied Long Island and were poised to conquer New York City .
Admiral Lord Richard
Howe sent out peace feelers , and Rutledge was chosen , along with Benjamin Franklin and John Adams , to meet with the British commander .
The discussion ended without positive results .
Rutledge spent the war years in political and military activities in South Carolina .
As a militia captain , he was captured by the British when they conquered Charleston in 1780 .
Rutledge spent a year in prison , until he was released in a prisoner swap .
He served in the state legislature in 1782 - 1798 .
During this period , the legislature appointed him a presidential elector three times .
His flourishing law practice and investments in plantations expanded his wealth .
By the time he was elected governor , in 1798 , his health was failing .
He died in early 1800 , at age 50 .
Elder brother John died the same year .
William Whipple — New Hampshire ( 1730 - 1785 )
Born in Kittery , Maine , William Whipple shipped out to sea early as a cabin boy .
By the time he retired from the mariner 's life , around the age of 30 , he had captained ships and was a wealthy man .
He settled in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , and went into business as a merchant with his brother .
By 1775 , his fortune secure , Whipple had the wherewithal and local standing to be elected to statewide offices and then to the Continental Congress .
He was the second of three New Hampshire men to sign the Declaration of Independence .
The first " “ fans of TV's West Wing will appreciate " “ was Josiah Bartlett ( although the eponymous fictional president had only one " t "  in his last name ) .
Whipple 's sea - toughened revolutionary activities were just beginning .
In 1777 , he became brigadier general of the New Hampshire militia .
That autumn , he was a commander in the American campaign against the British that led to Gen .
John Burgoyne 's surrender at Saratoga , in New York 's Hudson River Valley .
The American victory prevented the British from severing New England from the rest of the country .
And it demonstrated that the Americans could defeat the British on their own .
Throughout the campaign , Whipple was attended by a slave named Prince .
It is believed Prince is the black oarsman depicted in the famous Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze painting George Washington Crossing the Delaware , although it 's doubtful Prince actually was at the crossing .
In 1780 , Whipple was elected to the New Hampshire General Assembly , and in 1782 was made a judge of the state Supreme Court .
By then he was suffering from heart failure , and he once fainted on his horse while riding his circuit .
In 1875 , the New Hampshire Patriot summed up his legacy this way : " If not a star of the first magnitude " ¦the life of Whipple yet emitted a clear and steady effulgence , which sided in conducting the people in to the goal of independence . " 
David Holzel is a freelance writer outside Washington , DC .
He likes to think his Franklin Pierce Pages emits a steady effulgence .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - OPEC on Thursday warned of growing uncertainty over demand for its oil in the years ahead , raising doubts whether multi-billion - dollar investments in new supply will be needed .
OPEC , in its 2008 World Oil Outlook , said demand for its oil could fall to 31 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in 2012 , below current production , as additions to supply excluding OPEC crude outpace growth in demand .
The outlook underscores OPEC ’s concern about moves in Europe and the United States to cut oil dependence and promote alternatives .
Any investment shortfall would worry consumer nations facing record oil prices .
“ Our member countries , if they see the demand is low , they will not invest , ” OPEC Secretary - General Abdullah al - Badri told Reuters , referring to the supply and demand outlook to 2020 .
“ They have education problems , they have housing problems , they have health problems , they have roads problems .
They have a lot of activities they can invest their money on . ”
Concern that supply will fall short of future demand due to rising consumption in Asia and the Middle East and limited investment in new oilfields has helped to send oil prices to a record near $ 146 a barrel .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , source of two in every five barrels of oil , expects world demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd annually to 2012 and ease to 1.2 million bpd in the longer term .
In the period to 2012 , the group expects additions to total supply excluding OPEC crude -- such as non-OPEC oil , biofuels and OPEC ’s natural gas liquids -- to average 1.4 million bpd , more than demand growth .
The 13 - member OPEC , which holds about three - quarters of the world ’s proven crude reserves , said current plans to develop oilfields should increase supply capacity by more than 5 million bpd by 2012 .
“ These projects are already under way , some are currently under construction and some are close to completion , ” OPEC said .
“ Yet there is a real prospect of wasting resources on capacity that is not needed . ”
ENOUGH OIL
Demand would reach 113 million bpd by 2030 in OPEC ’s reference case -- more than 4 million bpd less than expected in last year ’s outlook -- from 85 million bpd in 2006 .
OPEC said the slowdown reflects efficiency improvements based on a higher price assumption of $ 70 to $ 90 a barrel for its index of crudes , up from $ 50 to $ 60 in 2007 .
Its outlook is in contrast to that of the International Energy Agency , an adviser to 27 oil consumers which has been urging OPEC to raise output and to boost investment .
The IEA on July 1 forecast consumption would rise by 1.5 million bpd to 2013 , faster than the average rate of supply growth , and signaling little relief from high prices .
Badri in the report reiterated OPEC ’s view that there is “ more than enough ” crude on the market now and blamed factors other than supply such as the weak U.S. dollar for rising prices .
Further ahead , OPEC warned that policy changes made investment decisions more difficult , saying demand for its crude could vary between 29 million and 38 million bpd by 2020 .
“ The range of uncertainty for OPEC oil is considerable , ” it said .
“ This translates into an uncertainty gap for upstream investment needs in OPEC member - countries of over $ 300 billion . ”
Such policy moves include the European Union ’s plan to get 10 percent of road fuels from renewable sources such as biofuels by 2020 and a U.S. law boosting the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks .
OPEC also said rising construction costs and a shortage of skilled labor posed threats to projects to build refineries to satisfy the world ’s growing demand .
It also warned the gap between supply and demand for middle distillates would grow , unless there was more investment in diesel - oriented projects .

The great mystery of bee deaths has been solved .
Colony Collapse Disorder is poisoning with a known insect neurotoxin .
Clothianidin , a pesticide manufactured by Bayer , has been clearly linked to die offs in Germany and France .
Although the bee die offs that have occurred recently are more severe , there have been many in the past from the same and similar products .
In North Dakota , a lawsuit is pending against Bayer for the loss of their bees in 1995 , the result of spraying rapeseed with Imidacloprid .
In 1999 , the same product was banned in France for use as a seed dressing for sunflowers when they lost one - third of their hives after widespread spraying .
In 2004 , it was banned for use on corn .
Recently , France refused to approve Bayer 's request to sell Clothianidin .
Clothianidin and Imidacloprid are both members of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids .
They are well known as insect neurotoxins , especially with regard to bees .
The spokesperson for the Coalition Against Bayer Dangers , based in Germany , stated , " We have been pointing out the risks of neonicotinoids for almost 10 years now .
This proves without a doubt that the chemicals can come into contact with bees and kill them .
These pesticides should n't be on the market .
" That neonicotinoids are potent neurotoxins , especially in insects , is unsurprising .
They were developed for precisely that purpose .
Bayer says that their use is safe for bees , when used according to instructions .
This involves using a glue that keeps the pesticides stuck to the seeds on which they 're used .
There are many problems with this .
Agribusiness corporations are known to evade anything that costs them money .
The glue costs money .
The equipment and personnel required to apply it costs money .
More careful pesticide application to try to keep it from becoming airborne costs money .
Obviously , both unscrupulous agribusiness farmers and unknowing small farmers -- not to mention home gardeners -- will , at least occasionally , not use the glue .
Even then , it 's impossible to believe that a fair amount of these pesticides wo n't become airborne .
Further , their residue will poison the soil .
It will be passed on into foods , which means that insects will come into contact with it there .
Is n't it interesting that a major pharmaceutical manufacturer , Bayer , also makes a product that is a poison by design ?
Bayer is not an exception .
Many , if not most , do business in both arenas .
That alone should give pause for thought .
Here 's a list of corporations -- not expected to be complete -- that profit in both pharmaceuticals and pesticides : * American Home Products * AMVAC * Astra Zeneca * Aventis* BASF * Bayer * Dow Chemical * Dupont Chemical * Merck * Monsanto* Novartis* PharmaciaIs it an accident that most of Big Pharma also manufactures pesticides ?
Is there a connection between the two types of products ?
Do the pharmaceutical arms of these corporations profit on the illness caused by the pesticide arms ?
These questions are rhetorical .
We 'll let the reader decide .
Mike Adams has humorously shown with his Disease - Mongering Engine ( https://www.naturalnews.com/disease-mongering... ) , which creates new diseases at the push of a mouse button , how easily phony diseases can be created to sell pharmaceuticals and fatten the pocketbooks of the medical world .
The same technique has been used to cloak massive bee die - offs with an air of mystery .
Colony Collapse Disorder is a false name that serves to mislead the public into believing that there 's a new , mystery disorder , probably something very complex , that needs tons of money to be thrown at it so that every possible angle can be studied .
The reason is simple .
By misdirecting the public , and apparently many professionals too , the real reason for bee die - offs is obscured .
This is very much like the misleading pseudoscience that supposedly debunks global climate change by giving a false impression that there is no consensus among scientists .
By stirring pesticides into a mix of other supposedly possible causes , such as bacterial infections , fungal infections , and environmental stress , a false controversy is created .
That results in precious time being wasted , while we really do move into a world without bees .
At the same time , money is being thrown at scientists , who should know better , but being just as human as the rest of us , they 're tempted .
Eventually , the real cause starts to become obvious , as is happening now in bee die - offs .
However , the guilty party , the one making obscene profits by selling neurotoxic poisons that destroy the earth , launches a campaign of disingenuous lies , misdirection , and lawsuits to continue to sell their contaminants as long as possible .
Meanwhile , we 're being told that we must prepare to live in a world without bees , as if it 's inevitable .
All because of Colony Collapse Disorder , a cleverly marketed nonexistent disease .
We live in fear of the implications of no bees , when the real threat is poisons manufactured for the sole benefit of obscene profits .

The games industry says British universities are failing to equip graduates with the skills it needs .
The warning comes from the industry campaign group " Games Up ? " , which says games developers in Britain are facing a serious skills shortage .
The lobby group says there are now 81 video games degree courses at British universities .
But only four are accredited by Skillset , the government body which monitors such courses .
Demanding course David Braben , chairman of Frontier Developments and a spokesman for " Games Up ? " , said : " 95 % of video gaming degrees are simply not fit for purpose .
Without some sort of common standard , like Skillset accreditation , these degrees are a waste of time for all concerned . "
The warning came as executives from across Europe 's games industry gathered for the GameHorizon conference in Gateshead .
The North East of England is one of the centres of a games industry whose activities are spread widely across the UK .
At Northumbria University , which offers a degree course in Computer Games Engineering , staff say that prospective students are often put off by the requirement for Maths A - Level .
Dan Hodgson , who is the course leader , says the games industry is very demanding and the university makes that clear to aspiring students .
" We do have people who do n't have the right mindset .
We consistently tell them that this is one of the hardest courses we offer at this university .
It 's certainly not for the sort of people who want to laze around and play games for three years . "
Death of maths
Fewer people are taking maths degrees
The games developers say that they are struggling to find in the UK the kind of high - powered mathematicians and computer scientists that they need to build increasingly sophisticated products .
" We are facing a serious decline in the quality of graduates looking to enter the industry , " said David Braben .
" The dearth of maths , physics and computer science graduates is hitting us hard . "
Jamie Macdonald , of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe , said there was a need for Centres of Excellence which would prepare graduates to compete for jobs in the industry .
" We want to work with government to help equip our graduates with the skills they need to thrive in one of the most dynamic and profitable industries in the world .
Britain has been one of the leading nations for games development but slipped from third to fourth position behind Canada in 2006 .
The games industry claims that Canadian government support has allowed it to flourish , and thousands of jobs are moving from Britain to Canada .
Your comments :
As a lecturer I have been tasked by my bosses to set up a Games Deign Foundation degree .
The problem is , it is very hard to find out what games firms want from graduates .
Several do not reply to queries or are not interested in sharing their requirements .
I would love to set up a course that was relevant and useful in the industry , as I have seen other courses that market themselves as game courses but are just not up to the task .
I would like any curriculum I put my name to to have real utility , not to be just a vanity or marketing exercise .

As a game developer I suggest that if the industry wants to attract top talent it needs to address the disparity between high demand for skilled workers and low wages .
It seems the games industry has for years relied on the image of it being a ' fun place to work ' .
Relative to other industries where a similar skill set is required , it is poorly remunerated and often badly managed which in turn drives away many experienced developers .
It would make me happy to see more graduates coming out with better computer science skills but the games industry is partly to blame for it 's recruitment woes .
Anon , London I 'm a University student , and I plan on moving to Canada as soon as circumstances permit .
The opportunities in IT and the government support the industry receives made it an easy choice to make .
S , South Wales I will be beginning a Computer Games Design in September at Huddersfield University .
I believe that the gaming industry is continually improving the standards of the digital age , however this industry is still not highly regarded .
Gaming is constantly berated by the news because of it's ability to express very grey area ideologies and it's negative appeal to children and teenagers alike , this in turn affects educating others of this medium .
The core aspects of gaming involves a mixture of both art and the understanding of how it works in relation to its environment ; nation wide schools are under heavy observation by the government and its examinations are constantly questioned .
So i ask you how can the government help equip the students of today with the necessary skills when they constantly suggest education itself needs to be improved ?

Writing computer games is one of the most demanding types of programming around .
Optimisation of code and algorithms is very important in order for the game to run fast enough .
I understand completely the need for A Level Maths .
The problem is that kids who play video games are not necessarily the right people to program the games .
The industry needs to attract good programmers , even those who do not play video games .
The industry needs to let these kids know that what counts is there programming skill and not what level they can reach on Doom .
Enticing a programmer by showing them flashy graphics and sound is not going to do it .
In order to attract the programmers they want they need to emphasise the " geeky " stuff such as algorithms and programming challenges .
I do not want someone who enjoys making a spinning triangle look 3D , I want someone who enjoys making that triangle interact with other triangles in an intelligent way .
I , Rockford , IL , USA I used to be in the games industry for over 8 years .
Started as a game tester and made my way to the position of designer .
3 years ago i left the industry to take up a position at West Cheshire College teaching on a game development course at National Diploma level .
We have a wide range of students and teach them basic techniques that will get them ready for university or a job in the industry .
Most recently we had one of our students finish the course and was then offered a job at Travellers Tales working on Lego Batman .
I 've found that like with all industries , if the individuals focus and really start to develop their skills and understanding of the industry they wish to enter .
A basic grasp of game mechanics and more importantly from a design point of view , discovering the origins of games in general would stand anyone in understanding how to make a solid game in today 's market .

The cost of entry is very valid here .
A development kit for a PSP runs into the tens of thousands of dollars plus requiring access to middleware like Renderman .
Universities and lone hackers can't put together that sort of cash so they work on things they can afford .
This is why you 'll see an upsurge in games for mobile phones with iPhone and Android .
The development kits are free .

Asked if NN08 tried to get Mr. Obama this year , Gina Cooper , who has helped organize all three conventions , said , “ Of course we did . ”
She added that the request was “ unusual because generally people come to us . ”
She said Mr. Obama already had commitments ( his campaign spokesman said he was preparing for his trip abroad ) but noted the many panels in which his team would participate .
“ There ’s such a synergy between his campaign philosophy and what we ’re doing , ” Ms. Cooper said , though she added that the netroots were feeling an “ urgency ” about certain issues that Mr. Obama may not be reflecting .
Josh Orton , the political director of NN08 , said : “ One strength of the online community is that issues get substantive discussion , so while not everyone here will agree with Obama 100 percent of the time , we ’re also not chained to conventional wisdom . ”
That synergy between the campaign and the netroots has been lost of late as the media has reported about schisms between them , based on Mr. Obama ’s perceived lurch to the center .
Still , despite the Obama campaign ’s organizing prowess online , and its ability to raise staggering sums , the candidate ’s relationship with the netroots has not always been smooth .
Straw polling last year showed the netroots preferred John Edwards of North Carolina over Mr. Obama .
Part of the problem stems from a difference in style .
The netroots can be reflexively confrontational and demand ideological purity .
A couple of years ago , the netroots breathed hot down Mr. Obama ’s neck for staking out centrist positions .
But he played it cool .
In a memo in September 2005 , “ Truth , Tone and the Democratic Party , ” which his staff posted on the Daily Kos , Mr. Obama took issue with their tactics .
He wrote that Democratic candidates who wanted to win the trust of voters could not , like the netroots , demonize those who disagreed with them or be ideological pure ( hat tip to Matt Bai ’s “ The Argument , ” Penguin Press , 2007 , for a great description of this episode ) .

già mi immagino il boom di accessi al trailer o gli incassi ai botteghini del film di Marco Tullio Giordana che viene presentato oggi a Cannes e uscirà venerdì nelle sale .
Perchè ?
A prescindere dalla bravura degli attori si è saputo che nel film , ma anche nel trailer , c’è grande abbondanza di baci ( il film racconta la caduta agli inferi tra sesso e cocaina , di una coppia di attori in pieno regime fascista ) , tra questi uno saffico della bella Bellucci con la giovane Lavinia Longhi .
Dopo tutto il parlare e i pruriti su una sua presunta relazione con la D’Amico … ora si calvalca l’onda , e anche sul sito del corriere la stellina cadente del film parla già di come la Bellucci l’abbia messa a suo agio quando si sono baciate .. mah !
Ci mancherebbe pure che un’attrice seria sia a disagio !
Quanto al film aspettiamo le reazioni alla proiezione e gli esiti al botteghino , nel mentre piovono le rime accuse di revisionismo , ma aspetto di vederlo prima di parlare !
Nel mentre godiamoci il successo di Gomorra che ha fatto pieno in sala a Cannes e nei botteghini con incassi record ( 2 milioni nel week end ) !
The Bad Music Movement …..
Since the dawn of popular music , there was always movement ; a constant â€œprogressingâ€ in a fashion that defined each movement as an era .
Generally speaking , these eras could be viewed in five to ten year spans .
The musical difference ( musical difference meaning the general sound of the recordings and artistic message ) was obvious from 1950 to 1960 , 1960 to 1970 , 1970 to 1980 , etc .
But something peculiar happened towards the tail end of the 90s :
It appears that since then there has n’t been much progressing .
So in 15 - 20 years from now how will we define the signature sound of the 2000s ?
Probably something like â€ œthe era of hyper - compressed , way too distorted , ear fatiguing music that is now classic because the music today in 2020 is so much worse .
Haha , I really hope not , but certainly a song coming out today does n’t have a sonic fingerprint that , say , could n’t be heard in 2001 .
Indeed there has been great music in the past 8 - 10 years , but we all know that something has changed .
There is a reminiscing in the air - passionate music lovers ; people of all walks of life longing for a time when they could buy great CDs - new releases - every week remember those days ?
For those who say that there is just as much great music today , well then they also have to admit one of two things along with that theory :
a) This multitude of great music is not getting out to the masses anymore , or
b ) The masses do n’t t like great music anymore
The term masses is not to be taken with a negative connotation ; I ’m speaking of your average music lover , your everyday passionate listener .
I guess they are gone because this tremendous amount of great , inspiring music is going unnoticed .
The more likely scenario is that great music has greatly diminished .
All right , so if that ’s the case there must be a reason , or perhaps several reasons all coming together to create the perfect storm for the invading bad music movement .
I ’m not saying there is anyone specific to blame , it is simply a cultural shift .
I do n’t claim to have any solutions but without trying to be too cynical , I would have to say that musical movements the way we once knew them could very well be part of our human history .
Music will go on just fine and I ’m sure plenty of great bands and artists will emerge in the future , however their relevancy on a pop culture scale will most likely be very limited ( except for the very few ) .
Let ’s hope that ’s not the case .
I have heard several people who are of the opinion that music and creativity has maxed out because there is only so much you can do and it ’s all been done .
Is music like a natural resource ?
Can it be depleted ?
If so , can it grow back ?
If it can , we need to start some music cultivation farms ( oh wait , they used to be called major labels ) .
But seriously , I do think it is harder to be original today than it was in the 70s or 80s .
Also , great acts almost always take many years to develop and in today ’s culture of people only wanting to be famous , the object of creativity has dramatically shifted .
The mentality is more in the form of let ’s just throw it down quick so we can go get famous .
The modern digital age has enabled bad music to be mass - produced very quickly and the wannabe famous artists in the basement are flooding the airwaves .
Great art is a long labor of love that few people have the time for these days .
Add to that the fact that there are fewer live venues for budding artists than ever before .
Many of the great acts we ’ve come to know in the past honed their craft by gauging the reaction of real people .
They could see the faces of the audience when they tried out their new material .
If your audience were falling asleep during that new song , maybe you would think twice about ever recording it .
Bands and artists are at a huge disadvantage who cannot perform live or do n’t have venues to do so .
Instead of playing their instruments they ’re at home playing with their computer mouse .
To summarize , here are some points , which most likely contribute significantly to the great decline of music :
– Too much information .
People do n’t have time to sift through a billion myspace pages
– Music and arts programs have been removed from our public schools .
So many children have been growing up without ever having a chance to not only learn and study music , but understand its history
– Music is free
– Live venues are dwindling
– Fame has become the ultimate goal
– Music has become devalued , why ?
Because it ’s free
– Anyone who can play 3 chords or rap a line has the ability to record it and post it on the web for the whole world to hear , though the world is hardly paying attention anymore ( you better have AMAZING songs )
– It ’s harder to be original and it ’s harder to stand out
– Sonically , music is waaaay too compressed and loud , making it very fatiguing to the ears for any extended period of time - the burn - out rate is fast
– People do n’t even buy stereo systems anymore - most people I know listen to music only on their computer speakers
So in conclusion , it seems most likely that we need a cultural movement if we ever hope to see another big musical movement .
I suggest we make some truly inspired music for the love of it and turn away from this ego driven , fame lusting , sick sick culture of ours ¦and may God bless America !
( I ’m not just saying that rhetorically , I mean it .

As C&L and many others have reported last night , CBS news had a huge scoop Tuesday night on John McCain , because he falsely claimed that the surge was responsible for the " Sunni Awakening in Anbar . "
That is FALSE .
The Sunnis changed positions before the surge was ever discussed so --- McCain once again makes a major mistake on the one issue his campaign is running on --- The Iraq war .
However , CBS probably violated its own rules ( Standards and Practice ) by altering the video of Katie Couric 's interview with McCain that left out his major blunder on this issue and then broadcast it on our airwaves .
CBS should not paste together separate answers from different questions to make it appear like an answer was fluid .
It was completely taken out of context .
I understand that a fair amount of editing has to be done , but what they did failed to meet the legitimacy test .
Here 's what happened .
ON CBS Nightly News , Katie Couric started off the segment with question # 3 of her interview from their website version of the McCain interview :
Couric QUESTION # 3 : Senator McCain , Sen. Obama says , while the increased number of U.S. troops contributed to increased security in Iraq , he also credits the Sunni awakening and the Shiite government going after militias .
And says that there might have been improved security even without the surge .
What 's your response to that ?
They then edited out his major gaffe on " the surge " and inserted his partial answer to question # 1 and then spliced in a partial answer to question # 3 to make it appear to be a consistent response .
Q1 Sen .
Obama has indicated that by his failure to acknowledge the success of the surge , that he would rather lose a war than lose a campaign .
Q3 Thanks to General Petraeus , our leadership , and the sacrifice of brave young Americans .
I mean , to deny that their sacrifice did n't make possible the success of the surge in Iraq , I think , does a great disservice to young men and women who are serving and have sacrificed .
There will still be attacks .
Al Qaeda 's not defeated .
But the progress has been immense .
And to not recognize that , and why it happened , and how it happened , I think is really quite a commentary .
Here 's part of his answer from question # 3 that they left on the cutting room floor and which exposes John McCain as not knowing what he 's talking about once again about the war in Iraq .
I do n't know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened .
Colonel McFarlane ( phonetic ) was contacted by one of the major Sunni sheiks .
Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others .
And it began the Anbar awakening .
I mean , that 's just a matter of history .
Thanks to General Petraeus , our leadership , and the sacrifice of brave young Americans .
I mean , to deny that their sacrifice did n't make possible the success of the surge in Iraq , I think , does a great disservice to young men and women who are serving and have sacrificed .
They were out there .
They were protecting these sheiks .
We had the Anbar awakening .
We now have a government that 's effective ...
It completely changes what he meant and actually said to Couric .
Here 's the full transcript .
The story on their website is still solid , but the presentation on air was not and is outrageous .
There must be some repercussions against this gaffe no matter who is involved and what happened .
They need to come out and apologize for their ethical lapse .

CBS used to have an ombudsman site called The Public Eye :
Public Eye 's fundamental mission is to bring transparency to the editorial operations of CBS News - transparency that is unprecedented for broadcast and online journalism .
And what , exactly , is transparency ?
It has several aspects , but most simply it is this : the journalists who make the important editorial decisions at CBS News and CBSNews.com will now be asked to explain and answer questions about those decisions in a public forum .

By combining some of the finest online music services , the folks at Favtape have concocted a lightening - fast online mixtape creation tool that creates sharable mixes of your favorite songs in under a second .
Assuming you already have a Last.fm or Pandora account ( and really , who does n't ? ) , all you need to do is enter your user name or profile page URL for that service into Favtape , and it will retrieve 10 songs that you have bookmarked or favorited there into a mixtape that approximates the interface we saw earlier on Muxtape .
Songs are delivered from SeeqPod 's directory of online MP3s using SeeqPod 's readily - available API , as pointed out by monkey_bites .
Ryan Sit of FreeStyle Labs told us that they made the service tosolve problems with some of the very sites upon which it relies .
" It startedbecause it really sucks when you bookmark a song on Pandoraor ' Love ' a song on Last.fm and can't play it on - demand later , " he saidvia e-mail .
" Muxtapeis also really cool , " Sit explained , " but you need to manually upload the MP3s , whichmakes it a drag to create a muxtape and update it . "
FavTape solves bothproblems by grabbing song URLs from SeeqPod to power anon-demand service that creates Muxtape - like web page mixtapes out of your Pandoraor Last . fm favorites .
For example , here 's the mix it created from my Last . fm account .
monkey_bites observes that there 's no way to reorder Favtape mixes , which is sort of a shame considering how long song sequencing has been a crucial aspect of mixtape making .
But since the whole point of this service is to create mixes really quickly and easily , we 'll give it a pass in that regard .
You can also listen to mixes on the site even without knowing their URLs in advance .
A music discovery section
allows browsing of other users '
Favtapes and lists the most popularones .
Every mix listed in the discovery section includes afew sample songs , so you can see what you 're in for before clicking .
Everysong on the site includes links to Amazon , iTunes , Flycell ( a ringtoneservice ) , Lyricwiki , a Favtape artist page and similar artists .
All songs are available as direct , on - demand links , and an e-mail link sends them to your friends .
Try Favtape out for yourself ( Pandora profile URL or Last. fm user name required ) and feel free to post the URL of your mix as a comment below .
It 'd be nice to see what Listening Post readers are into these days .

The current issue of BusinessWeek features a big collection of articles on personal challenges in the workplace .
I eagerly read their article about work - life balance as this is something I struggle with , but I was disappointed to find that the article mostly consisted of stories about people who were already well off who simply just chose a different career .
While that is one great way to improve your work - life balance , it ’s really just one way to do it .
In fact , it ’s not even really a choice for many people .
Quite often , we find ourselves in a personal or financial state where we simply can’t just pack up and switch jobs .
Maybe we really like our jobs , but they just encroach on our lives too much .
Maybe it pays really well .
Maybe we ’re afraid to make the leap into a new career , or we do n’t want to rock the boat of our home life too much .
Here are a list of fourteen additional techniques for improving your work - life balance that I ’ve discovered over the past few years .
Leave the office early , period .
Easier said than done , right ?
Not if you set a departure time as a clear goal very early on .
If you set an absolute time to leave earlier in the day , that time serves as a deadline to get your tasks done for the day , making you stay more focused throughout the day .
Your reward ?
You actually get out of the workplace at a reasonable time .
Try it !
Tomorrow , define an exact time you ’re going to leave early in the day and keep your eye on the clock throughout the day .
Recognize that you need to get your required tasks done by then , and when you pull it off , get out of there and enjoy your work - free evening .
Reduce your wasted time at work …
Often , I find myself wasting time at work .
I ’ll surf to some of my favorite political websites , distract myself with something interesting to read , or play a game when I should be working .
These things simply waste time – they ’re a basic method of procrastination .
My best method for counteracting this is by actually blocking the most distracting websites , and also closing all potentially distracting software that I ’m not actively using ( like my web browser ) .
Try it !
Close all of the programs that distract you , especially your web browser .
If you do n’t regularly use your web browser for work , hide it , so it ’s harder to get to .
… but actually take breaks .
On the flip side of that coin , regular breaks to allow your mind ( and body ) a break from work tasks can be very helpful if they ’re brief and spread apart .
If you ’re focused on your tasks for an hour or two , by all means , take a short break and do something completely different .
Eat a healthy pick - me - up snack ( like an orange ) , drink some water , and do something interesting ( like reading The Simple Dollar , for example ) , but get back to work reasonably quickly .
Try it !
Make it your goal to spend the next two hours without any personal distractions , but then have a ten minute break where you get something to eat and drink and do something else .
Write a “ to - do ” list for the next day before you leave .
One of the biggest challenges at the start of a workday is simply figuring out what to do : what needs to be picked up and continued and what tasks need to be started ?
It ’s easy to waste a bunch of time in the morning getting back in the flow , and that wasted time is often tacked on at the end of the day , preventing you from getting out of there .
Instead , before you leave in the evening , make a list of the key things you need to do the next day and leave it right where you ’ll find it in the morning , so you can just grab it and dig right in tomorrow without burning that start - up time .
Try it !
Before you leave from work , make a list of three things you need to accomplish tomorrow and leave it out where you can find it .
Then , the following morning , pick up that list and immediately get started on the tasks .
You ’ll find that your morning is immediately more productive – getting you on the ball quicker and out the door quicker , too .
Carefully consider your work goals , and tone them down a bit .
Many people find themselves with a work - life balance that ’s out of whack because they chose to take on more projects at work than they could reasonably manage .
Usually , this results in work encroaching more and more on personal lives , to the discomfort of not only the worker , but the worker ’s family and friends .
Why do they do this ?
They hope to get ahead in the workplace , based on a perspective that it will make their life better .
Instead , the chase makes their life worse .
Why not step back and ask yourself what you really want and whether taking on more projects at work will really get the job done ?
Perhaps executing a small number of projects well is better than juggling a lot of projects and doing them poorly .
Try it !
Take a look at all of the ongoing projects you ’re currently responsible for and see if there are n’t any that you can trim away or give to someone else .
Also , make a commitment to not take on new projects until you can complete the ones you ’re currently responsible for with a high level of quality .
Have “ focused sessions ” at work , where you eliminate all distraction .
Another aspect of modern work that keeps people in the office too late is distractions – people stopping by , phone calls , emails , instant messages , meetings , and so on .
These little distractions destroy our train of thought and make it much more difficult to bring sustained focus to a project .
The solution is to have short sessions ( an hour or two ) where you permit no distractions at all and focus on your work .
Turn off your phone .
Close your email program .
Close your office door .
Then , focus on what you need to do .
Try it !
For one hour , do everything you can to eliminate interruptions .
Close your email program , turn off your phones , close doors that when open invite people in , and so on .
Then , use this solid block of time to really bear down on your most important task .
Keep careful documentation of the tasks you accomplish …
Whenever you accomplish a notable task or project , document it .
Write down the date you completed it , as well as a detailed summary of what you did , and keep it someplace where you can easily retrieve it .
Over time , these documents provide strong documentation of all of the work that you actually do .
Not only does this help greatly with performance reviews , it also makes it clear how much work you actually accomplish .
Try it !
Start keeping a log of your significant accomplishments .
You can either make a daily work log or just simply make a list of every significant thing you accomplish .
Include details and do n’t forget about it !
… and then discuss a reasonable and more flexible work arrangement with your supervisor .
If you ’ve been working hard , accomplishing useful stuff , and maintaining a log of it , your next performance review should be a good one , and hopefully it will end with some discussion about performance - based rewards .
Instead of just diving for the money , talk about some workplace flexibility , like some degree of flex time , the ability to telecommute on occasion , or other perks that will help you find more breathing room for the life you want to live .
Try it !
The next time you ’re talking about a raise , instead talk about getting a more flexible work schedule .
More flexibility with your time will save you that money anyway and will also improve your quality of life .
Turn off routes of communication to work when you leave .
Do n’t check that email when you ’re at home .
Do n’t leave that cell phone on .
Leave the CrackBerry in your bag .
Just turn them off when you leave and deal with the problem when you return .
There are some jobs where you ca n’t do this – IT jobs come to mind – but for many jobs , you do n’t have to let technology crash the work - home barrier .
Try it !
When you get home , shut off the technologies that connect you to work and just enjoy some uninterrupted personal time .
After all , the freedom is what you work for , right ?
“ Unwind ” with something personally and spiritually fulfilling and relaxing .
Many people “ unwind ” by vegetating in front of the television .
Big mistake .
While it can help you relax , it also provides minimal spiritual and personal fulfillment and is quite often loaded with tons of mixed messages , ones that we ’re particularly susceptible to when we ’re tired .
Instead , seek out other ways to unwind .
Perhaps sitting on a park bench will do the trick for you , or maybe you can unwind while playing with your kids .
Meditation , prayer , and yoga also work .
For me , actually , cooking can really do the trick .
Try it !
Instead of unwinding in front of the television , try another simple activity to unwind .
Give meditation , prayer , or yoga a try , or go to a park and enjoy nature .
Better yet , find a simple activity you really enjoy , even if it seems silly .
Set aside blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on what ’s really important to you .
One of the biggest challenges I had in figuring out my own work - life balance was my children .
They deserved my uninterrupted attention sometimes , and when I was juggling my full time job and my burgeoning writing , it was very difficult .
The way I managed it was to realize that time with my children every day was of paramount importance , and so I just scheduled a three hour block of time each day that I spent solely with my family , usually from five to eight each evening .
We ate supper together , played in the yard together , read stories together , and so on .
Setting aside that block of time made my life bearable – without that time block , I would have felt very empty with regards to my life .
Try it !
Figure out which element of your life you ’re missing the most because of a work - life balance that ’s out of whack and set aside a block of time to focus solely on that element .
It might just be a big block each week , or it might be a smaller block every day , but set aside that time for what ’s most important to you .
Get involved in a significant and personally important project outside of work .
Some people tend to get absorbed in their job because they do n’t have a deeply meaningful element of their life outside of work , so they let their job become their life .
Over the long run , this is dangerous , as it wears you down and spits you out .
A much better approach is to find a major project to involve yourself in outside of work , whether it be your family , a community group , a volunteer project , or something oriented around personal growth or fun .
Try it !
Spend some time to find out about and get involved with groups or projects of personal interest to you , and when you find one that really clicks , dig in deep and get involved .
Actually use your vacation time , even if it ’s just spent around the house .
At my previous job , there were people who consistently lost their vacation time simply because they did n’t use it .
Quite often , these same people were those who were tied to their desks and clearly unhappy about it , with that unhappiness eating into their productivity and effectively eating up the time they could be spending on vacation .
Do n’t let yourself fall into that trap .
Instead , keep focused on your work and actually use your vacation , even if it ’s at home .
Take that time to do something fun and different or dabble in an area you ’ve never tried before .
Try it !
Never let your vacation time lapse .
Instead , always use it up – and use some of it to just stay at home and try some new things or complete some personal projects left undone .
Get adequate sleep .
“ Does n’t a couple more hours of sleep eat into my personal time ? ”
Sure , but if you ’re exhausted , you ’re spending more time getting less done at work and enjoying your time at home less , too .
A solid night ’s sleep vastly increases your concentration level , making you more productive at work and adding to your enjoyment of your personal life as well .
Try it !
If you feel tired on a regular basis , try to adjust your sleep so that you get closer to an optimum amount of seven to eight hours a day .
If you get less than that , cut out some nonessential activities ( like television watching ) for sleep ; if you get more , try going to sleep later or getting up earlier .
A scheme to dump quicklime into the oceans to sequester more carbon in their depths is being revived by a British management consultant with backing from Shell .
First proposed back in the '90s by Exxon engineer Haroon Kheshgi ( .pdf ) , the idea takes advantage of a series of simple chemical reactions .
Limestone , at high temperatures , breaks down into carbon dioxide and quicklime , in a process that produces greenhouse gas .
But dump that quicklime in seawater , and it absorbs roughly twice as much CO2 as was released in the first reaction .
The heat required to decompose the limestone will probably come from fossil fuel , generating more CO2 , but even so , the sum of the process could be a reduction of the CO2 in the atmosphere .
" If we discover we 've overshot the amount of CO2 the environment can cope with , the carbon - negative process I 'm describing can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , " said Tim Kruger , founder of Cquestrate.com , which has drawn seed funding from Shell and bills itself as developing an open source solution to climate change .
Geoengineering projections have shown that it might be possible to stop the warming of the Earth , but the workable ones have had a big problem : the oceans .
While schemes like shooting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to deflect some of the sun 's energy could cool the Earth , they do n't deal directly with the problem of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Regardless of the greenhouse effect , CO2 buildup will lead to ocean acidification , which could wipe out coral reefs and lead to large - scale oceanic ecosystem collapse .
The quicklime scheme is different .
It would go right at the heart of the CO2 buildup problem by removing the gas from the air and sequestering it in the world 's oceans .
It also makes the oceans more alkaline , directly combating ocean acidification .
Of course , the scale of the project would have to be eye - poppingly large .
The early calculations , Kruger told Wired.com , indicate that
56 billion cubic feet of limestone would be required to sequester each gigaton of carbon .
Humans put out about 5.5 billion tons of carbon annually by burning fossil fuels , so a limestone offset budget could reach 300 billion cubic feet of limestone per year .
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates limestone reserves as adequate for every country in the world .
This scheme , however , would require a major ramp - up in lime production from the 300 million tons now produced in the world .
The energy requirements would also be enormous .
Kruger estimates that 2.7 gigajoules of energy will be required for the conversion of each ton of limestone .
Multiplied out , his numbers suggest the equivalent of 10 billion barrels of oil would be necessary to generate the heat for decomposing those billions of cubic feet of limestone – although oil would not be the fuel of choice .
Where would that energy come from in a world of rising energy prices ?
Kruger said that the first place would be " stranded energy , " like the natural gas that is flared during oil recovery .
The World Bank estimates that 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are flared each year .
That amount of gas translates into about 3.3 billion exajoules of energy , or about one - third of the energy required to decompose enough limestone to offset all of the carbon emissions generated by human fossil - fuel use .
Kruger said that solar thermal and nuclear power plants could be other heat - generating options .
Still , geoengineering experts are skeptical that securing enough energy for the process to scale up will be possible .
" The basic problem is that there is not all that much stranded energy around , so it is at best a niche opportunity , " Ken Caldeira , the Stanford professor and geoengineering expert , wrote on the Geoengineering Google Group .
Environmental advocates , too , worry about unforeseen deleterious effects on the ocean ecosystems near lime deposition points .
EcoGeek blogger Hank Green even compared the scheme to a lobotomy for the Earth , opining , " Pouring many tons of calcium hydroxide into the oceans in an attempt to decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is akin to shoving a rod into your brain and hoping you come out the other side a happier person . "
Logistically , the idea would have to work work at the global scale , but use local supplies of limestone that happen to be located near natural gas fields or solar - plant filled deserts .
Kruger said that was necessary to make the process cost - effective while remaining net carbon - negative .
" The important point is to locate the process where the energy is cheap , " Kruger said .
" That 's the only way that this is going to be economically feasible . "
Whether or not the scheme works , it 's likely to spark more debate about how human beings should be approaching the dual problems of ocean acidification and climate change .
You can join the official debate around Kruger 's idea at Cquestrate .
" I want to make sure that this succeeds , or that if it does n't succeed , it fails quickly , " he said .
" Getting people to contribute information , we 'll see if there is some fundametal flaw in the idea . "

Yes , China won the most gold medals at the Olympics and the United States won the most total medals .
But is that really the best way to measure Olympic success ?
The guys over at Freakonomics say probably not .
If you look at gold medals per million inhabitants , the rankings look much different :
So if you 're keeping score , it's :
1. Jamaica
2. Bahrain
3. Estonia
....
33 . United States
...
47 . China
Well , better luck next time .

If it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck
The iPhone is not a " phone " any more than my laptop computer is a phone .
The iPhone can make phone calls , but so can my laptop .
I could call your phone using my voice - over - IP system , and you would n't know the difference .
I can even put a card in my laptop that enables communication over a cellular network .
The iPhone has a 412MHz processor , 128MB of RAM , wi-fi , bluetooth , and several gigabytes of storage .
It has an operating system , and runs applications written in the same programming language that one can use to write programs for any OS X desktop system .
The current list of applications available for the iPhone includes wiki software , an office suite , financial management programs , and of course an e-mail client and web browser .
Just because it fits in your pocket does not mean that it is n't a computer .
As the specifications of the hardware and the diversity of available proprietary applications indicate , it 's a general - purpose device .
This is a simple case of applying the " duck test " —
If it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , it 's probably a duck .
Any resemblance to an " appliance " or " just a phone " is the result of artificial restrictions imposed by Apple via software .
It is backwards to allow the severity of these restrictions , which limit what users can do with the device , to be used as justification for whitewashing ethical concerns that are intrinsic to general - purpose computers .
These restrictions give Apple unprecedented and unjust control over iPhone users .
More than one bad apple in the bunch
For many years , we have been suffering from Microsoft 's PC monopoly ; a platform that has allowed Microsoft to inflict untold harm on computer users and the computing industry .
The free software community has been working for many years to give people an opportunity to escape to GNU / Linux from Windows , but the iPhone would allow no such escape route .
The Free Software Foundation will be treating this new proprietary platform as another threat to user and developer freedom , in the same way that we have worked to counter the threats posed by every other proprietary operating system , from Microsoft Windows in all its forms , to Apple 's OS X and other proprietary Unix variants .
Of course , other " smartphones " are also general - purpose computers , and they also run proprietary operating systems .
The FSF is directing attention to the iPhone at this moment in time for two main reasons .
First , the recent release of iPhone 3G means that many people are contemplating a purchase , and wo n't get information about its restrictions from Apple 's marketing machine .
Second , there has been a great deal of confusion in both the free software and open source communities about whether it is possible to develop and distribute free software for the iPhone .
Free as in freedom , not beer
There are many " free as in beer " applications available for the iPhone portable computer .
When we talk about whether " free software " can be written for it , we are not talking about this " gratis " kind of free .
We mean free as in freedom , like free speech .
Even when it does n't cost money , software that is licensed under typical restrictive terms takes important freedoms away from users .
Some people lump this in with " open source " , but distinguishing free software is important .
The term " open source " puts the emphasis on access to a program 's human - readable source code , but that is only one prerequisite for users to have freedom .
Talking about free software means also talking about the freedoms to change , modify , and share the software .
Having source code is useful , but if a user can't do anything with it , she is still squarely under Apple 's thumb .
" I 'm sorry Dave , I 'm afraid I can't do that ... "
In order for any program to be installed on the iPhone , the program must be cryptographically signed .
When a user attempts to install software on her iPhone , the iPhone 's Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) system checks to see if Apple considers the signature on the software to be valid .
If there is no signature or if the signature is invalid , the iPhone will refuse to install the software .
If the software has been modified in any way , the signature check will fail .
The signature check is also tied to the user 's specific device , which means that she is not permitted to transfer or copy downloaded programs directly between iPhones , and any other copying is permitted or not permitted at Apple 's whim .
This system of rejecting software that does n't pass a signature check — even when modifications to the software are legally permitted — was made famous by TiVo , and so is called " tivoization " .
Apple forces all programs distributed through the iTunes App Store to be signed in this way .
It does n't matter if the program does n't cost any money or if its author actually wants its users to be able to copy and share it .
Even worse , Apple says that the iTunes App Store is the only legitimate way for regular users to obtain and install iPhone software ( there has been some confusion about this with regard to Apple 's developer and ad hoc certificate systems which will be addressed by the next article in this series ) .
They claim that tivoization is necessary for " security " .
These specific claims will also be addressed in depth later in this series , but in the end their DRM system is simply a way of kicking away the ladder now that they have achieved a position of power .
It 's well - known that the kernel and many applications that ship with Apple 's operating system are based on free software .
They are happy to avail themselves of the freedom that free software provides when it suits them , but they do n't want you to do the same .
In fact , they argue that for you to do the same would be a threat .
Getting at the core of the issue
Authors who write free software intend for other users and developers to be able to make modifications to their work and to be able to share their work with others .
Contrary to the dominant myth , there are many creators out there who actually want this .
Like mathematicians building on the publicly available proofs and theorems of their predecessors , many of these programmers see freedom , openness and sharing as critical to the whole enterprise of software .
The existence of the GNU / Linux operating system and such widely used programs as Firefox and OpenOffice.org proves both the reality and the merits of their approach — these are programs whose authors want you to make and share as many copies as you like , either modified or unmodified .
The GNU General Public License ( GPL ) is a legal document that many such authors use to describe the terms under which they share their work with others .
Whereas most software licenses — the texts you usually have to agree to in order to install a new piece of software — spell out a laundry list of restrictions , the GPL spells out permissions , under the basic " copyleft " umbrella principle of share and share alike .
Any programmer can include a copy of the GPL along with her program to give a clear indication that she wants all of its users to have these permissions .
Programmers can often distribute software under the terms of the GPL even when that software is designed for use on proprietary operating systems like Microsoft Windows or Apple 's OS X .
So even if users are stuck with Windows , they can still use individual free software applications , and can obtain them from whatever store or web site they want .
This has to date been as true on smartphones as it has been on other computers — Windows Mobile , Palm , Symbian , and Blackberry phones , though still proprietary at their core , have permitted authors to write and distribute free software , and users to install it .
Apple , though , is pushing a tivoized model of software development and distribution — a model enforced by a laundry list of restrictions that puts them in control as gatekeepers , threatening anyone who would challenge this control with jail time under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
The DMCA says that if a person attempts to bypass " technological protection measures " ( a horrible misnomer ) like Apple 's DRM , maybe by installing on a friend 's phone an unsigned piece of software that she wrote , she has committed a crime .
Apple 's approach runs headlong into an important part of the GPL 's copyleft approach — the principle that anytime someone shares a copy of a GPL - covered program with another person , she also needs to provide that person with the installable , human - readable source code for that program .
This ensures that everyone who gets a copy of a program also gets the raw material needed for any study and modification .
This freedom is not meaningful if the computer on which the software is meant to run arbitrarily rejects any potentially changed version installed by the user simply because it has not been signed or approved by a " higher " authority .
The latest version of the GPL ( GPLv3 ) includes a provision to address the threat posed by this tivoization and put a stop to this method of depriving users of freedom .
In Section 6 , it says :
" Installation Information " for a User Product means any methods , procedures , authorization keys , or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source .
The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made .
If you convey an object code work under this section in , or with , or specifically for use in , a User Product , and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term ( regardless of how the transaction is characterized ) , the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information .
In other words , users must be able to exercise their freedom to install and run modified versions of any GPLv3 - covered program distributed on the iPhone .
Systems that use cryptographic keys could be fine — but the user needs to have access to any such keys along with the code .
However , in order to write software for the iPhone and have that software distributed , a developer has to agree to the Apple 's iPhone Developer Program License Agreement ( in addition to several other licenses ) .
Section 5 of this agreement says :
You further represent and warrant to Apple that the licensing terms governing Your Application , or governing any third party code or FOSS included in Your Application , will be consistent with and not conflict with the digital signing or content protection aspects of the Program or any of the terms , conditions or requirements of the Program or this Agreement .
In particular , such licensing terms will not purport to require Apple ( or its agents ) to disclose or make available any of the keys , authorization codes , methods , procedures , data or other information related to the Security Solution , digital signing or digital rights management mechanisms utilized as part of the Program .
These two licenses are incompatible .
Apple 's license says that to write and distribute software for the iPhone , developers have to agree that any freedom users should have to modify and share their software is secondary to the paramount requirement of observing and protecting Apple 's DRM system .
This is n't a case of being picky about some legalese .
There is a reason Apple does n't want users to be able to install modified software on their portable computer , even if the software 's creators want to encourage that — they want to control what users do with their computers .
For one example among countless potential " antifeatures " , they do not want users or developers to be able to write or modify voice - over - IP applications to use the 3G cellular data network , because this use goes against their profit motive and the profit motives of their business partners .
Upsetting the apple cart
Apple 's DRM software and the accompanying legal threats are in place to further their own interests by restricting the freedoms of computer users , while GPL v3 exists to protect those freedoms .
If you are a software developer , please support free software by sharing your code under the terms of GPLv3 .
Even if you are not writing code specifically for the iPhone , use GPLv3 to ensure that no one else can subject it to the shackles of Apple 's DRM .
In the world of mobile software development , we can and should focus our efforts on developing applications for the FreeRunner and other rapidly advancing smartphones that support and encourage user freedom .
Even if we could find some legal loophole that would make free software possible on the iPhone , it would be better to contribute our efforts to platforms for which respecting user freedom and creativity is a founding principle .
If you are not a software developer , you can join us in writing to Tim Cook at Apple ( tcook@apple.com ) to let him know that we will not purchase or support the iPhone because it is incompatible with free software .
CC us at campaigns@fsf.org , and if you hear back from him , forward his reply to us .
Please help us cut through the haze of confusion and Apple marketing propaganda by sharing this and other articles in the series with your friends , family , collaborators and colleagues .

It has been unclear for many years how embryonic stem cells develop to their final destination as a specific tissue of the grown organism .
Recently , a collaborative research group from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , the US National Institutes of Health and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto was able to discover the specific process the cells go through .
The research answered a long - standing question as to whether the cells achieve their goal via selective activation or selective repression of genes .
This discovery could help fight various diseases by improving medical ability to create specific cells in order to replace damaged tissues .

Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are derived from embryos which develop from eggs that have been fertilized in - vitro ( test tube ) in a fertilization clinic and then donated for research purposes .
The cells are then transferred to a laboratory culture dish that contains a nutrient broth where are put through different genetic and physiological tests .
These are cells that have not yet differentiated to any specific tissue and can become any type of cell .
The process of their becoming tissue specific cells was in the spotlight of the study in question .
The research team conducting this study included Dr. Eran Meshorer of the Department of Genetics at the Silberman Institute of Life Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
The team has discovered that the ES cells express large parts of their genome without any constraints .
They express various lineage - specific and tissue - specific genes and also non-coding regions of the genome and repetitive sequences that comprise most of the mammalian genome , but are normally suppressed .
Until recently , it was widely thought that most of the repetitive regions were not important for the organism .
This discovery , among others , indicates that these areas have some unknown use and further research on their mission is necessary .
Pluripotent , embryonic stem cells originate
as inner mass cells within a blastocyst .
The stem cells can become any tissue
in the body , excluding a
placenta ( Credit : Mike Jones )
The next peculiarity the team saw was that when an ES cell differentiated into a cell type specific to a tissue , many genes were silenced ( no longer expressed ) and could no longer be activated .
Until that happened the genome remained flexible , with the ES cells staying “ ready to go ” right until they had to differentiate and become any type of cell .
Silencing , being an irreversible process , shuts down this ability .
To reveal the process , the researchers created the first full - mouse genomic platform of DNA microarrays .
Microarrays are glass - based chips that allow simultaneous detection of thousands of genes .
The microarrays used in this study were not confined to any specific genes but scanned the genome as a whole .
In this study , hundreds of such arrays were analyzed in order to cover the entire genome and test the gene expression during different points of stem cell differentiation .
By observing the changes between different time points , the researchers were capable of establishing the exact point in time when the stem cells developed into specific tissue cells and the silencing occurred .
Many attempts are being made to replace damaged tissue with ES cells in diseases such as Parkinson ’s , Multiple Sclerosis , and Alzheimer ’s .
When scientists will be able to improve the understanding of ES cell differentiation even more , the medical options of fighting these diseases will be expanded .
TFOT covered the topic of ES cells extensively in the past in the article entitled “ Shedding Light on Blindness ” .
TFOT also covered the topic of artificial stem cells capable of curing Parkinson ’s disease , and stem cells used for rebuilding heart tissue .

State police arrested a man , who was said to have the highest ever - recorded blood alcohol level of 0.491 percent that should have caused him death .
Stanley Kobierowski , a 34 - year - old man of North Providence got arrested after crashing into a highway message board on Interstate 95 in Providence .
When police stopped him , the man could hardly move to get out of the car then he grabbed the car to oppose his being taken out of it .
Police had to carry him to the nearest lane and back to their barracks , the report says .
A breath test indicated blood alcohol level of 0.489 percent , followed by 0.491 , said Maj. Steven O'Donnell .
" The person 's lucky they survived , " he said .
" There 's no doubt he would have gotten killed or killed someone if he had continued on the route he was taking . "
Kobierowski was sent to the hospital , placed for detoxification and sedated .
He was charged of driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest and will appear in court on Friday .
Unless a person is considered extremely tolerant for alcohol , a blood alcohol content of 0.20 percent means very serious intoxication , 0.30 is considered a stupor , 0.40 percent is the lethal dose for 50 % of adult humans , while 0.5 is considered fatal , according to health department statistics .

Click to viewMillions of homes have an Xbox 360 sitting in the living room , but if you 're only using your 360 to game , you 're missing out .
With some free tools and a little elbow grease , that compact , networked PC sitting under your television can offer a whole lot of useful media functionality .
The fact is , your 360 is capable of so much more than just gaming .
Let 's take a look at a few ways you can get more from your Xbox 360 .

I 'm a casual gamer who bought his Xbox 360 a solid two years after its release .
I 've built a dedicated DVR PC for my living room and am no stranger to incorporating computers with my home theater .
Once I bought my 360 , however , I 've been able to get rid of my home theater PC , my DVD player , and even my cable box , so that my entire entertainment system runs through my Xbox 360 .
It 's convergence at its best .
The 360 is not perfect by any means , but it 's the best multimedia device I 've ever used .
With that in mind , let 's start souping it up .

Installing a dedicated home theater PC under your TV is overkill for most people , especially if you do n't want a big , noisy PC in your living room .
But if you 've got a Windows computer capable of running Windows Media Center ( that includes either Windows XP Media Center Edition or Vista Home Premium and Ultimate ) and an Xbox 360 that 's already in your living room , you can use your 360 as a Media Center extender .
That means that you get virtually all of the goods available in Windows Media Center on your living room TV through your Xbox .
If you install a tuner card on your PC , your 360 becomes a full - fledged DVR .
Even if you do n't take the TV route , your 360 - as - extender can play back music and stream video from your PC as well as provide access to other online content .

If you 've already got your 360 set up as a Media Center extender and you 've got a Netflix subscription , you can turn your Xbox 360 into a streaming Netflix Player with access to the over 10,000 titles in the Netflix Watch Instantly library .
Sure you could shell out $ 100 for Roku 's official Netflix Player , but this Media Center plug - in works wonderfully with the Xbox to do virtually the same thing the Roku player does and then some ( including save Netflix videos on your hard drive to watch later so you do n't have to deal with buffering ) .

When it comes time to connect your Xbox 360 to your home network ( which is a must if you 're looking to squeeze more functionality from it ) , not everyone is keen on snaking hundreds of feet of ugly Ethernet cable through their living room to get connected .
On the other hand , the official Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter lists around a hefty $ 100 .
If you 're looking to take your 360 wireless without the added cable clutter , you 've actually got a few cheaper options , and you may already have all the tools you need .

DIY Wi-Fi Adapter :
We highlighted how to build a Wi -Fi adapter for your 360 on the cheap using an inexpensive router or bridge , but Gina 's more recent guide to wiring your living room over Wi -Fi with a wireless bridge goes into the specifics .
Alternately , if you 've got an extra Wi - Fi router sitting around the house capable of running the open - source DD - WRT firmware , you can just use DD - WRT to build a wireless bridge .

Play Back Any Media Over Your Network
Even if you have n't set up your 360 as a Media Center extender , you can still use it to play back media over your home network through the Xbox Dashboard .
Media support used to be fairly limited ( and still could use expanded support ) , but after a much anticipated update to the 360 at the end of last year with support for DivX and Xvid videos , setting up media sharing for your 360 is a must .

The Windows Solution :
If you 're running Windows , all you need to do is enable sharing through one of a number of avenues — either using Windows Media Player 11 , the Zune software , or Windows Media Connect .
Microsoft offers detailed instructions for setting up media sharing with your Windows PC .

But I 've Got a Mac :
If you 're not running Windows , sharing media over your home network is n't so easy .
In fact , unless you want to run one of the Windows solutions in a virtual machine like VMware Fusion or Parallels and you 've already bought those programs , there 's no free solution .
However , if you 're willing to lay down $ 20 , applications like Connect360 and Rivet provide arguably better functionality than the default Windows solutions , including on - the - fly transcoding of several unsupported file formats so you can play back even unsupported media on your 360 .
Both apps have demo versions that limit the amount you can stream but work if you only need to stream a video or song every now and then .
But I 've Got Linux :
If you 've got an Xbox despite your commitment to free and open source software , you 're still not completely out of luck .
One fellow Ubuntu user has detailed how to stream music from Ubuntu to your Xbox 360 by spending a bit of time in Terminal .
Unfortunately these methods wo n't get you video streaming , but a little music is better than nothing .

Silence Your 360 with a New Fan
Advertisement
Like I said above , a 360 in your living room is much quieter than just any PC under your TV , but that does n't mean that it 's silent .
On the contrary , the Xbox 360 can be quite noisy .
I 've never noticed significant noise issues , especially when the DVD drive is n't spinning ( for example , when I 'm using the 360 as a Media Center extender ) , but if your Xbox is a touch too noisy for your tastes , you can silence your Xbox 360 with a new fan .
Keep in mind that cracking open your Xbox will void its warranty , and this hack could get you kicked off Xbox Live , so if either matter to you , you may want to skip this one .

Transcode 360 : If you prefer watching video on your Xbox as a Media Center extender rather than through the Xbox 360 dashboard , there 's a catch : Windows does n't support Xvid and DivX playback on the 360 as an extender — despite the fact that the Xbox 360 itself can play back those formats just fine .
The freeware application Transcode 360 automatically transcodes those videos for your 360 extender so you can get the same video support in the interface you prefer .

How you make your Xbox 360 sing ?

A few miles from the Vatican , Najat Hadi kept house with her husband , his other wife and their assorted children , an unhappy home with a hateful woman 10 years her junior and a cruel spouse who left her with a jagged scar peeking from her collar .
Finally , she says , her Egyptian - born husband , who worked in Rome making pizzas , beat her so badly that she left him .
But he kept her children .
Thousands of polygamous marriages like Hadi’s have sprung up throughout Italy as a byproduct of a fast - paced and voluminous immigration by Muslims to this Roman Catholic country .
Despite the obvious culture clash , Italian authorities largely turn a blind eye , leaving women in a murky semi-clandestine world with few rights and no recourse when things go especially badly , as they did in Hadi ’s case .
Advertisement
“ It is absurd that in a civilized country like Italy , so little is acknowledged about this , ” said Souad Sbai , a Moroccan - born Italian lawmaker who has emerged as a one - woman champion of female Muslim immigrants here .
Italy is one of several European nations faced with the issue of polygamy .
In Britain and Spain , where large Muslim communities have also settled , some officials favor recognizing polygamous marriage as a way to ensure the wives ’ access to pensions , medical care and other state benefits .
But Sbai , who has lived 27 of her 47 years in Italy , thinks that misguided attempts at cultural sensitivity backfire when customs that stray into illegality are tolerated .
Italian law sanctions marriage between a single man and a single woman only .
Sbai estimates that there are 14,000 polygamous families in Italy ; others put the number even higher .
Many take advantage of the so - called orfi marriage , a less formal union performed by an imam , that does not carry the same social or legal standing as regular marriage .
Advertisement
She is convinced that the polygamists in Italy are practicing a more fundamentalist and abusive form of multiple marriage .
Because they feel so threatened by the Western culture around them , the men often imprison their wives and confine them to a life of solitude wholly dependent on the husband .
“ They are kept in a kind of ghetto , ” Sbai said .
--
When Sbai recently created a hotline for Muslim immigrant women , she was inundated with 1,000 calls in the first three months .
To her astonishment , she had tapped into a hidden community of women desperate for information , many trapped in violent , polygamous households , isolated and lonely .

Hadi , a Moroccan , had endured beatings and humiliation because she felt she had nowhere to turn .
She said she met and married her husband in 1987 in Italy , where she was visiting on holiday .
They had a religious ceremony at a local mosque and a legal wedding at the Egyptian Embassy in Rome .
Over the next decade , she gave birth to four children .
Then , one day in 2000 , Hadi returned from a vacation in Egypt , where she had taken the children to spend time with her husband ’s family .
In her Rome apartment was a new woman .
Her husband had married again while she was gone .
“ I returned and found her in my house , ” Hadi , 46 , said .
Hadi said she at first challenged her husband but then decided there was little she could do .
“ He said , ‘ I ’ve married this woman . ’
I wanted to know why .
I told him to send her away .
He refused .
But where could I go with four children ? ”
She tried to accommodate the other woman , an Egyptian whom Hadi describes as full of hatred .
Advertisement
“ I tried to accept her , for the children , ” Hadi said .
“ But she was n’t a woman with a brain . ”
Her husband ’s beatings got worse , landing Hadi repeatedly in the hospital .
The pale scar on her chest is a remnant of the time she says he took after her with a knife .
Then , about a year and a half ago , he turned on the children .
And that was when she decided she had to go .
From other Moroccan women , she learned of Sbai ’s center and prepared to file a criminal complaint against him .
But he seized the children and fled to Egypt .
Hadi has not been able to move authorities to help her regain custody .
Sbai , the politician , remembers polygamy from her childhood in Morocco .
There , at least officially , the husband could marry no more women than he could adequately and justly care for .
Here in Italy , she says , polygamy is often distorted .
The immigrant experience is turned on its head : regression and isolation instead of integration .

--
Of the hundreds of women Sbai hears from , most are Moroccans and illiterate , at a much higher percentage rate than in Morocco .
That also tends to isolate them , a condition compounded by mistrust of Italian authorities and fear of the unknown .
Aliza Kalisa , 50 , joined her Moroccan husband in Italy in 2001 .
They had been married for many years , but when she arrived in Rome , she found he had used his time here to take on a second wife .
“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ” she recalled asking him .
Advertisement
“ I needed a woman here , and you were in Morocco , ” he responded .
Kalisa was devastated .
She lived with her husband , his other wife and the woman ’s two children in a one - room apartment , where she was forced to sleep on the floor and listen as her husband and the younger woman had sex .
He treated her badly , flaunting the second wife like a prize and forcing Kalisa to do the housework and care for the children -- the second wife ’s children .
He forced her to fork over all her earnings as a maid in an Italian family ’s home .
He beat her .
Kalisa thinks the other wife delighted in the abuse she suffered ; the woman peppered Kalisa with taunts that she was the favorite .
“ I had been his wife such a long time , ” Kalisa said .
“ Then I was like the servant . ”
Advertisement
When , at the end of her rope , she threatened to leave , her husband locked her in the apartment for 10 days .
Eventually her screams prompted an Italian neighbor to call the police , and Kalisa was able to leave .
At Sbai ’s center , Kalisa is learning to write her name for the first time .
Zora , a Moroccan who has lived in Italy for 27 years , met and married an Egyptian in Rome in 1989 .
Though he swore he was single , it turned out he had another wife back in Egypt .
Zora ( who asked that her last name not be published ) learned of the marriage when a grown son from that union showed up at her Rome apartment .
“ I was speechless , ” said Zora , who is 52 but looks 35 .
Zora began to suspect that her husband ’s son was molesting her son , who was 6 at the time .
The boy was bruised and terrified to be left alone with his older half - sibling .
She , in turn , was terrified to say anything to her husband .
When Zora confirmed that the abuse was taking place , her anger overcame her fear .
She grabbed her son and fled .
Advertisement
Sbai , the politician , helps women such as Zora get or keep jobs , however low - paying , and begin to navigate the basics of Italian legal red tape .
Zora , for example , is trying to have her son ’s name removed from her husband ’s passport and added to hers to prevent him from taking the boy and leaving the country .
The women are also receiving elemental education and are given access to a psychologist , though counseling has been slow - going because most are reluctant to discuss their ordeals .
“ We are not at the point of integration yet , ” said the psychologist , Lucia Basile .
After what they have been through , “ we first need to teach them that they have dignity and that they exist . ”
Hadi , for one , has taken up that cause .
As she campaigns for the return of her children , she has joined Sbai ’s office , works the emergency hotline and is reaching out to other Moroccan and immigrant women to inform them of their rights and opportunities .
“ It ’s always the women , ” she said , “ who pay the price . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A moratorium on the opening of new fast food restaurants in one of the poorest areas of Los Angeles moved one step closer to reality on Tuesday in a measure aimed at countering obesity .
KFC and McDonald 's signboards are shown in Los Angeles October 3 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
A Los Angeles city council planning committee unanimously approved a one - year ban , which could be extended for a further year , on new fast food outlets in a 32 - square - mile ( 82 - sq - km ) area of Los Angeles .
The measure , the latest in efforts by U.S. cities to promote healthier eating , will go to the full council for a vote next month .
If passed , it would affect about half a million Angelenos living in an area that supporters say already has about 400 fast - food eateries and few grocery stores .
The proposed moratorium follows a report last year which found that 30 about percent of children living in the South Los Angeles , West Adams , Baldwin Hills and Leimert Park areas are obese compared to about 21 percent in the rest of the city .
It will be accompanied by moves to encourage more grocery chains and fresh food stores to open for business .
“ If people want to eat at a restaurant or go shopping at a neighborhood grocery store , these are choices that are not readily available to them at this time , ” said councilwoman Jan Perry , who spearheaded the measure .
The traditional fare at fast - food restaurants is thought to be a contributing factor to rising levels of obesity that can lead to diabetes , heart disease and high blood pressure .
The restaurant industry has lobbied against the measure , saying it places too much blame for obesity at its door .
“ Even fast food establishments have healthy choices now .
They all offer salads and smaller portions , ” said Andrew Casana , a spokesman for the California Restaurant Association .
Several U.S. cities have adopted measure forcing the restaurant industry to adopt healthier standards .
California banned the sale of soft drinks in middle and elementary schools in 2003 and a new law requires fast - food restaurants in New York to post calorie counts above the service counter .

Hey .. Jose , Madonna is married to , have you seen him ?
Does n't really fit " her type . "
If we had to guess , we 'd say there is probably some bad blood between A - Rod and Jose or maybe just a little bit of jealousy .

Leahy faces off with Joker in The Dark Knight
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008

In the last 18 months , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) has stared down plenty of ' jokers ' from his perch as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Next Friday , viewers will see him take on an even more nefarious clown when the latest Batman movie premieres .
The senator , a huge Batman buff , was glad to see his brief cameo in The Dark Knight was n't left on the cutting room floor .
In the film , Leahy appears alongside The Joker , portrayed by Heath Ledger in what 's being hailed as an Oscar - worthy performance .
Roll Call 's Heard on the Hill reports that the senator 's staffers found a clip of the film on YouTube apparently from a Swedish newscast .
The clip shows Ledger 's Joker bursting into a party on a mad hunt for District Attorney Harvey Dent .
Leahy stands up to the villain : " We 're not intimidated by you thugs , " he declares .
Some might say the line could be just as easily employed in his day job trying to rein in the Bush administration .
And his idolization of the Gotham - protecting super hero has led Leahy to invoke Batman in Senate speeches and chats with constituents .
In one report from a couple years ago , witnesses saw Leahy wheeling around outside his Senate office on a toy Batmobile he had bought for his grandson .
Leahy joked to staffers he wanted to " ride around zapping it and bad guys and exacting justice . "
More on Leahy 's fascination with the legend of the Dark Knight can be read at this link .

( Adds new EIA gasoline data , paragraph 3 )
WASHINGTON , June 9 ( Reuters ) - Average U.S. gasoline pump prices -- already above $ 4 a gallon -- could run up 20 cents or more by mid-summer , if crude oil prices do n’t fall from record levels near $ 140 a barrel , analysts said .
Gasoline prices are up almost $ 1 from a year ago , heaping pressure on a U.S. economy beleaguered by falling home values , a sagging dollar and an anemic job market .
Oil prices have risen six - fold in the past six years and are up 40 percent since January .
For the first time ever , average retail U.S. pump prices tracked by the Energy Information Administration rose above $ 4 a gallon on Monday to average $ 4.04 , up 96 cents from a year ago .
California prices averaged $ 4.43 a gallon .
There are more gasoline price increases lurking in the fuel delivery chain , especially if U.S. refiners are able to boost historically low profit margins and pass more of their soaring crude oil costs along to consumers .
“ There is still a very big upside potential to gasoline prices , because refining margins are not anywhere near where they were a year ago , ” said Fadel Gheit , an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co .
“ By the middle of July , if oil prices do n’t go lower , we are going to see another pop of at least 20 cents , ” Gheit said of gasoline retail prices .
U.S. crude CLc1 settled up $ 10.75 at $ 138.54 a barrel on Friday , after touching an all - time high of $ 139.12 , in its biggest gain in dollar terms on record .
U.S. oil futures were lower on Monday at about $ 136.50 a barrel .
If Friday ’s jump were fully priced into retail gasoline prices , they would increase about 25 cents a gallon , Gheit said .
So far , that has n’t happened because low demand for gasoline , as well as a mandate for refiners to use corn- blended ethanol , has kept U.S. refining margins weak , he said .
According to Credit Suisse , a U.S. Gulf Coast refinery can make about $ 16.03 from turning a barrel of oil into gasoline and other products .
That ’s down from $ 28.59 a year ago .
So far , profit incentives to produce gasoline are so anemic that major refiners like Valero Energy Corp VLO.N are shutting down gasoline - making equipment .
“ They are all cutting ( gasoline production ) because they say they are not in the business of losing money , ” Gheit said .
“ They are not running a charity for the truckers and the motorists . ”
Oil prices could top $ 150 a barrel by July 4 , one of the busiest U.S. travel holidays , as strong demand in Asia triggers a slowdown in shipments of crude to the United States , investment bank Morgan Stanley said last week .
A $ 150 oil price would equate to about $ 4.50 a gallon for gasoline , if refinery profit margins hold steady , according to Tancred Lidderdale , an analyst with the federal Energy Information Administration .
“ It will be going higher , ” Lidderdale said about the national pump price .
“ The price will be going up , and it all depends on the price of crude oil . ”
Crude oil prices comprise more than 70 percent of gasoline prices .
Such estimates vary , however .
According to analysts at the Oil Price Information Service , a $ 150 oil price would yield a retail pump price in a range of $ 4.32 to $ 4.37 a gallon .
Consumption in the United States already has shown signs of faltering , even as the world ’s top consumer enters the summer vacation season , when gasoline demand generally peaks .

During the summer of 2002 , in the run-up to President Bush 's invasion of Iraq , the US military staged the most elaborate and expensive war games ever conceived .
Operation Millennium Challenge , as it was called , cost some $ 250 million , and required two years of planning .
The mock war was not aimed at Iraq , at least , not overtly .
But it was set in the Persian Gulf , and simulated a conflict with a hypothetical rogue state .
The " war " involved heavy use of computers , and was also played out in the field by 13,500 US troops , at 17 different locations and 9 live - force training sites .
All of the services participated under a single joint command , known as JOINTFOR .
The US forces were designated as " Force Blue , " and the enemy as OPFOR , or " Force Red . "
The " war " lasted three weeks and ended with the overthrow of the dictatorial regime on August 15 .
At any rate , that was the official outcome .
What actually happened was quite different , and ought to serve up a warning about the grave peril the world will face if the US should become embroiled in a widening conflict in the region .
As the war games were about to commence on July 18 2002 , Gen. William " Buck " Kernan , head of the Joint Forces Command , told the press that the operation would test a series of new war - fighting concepts recently developed by the Pentagon , concepts like " rapid decisive operations , effects - based operations , operational net assessments , " and the like .
Later , at the conclusion of the games , Gen. Kernan insisted that the new concepts had been proved effective .
At which point , JOINTFOR drafted recommendations to Gen. Richard Myers , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , based on the experiment 's satisfactory results in such areas as doctrine , training and procurement .
But not everyone shared Gen. Kernan 's rosy assessment .
It was sharply criticized by the straight - talking Marine commander who had been brought out of retirement to lead Force Red .
His name was Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper , and he had played the role of the crazed but cunning leader of the hypothetical rogue state .
Gen .
Van Riper dismissed the new military concepts as empty sloganeering , and he had reason to be skeptical .
In the first days of the " war , " Van Riper 's Force Red sent most of the US fleet to the bottom of the Persian Gulf .
Not all of the details about how Force Red accomplished this have been revealed .
The Pentagon managed to keep much of the story out of the press .
But a thoroughly disgruntled Van Riper himself leaked enough to the Army Times that it 's possible to get at a sense of how a much weaker force outfoxed and defeated the world 's lone remaining Superpower .
1 The Worst US Naval Disaster Since Pearl Harbor
The war game was described as " free play , " meaning that both sides were unconstrained , free to pursue any tactic in the book of war in the service of victory .
As Gen. Kernan put it : " The OPFOR ( Force Red ) has the ability to win here . "
Much of the action was computer - generated .
But representative military units in the field also acted out the various moves and countermoves .
The comparison to a chess match is not inaccurate .
The vastly superior US armada consisted of the standard carrier battle group with its full supporting cast of ships and planes .
Van Riper had at his disposal a much weaker flotilla of smaller vessels , many of them civilian craft , and numerous assets typical of a Third World country .
But Van Riper made the most of weakness .
Instead of trying to compete directly with Force Blue , he utilized ingenious low - tech alternatives .
Crucially , he prevented the stronger US force from eavesdropping on his communications by foregoing the use of radio transmissions .
Van Riper relied on couriers instead to stay in touch with his field officers .
He also employed novel tactics such as coded signals broadcast from the minarets of mosques during the Muslim call to prayer , a tactic weirdly reminiscent of Paul Revere and the shot heard round the world .
At every turn , the wily Van Riper did the unexpected .
And in the process he managed to achieve an asymmetric advantage : the new buzzword in military parlance .
Astutely and very covertly , Van Riper armed his civilian marine craft and deployed them near the US fleet , which never expected an attack from small pleasure boats .
Faced with a blunt US ultimatum to surrender , Force Red suddenly went on the offensive : and achieved complete tactical surprise .
Force Red 's prop - driven aircraft suddenly were swarming around the US warships , making Kamikaze dives .
Some of the pleasure boats made suicide attacks .
Others fired Silkworm cruise missiles from close range , and sunk a carrier , the largest ship in the US fleet , along with two helicopter - carriers loaded with marines .
The sudden strike was reminiscent of the Al Qaeda sneak attack on the USS Cole in 2000 .
Yet , the Navy was unprepared .
When it was over , most of the US fleet had been destroyed .
Sixteen US warships lay on the bottom , and the rest were in disarray .
Thousands of American sailors were dead , dying , or wounded .
If the games had been real , it would have been the worst US naval defeat since Pearl Harbor .
What happened next became controversial .
Instead of declaring Force Red the victor , JOINTFOR Command raised the sunken ships from the muck , brought the dead sailors back to life , and resumed the games as if nothing unusual had happened .
The US invasion of the rogue state proceeded according to schedule .
Force Red continued to harass Force Blue , until an increasingly frustrated Gen.
Van Riper discovered that his orders to his troops were being countermanded , at which point he withdrew in disgust .
In his after - action report , the general charged that the games had been scripted to produce the desired outcome .
Later , Van Riper also aired his frustrations in a taped - for - television interview : " There were accusations that Millennium Challenge was rigged .
I can tell you it was not .
It started out as a free - play exercise , in which both Red and Blue had the opportunity to win the game .
However , about the third or fourth day , when the concepts that the command was testing failed to live up to their expectations , the command at that point began to script the exercise in order to prove these concepts .
This was my critical complaint .
You might say , ' Well , why did n't these concepts live up to the expectations ? '
I think they were fundamentally flawed in that theyleaned heavily on systems analysis of decision - making .
I 'm angered that , in a sense , $ 250 million was wasted .
But I 'm even more angry that an idea that has never been truly validated , that never really went through the crucible of a real experiment , is being exported to our operational forces to use .
What I saw in this particular exercise and the results from it were very similar to what I saw as a young second lieutenant back in the 1960s , when we were taught the systems engineering techniques that Mr. [ Robert ] McNamara [ Secretary of Defense under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson ] had implemented in the American military .
We took those systemsto the battlefield , where they were totally inappropriate .
The computers in Saigon said we were winning the war , while out there in the rice paddies we knew damn well we were n't winning .
That 's where we went astray , and I see these new concepts potentially being equally ill - informed and equally dangerous . "
2
" We did n't put you in harm 's way purposely .
It just ... happened . "
As a result of Van Riper 's criticism , Gen. Kernan , the JOINTFOR commander , faced some pointed questions at a subsequent press briefing .
In defending the operation , the general explained the embarrassing outcome as due to the unique environment in which the war simulation , by necessity , had been conducted : Q : General , one thing that Van Riper made much of was the fact that at some point the blue fleet was sunk .
Gen. Kernan : True , it was .
Q : I want to set - aside for a moment the allegation that the game was rigged because the fleet was " re-floated . "
I mean , I understand , I 've been told that happens in war games .
Gen. Kernan : Sure .
Q : And I 'm curious .
In the course of this experiment or exercise , your fleet was sunk .
I 'm wondering if that did teach you anything about the concepts you were testing or if that showed anything relevant .
Gen. Kernan : I 'll tell you one of the things it taught us with a blinding flash of the obvious , after the factAnd of course , it goes back to live versus simulation , and what we were doing .
There are very prescriptive lanes in which weconduct sea training and amphibious operations , and these are very , obviously , because of commercial shipping and a lot of other things , just like our air lanes .
The ships that we used for the amphibious operations , we brought them in because they had to comply with those lanes .
Did n't even think about it .
Now you 've got basically , instead of being over the horizon like the Navy would normally fight , and at stand - off ranges that would enable their protective systems to be employed , now they 're sitting right off the shore , where you 're looking at them .
I mean , the models and simulation that we put together , it could n't make a distinction .
And we did n't either , until , all of a sudden , whoops , there they are .
And that 's about the time he attacked .
You know ?
The Navy was just bludgeoning me dearly because , of course , they would say , ' We never fight this way . '
Fair enough .
Okay .
We did n't mean to do it .
We did n't put you in harm 's way purposely .
I mean , it just , it happened .
And it 's unfortunate .
So that 's one of the things that we learned " 3 Gen .
Kernan 's nuanced defense was that the simulation had necessarily been conducted in the vicinity of busy sea lanes , hence , in the presence of live commercial shipping ; and this required the Navy to " turn off " some of its defenses , which it would not have done in a real wartime situation .
All of which is probably true , but the general 's remark that in a real Gulf war the fleet would be deployed differently , in a stand - off manner , with its over - the - horizon defenses fully operable , was a misrepresentation of the actual situation in the Persian Gulf , today .
The US Navy 's biggest problem operating in Gulf waters are the constraints that the region 's confined spaces impose on US naval defenses , which were designed for the open sea .
The Persian Gulf is nothing but a large lake , after all , and in such an environment the Navy 's over - the - horizon defenses are seriously compromised .

Nor can the Navy withdraw to a safe distance , so long as its close - in presence is required to support the US occupation forces in Iraq .
The serious implications of this simple fact for a possible future conflict , for instance , involving Iran , have never , to my knowledge , been discussed in the US press .
Gen. Kernan 's remark was not a misstatement .
He repeated himself again , later in the same interview , while fielding another question : Q : As a follow - up ... Van Riper also said that most of the blue Naval losses were due to cruise missiles .
Can you talk about that and say how concerned you are about that ?
Gen. Kernan : " Well , I do n't know .
To be honest with you , I have n't had an opportunity to assess ... what happened .
But that 's a possibility , once again , because we had to shut off some of these self - defense systems on the models that would have normally been employed .
That 's a possibility .
I think the important thing to note is that normally the Navy would have been significantly over - the - horizon .
They would 've been arrayed an awful lot differently than we forced them to because of what they had to do for the live - exercise piece of it .... Yeah , I think we learned some things .
The specifics of the cruise - missile piece ... I really can't answer that question .
We 'd have to get back to you .
" 5 Safely Over - the - Horizon ?
Gen .
Kernan 's remarks are surprising , because at the time he made them , in August 2002 , as he well should have known , at least two separate studies , one by the US Government Accounting Office ( GAO , ) based on the Navy 's own data , and another by an independent think - tank , had already warned the Office of the Navy about the growing threat to the US fleet posed by anti-ship cruise missiles .
6
As recently as 1997 some forty different nations possessed these awesome weapons .
By 2000 the number had jumped to 70 , with at least 100 different types identified , and a dozen different nations actively pursuing their own production and research / development programs .
While the numbers are not available for 2004 , there is little doubt that the technology has continued to spread rapidly .
And why are anti-ship cruise missiles so attractive ?
The answer is that they are relatively simple to develop , especially in comparison with ballistic missiles .
Cruise missiles can be constructed from many of the same readily available parts and components used in commercial aviation .
They are also reliable and effective , easy to deploy and use , and are relatively inexpensive .
Even poor nations can afford them .
One cruise missile represents but a tiny fraction of the immense expenditure of capital the US has invested in each of its 300 active warships .
Yet , a single cruise missile can sink or severely disable any ship in the US Navy .
According to the GAO report , " the key to defeating cruise missile threats is in gaining additional reaction time , " so that ships can detect , identify and destroy the attacking missiles .
The thorny problem , as I 've pointed out , is that the Navy 's long - range AWACs and intermediate - range Aegis radar defense systems are significantly less effective in littoral ( or coastal ) environments , the Persian Gulf being the prime example .
The other important factor is that cruise missile technology itself is racing ahead .
The GAO report warned that the next generation of anti-ship missiles that will begin to appear by 2007 will be faster and stealthier , and will also be equipped with advanced target - seekers , i.e. , advanced guidance systems .
In fact , one of these advanced anti-ship cruise missiles is already available : the Russian - made Yakhonts missile .
It flies at close to Mach 3 ( three times the speed of sound ) , can hit a squirrel in the eye , and has a range of 185 miles : enough range to target the entire Persian Gulf ( from Iran ) , shredding Gen .
Kernan 's glib remark that in a real war the US expeditionary force will stand - off in safety " over the horizon " while mounting an amphibious attack .
Nonsense .
Henceforth , in a real Gulf war situation there will be no standing off in safety .
The Yakhonts missile has already erased the concept of the horizon , at least , within the Persian Gulf , and it has done so without ever having been fired in combat--- yet .
Gen .
Kernan should have known also that , according to Jane 's Defense Weekly and other sources , Iranian government officials were in Moscow the previous year ( 2001 ) , shopping for the latest Russian anti-ship missile technology .
7
By their own admission the Russians developed the Yakhonts missile for export .
No doubt , it was high on Iran 's shopping list .
The 2000 GAO report 's conclusions were not favorable .
It stated that for a variety of reasons the Navy 's forecasts for upgrading US ship defenses against cruise missile attack are overly optimistic .
The Navy 's own data shows that there will be no silver bullet .
The technology gap is structural , and will not be overcome for many years , if at all .
US warships will be vulnerable to cruise missile attack into the foreseeable future , perhaps increasingly so .
But the GAO saved its most sobering conclusion for last :
It so happens that the most vulnerable ship in the US fleet is none other than the flagship itself , the big Nimitz - class carriers .
This underscores the significance of Force Red 's victory during Millennium Challenge .
Just think :
If Van Riper could accomplish what he did with Silkworms , the lowly scuds of the cruise missile family , imagine what could happen if the US Navy , sitting in the Gulf like so many ducks , should face a massed - attack of supersonic Yakhonts missiles , a weapon that may well be unstoppable .
It would be a debacle .
So , we see that the 2002 US war games afforded a glimpse of the same military hubris that gave us the Viet Nam War and the current quagmire in Iraq .
The difference is that the peril for the world today in the " Persian Lake " is many times greater than it ever was in the Gulf of Tonkin .

World 's Largest Offshore Wind Farm Back on Track
July 21st , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
The world ’s biggest offshore wind farm was revived yesterday when German - based energy group E.ON and the Danish utility Dong Energy agreed to acquire Shell ’s 33 % stake in the 1,000 - megawatt London Array .
The two firms , which each own a one - third stake in the project will now become 50 - 50 partners by buying out Shell , the former third partner .
Shell decided to withdraw from the London Array project back in May after a strategic review indicated that the project would not bring sufficient rates of return on the investment .
Industry - wide cost inflation has raised the cost of the project to more than £ 2.5 bn ( $ 5 billion U.S. ) , well above the original estimates of £ 1.5 bn three years ago .
The purchase came as a major relief for a British government that is lagging behind the pace it needs to keep for its renewable energy targets of 15 % by 2020 .
The news also came on the day the biggest onshore wind farm in Europe – planned for Scotland – was given final approval .
There are currently 176 wind energy projects that would produce 2,546 megawatts currently in the planning stages across the UK – enough to supply electricity to 1.4 million British homes ( British Wind Energy Association ) .
After much political opposition to the aesthetics of wind farms in the UK , is it safe to say there has been a significant shift in how British perceive the wind farms ?
Or is it out of economic rationality and political necessity that there is a push to expand the British wind energy portfolio ?

Where the Hell is PETA on This ?
Hillary Clinton is not only a candidate for President , she ’s an animal torturer :
“ You all know how to boil a frog do n’t you ? ” she asked the folks in Mississippi , which votes Tuesday .
“ Yeah ! ” some in the crowd yelled .
“ You know you drop a frog in hot water , it jumps right out , ” Clinton said , telling her frog analogy with more vigor than usual .
“ But , you put it in cold water and you turn up the heat pretty soon you got a boiled frog . ”
Or , if you do n’t like boiled frog , how about caviar ?
“ The best job I ever had in preparation for running for office was a job I had sliming fish in Alaska , ” Clinton said .
“ I was in a salmon fishery where they brought in the salmon .
They had some experts from Japan who were there and slit the fish open and took out the caviar and I was there in hip boots with a spoon , and my job was to clean out everything else .
Really now ?
Hillary Clinton worked in a salmon fishery ?
She wore hip boots , huh ?
Actually , I was going to laugh at that ridiculous notion , but I just looked it up , and sure enough , between Wellesley and Yale Law , she did , indeed , slime salmon in Alaska before she was fired for complaining about unhealthy conditions .
Huh .
Color me impressed .
Whatever !
The point is , it ’s not nice to slow boil frogs alive .
That ’s all I ’m saying .

The bodies of the two students were found at a bedsit in New Cross
A man has been charged with the murders of two French students who were found dead in a blazing bedsit in London .
Police have also arrested a man aged 35 and a 25 - year - old woman over the deaths of Gabriel Ferez and Laurent Bonomo .
The victims , both 23 , were bound and gagged and suffered numerous stab wounds , in New Cross on 29 June .
Nigel Edwards Farmer , 33 , of no fixed address , has been charged with their murders , arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice .
Detectives arrested Mr Farmer after he walked into Lewisham police station in the early hours of Monday .
Severely damaged
He was initially taken to hospital under guard for treatment to serious burns to his hands and arms .
The badly - burned bodies of the two students were found after an explosion at the bedsit .
Mr Bonomo was stabbed nearly 200 times , up to 80 of the wounds inflicted after he was dead , while Mr Ferez suffered nearly 50 knife wounds .
Forensic searches at the severely damaged ground - floor property in Sterling Gardens could continue for several weeks .
Detectives have previously said the students may have been attacked by more than one assailant .
Mr Farmer will appear at Greenwich Magistrates ' Court on Thursday .

複雑な構成の設定ファイル群に新たな変更を施す場合、awkを用いてファイル中の要変更箇所を特定して臨機応変的な対処をするという自作スクリプトの活躍した時代は、今や終焉に近づいているのかもしれない。それというのも、設定ファイルの記述内容を自動で解読する
Augeas というツールの登場により、人間は本来の目的である設定内容の変更だけに集中できるようになりつつあるからである。例えば仮に、何らかの設定ファイルにおける特定情報の記述位置が4列目に移動されていたとしても、Augeasを使えば該当する設定情報は以前と同様に提示されるため、そうした内部的な変更をユーザがいちいち気にする必要はなくなるのだ。
Augeasを用いた設定ファイル群の編集はコマンドラインから直接実行できるが、あるいはこうした機能をネイティブのC
APIおよび、Python、Ruby、OCamlのバインディングを用いてその他のプログラムに組み込むことも可能になっている。Augeasの入手法に関しては、Fedora 9の標準リポジトリに収録されている他、openSUSE
10.3については1-Clickインストールができるようになっているが、現状でUbuntu用のパッケージは用意されていない。私の場合は、64ビット版Fedora 8 マシン上で 「 ./ configure ; make ; sudo make install 」 という通常のインストール手順にてソースコードからコンパイルしたAugeasバージョン0.1.1を使用している。
なお上記の./configureを実行してから（READMEに示してあるように）Augeasをセットアップしても最初は上手く行かないはずで、それは設定ファイル群の認識にAugeasが使用するファイル群は/usr/localにインストールされているのに、実際には/usrを検索するためだ。こうした設定ファイルの認識法を規定しているのはレンズ（lens）と呼ばれているファイル群であり、ここではこれらlensファイル群についてもう少し説明することにしよう。先の通常インストールにて発生する問題を解決するには、下記に示したようにAUGEAS_LENS_LIBに正しいパスをエクスポートすればいい。ここではまず下記の実行例における1つ目のlsコマンドにて、ファイルディレクトリが何も出力されていない点に注目して頂きたい。
$ augtool augtool > ls Not enough arguments for ls augtool > ls / augeas / = ( none ) augtool > $ export AUGEAS_LENS_LIB=/usr/local/share/augeas/lenses $ augtool augtool > ls / augeas / = ( none ) files / = ( none )
Augeasの認識した設定ファイル群の表示は、一種の仮想的なファイルシステムを2つ介して行われるようになっている。つまり/filesのパスでは設定ファイル群、そして/augeasではメタデータが表示されるのであり、例えば/etc/hostsのファイル群はAugeasにおいて/files/etc/hostsという扱いにされる。
Augeasでサポートされているのは、aliases、aptsources、fstab、grub、hosts、ifcfg、inittab、pam、sshd、sysconfig、xinetd、yumの設定ファイルフォーマットである。その他の独自フォーマットの設定ファイルをAugeasで編集したい場合は、lensと呼ばれる機構を利用しなければならない。既にテキスト構文解析およびExtended Backus - Naur Form（EBNF）についての知識を有すユーザであれば、各自の設定ファイルに応じたAugeas用のlensファイルを作成するのはそれほど難しくないはずだが、EBNFに詳しくないユーザがlensファイルを作成するには、テキストの構文解析（parsing）と形式文法（formal grammar）に関する何らかの入門書に目を通しておかなくてはならないだろう。こうした標準的なEBNFの定義法とAugeas用lensの記述法を比べた場合、両者の間に存在する基本的な相違点の1つは、lensの用途は特定のテキストファイルを抽象構文木（abstract syntax tree）に変換する構文解析だけでなく、そうして取得した構文木からプレインテキストファイルへの再変換という双方向の処理に使用するという点である。
これ はAugeasのダウンロードページにも記載されている注意事項だが、現行のAugeasは未だ試作段階であるため、ここで編集した設定ファイルが損傷する可能性を想定しておかなくてはならない。そのためコマンドラインツールには、こうした事態に備えた“バックアップ”オプション、つまり変更を加える設定ファイルを別途保管しておく機能が用意されているのである。またこの機能を用いると“/”以外をシステムルートディレクトリとした状態でAugeasを実行させることもできる。この機能を使うと、例えば/tmp/augeas-root/etc/hostsなどの指定で各自の設定ファイルを一般ユーザの権限にてコピーしておき、このファイルに施した変更に問題がないかを一通りチェックしてから、変更後のファイルを改めて/etc/hostsにコピーし直すという処理ができる。
下記に示してあるのは 、Augeasの諸機能を試す目的で/etcの内容を別途コピーしておくコマンド操作例である。なお/etcの直下にあるgconfおよびselinuxというディレクトリに収められているファイル群は数が多い上に簡単なAugeasの機能テストをする対象として適していないため、ここでは/etcにある設定ファイル群をtarボール化する際の前処理として、これら2つのディレクトリをfindコマンドを用いて明示的に除外させている。
export AUGEAS_ROOT=/tmp/augeas-`id -u`-root rm -rf $ AUGEAS_ROOT mkdir $ AUGEAS_ROOT find /etc \( - path / etc / gconf -o - path /etc/selinux \) \ - prune -o - type f \ - print0 | xargs - 0 tar cf $ AUGEAS_ROOT /etc.tar tar - C $ AUGEAS_ROOT - xf $ AUGEAS_ROOT/etc.tar sudo chown - R $ USER $ AUGEAS_ROOT augtool -b
この段階で私が気づいたのは 、Augeas Webサイトにあ るQuick Tourページの解説では/etc/hostsが表示されているのに、私のhostsファイルは表示されていないということだ。この問題に関しては、私のhostsファイルに空行があるのが原因であったようで、こうした空行をすべて削除したところ/etc/hostsファイルはAugeasにより認識されるようになった。
$ augtool augtool > ls / files / etc sysconfig / = ( none ) ... hosts / = ( none ) inittab / = ( none ) ... augtool > ls / files/etc/hosts
1/ = ( none ) 2 / = ( none ) ... augtool > ls / files/ etc/hosts /1 ipaddr = 127.0.0.1 canonical = localhost.localdomain alias [ 1 ] = localhost alias [ 2 ] = lincomvm
上記実行例中のlsコマンドの出力にあるlocalhostの定義を見ると分かるように、1つのアイテムに複数のエントリが存在する場合は、nをインデックス番号とした連番[n ]が付けられるようになっている。このようにhostsファイル中の定義情報を示す目的でサブディレクトリ群に1、2……、nという連番を付けるシンタックスについては、10.10.10.10など特定のIPアドレスに対するエントリが既に存在するかのチェックを困難にしているようにも思われるが、Augeasのパス指定ではワイルドカードがサポートされており、XPath系の一部シンタックスも使用できるようになっている。例えば下記の実行例における1つ目のコマンドは、/etc/hosts中に10.10.10.10という定義が既に存在しているかのチェックを行うものである。そして2つ目のコマンドでは、当該エントリの詳細を表示させている。次に私が実行したのは、setコマンド中に alias [ 1 ]
を指定することで、当該ホストに対する直接のエイリアスを1つ作成することである。
ドキュメントの記載によると最終ノードのインデックス番号は last ( )
関数の戻り値として取得できるはずなのだが、現行のAugeasではこうした状況での算術演算ができないため、last()+1をインデックス番号とした2つ目のエイリアス作成は失敗に終わってしまった。この問題に対する1つの簡易的な回避法は、事前に ins コマンドによる新規ノード追加を行っておき、その後で last ( )
の返す最終ノードのインデックス番号を用いたエイリアス作成を行うというものである。その後のmatchコマンドで実施しているのはエイリアスが存在するかのチェックであるが、ここではエイリアスのパスにおけるインデックス番号指定を省略することで、すべてのエイリアスノードをチェックさせている。最終行のsaveコマンドは、変更した内容を確定して保存させるための指示である。
augtool > match / files/etc/hosts/*/ipaddr 10.10.10.10 /files/etc/hosts/10/ipaddr augtool > print / files / etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10/ipaddr = " 10.10.10.10 " / files/etc/hosts/10/canonical = " linux.com.example.com " augtool > set / files/etc/hosts/10/alias[ 1 ] " l.c.alias " augtool > print / files / etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10/ipaddr = " 10.10.10.10 " / files/etc/hosts/10/canonical = " linux.com.example.com " / files/etc/hosts/10/alias = " l.c.alias " augtool > set / files/etc/hosts/10/alias[last( ) +1 ] " l.c2.alias " Failed augtool > ins alias after / files / etc/hosts/10/alias[last ( ) ] augtool > set / files/etc/hosts/10/alias[last( ) ] " l.c2.alias " augtool > print / files / etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10 /files/etc/hosts/10/ipaddr = " 10.10.10.10 " / files/etc/hosts/10/canonical = " linux.com.example.com " / files/etc/hosts/10/alias[ 1 ] = " l.c.alias " / files/etc/hosts/10/alias[ 2 ] = " l.c2.alias " augtool > match / files/etc/hosts/10/alias l.c2.alias /files/etc/hosts/10/alias[ 2 ] augtool >
save
このよう にAugeasを利用することで、設定ファイルのアップデート時に独自のスクリプトを構築するという負担は大幅に軽減することができるだろう。もちろんごく単純に、特定の設定ファイルに新規の設定行を1つ追加するだけという作業であれば、Perl、awk、grep、wc、catなどでも対処可能ではあるが、過去に変更を施した既存の設定行を操作するとなると話はそれほど簡単には進まないはずだ。つまり過去に施した変更内容が複雑なものであればあるほどスクリプト処理による設定ファイルの編集作業は困難となり、オリジナル状態からの相違点が大きくなった各種の設定ファイル群に対処可能なスクリプトを整備する負担は過度に大きくなっていくはずなのである。
確か にAugeasは誕生間もないプロジェクトであり、本文中で触れたような/etc/hostsファイルに空行があるだけで正常に対処できないなど若干の不備は残されているものの、設定ファイルの編集作業を大幅に簡単化するという本来の目的は現状の完成度においてもほぼ達成されていると評していいだろう。いずれにせよこうしたhostsファイルの空行認識などは構文解析にまつわる不備なのであり、今後Augeas用のlensファイルの改良が進んでいけば、この種の問題点も一括して解消されていくものと期待できるはずだ。

This is a list of the most influential metal bands .
If it were the best bands list , it would be very different .
All bands here deserve props for what they did and should never be forgotten through the music made today .
Narrowing down the selections was difficult and I almost feel like I cheated Metallica , but I think if they had stayed true to their original sound , they would have had a much greater impact .
10 Napalm Death
Napalm Death are the creators of grindcore .
On top of that they influenced all sorts of death and doom metal bands around their time .
They have had great members in their band , some of whom found success over the years in bands like Cathedral and Carcass .
9 Death
Death was one of the original death metal bands .
Late guitarist Chuck Schuldiner was often considered the “ Father of Death Metal . ”
It is no surprise that they paved the way for bands like Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death .
8 Slayer
Slayer is one of the big four that founded thrash metal along with Metallica , Anthrax and Megadeth .
Other bands even created the genre speed metal around Slayer .
With insane riffs and songs like Raining Blood , Seasons in the Abyss , Angel of Death , and Black Magic , it is obvious why they are on the list .
7 Manowar
Manowar are power metal .
Often singing about fantasy and looking the part of the warriors they claim to be .
You can see lyrical similarities with current day power metal bands such as Blind Guardian , Hammerfall , and Dragonforce .
6 Celtic Frost
Celtic Frost is an incredibly influential gothic metal band .
It is hard to say that they are n’t influential considering all of the covers of their songs that bands have done .
They helped create that gloomy sound that metal has become so accustomed to .
5 Venom
Another founder of death / black metal .
They directly influenced Slayer and bands of that ilk .
They were not afraid to depict Satan in their music and that helped contribute to their fame .
Although not a widely known band , their sound and depictions of religion are seen throughout metal today .
4 Motorhead
The Ace of Spades , Overkill , and Bomber .
Need I say more ?
Lemmy ’s gritty vocals and wild bass playing were unheard of at the time .
It is very hard to say that Motorhead did not impact the world of metal .
3 Iron Maiden
The NWOBHM ( New Wave of British Heavy Metal ) has by far the greatest impact and was the start of metal .
Iron Maiden helped lead the pack with wailing vocals , catchy and memorable songs and also helped led the way for power metal with its lyrical content .
Still going strong today , any band looking for influence cannot cancel out Iron Maiden .
2 Judas Priest
Another band out of the NWOBHM , they started with two guitarists in the band and high pitched vocals .
Songs like Painkiller , You ’ve got another thing comin ’ , and Breaking the Law have become timeless classics .
Judas Priest is arguably one of the best bands to ever sport metal as their genre .
1 Black Sabbath
As soon as you read the topic I ’m sure you knew that this would be the number one .
The very first metal band , it ’s only fair to give them the top spot .
They started everything .
You hear a riff or sound a guitar makes , it evolved from Black Sabbath .
Thrash sounds are apparent in Symptom of the Universe and epic tones are present in Iron Man and War Pigs .
The lyrical ideals of Geezer Butler were amazing and opened the eyes of the people .

The majority of servers supporting the Fedora Linux distribution were back online on Tuesday following a mystery disruption .
Last Thursday ( 14 August ) Fedora project leader Paul Frields took the unusual step of advising users not to download or update their software , as a precaution while the Fedora team responded to an unspecified issue .
He warned ahead of time that service outages were likely .
" The Fedora Infrastructure team is currently investigating an issue in the infrastructure systems , " Frields wrote in a posting to the Fedora announcement mailing list .
" That process may result in service outages , for which we apologize in advance .
We 're still assessing the end - user impact of the situation , but as a precaution , we recommend you not download or update any additional packages on your Fedora systems . "
A later post on Saturday revealed that Fedora was completely rebuilding its systems from the ground up .
This , together with the earlier advice to hold off on downloads , sparked speculation that a security breach may be behind the problem .
By early Tuesday most of the Fedora systems were back online .
In his latest posting Frields said that all critical systems - needed for the day - to - day operation of Fedora - would be back by close of play on Tuesday .
Frields said a detailed explanation of what provoked the incident would be available soon .
" We know the community is awaiting more detail on the past week 's activities and their causes .
We 're preparing a timeline and details and will make them available in the near future .
We appreciate the community 's patience , and will continue to post updates to the Fedora - announce - list as soon as possible . " ®

Ben Stein blames Darwin for Nazism and the Holocaust in his new movie .

The Ben Stein Conspiracy
" If evolution is worth debating , it 's worth debating well , and by a more intelligently designed film than this one . " -- Variety
" ... the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed … that ’s where science leads you .... science leads you to killing people . "
-- Ben Stein
April 9 , 2008 .
I do n't plan to see Ben Stein 's new movie , an alleged documentary called Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , but I have watched his promotional interviews with Pat Robertson , Glen Beck , and Bill O'Reilly .
I have no quarrel with his shameless anti-science stance .
He can remain as ignorant as he wants about the nature of the universe and it wo n't bother me a bit .
What disgusts me about the man is his claim that there is some sort of scientific cabal that is blacklisting creationists and denying them their right to free speech .
He did n't name anyone in his interviews who has been persecuted , but he 's quoted in Newsweek as saying
There are a number of scientists and academics who 've been fired , denied tenure , lost tenure or lost grants because they even suggested the possibility of intelligent design .
The most egregious is Richard Sternberg at the Smithsonian , the editor of a magazine that published a peer - reviewed paper about ID .
He lost his job .
-- Ben Stein ( Newsweek , April 14 , 2008 )
I know something about Mr. Sternberg , so I posted an entry for him in the Skeptic 's Dictionary .
The Sternberg case is no case at all .
If Stein calls this " the most egregious " case , the other cases must be truly without any merit .
In any case , the scientific community is n't secretive at all about keeping religious views separate from scientific views .
It is very open and up front about not confusing science with religion .
There is no secret about trying to keep intelligent design out of the science classroom .
We 've gone to court over it and won .
It 's all been very public .
Nobody 's religious views have special preference in this society and nobody 's religious views have a right to be considered as alternatives to scientific views .
At least that 's how it 's supposed to be in America , but in places like Texas the creationists play by a different set of rules , as the video below demonstrates :
People are free to believe in intelligent design , the Flying Spaghetti Monster , Thor , Votan , Wotan , Zeus , Athena , or whatever religious idea or entity they feel like believing in .
But they do n't have the right to call their beliefs science or to be given a hearing along with scientific views in the science classroom .
Why is Stein whining about creationists as if they should be allowed to teach biology because they believe an intelligent designer created the world ?
Everybody 's free to believe or not in an intelligent designer and in our society everyone is free to express that belief .
Being a lawyer , Stein must know that freedom of speech does n't mean anybody can go anywhere and say anything at any time .
I can't go to his synagogue uninvited and disrupt services by reciting my poetry .
He can't break into my house and give a lecture on the evils of Darwinism .
Creationists can't claim a right to go into anyone 's classroom and tell the students that in their view intelligent design is a viable alternative to natural selection .
Intelligent design is the belief in a creator .
Stein 's ignorance about the fact that many people believe in a creator and accept evolution is evident from what he says in interviews .
He 's an educated , intelligent man , but he's also a lawyer so he knows how easy it would be for an incompetent or unproductive scholar who is an outspoken creationist to claim that he 's being denied tenure because of his religious views .
His colleagues might not like him for a variety of reasons but if he cries religious discrimination he might get what he wants even if he does n't deserve it .
Fortunately for Stein the people who interview him on television are as ignorant of science as he is and can be led down the path on which he wants to take them .
In American television , the ignorant leading the ignorant is an anthem , a creed .
It 's one of our main forms of entertainment and amusement .
If it were n't for YouTube and those who post clips from these TV shows , I would n't know anything about Ben Stein and his clumsy attempt at anti-science propaganda .
The main lesson I am learning from people like Stein and his minions is that anti-scientific religious people do n't care about the truth at all .
They make no effort to educate themselves about science .
They think they know the truth from the Bible or from their upbringing .
They 're intelligent and articulate enough to buffalo their way through life seeming to understand what they 're talking about because for the most part they communicate with people who are even more ignorant and less caring about science than they are .
Not only do n't the Ben Steins of the world care about truth , they seem to have no feelings of guilt at lying and deceiving and misleading others about both science and religion .
What next ?
Acupuncturists and Indian herbalists claiming they are being persecuted because they are n't being allowed to teach their alternatives in medical schools ?
Actually , the alternative quacks have already won the war and many medical schools now offer junk science along with evidence - based medicine .
Will biology departments give in as medical schools have ?
Will we one day have alternative science taught in all our classrooms ?
When that happens I 'll make my own documentary .
I 'd call it Stupid and Stupider , but that might mislead people into thinking it was about foreign policy .
postscript
As a propaganda film , Expelled had had at least one success .
A young Jewish man claims to have had his eyes opened while viewing Minister of Propaganda Stein 's Meisterwerk and wrote to Michael Shermer :
Now I truly understand who you atheists and Darwinists really are !
You people believe that it was okay for my great - grandparents to die in the Holocaust !
How disgusting .
Your past article about the Holocaust was just window dressing .
We Jews will fight to keep people like you out of the United States !
I have learned a lot from Ben Stein , a Jewish brother , who has opened my eyes up a bit .
Shermer passed the letter around and Richard Dawkins has written a very eloquent reply that is posted on his website .
It is worth a read for those who want details about Hitler and Darwin .
On the other hand , I have been combing the WWW for reviews of Expelled and have found only a few that are favorable : one by Chuck Colson , another by Chuck Norris , and another from that bastion of integrity : the Discovery Institute .
My local paper , the Sacramento Bee did n't even review it .
Instead , it gave it one star ( of 5 ) and posted a review from Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel , who said mean things like :
Expelled relies on the viewer 's inability or unwillingness to wrestle with a complex corner of science , double - talking its way toward a " must be a miracle " solution to anything that science may not claim to have an answer for .
Dismiss that for having no basis in fact , and you 're infringing on " academic freedom . "
The advertisement in the Bee for the movie had supportive blurbs from talk show host and Discovery Institute Senior Fellow Michael Medved and " national treasure " Rush Limbaugh .
Stein has a history of moronic reasoning and in some ways the fact that he has survived as a celebrated person of some intellect is a strong indication of the degeneration of respect for the intellect in the United States .
Wikipedia notes that
After Mark Felt 's identity as Deep Throat was revealed , Stein stated that Richard Nixon would have prevented the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge if he had not been forced to resign .
For his actions leading to that resignation , Stein said :
If there is such a thing as karma , if there is such a thing as justice in this life or the next , Mark Felt has bought himself the worst future of any man on this earth .
And Bob Woodward is right behind him , with Ben Bradlee bringing up the rear .
Out of their smug arrogance and contempt , they hatched the worst nightmare imaginable : genocide .
Yes , Ben Stein reasoned that the genocide in Cambodia was the responsibility of those who exposed Richard Nixon 's attempt to cover - up crimes committed by one of the greatest collections of enemies of free speech who have ever run the White House ( present company excluded ) .
With reasoning like that , one wonders how he has survived as a public figure .
You'd think he'd have drowned in the ridicule by now .

Putting science in a frame
During February 's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , a large audience packed the room for a session with a provocative title : " Communicating Science in a Religious America . "
Seven speakers discussed how scientific information is delivered to and perceived by a public that interprets it in light of personal beliefs , religious and otherwise .
The talks were organized by Matthew Nisbet , a professor of communications who is a proponent of the framing of science , in which communications techniques borrowed from the political realm are applied to promote scientific understanding .
As such , a number of speakers advocated specific frames for publicly controversial scientific issues .
Unfortunately , the use of those frames appears likely to generate controversy within the scientific community , and several speakers noted that science faces challenges that go well beyond communicating knowledge to the public .
There were some hints of a way forward that might work for both the scientific community and the public , but the challenges appear significant .
Ken Miller , designed by fish
The first speaker was Ken Miller , a cell biologist on the faculty of Brown University .
Miller has done appearances everywhere from The Colbert Report to the witness box of the Dover trial over intelligent design .
His high school biology textbook has carried stickers warning of its content on evolution , yet , as a practicing Catholic , he 's written books describing the compatibility between evolution and his view of theology .
There are few people better placed to discuss the often - messy intersection between science and religious faith .
Miller 's talk focused on the ID movement , which he described as a scientific failure , but a public relations success story .
He noted how the US trailed all European nations apart from Turkey in terms of its acceptance of the scientific evidence for evolution , but argued that these numbers do n't lend themselves to a simplistic " science versus religion " analysis .
Miller pointed out that less than 20 percent of the US population subscribes to biblical literalism , while far higher rates reject evolutionary science .
This discrepancy , Miller suggested , is the result of a deep discomfort with the fact that evolution is grounded in the random occurrence of mutations .
Fundamentally , people do n't want to think they were the product of a chain of accidents .
Miller also played a video clip of former senator Rick Santorum , who argued that this randomness made no moral demands of people , suggesting that evolution could allow them to take an " anything goes " approach to social contracts .
In this environment , design , with its emphasis on purposefulness and goals , makes for an emotionally compelling alternative .
ID " backs us into a corner , " Miller said , as " we have to argue that there is no design . "
That argument is made harder by the fact that many biologists have stated that things look designed , or drawn analogies between biological features and machinery .
Embrace your fishy design , says Miller
Image : Beth Rooney
The solution to this , in Miller 's view , is to describe evolution as a design process .
Evolution is not an accident or a mistake , but a predictable property of nature , in which the process of exploring fitness space necessarily designs adaptations .
Miller feels that the human body is designed ; it 's just designed by evolution using a fish as its raw material , an argument he borrowed from a recent book , Your Inner Fish by the discoverer of Tiktaalik .
The genetic material that produces humans is also a design , which evolution has produced using the primate genome as a foundation .
For Miller , the laws of physics and chemistry necessitate a spontaneous and creative design process , and we simply know that process by the term " evolution . "
For the religious , he said , that design process can imply God .
For anyone else , however , it comes from some other source .
Although this presentation might make for good public relations , there appears to be a danger that it will further fragment the scientific community .
The appearance of design is a very subjective thing , and there are many biologists ( including myself ) that do n't subscribe to the view that their subject matter looks designed .
It 's also far from clear that the atheists will be comfortable being told that they should look for any source for the necessity of evolution as a design process .
Matt Nisbet frames atheists
If atheists might feel uncomfortable with Miller 's suggestion , they would likely be very unhappy by a talk from Matt Nisbet , entitled " New atheism and the public image of science . "
Nisbet argued in favor of framing , which , to a certain extent , is Miller 's approach applied broadly : find values and perceptions that are shared between the public and scientific communities and emphasize those .
An example Nisbet gave is the shared awe of nature , which can be used as a frame in which the results and implications of environmental studies can be presented .
Framing has not been without controversy , as some have viewed is as little more than a form of empty platitude or an attempt to dumb down science .
What became clear from Nisbet 's talk , however , is that there can also be people left out of the ostensibly - shared values ; it should be no surprise they are objecting .
There 's no conflict in the
National Academies ' frame
Nisbet focused on evolution , arguing that it needs to be framed as a method of societal advancement , a relatively easy argument to make in the age of drug - resistant bacteria .
But he also said that the frame needs to emphasize a lack of conflict between evolution and personal beliefs .
Both of these frames went into the production of the National Academies ' new book , Science , Evolution , and Creationism ( PDF ) , which used surveys and focus groups to identify and address the audience it needed to reach .
Nisbet also cited surveys of the national press that indicate that the " no conflict " frame was reaching the public .
Even during peaks of coverage , such as the Dover trial , coverage that linked evolution and religious issues did n't rise to the level of that seen with stem cell coverage , and only a quarter of the articles used conflict imagery in their descriptions .
Unfortunately , from Nisbet 's perspective , not everyone has gotten with the program .
The " New Atheists , " such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris , have claimed to apply scientific standards such as objective empirical evidence to religious issues and , using this as a standard for reason , have found religious beliefs to be unreasonable .
Whether this is an appropriate use of scientific logic is irrelevant to Nisbet ; instead , he focuses on the fact that the new atheists are n't going along with non-conflict framing , and he argues they are harming science in the process
I personally agree that the presentation of scientific principles as in conflict with , or capable of invalidating , religious beliefs does the scientific community more harm than good .
That said , I 'm extremely uncomfortable with telling those who have chosen to do so that they should n't be part of the public engagement process .
It smacks of censorship , and implies that atheists are not fully part of the scientific community .
So long as speakers distinguish their beliefs from the scientific process , nobody should be discouraged from discussing a topic because it conflicts with a public relations agenda .
A graphics card can cost you almost as much as a bona fide Batman gadget , especially when you get up to ridiculous amounts of power and performance , but that ludicrous price is actually less ludicrous than it could be , because of the cutthroat competition between ATI and Nvidia , right ?
Not so fast .
An email Nvidia sent by Nvidia senior VP of marketing , Dan Vivoli , to ATI 's president and COO , Dave Orton made public by the judge in an ongoing anti-trust suit against the two companies reveals that they both see eye - to - eye on prices .
Namely , that they should be higher :
I really think we should work harder together on the marketing front .
As you and I have talked about , even though we are competitors , we have the common goal of making our category a well positioned , respected playing field .
$ 5 and $ 8 stocks are a result of no respect .

AOL Raises Dial - Up Prices Seriously .
What do you do when your company once ruled the Internet , but years of incompetence and an inability to adapt to a changing market results in tens of millions of customers defecting ?
If you 're AOL , you apparently raise prices .
AOL is informing dial - up customers that as of July 27 , they 'll be raising the price of dial - up service from $ 9.99 to $ 11.99 per month .
" This plan is still a great value , " an e-mail to customers claims , " saving you at least $ 3 to $ 10 per month over comparable plans from other major Internet service providers . "
quote : Critics may be wise to take a deep breath before deriding AOL for a boneheaded membership disincentive for people who have abundant other options .
The change could wring more revenue from low - value subscribers , lower AOL 's costs for those who stay at the $ 10 rate , and shuck the least active , least valuable AOL members .
Having not seen AOL make a solid business decision for a better part of the last decade , it seems more likely that Time Warner is simply trying to speed up AOL's " evolution " from carrier to ad engine in preparation for a sale .
While AOL still makes $ 2 billion a year from its dial - up business , they 've made it clear they want to be an advertising and portal juggernaut instead of a connectivity provider .
A price hike simply expedites the already bloody subscriber mass exodus .
You can apparently stay at the $ 10 rate if you do n't call for software support .
CNET seems to believe the price hike is a work of genius , disguised as the work of an idiot :
Having not seen AOL make a solid business decision for a better part of the last decade , it seems more likely that Time Warner is simply trying to speed up AOL's " evolution " from carrier to ad engine in preparation for a sale .

A small plaque on the washroom wall of a hotel room in China reads : " Beijing Conference Centre .
It 's an oasis in noise . "
Another sign above the sink reads : " Please save the water used for life . "
Tool says he has corrected more than 1 million bits of broken English in China .
( Simon Dingley / CBC )
These phrases of mangled English are infamously referred to as Chinese English , or " Chinglish , " and amuse some Western visitors .
But not everyone is laughing .
David Tool , a retired U.S. army colonel , has made it his mission to eradicate broken English in Beijing .
An English professor at the city 's International Studies University , Tool says he has corrected more than one million mistakes over the past seven years as a volunteer for the local government .
The Chinese media have dubbed him the " sign police " professor .
Even
Tool chuckles over some of what he 's seen .
( One example : Until two years ago , Western visitors to Beijing made a tradition out of having pictures taken in front of a sign outside a local hospital that read " Dongda Hospital for Anus and Intestine Disease . " )
But at the core of his efforts is a serious goal .
" When the foreigners come here , I want them to understand Chinese culture , " he says .
He does n't want them to laugh at it .
Snickering visitors cause distress
Tool was living in California in 1990 when he made his first visit to China .
He fell in love with the country .
Feeling unhappy about his life in the United States , he moved here in 2001 and renamed himself Du Dawai , a Mandarin translation of David Tool .
Signs with broken English in Beijing often have awkward meanings that cause foreigners to snicker .
( Simon Dingley / CBC )
Shortly after that , he saw firsthand the consequences of poor English for the Chinese while attending a performance of the Peking Opera .
" They had this line [ in the performance ] that should have said ' auspicious clouds in the sky ' but it read ' auspicious clods , ' " he recalls .
" I was upset by the fact that the foreigners were laughing so uproariously that it actually disturbed the performance .
The Chinese would see this as laughing at Chinese culture and not treating it with respect .
I was so distressed , I wrote a letter to the minister of culture . "
The local government took him up on his offer to help and put him to work .
Tool now fixes signs on the subways , on highways and at museums .
And wherever else Tool spots incorrect English , he e-mails or personally visits the shopkeeper or government person responsible to point out the error .
" If it 's a capital letter or small letter , we do n't fool with it , " Tool explains .
" We 're after the stuff that 's laughable , embarrassing or actually is wrong information . "
Lessons on the streets
The government made him a member of its Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Committee in 2002 .
The committee has released 12 volumes of guidelines for medical signs , commercial signs and gymnasiums .
Fried chicken is misspelled on a Beijing menu .
( Simon Dingley / CBC )
Tool also teaches English at Beijing 's International Studies University .
He incorporates his passion into the classroom , taking his students on field trips and teaching them analytical thinking skills .
" We started walking down the streets , and I used this as a teaching technique for the students , " he says .
" If there was something wrong with this sign , I 'd say what 's wrong with this sign ?
And then they would try to figure it out .
It was an interesting technique to use . "
Tool also volunteers by training people with disabilities to be city tour guides .
Improving accessibility is one of his major awareness - raising activities .
For all his efforts , the city of Beijing recently awarded Tool its highest honour , the Great Wall Friendship Award , and chose him as one of the city 's Top 10 volunteers .
Tool was also chosen to run through the Forbidden City with the Olympic torch earlier this year .
" Many people have asked me : ' Was China going to be [ rid of Chinglish ] by the Olympics ? ' " Tool relates .
" Obviously , we were not .
But the emphasis has been on safety and directions .
The subways , roads , the directions on how to get some place are pretty clear . "
Retirement in L.A. : ' Too easy '
Tool has only visited his homeland twice in the past seven years .
He left his wife of almost 40 years in Los Angeles .
She comes to visit him every couple years .
She has no plans to move to Beijing .
But Sharon
Tool is not bitter .
In fact , she encouraged him .
" How difficult would it be to have an unhappy husband living at home with me ?...
He 's just so happy and so effective as the man he is here in Beijing .
And he can't be that in Los Angeles .
I know that .
So that makes me happy , " Sharon Tool says while visiting her husband during the Olympics .
But why does he do it ?
Why move to a foreign country ?
Why not relax and enjoy retirement in Los Angeles ?
" Because it 's too easy .
It 's very nice .
My wife 's a wonderful cook , we 've got a very nice house , we 've got a grandchild , two wonderful kids , " David Tool says .
" But I do n't think it 's very useful .
To be an old man is one thing , but to be a useful old man is a totally different and wonderful life , and I feel extremely useful here . "
US official to attend meeting with Iran 's nuclear negotiator
WASHINGTON , July 15 ( AFP ) Jul 16 , 2008
A senior US diplomat will attend international nuclear talks with Iran on Saturday , marking a shift in US policy on negotiations with Tehran , a State Department official said .
Undersecretary of State William Burns will attend the weekend meeting in Geneva between EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Tehran 's nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili .
The United States has no official contact with Iran and until now has refused to even participate in preliminary discussions with Iranian officials unless Tehran first suspends its nuclear enrichment activities .
Burns , the State Department 's third - ranking official , would be in Geneva " to receive the Iranian response to the latest offer of the P5 plus 1 , " said the official , requesting anonymity .
The meeting was planned as the five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany seek to reach an agreement with Tehran over its atomic program , which the West believes is aimed at developing nuclear weapons .
The decision came after Washington insisted for months that it was ready to talk to Iran only if it abandons its sensitive nuclear activities , which Tehran has refused to do .
A State Department official told the Washington Post that Burns will not negotiate and will not hold separate meetings with the Iranians .
Instead , he will reiterate Washington 's insistence that Iran stop its uranium enrichment operations before the US can enter into any serious negotiations .
" This is a one - time deal , " the official told the Post .
The US move comes amid speculation sanctions have started to have an effect and that Iran 's leadership was locked in debate about how to respond to the international offer .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Monday that Jalili and Solana were to discuss a " timetable " for future negotiations to break the deadlock between the two sides .
" In these talks , the framework of talks and timetable of talks " will be discussed , Ahmadinejad told state television .
He also hinted at US - Iran talks without explanation : " It is possible that in the near future talks in different fields will take place with the United States . "
Washington broke off relations with Tehran in 1980 in the wake of the Islamic revolution and the seizure of the US embassy .
Ties have remained severed ever since amid increasing acrimony over Iran 's disputed nuclear programme .
Last year , US and Iranian ambassadors broke with years of isolation and held talks focused on security in Iraq , with the nuclear issue excluded from the agenda .
There have also been reports of a possible diplomatic initiative from Washington with President George W. Bush 's administration considering opening a US interests section in Tehran .
Last month the P5 plus 1 -- Britain , China , France , Germany , Russia and the United States -- presented Iran with an offer of technological incentives in exchange for suspending sensitive uranium enrichment work .
Reports say Solana is proposing to Tehran that world powers would refrain from new sanctions provided Iran did not start operating any additional centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Iran has countered with a proposal which it says will go toward solving some of the major security problems of the world , and which diplomats have described as complex .
Iran test fired a broadside of missiles in recent days -- including one whose range includes Israel -- in war games that provoked international concern .
Washington 's approach towards Iran has been a major issue in the US presidential election .
Democrat Barack Obama has blasted Bush for refusing to engage directly with Tehran and urged robust diplomacy while his Republican rival John McCain has branded Obama naive .
It ’s got to be seen to be believed but from one side this really does read “ Come In ” and from the other “ Go Away ” .
And when you have finished marvelling at this remarkable feat of graphic design you can wipe the mud from your boots too !!
PRLog ( Press Release ) – Jun 05 , 2008
for full story , please read this :
http://www.prlog.org/10077917-two-negative-new-mexico-legislators-who-killed-nutrition-council-bills-are-retired-by-voters.html
Many Consumer Protection oriented readers know that for the past 5 years , I have been trying to pass legislation to establish a New Mexico Nutrition Council , to advise citizens , schools , and concerned victims of additive poisoning , as well as challenge the FDA when it needs to be challenged .
The closest these bills ever came to passing was in 2005 .
Carried by Navajo Rep. Irvin Harrison , the House Bill passed the House resoundingly , and then hit the Senate Committee on Corporations chaired by Albuquerque Senator Shannon Robinson .
Republicans on that committee had already left in a “ hissy ” fit earlier over some minor miff , and there was n’t a quorum , so the Democrats there formed a subcommittee and passed it .
Committee Chair Robinson , himself a pathetic junk food addict at that time , who was continually strung out on the sugar - candy - cokes - and - god - knows - what - else - he - had eaten highs and lows , the next day did a “ floor poll ” of the Republicans on his committee , including Minority Leader Stuart Ingle , and convinced them to vote against it .
Even though this action was entirely outside of Senate Rules , this killed the bill .
I will never forget speaking with two physicians , ( Grant La Farge and Kenneth Stoller ) plus Senator Jerry Ortiz y Pino to the Senate Public Affairs Committee in 2007 on Jerry ’s bill to ban aspartame in New Mexico , and there in the first chair was James Taylor eating a ham sandwich and ostentatiously and contemptuously guzzling his Diet Coke , as if to “ dis ” those testifying as bringing Internet junk science to the Public Affairs Committee .
Visiting his office , as I once did , I saw cases and cases of Diet Cokes in stacks almost to the ceiling , ordered , I presume , because they were free to the legislators .
I had to pause and profoundly question what the hell I was doing , trying to convince legislators to look out for New Mexico children , diabetics , Native Americans , the overweight , etc. , when in fact , the legislators had terrible addictions to aspartame themselves , so much that they could n’t be expected to vote intelligently or display any discerning judgment necessary to protect the health of any New Mexican , let alone their own health .
I hope Taylor ’s neurological demise from the aspartame will not be too ghastly in his later years ; he wo n’t be around the legislature for us to watch any of it .
Taylor had been heavily and repeatedly endorsed by Governor Bill Richardson , as had Transportation Committee Chair , Dan Silva .
Silva was beaten by Eleanor Chavez , 53.78 % to 46.22 % .
In the larger context , it seemed voters were happy to ignore Pete Domenici ’s very late endorsement of Heather Wilson , the Republican whose Congressional career is now over .
They ignored Richardson on Taylor and Silva , and in Santa Fe County , they ignored District Attorney Henry Valdez ’s endorsement for his Deputy A.J. Salazar when they elected Angela “ Spence ” Pacheco for D.A .
This is a sign of health independence on the part of the voters .
And in fairness to Richardson , most of his slate of incumbents was re-elected .
As to the Nutrition Council , the mortal damage done to this concept was achieved by some dastardly actions of Shannon Robinson and Dan Foley , and the gaping omissions by James Taylor and a few other Senators continuing as members , whom I choose not to name here .
The most curious and hypocritical of them is Senator Dr. Steve Komadina of Corrales , who as an Obstetrician will tell his patients to never ever consumer aspartame , but when it comes to a bill to that effect for all New Mexicans , that would go against his so - called Libertarian principles .
What a baffling contradiction !

Bloggers '
First Amendment rights are being challenged once again , thanks to a lawsuit over a blog critical of a local police department .
The city of Memphis , along with Memphis Police Director Larry Godwin , have subpoenaed AOL to force it to hand over all records associated with an @aim.com e-mail address , including registration information , billing information , names , e-mails , faxes , phone numbers , or IP addresses .
The MPD may be facing an uphill battle with this lawsuit , however , as past cases have come out in favor of keeping anonymous bloggers anonymous and protecting their First Amendment rights .
The user(s ) of the e-mail address post to a blog called MPD Enforcer 2.0 , which has historically been critical of the Memphis Police Department 's activities .
The blog has been somewhat of a sore spot for the MPD , especially as it has gained popularity online ( and boy , is it going to be popular now ) .
Among other issues , the MPD Enforcer 2.0 has discussed sexual harassment within the police department , questionable ticketing practices , and officers allegedly violating citizens ' ( and prisoners ' ) rights .
Godwin is often discussed extensively in many of the posts due to his position as director of the department .
The case was filed in Chancery Court in Nashville on July 10 , but most of the documents have been sealed .
Still , " Dirk Diggler " at the MPD Enforcer 2.0 ( the collective pseudonym of the bloggers who write on the site ) has posted copies of the subpoena sent to AOL that seeks any and all identifying information for the blogger in question .
In another blog post , Dirk Diggler wrote , " It pains us to believe that we live in America and a Director of Police Services can use his position ( and possibly tax payers dollars ) to launch a personal vendetta against this site and the 1st Amendment . "
The Enforcer team is now being represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group , the litigating division of Public Citizen .
If the case proceeds , it seems unlikely that the MPD will be very successful in unearthing the information it wants .
In 2005 , the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court 's decision requiring an ISP to turn over the identity of an anonymous blogger who was heavily critical of local politicians .
The judge in the case ruled that the blogger 's First Amendment right should be protected from intimidation .
And , just this year , a California appeals court ruled that forum trolls are allowed to remain anonymous and exercise their First Amendment rights , too .
Free speech advocates believe that the same principles apply to this case .
" You can complain about the government , and you should be able to do that without fear of retaliation or threatening actions on the part of the people in these positions , " Electronic Privacy Information Center associate director Lillie Coney told the Memphis Commercial Appeal .
" I guess they 've kind of annoyed them at some level , but you really do n't want to see law enforcement or government resources spent in this way . "
ACLU executive director Hedy Weinberg agreed , adding that anonymous speech is Constitutionally protected and that the organization is interested in preserving the anonymity of the bloggers in question .
After filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy , the parent company of national chains Bennigan 's and Steak and Ale on Tuesday shut hundreds of restaurants , putting thousands of employees out of work .
The move by privately held Plano , Texas - based Metromedia Restaurant Group knocks down two sit - down chains that have been part of the country 's casual - dining landscape for decades .
About 200 restaurants were closed immediately , including all of the remaining 50 or so Steak and Ales .
The filing eliminates full and part - time jobs for more than 9,200 employees , many of those in Texas , Florida and Illinois , three people familiar with the matter said .
Another 138 franchisee - owned Bennigan 's sites are n't part of the filing and intend to remain open .
They face a more uncertain future , however , given they 'll no longer have the full support of parent company Metromedia Restaurant Group , a unit of billionaire John Kluge 's Metromedia empire .
A company spokeswoman , Leah Templeton , declined to answer specific questions about the closings and the filing .
In an email , she said that stores operated by franchisees are not named as debtors in the filings , and that future decisions regarding the affairs of the debtor companies will be determined and administered by a bankruptcy trustee .
Cuil , the latest search engine startup to come out swinging from its corner with the hope of knocking out Google , is instead taking a beating that could do it long - term damage as a credible contender .
The company received broad media coverage on Monday , primarily because it has former Google engineers on its team and because of its claim to have the world 's largest search index , but Cuil is now facing an angry backlash .
The site has had performance and availability problems throughout the day , and a growing chorus of search market observers has declared the engine 's results to its queries unimpressive .
In addition , the site has launched with only a Web search engine , at a time when it 's considered a basic requirement for any search engine with aspirations of competing against Google to have at least some basic vertical search tabs for news articles , photos , maps and local business information .
Without the ability to collate general search results with photos , news articles , the increasingly popular video files and mapping information , a search engine is effectively unable to provide the type of " universal " search results that have become de riguer and that Google now consistently does .
In short , what looked like a successfully architected public - relations launch is backfiring because the product has failed to meet the lofty expectations that were created .
Backed by reputable investors that have reportedly invested $ 33 million in it , Cuil will now have to go into damage control instead of riding the early momentum , and hope that end - users and industry observers will give it another chance once it works out its kinks .
" First impressions count a lot , " said industry analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence , who on Monday morning was unable to give Cuil a thorough test because of the site 's performance problems .
While Cuil could become an interesting alternative to Google and the other major search engines , that will take some time .
In hindsight , it might have been wiser for Cuil 's management to launch the site more quietly and give themselves time to improve it , Sterling said .
Instead , by making a big , noisy media splash , they gave themselves little room for error .
" This much media coverage creates high expectations , " he said .
Indeed , Cuil came out with an in - your - face attitude , claiming to have the largest Web index of any search engine : 120 billion Web pages , which Cuil states is " three times more than any other search engine . "
It was a point that its officials made in interviews with media outlets prior to Monday 's debut .
But the site seemed unable to handle some softball , straight - forward queries .
For example , a search for " barack obama " returned on the first page of results mostly links to different pages of Obama 's official site , hardly useful if one is looking for a variety of sites on the presidential candidate .
A search for " St. Louis , MO " initially returned zero results .
Among others , search engine expert Danny Sullivan criticized Cuil for focusing on the size of its index -- a practice that fell into disfavor years ago , as engines focused on the quality of results -- and questioned the basic validity of the claim .
" Yes , size matters .
You want to have a comprehensive collection of documents from across the web .
But having a lot of documents does n't mean you are most relevant , " Sullivan wrote on his Search Engine Land blog .
Sullivan also pointed out that Google has n't publicly stated the size of its
Web index in years , and that even if Cuil 's is indeed three times as big , Google could quickly match that by simply becoming a bit less selective .
Last Friday , Google , likely anticipating Cuil 's launch on Monday , said its crawlers today " see " more than 1 trillion URLs on the Web .
Google declined to comment about Cuil 's claim and also declined to say how many links are in its Web index .
Sullivan and other search market observers said they were underwhelmed by the quality of Cuil 's results .
" With the huge caveat that nine queries are far from letting anyone conclude anything , I still did n't come away with a sense that Cuil has Google - beating relevancy .
Instead , it has some flaws though is better than many start - up search engines appear out of the box , " Sullivan wrote in another post Monday .
" I played with the site a fair bit when it turned on this morning .
So far it does n't do much for me , " wrote Saul Hansell of The New York Times in a blog post titled " Cuil 's New Search Engine : Cheaper Than Google , but Not Better . "
Cuil , which is pronounced " cool , " got a resounding thumbs - down from The Wall Street Journal 's John Paczkowski in an AllThingsD post titled Totally UnCuil .
" If your mission is to beat Google in the search market , it 's probably wise to give your upstart search engine a name that people know how to pronounce .
It 's also wise to make sure that it appears in the first page of search results for its own name .
Cuil , the upstart search engine that debuted today with aspirations of unseating Google , has apparently done neither , " he wrote .
He 's not alone in his dislike for the company 's name .
IDC analyst Caroline Dangson flagged the name -- she called it " terrible " -- as one of what she considers the company 's main challenges .
" Cuil has an uphill battle in getting more consumers to search its site instead of Google .
Google wins hands down for brand recognition among U.S. consumers , " she said via e-mail , adding that using Google has become a habit for a majority of search users .
According to a recent IDC survey , three - quarters of U.S. online consumers know Google as an Internet brand and the majority like Google and believe it offers quality services , she said .
" Furthermore , Google also already has an established business model based on search advertising in which it excels .
Even if Cuil offers better search results , the company is not monetizing its service with advertising at this point and will not be able to compete with Google in terms of revenue , " she said .
Of course , on Monday , Cuil 's problems were much more serious than offering better results , considering how shaky its performance has been .
At close to 5 p.m. Eastern
Time the site was still returning error results , saying it could n't process queries because its servers were overloaded .

Today , Barack Obama ’s superdelegate march to the Democratic nomination continued with the endorsement of Rep. Brad Miller ( D - NC ) .
“ Senator Obama understands that he has the chance not just to win the election this year , but to be a great president .
Americans know that Republican policies have failed because their ideas are wrong .
Americans know that our government has not acted , to use Franklin Roosevelt ’s words , as trustees for the whole people , but have taken the side of powerful economic interests on every issue , ” Miller said .
Miller believes that Obama has a chance to build a Democratic consensus that could last for a generation , “ If Senator Obama and Democratic candidates up and down the ticket win this year and then deliver next year , we can build a consensus that will last a generation .
I look forward to serving on a unified Democratic ticket with Senator Obama .
He has shown great vision , strength and resilience during a very tough campaign against a worthy opponent . ”

Notice how the language of the superdelegates has shifted .
Delegates are now talking about Obama in terms of winning in November .
This is n’t about the matchup between Clinton and Obama .
Superdelegates like Miller view that as over .
For Democrats , this about beating John McCain and retaking the White House .
The point about Obama building a long term base of power ca n’t be ignored .
The 2008 election has the potential to be one of those historic generational shifts in American political leadership .
Obama is now 168 delegates short of clinching the Democratic nomination .

Scientists suggest the Arctic is already at a climatic " tipping point "
Arctic sea ice has shrunk to the second smallest extent since satellite records began , US scientists have revealed .
The National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) says that the ice - covered area has fallen below its 2005 level , which was the second lowest on record .
Melting has occurred earlier in the year than usual , meaning that the iced area could become even smaller than last September , the lowest recorded .
Researchers say the Arctic is now at a climatic " tipping point " .
" We could very well be in that quick slide downwards in terms of passing a tipping point , " said Mark Serreze , a senior scientist at the Colorado - based NSIDC .
" It 's tipping now .
We 're seeing it happen now , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Under covered
The area covered by ice on 26 August measured 5.26 million sq km ( 2.03 million sq miles ) , just below the 2005 low of 5.32 million sq km ( 2.05 million sq ) .
But the 2005 low came in late September ; and with the 2008 graph pointing downwards , the NSIDC team believes last year 's record could still be broken even though air temperatures , both in the Arctic and globally , have been lower than last year .
Last September , the ice covered just 4.13 million sq km ( 1.59 million sq miles ) , the smallest extent seen since satellite imaging began 30 years ago .
The 1980 figure was 7.8 million sq km ( 3 million sq miles ) .
The 2008 graph shows a steeper decline than at the same time last year
Most of the cover consists of relatively thin ice that formed within a single winter and melts more easily than ice that accumulated over many years .
Irrespective of whether the 2007 record falls in the next few weeks , the long - term trend is obvious , scientists said ; the ice is declining more sharply than even a decade ago , and the Arctic region will progressively turn to open water in summers .
A few years ago , scientists were predicting ice - free Arctic summers by about 2080 .
Then computer models started projecting earlier dates , around 2030 to 2050 ; and some researchers now believe it could happen within five years .
That will bring economic opportunities , including the chance to drill for oil and gas .
Burning that oil and gas would increase levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still further .
The absence of summer ice would have impacts locally and globally .
The iconography of polar bears unable to find ice is by now familiar ; but other species , including seals , would also face drastic changes to their habitat , as would many Arctic peoples .
Globally , the Arctic melt will reinforce warming because open water absorbs more of the Sun 's energy than ice does .

Fox News Sunday ’s “ Obama Watch ” came to an end this week , when the frontrunner for the Democrat presidential nomination granted an interview to Chris Wallace .
The 35 - minute interview took up three segments , and covered everything from Rev. Wright to Gen. Petraeus .
Despite widespread criticism of Fox News ’ rightwing bias , Obama ended up giving one of his better interviews .
Obama opened the interview collegially , joking that “ it takes me about 772 days to prepare ” for an interview with Wallace .
Throughout the interview , Obama appeared relaxed and willing to discuss any issue .
He did n’t ( usually ) try to dodge questions or proclaim certain issues out of bounds .
The frustrated , I ’m - too - good - for - your - silly - questions Obama of the ABC debate in Pennsylvania was no where to be found .
The Fox News Sunday Obama was not always completely forthcoming ( he is still a politician , after all ) but for the most part , Obama delivered serious , thoughtful answers to questions about his character and values .
Wallace opened the interview with a discussion about the racial dynamics of the campaign – Wallace noted that Clinton won white voters in PA ( 63 % - 37 % ) , and she overwhelmingly won white voters who admitted that race played a factor in their vote ( 76 % - 24 % ) .
Wallace asked , “ Is n’t there still a racial divide in this country that ’s going to make it very hard for you to get elected President ? ”
Obama responded by saying that many current polls show him matching up better against John McCain than Hillary Clinton .
Obama even went so far as to say , “ If I lose [ the general election to McCain ] , it wo n’t be because of race . ”
Advertisements
That may come as news to many of Obama ’s supporters in the media .
Writing in the L.A. Times earlier this month , David Shipler claimed that to call Obama “ elitist ” was unacceptable racialist discourse .
In light of a recent North Carolina Republican Party television ad that features now - infamous footage of Obama ’s former pastor Rev. Wright , both the New York Times editorial board and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne ( among others ) accused the N.C. GOP of making an oblique racial appeal .
Based on his answer to Wallace ’s question , it seems Obama does n’t share many of his followers ’ desire to cry “ racism ” when he is criticized .
Obama also answered questions about Rev. Wright , proclaiming his former pastor ’s statements as a legitimate political issue .
He attempted to explain his relationship with one - time domestic terrorist William Ayers , saying that his association with Ayers is a very loose one .
He also clarified his previous remarks that wearing an American flag lapel pin is n’t necessarily an indicator of patriotism , and in doing so , Obama somewhat redeemed himself after having said during the ABC debate that such questions were “ distractions . ”
Obama even made positive ( although brief ) comments about free markets .
Obama was less impressive during other portions of the Fox News Sunday interview .
When asked how he can present himself as a post - partisan candidate when his voting record is unwaveringly leftwing , Obama offered nothing new or convincing .
He repeated previous statements that he ’s not necessarily opposed to merit pay for union school teachers , and that he ’s generally willing to give Republicans a respectful hearing before voting against them .
When asked how he will respond to McCain ’s inevitable portrayal of him as a “ tax and spend ” liberal , Obama responded with his own criticisms of McCain ’s vague promises to cut spending without tax increases .
Fair enough , but Obama failed to explain how his own domestic proposals can be paid for without middle class tax hikes .
Obama also rejected the possibility of any further debates with Hillary Clinton before the Indiana primary .
He said , “ I ’m not ducking .
We ’ve had 21 ( debates ) , and so what we ’ve said is , with two weeks , two big states , we want to make sure we ’re talking to as many folks possible on the ground taking questions from voters . ”
Of course , he ’s only had four debates one - on - one with Clinton .
He ’s obviously ducking another debate because his last performance in PA was uninspiring , to say the least .
Obviously , there ’s no political advantage for Obama in debating Clinton again , but if he had the courage of his convictions , he would be willing to debate Clinton anywhere , any time .
In the end , Obama came off fairly well on Fox News Sunday .
He took the opportunity to bring his message to a skeptical Fox News audience , and he acquitted himself well .
He probably should have done it sooner .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A soldier who survived a Taliban attack that killed nine U.S. troops in Afghanistan last month described a scene of " pure chaos " in which he watched buddies die .
Army Spc. Tyler Stafford is recovering from wounds he suffered in the July 13 attack .
Army Spc. Tyler Stafford and fellow soldiers in the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team were establishing an outpost near the village of Wanat when about 200 Taliban militants attacked July 13 .
" They had 200 - plus guys all shooting at us -- I mean , pure chaos , " Stafford said .
" You could hear guys screaming . "
Nine Americans were killed and 12 -- including Stafford -- were wounded in the deadliest attack on U.S. forces in Afghanistan in three years .
Afghan sources said that up to 100 militants were killed in the attack .
Stafford , who is recovering at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center , said he and his fellow soldiers were facing Taliban fighters on three sides when the attack began .
The Americans were outmanned and outgunned .
A NATO spokesman said the defense of the outpost was " heroic . "
Once he was wounded , Stafford called out to his friend , Cpl. Matthew Phillips .
" I yelled to him , I was like , ' Phillips , man I need help .
I 'm hit .' ... I looked at him and I called him about four or five times .
I was like , ' Phillips .
Phillips .
Are you all right , Phillips ? '
And he never moved .
" That 's the first one of my buddies I 've ever seen die . "
A short distance away was Cpl. Jonathan Ayers .
" He never once stopped shooting , " Stafford said .
" I thought that was completely amazing .
He never , I mean , he finally was killed by [ rocket - propelled grenades ] and gunfire , but he never once stopped shooting back at them . "
Lt. Jonathan Brostrom and Cpl. Jason
Hovater were killed when they ran through a hail of Taliban gunfire in an attempt to carry more ammunition to their fellow soldiers , Stafford said .
" They knew our guys were in trouble , and when the Airborne 's in trouble , you do n't leave them to die ; you go help them , " Stafford said .
" They brought what they could . "
The Americans were running low on ammunition , and some of them were so badly wounded they were unable to move , Stafford said .
Help did not come for an hour , he said .
Stafford eventually was helicoptered to safety .
He said he looked back at the scene below while aboard the chopper .
" It 's like one of the those movies out of like Vietnam that you see with all these special effects and everything 's on fire , " he recalled .
" Smoke in the air , and that 's all you see is tracer rounds going back and forth ... just , ' boom , boom , boom . ' "
The other Americans who died were Sgt. Israel Garcia , Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling , Spc. Sergio Abad , Cpl. Pruitt Rainey and Cpl. Jason Bogar .
" The way they served each other -- you 're fighting for the guy on your back , the guy that 's in the foxhole next to you , when that kind of stuff happens .
We all love each other very much , " Stafford said .

There are many sustainable options when it comes to putting food on the table , from eating organic to choosing locally grown foods to avoiding animal products .
But there ’s nothing quite as truly sustainable , satisfying , and tasty as growing your own organic food .
What follows is my homegrown experience in community gardening .
After traveling around in a veggie oil and biodiesel powered “ volksvegan ” for most of last year , I was eager to have a garden again ( not to mention an actual kitchen ) .
It did n’t take long in our small town to find a wonderful non-profit organization teaching organic food production classes and get involved .
Before long we were starting seeds in a greenhouse , not quite sure where we’d be planting them when they were sprouted .
Luckily , the organization , Noyo Food Forest , was just breaking ground on a new community garden , and we jumped at the chance to get our hands dirty and grow some organic food .
Our gardening experience in coastal Northern California has been quite an experiment .
After growing up in the hotter and dryer climate of Idaho , gardening on the coast took some getting used to .
But we discovered that with some fertile soil , organic seeds , a few helpful people , and the labors of love , we could grow a bounty of fresh organic produce and community at the same time .
Community or neighborhood gardens are an ideal situation for people like my partner and I that do n’t have ideal garden space at home .
Our house in the redwood forest does n’t get much sun , so renting an 8 ′ x 20 ′ plot in the community garden just down the road from us worked out perfectly .
In addition , we planted kitchen herbs and a few veggies in pots in the few sunny spots in the yard .
Seeds were started in Noyo Food Forest ’s greenhouse and we used a desk under a south - facing window and a small plant light to keep the seedlings happy until May , when we could plant them outside .
Community gardens come in many forms and sizes , depending on the people who organize them .
Luckily for us , the Noyo Come - Unity garden we became a part of was just getting started when we moved here , so we were able to be involved in the process from the beginning .
Along with other gardeners , we cleared the land , had dead trees cut down , split up and hauled the wood , had a bonfire with the rest , put up fences and gates , planned out a garden design , built compost piles , and dug in .
We all decided to have individual / family plots as well as community beds , where we could grow food for the food bank and other local organizations .
We share tools , knowledge , ideas , and general garden chores and each maintain our own plots .
Once a week , we have work days where we plan and work on the garden together .
We got involved in the process in February .
By mid-May , plots had been assigned , and each family weeded and double - dug their beds to prepare the fertile soil .
We learned about compost and organic soil amendments as we got ready to plant .
I drew up a plan and bought organic seeds for our plot , and then the fun part began .
We transplanted broccoli , mesclun greens , bush beans , spinach , and a few beneficial herbs we had started from seed into neat rows .
We got other starts at the local farmer ’s market : corn , cabbage , eggplant , squash , brussels sprouts , asian greens , tomatillo , lettuces , leeks , onions , fennel , and cauliflower .
And we started zucchini , cucumbers , radishes , carrots , peas , and green onions from seeds .
Using the guidelines of some organic gardening books and the back of seed packages , we filled in the garden , watered it , and waited to see what would happen .
As our garden grew , so did the community garden itself .
A tool shed was built , and we dug and planted community beds full of herbs , flowers , beans , peas , squash , zucchini , and greens .
We painted signs , laid out paths covered with wood chips , and cleared areas that would eventually be a community food forest .
We met new people as more folks got involved , made plans to build a cob oven and kids ’ play area at the garden , and started planning a drip irrigation system .
The garden space went from a bare plot of weeds to a beautiful garden space full of organic food , hope , and love in a matter of months .
As it evolves , we learn more and more about growing our own food as well as building community .
Our first harvest from our plot was a large handful of asian greens and a few huge leaves of bok choy .
But it was more than a simple salad : it was our first homegrown , completely local , fresh from the garden meal of the spring .
It symbolized a lot of hard work and dedication , and it was only the beginning .
By June we were harvesting a large salad of mixed greens , spinach , bok choy and radishes every other day .
We began re-seeding and filling in the few blank spots in the garden as we harvested .
We mulched our plot to conserve water , weeded it every week , and picked fresh produce as we worked .
We ’re now planning for fall and winter crops .
The best part was that none of this seemed like work , not even shoveling wheel barrel loads of compost and manure !
As food and transportation prices rise , more and more people are discovering the health and environmental benefits of organic and locally grown food .
The natural progression of this awareness is to bring it back home .
I am starting to see a resurgence in gardening , and am happy to witness an era when growing your own food is once again becoming popular and even hip .
Whether you have a collection of pots on a sunny patio , a backyard , or a community garden to work with , all it takes to start growing your own food is curiosity , a willingness to experiment , and a bit of dirty work .
Growing your own is not only a sustainable way to be more self - sufficient , it ’s a lot of fun .
There ’s nothing quite like that first harvest of fresh veggies picked straight from the earth .
So dig in !

Better . throughout the year for more adventures in community gardening .

Family Security Matters a neo-conservative based think tank has published an article advocating that George W. Bush should be a dictator for life .
The organization has since taken the article down , but is still viewable via this cached link [ IFP Ed.
Note : The link is defunct ] .
Conquering the Drawbacks of Democracy : By Philip Atkinson
The article written by Philip Atkinson states that Bush would fail his country by becoming an ex-President or can achieve greatness by becoming President - for - Life Bush in order to bring sense to Congress and sanity to the Supreme Court .
Atkinson is bluntly advocating that Bush should become dictator for life with these outrageously anti-American statements .
From the article :
President Bush can fail in his duty to himself , his country , and his God , by becoming “ ex- president ” 
Bush or he can become “ President - for - Life ” 
Bush : the conqueror of Iraq , who brings sense to the Congress and sanity to the Supreme Court .
Then who would be able to stop Bush from emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world ?
For only an America united under one ruler has the power to save humanity from the threat of a new Dark Age wrought by terrorists armed with nuclear weapons .
Atkinson also advocates that Bush should get rid of everyone in Iraq through military force and repopulate the country with Americans .
From the article :
If President Bush copied Julius Caesar by ordering his army to empty Iraq of Arabs and repopulate the country with Americans , he would achieve immediate results : popularity with his military ; enrichment of America by converting an Arabian Iraq into an American Iraq ( therefore turning it from a liability to an asset ) ; and boost American prestiege while terrifying American enemies .
Although these statements by Atkinson are completely insane and entirely anti-American , the author also shows complete ignorance as to the type of government the United States is supposed to be .
The author states that Bush is a victim of Democracy when in fact the United States is not a Democracy .
From the article :
Yet in 2007 he is generally despised , with many citizens of Western civilization expressing contempt for his person and his policies , sentiments which now abound on the Internet .
This rage at President Bush is an inevitable result of the system of government demanded by the people , which is Democracy .
The inadequacy of Democracy , rule by the majority , is undeniable “ “ for it demands adopting ideas because they are popular , rather than because they are wise .
This means that any man chosen to act as an agent of the people is placed in an invidious position : if he commits folly because it is popular , then he will be held responsible for the inevitable result .
If he refuses to commit folly , then he will be detested by most citizens because he is frustrating their demands .
Although I do agree that Democracy is a horrible form of government , Atkinson ’s argument holds no water since we do not have a Democracy in this country .
The United States is in fact a Constitutional Republic , so it is not possible for Bush to be a victim of Democracy .
Unfortunately , Atkinson might get his wish of a Bush dictatorship .
The HSPD - 20 / NSPD - 51 directives issued by Bush states that the President is to have complete control over all three branches of government during a catastrophic emergency .
In addition , the Department of Homeland Security plans for continuity of government operations have been kept secret from Congress .
Either way , Atkinson the author of this article is clearly an insane individual who hates America .
From advocating the colonization of Iraq with Americans as well as a Bush dictatorship , it is clear this individual needs some serious help .
It also leaves questions as to the judgment of this Family Security Matters organization considering they openly published this anti-American trash .
An investigation by Free Market News Network , found that Family Security Matters is actually a front group for the Center for Security Policy a group that Vice President Dick Cheney is a known associate of .
Removing the article was clearly a means of damage control and it shows how rabid and insane the neo-conservative base has become .
This article shows that today ’s neo-conservative is nothing more than the 21st century equivalent of a Nazi in pre World War II Germany .

The humble phone number .
Global , local , extensions , alternates , and sometimes pure garbage :
Without data entry restraints there is no telling what you might find in a typical phone number data field .
Until now .
The topic of phone number crunching has arisen at the Monastery before , multiple times , with answers and insightful speculations , but thus far all seem to have underestimated the complexity of the unrestrained Beast .
I come bearing loads of international phone number DATA found running rampant in the wilds of the data entry savanahs , plus my particular solution to the problem of making sense of it all .
From a representative field of nearly 100,000 numbers I distilled a subset of über - patterns and their appearance frequencies .
What follows is my eventual solution for parsing these noisy numbers , a rather brute - force solution that evolved to fit the data at hand for a data set perhaps better suited for analysis by a neural net ; my reflections on the nature of data entry , ambiguity , and alternate approaches ; and most importantly , a scrambled but meaningful representative data set on which you are free to chew at your leisure -- I 'm sure better approaches exist .
I invite thoughts , code commentary , and better solutions .

Parsing Thoughts
Phone numbers , like email addresses , are inherently impossible to prove " correct " merely by parsing .
The only way to discover if a phone number is valid is to dial it and see what rings .
More generally speaking , of course , there are general formats we expect to see , regardless of whether the number is indeed a valid number .
Beyond the International Dial Direct codes ( what locals use to dial out of their country ) International Country Codes ( what the world dials to reach a particular country after the IDD )
The local phone number , including area / province codes and possibly long distance codes Extensions ( to be dialed after a connection is made )
Below you will find my commentary , a basic script , and three modules used for my crunching .
The example numbers are included below theportion of the script .
Phone numbers , like email addresses , are inherently impossible to prove " correct " merely by parsing .
The only way to discover if a phone number is valid is to dial it and see what rings .
More generally speaking , of course , there are general formats we expect to see , regardless of whether the number is indeed a valid number .
Beyond the International Country Codes , however , numbers are subject to the vagaries and capacities of the host country 's network .
There are no guarantees , without knowing the rules for every country , what bits of a number apply to an area or province code , municipality , etc .
The only parts of a number we can reasonably expect to identify in a globally generic way are :
On top of this we should also expect indications of alternates for numbers , suffixes , and extensions in unconstrained data entry fields .
All is not doom and gloom for the country networks , however .
If , for example , you happen to know that a large proportion of your numbers are supposed to be in a ten - digit format then you can use that information to infer information and rules of thumb , especially for parsing alternate suffixes .
1-900-ILOVEYOU : I have made no attempt to parse vanity numbers .
First of all , none are represented in this data set .
Second , I toyed with the idea and eventually decided that there was too much ambiguity involved with extracting extensions usually indicated by some combination of letters from ' extension ' , periods , hashes , and whitespace .
I can see how distinguishing the difference might be done , but did not implement it since this data has loads of extensions but no vanity numbers .
Finally , there is one unavoidable fact :
There are plenty of garbage entries that are either incomplete or incomprehensible even to a human .
In a well - controlled universe this garbage would have been caught at the data - entry stage -- even a rudimentary attempt at enforcing validity would clean up much of the garbage .
Such is not the case here , however , though those tasked with parsing the result may fervently wish it otherwise .
Though no longer in vogue , the GIGO principle ultimately still stands for these cases .
The Data As mentioned above , the original data comes from 100,000 or so international and U.S. domestic numbers entered into unconstrained entry fields .
From these numbers I derived meta patterns with which to play :
As mentioned above , the original data comes from 100,000 or so international and U.S. domestic numbers entered into unconstrained entry fields .
From these numbers I derived meta patterns with which to play : Pattern Count Generality 1503 single digits ( \d ) , single alphas ( [ a - z ] ) 1269 single digits , single alphas , whitespace ( \d , [ a - zA - Z ] , and \s + ) 328 digit clusters , single alphas , whitespace ( \d+ , [ a - zA - Z ] , and \s + ) 312 digit clusters , alpha clusters , whitespace ( \d+ , [ a - zA - Z ] + , and \s + )
If extraction were the only goal , then the most general pattern collection at the bottom of that list would be sufficient for this particular data set .
However , in this case we just have a raw data field that is supposed to have a phone number in it .
Our job is to parse that number -- a more complicated task that presents its own set of challenges .
Therefore in the __DATA__ section in the phone .pl script below I have included 1269 example entries that represent patterns derived from letting single alphanumerics ( not clusters ) float and collapsing whitespace .
These are not real phone numbers , except perhaps some by random chance .
International country codes , where identifiable , were replaced with a random country code of identical length .
1's and 0's were largely left alone ( due mostly to the presence of IDD codes ) and the rest of the digits were sequentially overwritten .
Text strings have been replaced with nonsense unless they are somehow generically germane ( eg " Extension " , " PAGER " , " email only " , " - xxxx " , etc ) .
The result is a set of fake but convincing numbers with valid country codes ( when present ) that each correspond to one of the patterns .
Each number is preceded by a percentage measuring its match frequency in the original data set .
Though I did not use this information for parsing purposes , it is instructive to see that the majority of numbers fall into patterns that are reasonable to extract and that indeed , we need not fear for the collective skills of our world 's typists .
The percentages might also be useful to those seeking their own solutions -- either to form heuristics or to realize when " enough is enough " and be content with their 95 % .
Note that with a data set this size , percentages of less than 1 % are common and can represent a significant number of entries .
My Solution
There are three tasks involved with data such as this : extraction , normalization , and parsing .
Though logically distinct , in reality they are hopelessly entangled .
Much of the noise that gets dropped during normalization , for instance , can briefly serve as clues to the meaning of various parts of a phone number .
My end result , therefore , is a series of steps , sequentially cohesive , that are executed in a specific order with each step passing the remnants of its operation to the next .
The steps involved are a direct reflection of the nature of this particular data set .

My end result , therefore , is a series of steps , sequentially cohesive , that are executed in a specific order with each step passing the remnants of its operation to the next .
The steps involved are a direct reflection of the nature of this particular data set .
Loosely stated , my approach boils down to the following steps : Split entry into multiple numbers , if present .
Extract phone extensions .
Remove IDD prefixes ( possibly using them to infer upcoming country codes ) Interpolate alternate suffixes into separate list of complete numbers .
Extract country codes where present and map to appropriate numbers .
Remaining data is likely to be the core number for a locale .
Some clarifications are in order .
In step # 3 I mention removing IDD prefixes -- the sequence of numbers used to dial out of a particular country .
These are of little use to someone wanting to dial to a number if they do not happen to live in a country with that same IDD .
Sometimes in the data there is no '+ ' to indicate an international number -- sometimes there is merely an IDD , usually some combination of 0 and 1 -- so these codes can be handy to infer the imminent arrival of a country code .
I store the IDD 's where found , but other than the inferal process they are of no particular use for my purposes .
In step # 4 I mention interpolating numbers .
Sometimes a number might be listed as something like ' 555-555-6666 , 7777 , or 8888 ' .
There are three numbers there , all beginning with ' 555 -555 ' .
There are cases such as ' 555 555 6666 - 7 ' that present ambiguity : is the ' 7 ' an extension or an alternate ending to another suffix ?
In my solution that particular example is interpreted as an alternate suffix ' 6667 ' .
In the original data it was more obvious because these tended to appear as numerically sequential numbers , i.e. , adjacent suffixes .
The scrambling of the data has destroyed some of its intuitive " look " and might cause you to wonder about my decisions in these ambiguous areas .
These decisions are not bulletproof -- at the time they just seemed more likely to be correct .
Step # 5 is perhaps the most interesting .
I broke down and eventually came to rely on a list of actual , valid Country Codes .
Mechanically detecting country codes can go only so far .
Think " +44 555 666 7777 " vs " +445556667777 " .
With no knowledge of country codes , other than perhaps their typical maximum length of three digits and Huffman encoding , there is no bulletproof way of pulling the country code out of the second example .
In addition the mechanical approach cannot deal with invalid country codes following a '+'.
So in the CountryCodes package I provide some routines for pulling valid country codes out of a string of digits ; in addition , there is a small routine for grabbing an updated list of codes off of the Net .
There are two methods included : pull_cc_smart and pull_cc_guess ( not used ) that illustrate the difference .
The Code As I mentioned , I expect that the dataset is the most valuable contribution here .
My code is not optimized , tricky , or beautiful -- it is merely a straightforward evolution of a solution from data with pollution .
( Am I a poet or what ? )

The test script phone.pl is a simple harness around the data .
For each line it will print the raw entry and extracted phone numbers , separated by a colon .
In cases where multiple number were extracted , they appear on a line of their own below the first number found .

Re : Beast of the Number : Parsing the Feral Phone

Big time ++ dude !
Couple of quickie comments before I start trying to run your code against the 10 million german CLI ( call line identifiers ) that I have access to and the 100k or so UK numbers that are on hand as well .
Regarding parsing extensions .
In some countries ( like Germany ) you arent allowed to have extensions .
I believe this is due to the authorities needing to be able to uniquely identifiy the locaion of every handset in the country .
This of course means that if you can find the list of countries that have such a law you can simplify the logic of parsing out extensions .
Regarding number formats , I believe that you can take advantage of the +1 code .
All of these numbers are in a 3 - 3 - 4 pattern ( with optional extension ) .
These should be easy to parse .
OTOH Germany uses a floating format ( anywhere for 6 digits ( maybe smaller ! ) for a local number to a full blown 14 digit ( including + , country code and area code ) for my own phone number ( they can get larger ) .
Which brings me to area codes .
These are / should be easy to parse in the +1 area .
But theres no way to do so in a country that uses floating length area codes ( like Germany with 2 - 5 digit area codes ) short of knowing the full list for that country .
Of course thats not real feasable considering that Germany alone has 5226 of them ...
( I know I converted the DTAG list into the AOC data used on our switches ... )
( Actually ive always thought it interesting that Germany has so many , but the entire NA uses less than a thousand .
I guess thats why extensions are so common in NA , in order to work around the ( currently ) antiquitated telecoms industry that is the result of NA 's early lead in the area )
Anyway , these are just quick of the cuff comments .
A node this big and serious will need a lot more time for thought .
Big ++ once again !

Interesting data regarding Germany -- I had no idea .
It was for precisely this sort of reason , however , that I made no attempt to try and figure out area codes for numbers from various countries around the world .
The result of this parsing could easily be passed along to a country - specific module for more appropriate parsing and beautification .
There are a couple of things to point out here that I did not mention in the article ( due to 64 k limit on nodes ) .
I made no attempt to parse valid IDD prefixes even though lists for each country are available on the net .
The reason is that the IDD prefixes are not mutually exclusive to the Country Codes .
Nor , unfortunately or unexpectedly , are area codes for a particular locale .
This reality produces ambiguous areas where I could be slurping up an area code or IDD as a country code .
What 's needed in * that * case is some concept of the natural phone number length for that locality .
Rather than get that specific , though , I relied on a threshold length and size percentages as measured against the remainder of the number .
It 's not perfect , but for my data set it worked suprisingly well .
Given your information about the variability of German numbers , particularly the 14 - digit monsters , this technique might fail if the area / province codes happen to match valid country codes elsewhere .
This of course only applies to numbers that are presented * without * their Country Code .
Once this code has its hands on what it thinks is the local number , it 's just stored as a single number .
I chunk it for display purposes , but generically and in a U.S. - centric kind of way : 4 digits on the suffix , preceded by groups of three digits as long as there are digits left .
Also , keep in mind that this code is intended to operate on raw , unrestricted data fields .
Typoes , blippoes ( ???? or xxxx ) and all of it are present in the data .
There 's not a whole lot you can do in these cases to pull out a valid number without knowing in excruciating detail the particulars of the intended country .
GIGO , GIGO , it 's off to the dumpster we go !
BTW , I suspect this code might take quite a while to run on 10 million numbers , even if they are well - behaved .
Thanks for the comments and feedback .
Any thoughts on whether any of this should be CPAN - bound once cleaned up ?
( new names and POD , obviously , but beyond that ... )

I 've just seen a recommendation for telephonenumbers .
It is called : E.164 from the ITU - T ( TELECOMMUNICATION STANDARDIZATION SECTOR OF ITU )
Due to copyright issues , I must not post it here .

Re : Beast of the Number : Parsing the Feral Phone
( Deacon ) on Jan 16 , 2003 at 08:20 UTC by htoug on Jan 16 , 2003 at 08:20 UTC Just another 0.02 € : In Denmark there is no areacode .
Phone numbers are just 8 - digit numbers with a possible extension ( no standard for that , format etc depends on the local switchboard ) .
The number is traditionally formatted as dd dd dd dd , but even that has begun to vary : some people use 2 groups of 3 digits and a 2 digit group , others 2 groups of 4 digits !
Earlier you could figure out which phonecentral the number was attached to , but following ( EU instigated ? ) rulechanges you can take your number with you when you move from one part of the country to another .
Thus there is no areacode , or all of Denmark ( including cellular phones ! ) is in the same area .
Things do vary .

Interesting fatctiod about Denmark having no area codes .
This is why I do not bother attempting to interpret the core number once I have dealt with IDD codes , country codes , extensions , and various representations of multiple numbers .
Figuring out an area code is beyond the scope of this set of tools -- it does , however , make a huge step in providing a base phone number suitable for interpretation by a module tailored to a particular country or region .
I admit that my * display * functionality is US - centric .
It chunks the core number width 4 digits on the suffix , preceded by groups of three ( or less if the first digits ) .
So in your example , dd dd dd dd would come out looking like d ddd dddd .
That 's just cosmetic , however .
The internal representation makes no distinction for area codes of any sort .
The PhoneNumber.pm module can be provided with new chunked_number ( ) and as_string ( ) methods suitable for any locale .
If I ever put it on CPAN I would attempt to structure it so that subclasses could easily provide for internationalization ( perhaps based on country code , but with a default format for the local region ) .
( it 's worth repeating that the actual display of these numbers was more of an afterthought -- the main thrust is the normalization and parsing of unverified and unruly international phone number strings ) Matt Re : Beast of the Number : Parsing the Feral Phone

Do you know if phone numbers are any closer to being added to that module ?
Back to Meditations
European retailers were sold out of the new iPhone 3G before stores in the US even opened on Friday , thanks in part to strong marketing from Apple 's mobile partners .
The initial sales surge not only blew through stores ' inventory but also delivered a knock - out punch to Apple 's iTunes activation servers .
The Swiss daily newspaper " 20 Minuten " reported that hundreds waited in line for hours in ZÃ¼rich in front of the central Swisscom store .
The mobile phone provider opened 100 of its retail stores at 6:30 AM and served snacks and water to those waiting in line .
In Bern , Swisscom 's main shop in the Christoffel shopping center was sold out of 16 GB iPhones by 8 AM , and was sold out of all iPhones by two in the afternoon .
An employee reported that the store had received an initial allotment of 3,000 iPhones .
There are over a dozen other Swisscom retail stores in the Bern area , and all were sold out on the first day .
Orange did n't open its stores as early in the morning , but was similarly sold out of all iPhones by early afternoon as well .
Several other retail shops in downtown Bern , including Mobilezone , Apple Specialist retailer Data Quest , and the Globus department store , which hosts a Swisscom store inside , were all busy selling the new iPhone to slow moving lines three customers deep all morning .
All sold out of their inventories by early afternoon , although a few stores had held a unit or two for customers who had called in to reserve one .
Extensive Newspaper Coverage
The night before the launch , Swisscom paid to wrap the daily paper " Blick am Abend , " ( below ) with an iPhone ad promoting the 8GB iPhone for 99 Swiss Francs ( $ 99 US ) with the purchase of a two year , 55 Swiss Franc ( $ 55 US ) plan , which includes access to 1100 WiFi hotspots .
Swisscom is also selling the iPhone 3G 8 GB / 16GB without a subscription plan for 519/619 Swiss Francs ( $ 519/619 US ) , although the unit is still locked to Swisscom for service .
Enterprising hackers will likely work around the SIM lock soon , making the Swisscom pricing one of the most attractive deals in Europe .
On Friday , Orange wrapped its own offer over 20 Minuten : the 8GB iPhone 3G for 99 Swiss Francs ( $ 99 US ) with a two year contract , although the contract price is higher at 99 Swiss Francs ( $ 99 US ) per month .
Without a rate plan , Orange is selling the iPhone 3G 8GB / 16GB for 759/859 Swiss Francs ( $ 759 / $ 859 US ) .
Orange also includes access to 1,500 WiFi hotspots .
In addition to the service providers ' literal newspaper coverage with advertisements , the papers themselves were reporting extensively on the launch , with 20 Minuten touting its own iPhone app featuring a news reader and a video portal .
The paper also maintained an online section devoted to the iPhone launch for months .
Blick reviewed the new iPhone 3G as being , despite a few flaws ( including its weak 2 megapixel camera , lack of video recording , and inability to forward SMS ) " the best smartphone on the market . "
Too Much of a Good Thing
As reported earlier , the top three Swiss mobile operators have already noted 42,000 iPhones on their networks in the year prior to the official iPhone 3G launch .
Retailers who sold out their initial inventory on the first day expected additional iPhone 3G shipments within the week .
Supplies of the new iPhone appear to be less constrained in the US , but sales and activation delays still resulted in long lines .
Brisk sales of the new iPhone model , along with iPod touch sales being promoted by mobile carriers ( such as the Swiss Sunrise ) that are not selling the iPhone itself , promise to build strong support for Apple 's new mobile App Store platform .
However , the strong surge of demand on launch day has resulted in big problems for both mobile carriers and for Apple .
Mass activations of the new iPhone 2.0 software have temporarily knocked out the company 's iTunes servers , preventing new customers and existing iPhone users from completing their iPhone 2.0 software installations and rushing to iTunes to buy the new mobile apps .

But one of them was a bit familiar to web users ...
( Natural News ) China 's National Disease Authority has confirmed that a man whose 24 - year - old son died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu is also infected with the disease , raising concerns about human transmission of the virus .
H5N1 is a particularly virulent and lethal strain of the influenza virus that primarily infects domestic and wild birds .
So far , it does not spread easily between birds and humans , but health officials fear that it could mutate into a form that is highly contagious from human to human .
Given the intensely lethal nature of the disease , such a strain could easily lead to a global health crisis .
Neither the infected man , identified only by his surname Lu , nor his son were known to have had contact with infected poultry .
Health officials are carrying out an analysis on the DNA of the viruses that infected the two men to determine if they are the same strain , or whether the men contracted the virus from different sources .
A total of 69 people who had come into close contact with Lu's son have been quarantined , but health officials report that none of them have shown signs of the disease .
This suggests that even if the infection did pass to Lu from his son , it is not yet a highly contagious form .
Human - to - human transmission of avian flu has been confirmed in Hong Kong , Indonesia and Vietnam , but these have also not been highly contagious strains , spreading mostly within families whose members came into close contact .
The National Disease Authority said that the World Health Organization , along with the authorities of Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and other governments had been notified of the case .
A total of 27 human cases of bird flu have been confirmed in China , leading to 17 fatalities .
In contrast , the 1918 flu pandemic , which killed between 50 and 100 million people worldwide , had a fatality rate of only 2 percent .

Parents of new twins in Bristol have had no problem telling them apart as one is white and one is black .
It took me a while , but ever since I 've gotten my head around Smart Folders ( and Smart Playlists and Smart Groups , etc. ) , I 've started to think about the way I use my Mac a bit differently .
Clearly iTunes is the winner in this regard ( watch for an upcoming multi- part series about Smart Playlists on The Merlin Show ) , but the Finder , and Address Book , and Mail.app also have an amazing amount of power rumbling under the hood .
So , in the interest of spreading the love , here 's four Mail. app Smart Mailboxes that have been rocking my world over the last months .
Inbox , Flagged
This super - basic mailbox is great for whenever you 're processing your Inbox ( es ) .
You can blow through all the incoming messages , quickly flag anything that needs a response ( CMD - SHIFT-L ) , then view this Smart Mailbox to visually separate the wheat from the chaff .
Select all , move them to your " To Respond " folder , and off you go .
Recently Viewed
How many times do you think , " Oh , crap .
Where 's that message I was looking at last night ? " and then you have to either manually drill down through mailboxes or do a ( notoriously slow ) Mail.app search .
This little guy can quickly bubble all the emails you 've looked at in the last day or two .
I use it all the time .
[ via Red Sweater Blog - Mail Smart Folders ]
Recently Sent
Like the previous Smart Mailbox , this simpleton makes it easy to bubble - up messages that you often need to refer to , but that can be a pain to locate the old - fashioned way .
Just shows you any messages you 've sent to other people in the last couple days .
Yeah , it 's obvious , but , man , will you ever love this once you remember it 's there .
[ also via Red Sweater Blog - Mail Smart Folders ]
From a given Address Book group
In Address Book :
In Mail.app :
A lot of folks do n't realize that Smart Groups even exist in Address Book .
Consequently , even fewer know that the contents of both ad hoc and Smart Groups can be searched on from inside Mail.app .
So in this example , I 've created a Smart Group with everyone in my Address Book who lives in San Francisco , then I tell Mail.app to group all those peoples ' emails in one place .
This is also swell for seeing messages from a company you work with a lot , and it 's fantastic for grouping all the email from people in your family .
These particular kind of mailboxes can often be enhanced by ticking off the " Include messages from Sent " box -- that way you also see your own emails to people in this group , allowing you to view your conversations in threads .
( Note that this is a lot less useful if your own Address Book entry matches the saved criteria :-) )
If you find yourself searching or -- God forbid -- manually hunting for certain kinds of messages again and again , try to think of a way that Mail. app Smart Mailboxes can do the heavy lifting for you .
And , if you add to the mix something like Mail Tags ( which adds several very useful search abilities ) , you can have a lot of automated sexy happening in your email .
Edit : 2007-04-23 11:56:23 : Nomenclature corrected --
As Jean points out in comments , these are properly called " Smart Mailboxes " not " Smart Folders . "
Thanks , Jean !
Check Citigroup share price Citigroup has reported another big loss , although it lost less money than had been expected .
The biggest US bank by assets lost $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) in the three months to the end of June , weighed down by another $ 11.7 bn of write - downs .
Citigroup said it had cut 11,000 jobs in the first six months of the year and planned to continue at the same rate .
The company 's shares rose 7.7 % to close at $ 19.35 , following the smaller - than - expected losses .
It is Citigroup 's third consecutive quarter of losses , following shortfalls of $ 5.11bn and $ 9.83bn .
Credit losses
The losses spring from problems in the credit markets because of uncertainty about the value of mortgage - backed debt issued by US banks .
It has left banks worldwide reluctant to lend money to each other , because they are uncertain about whether the other banks are creditworthy and whether they will need the money themselves .
The credit market turmoil has forced the industry to axe thousands of jobs as it attempts to reduce costs , with more cutbacks expected in the year ahead .
Chief executive Vikram Pandit said : " While there is still much to do , we are encouraged by our progress . "
An element of bad news in the three - month results is that Citigroup 's credit costs have jumped to $ 7.2bn , as more of its own customers are defaulting on their loans .
That means that while the losses from mortgage - backed debt may be slowing , the losses from Citigroup 's own mortgages , car loans and credit cards are growing .
But some analysts believe there could be light at the end of the tunnel .
" While several global or major national banks delivered lousy earnings , the mortgage or credit market related write - offs were n't nearly as bad as expected and appear to be lessening , " said Fred Dickson , an analyst at DA Davidson & Co .

NO cheer squad next year at ANY football , basketball or other sporting event games .
The only form of “ cheer squad ” that will remain is the megaphones and signs .
Which will not be called the cheerleaders , but instead “ Sparky ’s Crew . ”
The photos are reminiscent of the racy pics of the Sacramento Kings Cheerleaders that were plastered all over the internet a few months ago .
The evidence is mounting that top US officials - including President George Bush , vice - president Dick Cheney and former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld - committed war crimes by authorising the use of " enhanced interrogation techniques " - ie torture .
The war crimes drumbeat has accelerated with the recent release of two books : New Yorker writer Jane Mayer 's The Dark Side and Philippe Sands 's Torture Team , which document the executive decision - making that led the US to set aside not just the Geneva Conventions , but a tradition of respect for the human rights of enemy prisoners that dates to back to George Washington 's prohibition on harming POWs .
Current and former Bush officials are now scrambling to avoid the opprobrium - not to mention the risk of prison time - that would result from criminal prosecution .
This week , Capitol Hill was treated to the spectacle of Sands and Douglas Feith , a former Rumsfeld protege who was an architect of the Iraq invasion , testifying side by side before a House subcommittee .
In an earlier interview with Sands , Feith claimed to be " really a player " in the engineering of legal workarounds to the Geneva Conventions at Guantánamo .
Before the committee , Feith declared his unerring support for Geneva .
The stream of commentary on this topic is waxing as we near the end of the Bush presidency .
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof went his fellow pundits one better , suggesting that what the US needs is a South Africa - style Truth and Reconciliation Commission to sort through not just the legal transgressions of the past eight years , but the political manipulations as well .
Hang on a moment .
There is no way that Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld or the second - and third - tier enablers of torture - the Feiths and John Yoos - will be prosecuted for war crimes in the United States .
The obstacle to prosecutions is the absence of a national consensus on the specific issue of torture , or , more generally , the Bush administration 's actions on terror .
Certainly there is a consensus that the Bush administration has been a disaster and that the Iraq war was a mistake .
But this does n't apply to specific terrorism policies , on which the White House still has more or less a political blank check to do as it pleases .
( Whether a majority of the public supports those policies is debatable , but Republicans still back Bush , and Democrats are still cowed by the risk of appearing soft on the issue . )
See Kevin Drum on why this is not Watergate : a well of political support remains for Bush 's terror policies , " enhanced interrogation " among them .
The matter of criminal culpability lies several steps further on .
Even if they concede that torture is a war crime and buy the practical arguments against it - that it generates false information , endangers US soldiers should they be taken prisoner and is disastrous for America 's image and diplomatic efforts - many Americans would still resist prosecuting officials whose motive was averting terror attacks .
This also goes deeper than politics .
I hate to sound cynical , but Americans do n't have much interest in accountability , truth or reconciliation .
Our national motto is " move on " .
The buzzword of the decade is Stephen Colbert 's " truthiness " .
Trials or commissions on war crimes would force a reckoning that many Americans do n't think is necessary and / or would simply rather not have .
However , those still hoping to see Bush and his associates in the dock might see promise in another feature of American culture : its disposability .
What seems set in stone today , an immutable law of politics , almost certainly wo n't be tomorrow .
What once seemed an issue of high principle to many conservatives - embracing torture and defending Bush & Co - may quickly become passé once Bush leaves office and other issues come to dominate .
The ideal condition for a successful prosecution is not a rising tide of outrage at Bush that would stoke the divisions in US society , but indifference .
Still , the most likely scenario for a torture prosecution is something like what happened to ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
His own country would n't touch him , but an industrious Spanish prosecutor - aided by the work of human rights activists and backed by international opinion - indicted him for torture and war crimes and nearly snared him .
If Bush , Cheney or Rumsfeld faced a similar indictment from abroad , Americans would be outraged - but not really .
The US government would try to head it off , but would n't be able to do much .
No one would actually go on trial , but the indictees would see their travel options humiliatingly curtailed and go to their graves knowing the phrase " charged with war crimes " will be next to their names in the history books .

I 've never hidden my deep and abiding love for Rachel Maddow as a pundit and am so glad for the recognition she 's due .
Armed with facts and wit , she can run circles around all these other talking heads without breaking a sweat .
Maybe that 's why the MSNBC bookers saw fit to match her to four conservatives on Race To The White House : Substitute host Joe Scarborough , Tony Blankley , Michelle Bernard ( who has of late been the omnipresent guest on all MSNBC shows ) , and former Scarborough Country and Hardball producer Noah Oppenheim , now the author of The Intellectual Devotional .
But the taker of the proverbial cake has to be Scarborough , who compensates for his general wrongness of position by a steady stream of snide and dismissive remarks .
In a discussion focused around the media - driven narrative that Barack Obama has flip - flopped in his positions ( they LOVE that word , have you noticed ? ) and is rushing to the center , Rachel is the lone voice from the left pointing out that his rhetoric has not changed radically and that he has always advocated a centrist ( " post- partisan , " I think it was called ) position and Scarborough both sneers at Rachel for pointing this out and cheers Obama for taking a more " responsible " stance .
When poll after poll finds that the majority of Americans think we should get out of Iraq , Scarborough thinks it will reassure Middle America if Obama slows down the withdrawal .
Were I running John McCain…er , were I , were I running Barack Obama ’s campaign , I would tell him to do this .
Because I think this actually reassures Americans , okay this guy said what he needed to say to win the far left in the primary and now as he moves to the general election , he ’s getting more responsible on FISA , he ’s getting more responsible on troop withdrawal .
Does n’t this make middle Americans in Ohio and West Virginia and Pennsylvania like Barack Obama more ?
Yeah , everyone feels much better when we move to the right ... that 's why the GOP brand is suffering so much .
Rachel tries again :
I think the important thing to recognize here is that there 's a difference between taking a centrist position because it's good for the general election and changing his position .
What I 'm saying about this Iraq stuff is not that Barack Obama secretly has a left position on Iraq that nobody else recognizes .
I 'm saying his position on Iraq is very centrist and has been all along and is not changing .
This was the position his campaign was taking through the primaries and we have ascribed a much more liberal policy to him , but when you go back and you look at the tape and you go back and look at the statements from his campaign , all the way back through the spring , all the way back when they were attacking Hillary Clinton for having a plan for withdrawal that was n't subject to conditions on the ground , it shows you that this is where he 's been all along .
You can call it centrist , but it 's still consistent .
And The Scar 's response ?
You might support Obama , but you have the " Clinton cackle " down , Rachel .
Classy to the last , Joe .
Dinner for ONE in Zimbabwe
Although humorous , this Zimbabwean restaurant slip illustrates the harsh reality of a country in a huge mess and with an inflation rate going ballistic .
Nissan gave the GT - R a clearly defined mission : annihilate nearly every other car on the market around a racetrack while providing seating for four , room for two sets of golf clubs and year - round livability , all for the price of a well - optioned Porsche Cayman S. Amazingly , it hits each of those targets , so long as the passengers are all Seacrest - scale and possessed of an uncommon spirit of cooperation .
Image Despite its technical sophistication , the GT - R gives the impression that its builders never dropped their focus on the driving experience .
The 2009 GT - R is heir to Nissan ’s legendary Skyline GT - R , a hopped - up salaryman ’s car that started out as an Asian version of the original Pontiac GTO and grew into a cult icon as a video game superhero .
Even so , Nissan dropped the Skyline name from the GT -R , it says , because the new model is built on its own platform .
That ’s true , but I also suspect that the generic name is a marketing move designed to make people say Nissan with GT - R so that listeners will know just which car is being talked about .
Much has been written about the GT - R ’s outlandish performance , especially at the track .
What I wondered before driving it was whether the tactility , the pure fun of driving , got ironed straight out in the pursuit of low lap times .
For instance , Nissan claims that in turning laps at the Nürburgring course where it did suspension tuning , onboard instrumentation showed that a GT - R driver made fewer steering corrections than the driver of a Porsche 911 Turbo did , and the GT - R was faster to boot .
Fine , but to what end ?
Are n’t precise steering adjustments part of the fun ?
If I want thrills without involvement , I can ride the Superman roller coaster at Six Flags .
Fears that the GT - R might be the second coming of the Mitsubishi 3000 GT VR4  a ’ 90s - era twin - turbo , all - wheel - drive dreadnought that died as bloated as Elvis  should be put to rest .
Yes , the GT - R is a four - seat coupe with a twin - turbo V - 6 and all - wheel - drive .
And it is loaded with treats like a paddle - shifted automated manual gearbox ; an electronically adjustable suspension ; and a choice among three levels of intervention by the electronic stability control .
Who knew ?
The legalization of gay marriage might make Californians happier .
At least that ’s what a new study based on surveys of 350,000 people in nearly 100 countries suggests .
No , the authors are n’t gay activists , nor do they seem to be peddling any particular political agenda .
But in their search to discover which countries are happier than others and why , these scholars -- led by University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart -- have stumbled on one pretty fundamental conclusion about what people want out of life : freedom .
Yes , that ’s right , more or less the same thing you were celebrating Friday by scarfing down hamburgers next to the pool in your brother - in - law ’s backyard .
How exactly , you ask , is gay marriage connected with “ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” ?
It ’s simple .
According to surveys , in developed countries discrimination against women and minorities is actually waning and gays remain the least tolerated “ outgroup ” in society .
They are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine .
In most developed countries , the relative level of their acceptance or rejection is a sensitive indicator of that society ’s overall tolerance toward minorities .
And -- here ’s the takeaway -- social tolerance “ broadens the range of choices available to people , ” thereby enhancing happiness for both the tolerant and the intolerant alike .
Advertisement
Sounds a little too touchy - feely , right ?
Are they saying that Armenians , who were next to last in the study ’s happiness ranking , should immediately allow gays to marry in order to be happier ?
Not exactly .
The researchers have found that freedom of choice is not only a universal aspiration but the single most important basis of human happiness .
But to get to freedom of choice for Armenians , who live in poverty , social tolerance might not beat out economic development on the national “ to - do ” list .
That ’s because first , you have to have enough food to eat .
Of course , economic well - being does n’t just buy food , it also frees people from the lack of life choices that deprivation imposes -- suddenly you ’re on your way up the happiness scale .
But money can only take you so far .
The transition from a subsistence economy to moderate economic security has a profound effect on a nation ’s happiness .
But once a nation gets past the level of , say , Portugal ( No. 47 ) , economic growth begins to produce diminishing returns .
That ’s when , the study ’s authors theorize , humans can afford to try to maximize “ free choice in all the realms of life . ”
Here in the U.S. , we know all about post - materialist politics and the emergence of “ quality of life ” issues .
At this stage , what does a society have to look like in order to create more free choice and more happiness ?
The study indicates that you need democratization and , most important of all , social tolerance .
Advertisement
“ Yes , I know that all this sounds like I ’ve been brainwashed by my third - grade teacher , ” lead researcher Inglehart told me , “ but it turns out it ’s true .
The empirical evidence is clear : Freedom is conducive to happiness . ”
For years , scholars were convinced that a nation ’s level of happiness was constant .
Previous research indicated that neither sudden tragedy nor rising fortunes could alter a nation ’s long - term levels of satisfaction .
Biological studies also have shown the degree to which happiness can be inherited .
But the sheer size of the survey sample in this study , as well as the fact that it was longitudinal -- tracking results for most countries over nearly 20 years -- strongly suggest that the old studies were wrong .
The happiness of a society fluctuates and usually is based on the relative freedom ( including freedom from scarcity ) of its population .
The researchers ’ theories can account for a lot about the rankings that emerged from their work , but not everything .
After all , the big picture might be development , democracy and tolerance , but individual happiness is still pretty subjective , and there are other , more minor factors that determine life satisfaction .
Where did the U.S. come in ?
Sixteenth .
Which country was No. 1 ? Denmark .
One impressive showing came from Latin America , where many of the nations ranked higher than the researchers had expected .
Colombia , for example , came in at No. 3 ; Puerto Rico at No. 2 . In fact , for all the study ’s emphasis on development , democratization and tolerance , Latin America makes even the researchers wonder .
They speculate that happiness in Latin America might have something to do with those societies ’ strong belief in God.
Traditional religion , according to the researchers , is also conducive to happiness .
Advertisement
Which brings us to a modern - day quandary .
Modernity is good because it facilitates development , democracy and freedom of choice ; but so is tradition because it gives us a sense of security , predictability and purpose in our lives .
The study suggests that religious faith and social tolerance are a winning combination .
Which leaves me wondering : Perhaps people in the U.S. would all be happier if more ministers , rabbis , imams and priests conducted more gay marriages .
R.I.P. -- the 4th Amendment & the Rule of Law
R.I.P. -- the 4th Amendment & the Rule of Law
By Kyle Hence
Rumor is circulating that the House leader , Nancy Pelosi , is making a play to put Karl Rove above the law .
Reportedly she is saying he should not be held in contempt for refusing to appear before the House Judiciary Committee .
Although Pelosi ’s office now denies it , many are finding it hard to give the Speaker the benefit of the doubt and for good reason .
She took impeachment off the table to prevent the House from responsibly examining likely impeachable violations , just one of which is the President ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
As illustrated above , there is a disturbing pattern here .
The Rove issue comes shockingly just a week after the Democratic House leadership caved - in to the Executive Branch over the FISA Bill .
In the Bill ’s passage today in the Senate the Executive Office gets what it wants , and the telecom companies get what they want ¬a get - out - of - jail free card for a massive , still secret surveillance program operating without warrants or oversight for years in order to spy indiscriminately on the phone , fax , and email communications of millions of Americans .
By passing this Bill , the telecoms gain effective immunity from civil prosecutions over their participation in NSA warrant - less wiretapping directed by the Bush Administration .
Some 40 lawsuits , some of them class - actions representing millions of Americans , will be dismissed by District judges as a result of this legislation .
To get off the hook , the companies need only produce written evidence of a “ directive ” ( rule by fiat ) by the White House affirming the program ’s legality , thus ignoring and forgiving the actual violations of the law , and precluding further litigation and investigation .
( see EFF lawsuit – Hepting vs. AT&T )
Bottom line on the FISA vote today : the Democratic leadership and a minority of Democratic members in both the House and the Senate aligned with the Republicans have , by their votes on the FISA Bill , declared that the telecom companies and the Executive Office are above the law .
The Bill also makes legal wiretapping of any and all Americans who communicate with friends or family overseas without being required to prove suspicion or just cause , without a warrant .
Big brother is now sanctified and codified in the passage of this Bill .
Hyperbole you say ?
Well , just ask AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , who witnessed the installation of secret NSA controlled rooms at his AT&T facility .
http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/06/att-whistleblow.html
This is a prescription for lawlessness in our country , a prescription , shockingly , written by our own Congress .
This is systematic , dissembling of the Constitution .
This is violation of the American system of checks and balances .
This is the death of a Republic in slow motion .
This is usurpation of Constitutional rule of law by Presidential Directive .
And by a compliant and complicit Congress and its members who failed to uphold their oath of office .
As Republican Senator Specter said on the floor in arguing for his amendment , “ History will look back on this period of history as one of unprecedented expansion of Executive authority , unchecked expansion of authority . ”
Exhorting his colleagues Specter said “ perhaps after the July 4th holiday , Congress will declare its independence from the Executive branch . ”
It did n’t happen .
How did all this come to pass ?
The simple answer : the dangerous merging of corporate and Executive power and a lack of courage in the face of the politics of fear .
The passage of this Bill was preceded by millions of lobbying dollars pouring into Washington , D.C. and corporate contributions to members of Congress , including a spike in telecom donations to the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Jay Rockefeller .
The lobbying dollars has now insured legal protection of a massive secret spying program accountable to no one but the President .
And it has revealed a dangerous even treasonous liaison between unbridled , unchecked executive power and private corporate power that has led to gross violations of the rule of law and U.S. Constitution .
This my friends , my fellow Americans , herald a rising Fascism , a merging of corporate and government power , that is now rising up in place of a dying Constitutional Republic , all delivered to the American people by the almighty corporate dollar and those elected to office who by their vote today have utterly and completely betrayed .
We are witnesses , here and now , with the passage of this Bill , to the arrival of dangerous merging of narrow unchecked corporate interest and those of an equally unchecked Executive Office that Congress has utter failed to hold to account , as is their sacred duty under the Constitution .
We each are witness now to a de- facto coup by Executive fiat , rule by directives irrespective of the law or Constitution , all veiled by secrecy and to which all dissent is overcome by instilling fear .
It marks the death of the Republic unless we act now to tie off the autocratic fear - feeding cancer that afflicts our nation .
Make no mistake about what happened on the floor of the Senate today .
With the passing of this FISA Bill the Congress is capitulating , lock , stock and barrel , to the merging of the interests of an unaccountable secret dictatorial Executive governing by “ Directive ” with the interests of the corporations that feed at the massive and growing private contracting trough .
A few score of corporations now gobble up so much of the Federal budget that fully 70 % of the intelligence budget is now outsourced to private contractors such as AT&T .
http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/01/intel_contractors
This is the same AT&T that received a get out of jail card today , despite the fact that it violated laws on the books , by piping their communications network straight into secret rooms controlled by NSA .
Whereas Qwest refused based on a clear understanding of FISA law , and was cut out of pending government contracts , AT&T continues to take government money to spy illegally on Americans since there can be no verification the NSA has shut its secret rooms or ceased its massively trolling of the private communications of innocent Americans .
Thanks to a minority of Democrats , the spinelessness of a Democratic nominee to back up his rhetoric with real leadership , the majority of the Republicans and the Executive Office has yet again employed the post 9/11 fear card to induce a tragic capitulation and betrayal of the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law .
“ When laws ends , tyranny begins . ”
These are not the words of a enraged radical leftist , no , these are the words of former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher , just quoted minutes ago by Senator Dodd in his closing arguments before this unconstitutional Bill was passed into law , and our country turned brazenly and openly to Corporatism and rule by Executive fiat .
There is no time for despair in the face of this treason so let us hope , pray and most importantly act so that this travesty , this trespass on our rights is not left unchecked and uncorrected by those of us who still believe in the sanctity of the Constitution and Freedom granted each us by our Creator , and who are courageous enough to stand up and defend it .

A letter from Evan Cutler – Girdwood , Alaska , District 32 Delegate for Ron Paul
Here in Alaska we grew a group of delegates after our primaries into the Alaska Ron Paul Delegates meetup .
In that group we pulled together about 70 of our 110 or so Ron Paul delegates in order to work and communicate together for the seven weeks before the state convention .
We did one project that I think bears replication , both for states with pending State Conventions , but also , and most importantly , on a national level , before the St. Paul Convention .
First , we realized that mainstream media had been almost completely ignoring Dr. Paul .
According to my own study , which I can provide to Nolan Chart , of the 2,188 mainstream media stories about presidential candidates between January 14th and February 10th , only 4 were about Dr. Ron Paul .
Contrast that to :
756 stories about Hillary Clinton
760 stories about Barack Obama
674 stories about about John McCain
424 stories about Mitt Romney
281 stories about Mike Huckebee
While we set the world record for single day campaign contributions the month before , our candidate was virtually ignored just one month later !
So , what could we do ?
We decided to send our own media , in the form of a DVD , to every single registered delegate and alternate in Alaska before the state convention , on the grounds that at least they could have a chance to learn who Dr. Paul was .
This would help counter that “ fringe ” candidate label the media was applying to Dr. Paul .
And it worked !
Not as well as we might have liked , but very well indeed .
We found a lot more support at the convention as most the delegates who watched it never before had the opportunity to learn about Dr. Paul before , and many found they were far more in agreement with Dr. Paul , than with John McCain .
I believe we could improve on what we did here in Alaska .
We have five months .
With the proper support , we could manage a campaign that sends a DVD each month for four months to the national delegates and alternates going to St. Paul .
It is far less expensive to have a directed campaign toward 6,900 delegates and alternates , than it is to reach 150 million voters .
I 'm willing to help , but not to run this project alone–or at least not run it alone without income ; I organized our own project in my spare time , which became none existent for the two weeks it took to make it happen .
You can view ( and even get your own copy of ) our effort here :
[ link edited for length ]
Replicating ( and Improving ) this DVD Project on a National Scale
I 'm already finding there is interest among other organizers to help make this happen on a national scale !
When I suggested the larger scale project to a national Ron Paul Organizers meetup , I was immediately contacted by organizers from North Carolina , South Carolina , and Colorado who also liked the idea .
Two of these organizers are planning similar projects now in their states .
My model imagines a series of four DVD's , one sent each month , to each National Delegate and Alternate we can identify .
As we get closer to September , more and more will be chosen and identified , so the mailings will get successively larger .
This means the most important DVD will be the last one .
We will find a way to allow each state to know their prorated share of manufacturing cost , and use a chip in to pay for it together .
This will allow very professional manufacturing at the lowest cost per unit .
Then , we will drop ship each DVD as it is ready , to the Ron Paul organizers in each state , who will use their meetups to address and stuff the envelopes to the national delegates in their states .
Handwritten addresses and colorful postage stamps of super heroes will get people to open these envelopes .
The DVD cover information will get people to place the DVDs in their players .
The content will draw them in and make them thirst to learn more .
What they learn will help make them our allies at the convention , so there is no such thing as “ US versus Them . ”
Ron Paul Delegates and Activists in every state will call their respective non Ron Paul delegates and make sure they received their DVDs .
We have an advantage in this campaign on a national level , as compared to what already worked in Alaska .
We have more time to prepare each video , and to allow people to watch and reflect upon each one .
We did pretty well with just a couple weeks lead time on the Alaska Delegate DVD Project .
Now we have more weeks of prep time just till the first mailing , then a month more for each successive mailing .
One of the challenges will be to invent that content .
As a group , Alaskan delegates did a great job on choosing content for the Alaska DVD , and there is no time like the present to start brainstorming what will go in the series envisioned .
Would you please help me brainstorm a strategic outline of content for this video series ?
Let 's include the best of the best material we all know of .
I will assemble and present brainstorms to the national Ron Paul Organizer and Activists communities for further feedback , and try to settle on a final syllabus all can appreciate .
The purpose here is to educate delegates to the national convention on the most important issues that need to be addressed by the Republican Party .
Choosing Ron Paul is of course , our top priority , but there is so much more to share !
Remember , we can use these DVD's to propose and explain and advocate for resolutions we will bring to the floor ( or try to ) , so that even regardless of the presidential nominee , the party platform changes .
Some of us retain hope in our hearts and the will to prepare for success .
Perhaps to others , we look like Rocky Balboa on the verge of passing out in his first heavy weight fight .
But no one knows our real strength comes from the righteousness of our cause .
What we seek is not only reasonable , but in every freedom loving American 's interest .
The project lets us stop complaining about the media , because we are producing media instead .
Think of this opportunity to educate the national leaders of the Republican Party .
Already there is national support for this project .
I need all of you who are interested to join in .
If any more of you want to help , please let me know , share your ideas , and let 's once again show America what happens when Ron Paul supporters band together to share a dream .
This week , I will start a national website dedicated to organizing this project .
Send me an email at EvanAlaska@aol.com with “ Join National DVD Project ” in the subject and I will be sure to invite you to collaborate with us .
If you have content suggestions , links , permissions to use content , please type “ DVD Content Suggestions ” in the subject line .

Need to know the type of an object ?
Let me make a brief argument :
No , you do n't .
Just use the object as if it was whatever you expect it to be , and handle any errors that result .
On the other hand , type - checking is convenient , easy to implement , and can save your life when debugging .
Sometimes there is n't an obvious other way to attack a problem .
( Look for one first though .
Really . )
You have a few choices on how to type - check : the built - in functions type and isinstance and the instance property __class__ .
To compare the object to known classes , you can compare to the class directly or import the ' types ' module ( safe to do in your global scope ) to get access to some types that do n't provide user - accessible classes ( like functions ) .
Before we start , note that Python has two types of classes : ' new - style ' classes which inherit from the object class , and ' old - style ' classes which do n't .
Most ( all ? ) native Python types are now new - style classes , but classes you 've created probably are n't .
Let 's try some experiments , trying to print out the name of a class , and then comparing the type to a known class .
Say we have the following classes and instances defined :
# 's 1 from types import *
2
3 # Instances of new - style classes
4 class NewClass ( object ) : pass
5
6 new_class_instance = NewClass ()
7
8 def function ( ) : pass
9
10 string = ' This is a string ! '
11
12 # Instances of old - style classes
13 class OldClass : pass
14
15 old_class_instance = OldClass ()
Let 's print out the name of the class using type and __class__ .
There 's no way to do this with isinstance .:
# 's 1 print type ( new_class_instance )
2 print new_class_instance .
__class__
3 # both print " < class ' __main__.new_class ' > "
4
5 print type ( function )
6 print function .
__class__
7 # both print " < type ' function ' > "
8
9 print type ( string )
10 print string .
__class__
11 # both print " < type ' str ' > "
12
13 print type ( old_class )
14 # prints " < type ' instance ' > "
15
16 print old_class .
__class__
17 # prints something like " class __main__ .
OldClass at 0x00F7 F "
18 # Note that this is different than what was printed by type ( )
It looks like type does n't work for old - style classes .
Now let 's try checking against a known class or type , using type , isinstance , and __class__ :
# 's 1 type ( new_class_instance ) == NewClass
2 isinstance ( new_class_instance , NewClass )
3 new_class_instance .
__class__ == NewClass
4 # All return True
5
6 type ( function ) == Function Type # from ' types ' module
7 isinstance ( function , FunctionType )
8 function .
__class__ == FunctionType
9 # All return True
10
11 type ( string ) == str # we could also use StringType from ' types ' module
12 isinstance ( string , str )
13 string .
__class__ == str
14 # All return True
15
16 type ( old_class_instance ) == OldClass
17 # Returns False , even though old_class_instance is an instance of OldClass .
18 # ' type ' just can't understand these .
19
20 isinstance ( old_class_instance , OldClass )
21 old_class_instance .
__class__ == OldClass
22 # Both return
True as expected
Apparently , type is completely useless for both type printing and type comparisons , as it can't understand old - style classes while __class__ can .
__class__ is messy , but is the only method that both works for both types of classes and will print out the name of the class if desired .
It is the best choice for debugging , when you have no idea what type of object you 're looking at .
isinstance also works on all objects .
It also has another couple of perks : it actually checks to see if your object is an instance of a class or subclass of the class you pass it .
Generally if you 're type - checking you 're interested in the existence of a behavior or method , and all subclasses of the target class will probably have it .
So , isinstance is more accurate .
Additionally , you can pass it a tuple of classes , and it will check against all of them .
These perks make it the best choice for legitimate type - checking in a real program .
Here 's a summary of what we found :
July 24 , 2008 -- Researchers have tested gummy bears made with a sugar substitute that wards off cavity - causing bacteria .
A study in Washington State gathered 154 first to fifth graders from two elementary schools .
The students were given four gummy bears made with either xylitol or maltitol ( types of sugars used in many types of sugarless chewing gum ) three times a day during school hours .
All were checked for plaque and bacteria in their mouths at the start of the study and six weeks later .
After six weeks , there was a " significant " reduction in the main bacteria buildup associated with cavities for the children who snacked on the xylitol and maltitol candy .
Study lead author Kiet A . Ly with the University of Washington says in a news release that gummy bears may have the edge over gum .
" For xylitol to be successfully used in oral health promotion programs among primary school children , an effective means of delivering xylitol must be identified , " Ly says .
" Gummy bears would seem to be more ideal than chewing gum . "
The gummy bears made with xylitol used in the study are not available on the U.S. market at this time .
Study authors now urge a large clinical trial .
In background information published with the findings , study authors write that chewing gum made with these sugars are widely available in Europe , China , and Japan .
Finland has a national campaign in place called " Smart Habits " for children , which uses xylitol products to reduce tooth decay .
The findings are published in the journal BMC Oral Health .

“ You already know the answer to these questions .
It ’s all right there .
Just examine every episode closely and the truth will emerge .
Or break out a magnifying glass and go over that Last Supper photo one more time .

The Revelation by N.E. Lilly
I ’ve only become recently bound up in the knotty problem of the Battlestar Galactica “ Last Supper ” image .
As a designer , the image seemed staged .
People were n’t just standing there , acting their parts — they were placed ; from the positions of the groupings to the unnatural positions that they were holding .
Not just the people , but certain items on the table as well .
The image reminded me , on a sub- conscious level , of a Highlight Magazine picture search , a MAD Magazine fold - in , and a Da Vinci Code style hidden image all rolled into one .
MAD Magazine Fold-in
Here is a sample MAD Magazine fold in .
It ’s a very popular feature for the magazine ...
... because , by folding points A and B together , you come up with a new image , with an altogether different meaning :
Da Vinci’s The Last Supper
Here is Da Vinci’s
The Last Supper , which is also reported to contain hidden images :
Something that caused quite a stir is the discovery that if you flip the image , and make one image transparent over the other ( and align the two images to have the same single point of perspective ) then you see what looks like a woman holding a child standing near Christ .
Another interesting feature is the figure , next to Christ , leaning away from him .
By moving that person to the right of Christ to his left , you can see that it seems that the figure was intended to be there , almost as a part of a loving couple .
One final interesting feature of the image is something that ’s missing from Da Vinci ’s The Last Supper .
Despite the fact that this is a painting of the last supper , the Holy Grail ( the vessel that contained the blood of Christ ) is missing .
It was speculated ( using the aforementioned irregularities in the painting ) that the vessel of Christ ’s blood was in fact , his child , whom he had with Mary Magdalene .
Whether or not you believe this is true , these are the elements that lead us to the hidden clues in the Battlestar Galactica image , which I ’ve begun to call The Last Cylon .
Battlestar Galactica : The Last Cylon
Someone is indeed absent from the table , admits Moore : “ We have not yet revealed the final [ unknown ] Cylon . ”
Does that mean the people already at the table are n’t the final cylon ?
Moore laughs .
“ You ferreted that out pretty slyly .
I did n’t really want to give that away . ” — Entertainment Weekly
Entertainment Weekly did an excellent job of highlighting the different elements in the image , and what significance they hold in the series .
First I approached the image from the aspect of a MAD Magazine fold - in .
Dividing the image into quarters , and folding along those lines produces a striking image — but it felt incomplete .
That ’s when I turned to analyzing it in a similar fashion to Da Vinci ’s The Last Supper .
As mentioned before , the configuration of the figures troubled me .
What also troubled me was the fact that the two glasses were exactly on the same line .
It seemed too unusual — especially when you take into consideration the two glasses of water on the table , which , all too conveniently could form registration points for a fold - in image .
The rest follows from artist intuition .
The two glasses were the same shape , on the same line , and transparent .
I proceeded to lay one glass over the other and set the one layer to roughly the same percentage as one glass is less than the other .
And my heart jumped at the image that was produced .
The majority of the image was a jumble of imformation , but the center of the image produced a clear result :
The relation between Kara and Lee and between Tyrol and Baltar is too good of a fit to be coincidental .
It places Kara squarely in front of the grail .
The image still felt incomplete , however .
I then struck upon the idea of trying to merge the two images .
That produced a much more complete composition .
At the end of what I felt that I could conceivably accomplish .
It seemed that if there were secrets buried deeper in the image than I could divine .
I stumbled across a major revelation , but not having watched the show as religiously as I could have , I contacted the good people at Galactica Sitrep .
ProgGrrl did n’t want to be potentially exposed to spoilers , so her counterpart Logan Gawain stepped in .
After doing some research and reading in the Entertainment Weekly article the very coy answer about the grail ( note that Moore does n’t simply say “ no ” ) , I felt that Kara should be the last Cylon .
I ’m sure that there are still more mysteries waiting to be uncovered , but this , I believe is the primary one .
Images Explained by Logan Gawain
While I firmly believe Nathan has discovered an important key to understanding the BSG Last Supper image , I am not as prepared to conclude any single meaning from it .
Rather , I see multiple interpretations .
But , I do agree that the glasses of water probably are a marker that when lined up reveal something important , perhaps even crucial to understanding any meaning in the photo .
And the perfect alignment of the glass of water and other elements proves to me that either this is the way the image has to fit , or it ’s one amazing and wild coincidence .
Just look at how exactly every element fits rather precisely , as if it ’s meant to fit that way .
For instance , does Chief Tryol ’s position change to now holding the knife at Baltar ’s head foreshadow a final confrontation between the two of them ?
The number Six , known as Natalie who is leading the Cylon rebellion against Cavil ’s faction , in this positioning is now pointing directly at Tyrol .
Does that convey some special meaning , or deeper understanding ?
Do the merging of the two glasses of water themselves represent an important metaphor , or foreshadowing ?
The glass of water by Anders is full .
The glass of water near Baltar is nearly 3/4ths full .
It might mean something in of itself , I just do n’t know what .
Kara , Lee , Anders : Notice how it now appears that Kara is looking at Lee .
In the repositioning Anders sits with his arms around both Lee and Kara almost in a group hug , or family portrait , while he kisses Kara .
Is he , in this image , handing off Kara back to Lee , and letting her go ?
( Kara / Lee ’ shippers take note ! )
Also notice how the book that is in front of Kara , now fits perfectly under the chalice or grail .
What ’s the meaning of relationship between the book , and the grail ?
Yes , Kara sits directly before the grail .
But , that does n’t not have to mean she ’s the final Cylon .
Instead it may in fact mean that she ’s the savior of mankind .
Or it may also mean that the 5th Cylon has a unique relationship to Anders , Kara , and Lee. Still , could Kara Thrace be the final Cylon ?
Maybe she could be .
I want to find more clues in the show itself as the episodes play out , before coming to a conclusion .
Does the First Hybrid ’s prophesy from “ Razor ” provide any clues ?
At last , they ’ve come for me .
I feel their lives , their destinies spilling out before me .
The denial of the one true path , played out on a world not their own , will end soon enough .
Soon there will be four , glorious in awakening , struggling with the knowledge of their true selves , the pain of revelation bringing new clarity , and in the midst of confusion , he will find her .
Enemies brought together by impossible longing , enemies now joined as one .
The way forward at once unthinkable , yet inevitable .
And the fifth , still in shadow , will claw toward the light , hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering .
I can see them all .
The seven , now six , self - described machines who believe themselves without sin , but in time , it is sin that will consume them .
They will know enmity , bitterness , the wrenching agony of the one splintering into the many , and then they will join the promised - land , gathered on the wings of an angel .
Not an end , but a beginning .
—
The Hybrid , Battlestar Galactica : Razor
Clearly , the Hybrid spoke of things we ’ve already seen , such as the occupation of New Caprica , the Four discovering their true nature , and the emerging Cylon civil war .
Other events prophesied remain shrouded in mystery :
What will be the “ unthinkable ” but “ inevitable ” way forward ?
Why is the fifth Cylon still in shadow , “ hungering for redemption ” ?
And who , or what , would be considered “ wings of an angel ” that will gather everyone at the “ promised land ” ?
In “ Maelstrom ” Starbuck gave to Adama the figure of Aurora , the Goddess of the Dawn .
Does Kara ’s positioning next to the challis reaffirm her role as savior , as Aurora , leading the way to their new home ?
Or , is she a false prophet , as as the First Hybrid prophesied to Kendra Shaw in Razor , who will “ lead the human race to it ’s end .
She is the herald of the apocalypse .
The harbinger of death .
They must not follow her . ”
I agree that this photographic discovery is an important find , and will add to the lore around the Last Supper image .
But , it ’s too early to draw any one conclusion to solve all the deep mysteries and mythology involved .
I ’m sure more is to be discovered before all is revealed .
But , this new insight opens up many new avenues to explore .
Final Word
This is an open article .
These might not be the final ( or even correct ) answers , but hopefully , at the very least , this article will take the analysis of The Last Cylon image to a whole new level .
If anyone has further discoveries that may have been missed , then please , feel free to contact me and your contribution will be added .

“ To see a world in a grain of sandâ€ ¦ ” â€ “ English Poet William Blake
The Phoenix science team tested out the lander ’s Optical Microscope by imaging grains of sand and dust particles , some as small as one - tenth the diameter of a human hair .
These are the highest resolution image ever of small soil particles from another planet .
“ We have images showing the diversity of mineralogy on Mars at a scale that is unprecedented in planetary exploration , ” said Michael Hecht of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The microscope observed particles that had fallen onto an exposed surface of the lander .
“ It ’s a first quick look , ” Hecht said .
“ This experiment was partly an insurance policy for something to observe with the microscope before getting a soil sample delivered by the arm , and partly a characterization of the Optical Microscope .
All the tools are working well . ”
However , some of the particles may be “ alien ” â€ “ that is , they might have come from inside the spacecraft when Phoenix dropped to Mars surface at landing .
But at first glance , many of these grains match expectations for Martian particles .
“ We will be using future observations of soil samples delivered by the Robotic Arm to confirm whether the types of particles in this dustfall sample are also seen in samples we can be certain are Martian in origin , ” Hecht said .
The particles show a range of shapes and colors .
“ You can see the amount of variety there is in what appears otherwise to be just reddish brown soil , ” said Tom Pike , Phoenix science team member from Imperial College London .
He noted that one translucent particle resembles a grain of salt , but that it is too early to say for sure .
Meanwhile , Phoenix received commands
Thursday to collect its first soil sample to be delivered to its science lab instrument on the lander deck .
Those commands were originally sent on Wednesday , but the lander did n’t receive them as the relay for the commands , the Mars Odyssey , had gone into safe mode .
The orbiter may have been hit by a cosmic ray , and engineers from JPL say nominal operations of the spacecraft should return by the end of the week .
This type of event has occurred a couple of times in the Odyssey mission , and engineers do n’t appear overly concerned about the situation .
So , the commands were successfully re-sent via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Look for the first science results from Phoenix within the next day or so .

Me , but partly because despite my problems with GH3 it had more music that I liked compared to Rock Band ( although the DLC definitely alleviated that problem with RB ) and based on what we know now the bands appeal to me a little more .
Hopefully with regards to SoaD it 's something from their first album .

After the first forty minutes of last night 's Democratic debate , it was clear we were watching something historic .
Not historic in a good way , mind you , but historic in the sense of being something so deeply embarrassing to the nation that it will be pointed to , in future books and documentary works , as a prime example of the collapse of the American media into utter and complete substanceless , into self - celebrated vapidity , and into a now - complete inability or unwillingness to cover the most important affairs of the nation to any but the most shallow of depths .
Congratulations are clearly in order .
ABC had two hours of access to two of the three remaining candidates vying to lead the most powerful nation in the world , and spent the decided majority of that time mining what the press considers the true issues facing the republic .
Bittergate ; Rev. Wright ; Bosnia ; American flag lapel pins .
That 's what 's important to the future of the country .
What a contrast .
Only a few weeks ago , we were presented with what was considered by many to be a historic speech by a presidential candidate on race in America -- historic for its substance , tone , delivery , and stark candor .
Last night , we had an opposing , equally historic example -- and I sincerely mean that , I consider it to be every bit as significant as that word implies -- of the collapse of the political press into self - willed incompetence .
You might as well pull any half - intelligent person off the street , and they would unquestionably have more difficult and significant questions for the two candidates .
It was not merely a momentarily bad performance , by ABC , it was a debate explicitly designed to be what it was , which is far more telling .
It is certainly true that a case could be made that the moderators explicitly set out to frame even the supposedly " substantive " questions according to GOP designs .
The implicit presumption of success in Iraq when , nearly an hour into the debate , the moderators finally deigned to mention the defining current event of this campaign .
Gibson , as moderator , lied outright about the supposed effects of capital gains tax cuts , and dogged the candidates over it to a greater extent than any other economic issue : does he really believe that of all the economic challenges facing this nation , the most pressing of them is supplication towards a decade - long Republican bugaboo ?
Gun control ?
Affirmative action ?
These are the issues that are most compellingly on the minds of Democratic primary voters , in 2008 ?
Or were the questions taken from a 1992 time capsule , insightful probes gathering dust for a decade and a half until they could find network moderators desperate enough to dig them up again ?
But even slanted questions could be forgiven , of the press ; what was more inexplicable was the intentional wallowing in substanceless , meaningless " gaffe " politics .
It says something truly impressive about the press that a few statements by a presidential candidate 's preacher bear far more weight to the future of our nation than the challenges of terrorism or war .
It is truly a celebration of our own national collapse into idiocracy that we can furrow our brows and question the patriotism of a candidate , deeply probe their patriotism based on whether or not they regularly don a made - in - China American flag pin , but a substantive discussion of energy policy , or healthcare , or the deficit , or the housing crisis , or global climate change , or the government approval of torture , or trade issues , or the plight of one - industry small American towns , or the fight over domestic espionage and FISA , or the makeup of the Supreme Court -- those were of no significance , in comparison .
If a media organization set out to intentionally demonstrate themselves to be self absorbed and ignorant , they could not have accomplished it better .
It was not just a tabloid debate , but the tittering of political kindergardeners making and lobbing mud pies .
It was politics as game show .
The moderators demonstrated that to them and their supposed " news " organization , the presidency of the United States of America is about the trivialities of_politics_ , which were obsessed over ravenously , not about the challenges of American governance , which were fully ignored .
Certainly , as mere citizens we could ask little of the network that unapologetically brought us The Path to 9/11 , a fabricated conservative pseudo - documentary laying the blame for terrorism at the feet of everyone loathed by the far right .
But it is not simply ABC that bears the blame : surely , one could expect similar drivel from any of the other networks or cable channels who have so successfully and self - importantly dimmed the national discourse , these past ten years .
For his part , the chairman of the written intellectual wisp , the New York Times ' David Brooks , marveled at the " excellent " questions :
We may not like it , but issues like Jeremiah Wright , flag lapels and the Tuzla airport will be important in the fall .
Remember how George H.W. Bush toured flag factories to expose Michael Dukakis .
It ’s legitimate to see how the candidates will respond to these sorts of symbolic issues .
Indeed , how dare his peon readers whine about these things : this is how the political game is expected to be played by the grand masters of our discourse .
Symbolic tours of flag factories !
Checkmate !
That is the elite idea of " issues " in our national debate .
Piss on the war , and screw the economy -- somebody find a goddamn flag factory to tour !
That is how our most elite media figures like to see political opponents " exposed " as ... well , what exactly ?
What does touring a flag factory prove , other than the media in this country is so astonishingly gullible , tin-headed and shallow that you can actually tour a damn flag factory and get praised for it by our idiot press as being a bold , disarming move against your opponent ?
Truly , we have become a nation led by the most lazy and ignorant .
It seems impossible to mock or satirize just how shallowly the media considers the actual world ramifications of each election , how glancingly they explore the actual truth behind political assertion or rhetoric , or how gleefully they molest our discourse while praising themselves for those selfsame acts .
And that , in turn , is precisely how we elected our current Idiot Boy King , a man who has the eloquent demeanor of a month - old Christmas tree and the nuance of a Saturday morning cartoon .
It seems impossible , but we may yet have an election season in which we can be in a slogging , five - year - long war , and mention the fact only in glancing asides .
We may yet have a series of Republican - Democratic debates in which the most pressing issues of the economy are entirely ignored , so that we can more adequately explore the " patriotism " of the candidates as expressed by their clothing .
We may have yet another campaign season carefully orchestrated to leave all but the most glancing and hollow of themes untouched , while our press achieves multiple orgasms at every botched line , every refused cup of coffee , every peddled character assassination or character assassination - by - proxy peddled by the sleaziest of paid dregs .
A campaign , in other words , perfectly suited to the bereft , rudderless , and substanceless self - pronounced guardians of our democracy .
Perhaps , if nothing else , it is time to take back the debate process and insist once again on moderators chosen for competence , expertise and neutrality , rather than network or cable network fame .
The elites of our press have managed to botch the task time and time again ; perhaps it should be left to someone with an actual interest in doing the job .
The Pirate Bay has announced that it will file a complaint to ask for compensation from the IFPI for the traffic which was destined for its site , but blocked by the Danish ISP Tele2 .
If they win , the money will be spent on funding independent artists who share their music for free on filesharing sites .
In February , a Danish court ordered the ISP “ Tele2â €³ to block its customers from accessing The Pirate Bay .
The decision , which is currently under appeal , once again heated the debate on ISPs Internet filtering .
The court case was initiated by the IFPI – the infamous anti-piracy organization that represents the recording industry .
The IFPI later tried to use the “ landmark decision ” to force Swedish ISPs to do the same , but failed .
In fact , it seems that filtering traffic to The Pirate Bay is actually illegal according to European law .
Pirate Bay ’s Brokep told TorrentFreak that they will file a complaint , and ask for compensation for the time they were blocked in Denmark .
The Pirate Bay already fought back by launching The Jesper Bay , giving affected customers detailed instructions on how to regain access to The Pirate Bay .
However , they think that it is only fair to ask compensation for the inconvenience the IFPI block has cost .
The money , which will be managed by the Danish Piratgruppen , could be used to fund Danish artists who want to share their music , according to Brokep , who assured us that they will only ask for a reasonable amount of money , unlike the IFPI .
“ The grant will give out money to Danish aspiring artists for making music and releasing it for free .
And all will be sponsored by IFPI since they tried to fuck those people over .
Poetic justice . ”
Strangely enough , The Pirate Bay was never heard in the IFPI vs. Tele2 case .
“ Nobody ever asked us what we think about the block , although it does affect only us and we ’re the reason for the lawsuit , ” brokep said .
This is not the first time The Pirate Bay has fought fire with fire , last year they took legal action against 10 major media companies , including Paramount Home Entertainment , Twentieth Century Fox and Universal Music Group , for using MediaDefender to sabotage their BitTorrent tracker .
( Updates Fox News comment in final paragraph )
NEW YORK , July 23 ( Reuters ) - Protesters gathered on Wednesday outside Fox News Channel to denounce what they claim is its racist campaign coverage , including a pundit who called Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama a terrorist .
The crowd of some 150 people wielded a petition with more than 600,000 signatures objecting to news coverage by Fox , owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp NWSa.N , organizers said .
Some demonstrators held signs that crossed out the network ’s “ Fair and Balanced ” slogan and replaced it with the words “ Fairly Racist ! ”
Led by activist groups MoveOn.org and ColorOfChange.org , protesters cited incidents on Fox including an on - screen graphic calling Michelle Obama “ Obama ’s baby mama ” and a pundit who confused Obama with Osama bin Laden and joked they should both be assassinated .
Another anchor called a televised fist bump between Obama and his wife a “ terrorist fist jab , ” they said , and talk show host Bill O’Reilly discussed calling a “ lynching party ” to deal with Michelle Obama after criticizing her patriotism .
“ Putting racism on national television and calling it news is never funny , ” said Andre Banks of ColorOfChange .
Joining the protest was hip hop star Nas , who said the Fox coverage inspired a song “ Sly Fox ” on his new album .
“ Fox poisons this country every time they air racist propaganda and try and call it news , ” he said .
A spokeswoman for Fox said : “ Fox News believes in all protesters exercising their right to free speech , including Nas , who has an album to promote . ”
Blackwater Worldwide may have misrepresented its size to obtain small business contracts , the House oversight committee announced on Monday .
The finding is the result of an investigation by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) , and it 's just the first of three reviews of the controversial security contractor requested by Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
Unlike a number of investigations by the FBI and the committee itself that have focused on the conduct of Blackwater 's guards in Iraq and Afghanistan -- for instance , the allegedly unprovoked shooting of Iraqi civilians -- Waxman appears to be taking a new tack : scrutinizing the contractor 's employment practices to make it ineligible for future federal contracts .
In March , Rep. Waxman contacted the SBA , Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and Department of Labor ( DOL ) to ask each agency to conduct a review of Blackwater 's compliance with federal employment laws .
The first to report its findings ( PDF ) , the SBA inspector general , determined that Blackwater and its affiliates may have obtained more than $ 100 million in contracts set aside for small businesses , in spite of receiving more than a billion dollars in federal contracts since 2002 .
As Waxman explained in a memo ( PDF ) accompanying the launch of the three investigations , they each hinge on Blackwater 's self - classification of its workers as contractors rather than employees .
Waxman argues that classifying security personnel as contractors has allowed Blackwater to apply for small business contracts for which it was n't eligible , underpay income taxes and workers benefits , and avoid complying with DOL anti-discrimination requirements for federal contractors .
Blackwater has argued that it recruits and trains workers but relinquishes management and oversight to its clients .
" After being deployed , Blackwater has little if any knowledge regarding the location or activities of these independent contractors .
Blackwater 's only real involvement is to pay the independent contractors , " Blackwater President Gary Jackson said in an October 2006 affidavit for the small business application .
Waxman has countered Blackwater 's claims by pointing to statements by Erik Prince -- including in televised interviews ( 5:02 - 5:21 ) and congressional testimony ( PDF ) -- in which Blackwater 's CEO says that his company maintains tight control over its personnel .
Waxman also referred to the company 's legal defense in a civil suit brought against it by the estates of four Blackwater guards killed in Fallujah .
The company argued that because the four dead guards were employees , rather than contractors , the company 's liabilities were limited to the provisions in the Defense Base Act .
" When the issue is whether Blackwater can be held liable for the wrongful death of Blackwater guards , Blackwater argues that the guards are ' employees , ' " Waxman wrote ( PDF ) in the March memo .
" But when the issue is whether Blackwater must pay or withhold ... taxes for the guards [ or if it 's ] eligible for small business preferences in contracting ... Blackwater calls these same guards ' independent contractors . ' "
In response to Waxman 's memo , Blackwater called the charges baseless .
" Chairman Waxman 's allegations regarding Blackwater 's employment practices are completely without merit .
Blackwater 's classification of its personnel is accurate , and Blackwater has always been forthcoming about this aspect of its business with its customer , the U.S. government , " the company said in a statement .
So far , Waxman 's strategy seems to be working .
The SBA IG report states that the security contractor 's small business applications " could have involved potential misrepresentations by Blackwater " -- a charge which , if true , could result in a fine , prison time and suspension from receiving federal contracts .
The SBA IG referred the case against Blackwater to the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs for further investigation , including a determination of possible penalties .
Though the IRS and DOL have n't issued their reports , an earlier IRS ruling unrelated to Waxman 's investigation questioned Blackwater 's employment classification .
After the SBA report , Blackwater officials reiterated their belief in the accuracy of their worker classifications and pointed to the complexity of these rules .
In a statement , the company said , " If after fair and complete examination of the facts , the appropriate authorities have alternate recommendations about our worker classification , we are open to considering other options so long as we can continue to serve our government clients in the best way possible . "
George Washington was so essential to the founding of our country that historians have called him " the indispensable man . "
His courage , leadership , and deep convictions about freedom , honor , and self - government sustained a revolution that seemed on the verge of failure more often than not .

A MUM has been told to stay away from a mall so the child sex pervert who abused her daughter is free to do his weekend shopping there .
James Bryson - who had charges of raping the five - year - old dropped when he pleaded guilty to other horrifying sex attacks on her - was freed on Thursday .
The girl 's mum was horrified to find he was moving near her family and social workers had agreed he could have " shopping access " to her local centre at weekends .
Last night , the furious mum said she had been told Bryson , who served 40 months of an five - year sentence , had to have his human rights protected .
The woman , who can not be named to protect the identity of her daughter , now 10 , said : " It 's bad enough he 's out .
" But then I found out he was living just five minutes away from us .
" And I was told his conditions allowed him to use the local shops at weekends so I was advised not to go there or I risked meeting him .
" It 's a horrific situation for us and makes me feel sick .
" The social worker who came to my house said it was to do with his human rights .
I could n't believe what I was hearing . "
Former pub bouncer Bryson , 31 , originally from Possil , Glasgow , was released from high - security Peterhead Prison this week .
He was originally charged with raping the five - year - old on " various occasions " between January and June 2004 .
At the High Court in Edinburgh in 2005 , he agreed to admit a string of gruesome sex attacks on the girl .
He is meant to be supervised in the community until 2013 .
The mum and her daughter moved from their former home in Glasgow - where the abuse took place - to the city 's Drumchapel area to escape the memories of the abuse .
But the 26 - year - old mum has been told Bryson is now living with family in Clydebank , five minutes away , where she gets her groceries at the giant Clyde Shopping Centre complex .
She said : " He ruined our lives and my daughter still has nightmares .
We thought we would move to get away from it all only to be told he was moving in close by .
" He is banned from Clydebank shops during the week but is allowed to use them at weekends .
" I use those shops and the weekend is obviously my main shopping time so we are at an inconvenience in order to suit him .
" We were not happy with him being out of jail so early .
The whole thing stinks .
They said although he is only five minutes away , I am in Glasgow Council area 's while he is in West Dunbartonshire , so there was nothing they could do about it . "
The mum added : " I do n't see why he had to come to Clydebank .
He 's not even from here .
" I use Asda at the centre for my main shop .
I also take my daughter to the cinema on a Saturday for the kids ' club because it 's only s1 .
" I wo n't be able to do that any more .
Running into him is my worst fear .
" The guy from social services told me out of the blue it would n't do me any good speaking to a newspaper about this .
" They said he needed the support of his family and it would make it difficult for him to get back on his feet if all this appeared in the papers .
" They made out he was the victim .
But what about us ? "
A West Dunbartonshire Council spokeswoman said : " The impact on the victim of an offence is always considered when arrangements are being made for an offender 's release .
" This can include alerting a victim to situations where they might inadvertently come across the offender if they did not have that information . "
Apple 's iPhone apps platform , launching on July 11 , could be a big hit .
But if you 're a developer who wants to cash in on it , we hope you 're patient -- or have a hook - up at Apple .
We hear the waiting list to get accepted into Apple 's developer program is six months long .
( That is , to be officially recognized as an iPhone developer , so you can submit your app to Apple for inclusion in the iPhone apps store . )
Writing the app takes time , too , but you can start that whenever -- Apple says 250,000 have already downloaded the iPhone software developers kit .
And Apple will still need to review your app before it goes up for sale .
We assume that 's a soft waiting list -- if you 're a huge software developer , or have good connections at Apple , you could probably get right in .
But smaller or new companies waiting in line could potentially get shortchanged by missing out on Apple 's promotion around the official launch .
( That said , if the iPhone apps store is anywhere near as successful as the iTunes music store , it probably wo n't matter in the long run . )
We have big expectations for the iPhone platform :
For consumers , who have n't really latched on to previous mobile platforms like Palm OS or Windows Mobile ; for developers , who could make money selling apps through Apple 's store ; and for Apple , which should sell a lot of iPhones and iPod touches this year .
Anyone out there already accepted to the iPhone developers program ?
How long did it take you to get in ?
Anything particularly interesting / strange / awesome / annoying ?
Let us know in comments ; by email to dfrommer@alleyinsider.com -- we 'll keep your information anonymous ; or via our anonymous tips box .

Some activists think the language change , which spells out the removal of the right for same - sex couples to marry , could help add support to defeat the amendment .
Read the change to the language after the jump ...
Election officials in California made what could be an important change to Proposition 8's language yesterday .
Prop 8 , which was put forward by fundies to reverse the state 's Supreme Court decision to legalize same - sex marriage , is on the ballot in November .
The original ballot language read :
[ Prop 8 ]
Amends the California Constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California .
The election official 's change , however , gives the legislation a more straightforward read :
[ Prop 8 ] Changes California Constitution to eliminate right of same - sex couples to marry .
Provides that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California .
Fiscal Impact :
Over the next few years , potential revenue loss , mainly sales taxes , totaling in the several tens of millions of dollars , to state and local governments .
In the long run , likely little fiscal impact to state and local governments .
This is a small but important change in language .
According to some polls , changing the language to denote the removal of rights can add up to ten points to the " no " votes .
Many people might be hesitant to strip away an existing right , which this language change makes clear .
Also , the addition of fiscal impact could sway many voters in California who have seen the financial windfall marriage equality has given the state .
Let 's hope this new language , as well as the hard work of those fighting Prop 8 , can stop this discriminatory amendment from passing .
But the truth is that nobody knows .
Fannie and Freddie have financed several hundred billion dollars of doubtful mortgage paper that may or may not pay off enough to meet their debts , and they cannot predict whether they will have gains or losses from their gigantic exposures in the derivatives markets .
If the government had not guaranteed the full payments of principal and interest on their paper , the foreign governments that own so much of it might have had to show losses on their dollar - denominated accounts .
To say the least , this would make them reluctant to continue to finance our trade deficit , our wars and the strength ( such as it is ) of our dollar .
Our interest rates , and not just for mortgages , would soar .
So the debate about whether dishonest lenders and dumb borrowers should have been bailed out was really meaningless  the conclusion was foregone .
The international position of the dollar had to be defended against even the hint of possible failure at Fannie and Freddie ; they had to be saved at all costs .
This brings us to the Exchange Stabilization Fund , which could give the government the means to save Fannie and Freddie without ignoring the Constitution .
The fund was started in 1934 as a place to set aside the profits credited to the government when President Franklin Roosevelt took possession of the nation ’s monetary gold .
It ’s been used sparingly ever since , perhaps most notably when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin used it to extend a $ 20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 .
The net wealth of the fund , most of which can be realized with the stroke of a pen , is about $ 41 billion .
Among the uses specified when it was created was maintaining “ orderly exchange arrangements and an orderly system of exchange rates . ”
Nothing could be more disruptive of orderly exchange arrangements than even the hint of a default at Fannie and Freddie .
Just because Congress has given Mr. Paulson a blank check to dip into the Treasury does n’t mean he has to do it .
Among the advantages of using the stabilization fund is that it comes with built - in Congressional oversight  a mandatory monthly review by Congress was written into the law in 1978 .
Should conditions worsen at Fannie and Freddie , Congress would have an early warning system .
We should all hope that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac escape this jam on their own .
Should they falter , however , it ’s only sensible for the Treasury and Congress to have a plan to step in .
But the bailout bill that President Bush is expected to sign this week will give Secretary Paulson untested and unconstitutional powers .
Why take that leap when there are proved alternatives like the Exchange Stabilization Fund ?
Ota Benga , a member of the Batwa people of the Congo , spent 12 years in tormenting exile :
After being sold to an American missionary , he was put on display at the 1904 St. Louis World ’s Fair , then exhibited in the monkey house at the Bronx Zoo , then sent to work in a Virginia tobacco factory .
In 1916 his loneliness drove him to borrow a revolver , build a ceremonial fire , and shoot himself in the heart .
Benga ’s isolation was extreme , but as University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo and writer William Patrick eloquently explain , the physical and emotional impact of even ordinary loneliness can lead to an early grave .
People with few social ties are at increased risk of dying of heart disease , cancer , and respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments .
Lonely people also suffer more anger , anxiety , hostility , pessimism , and lower self - esteem .
Three decades of research have shown that loneliness can affect levels of stress hormones , immune function , and even gene expression , while human interaction increases levels of oxytocin , a bonding hormone that reduces blood pressure and cortisol levels .
“ Western societies have demoted human gregariousness from a necessity to an incidental , ” the authors write , although they do n’t discuss why .
At least 27 million people in the United States now live alone , and as much of the world adopts a lifestyle conducive to a chronic sense of isolation , “ the results can be devastating , not only for the individual , but for societies as well . ”
One place where " if you build it , they will come " does n't always apply is in military hardware .
After constructing two Zumwalt class DD ( X ) stealth destroyers at $ 2.6 billion apiece , the Navy has scrapped its plan to build up the rest of its intended 313 - ship fleet - turns out , the demand for a ship whose primary mission is to obliterate large land targets with guided artillery and Tomahawk missiles does n't suit the smaller - scale anti-terror missions most of the armed forces are currently faced with .
Now the Pentagon just has to decide what to do with the almost $ 1 trillion it just freed up in its budget .
I 'm sure they 'll have no problem with that . [ AP ]

Resistance to ciprofloxacin , a member of one of the most commonly used groups of antibiotics in the world , has been discovered by a team of Canadian researchers among people in remote South American villages who are believed to have never taken this medication .
The researchers found high levels of ciprofloxacin resistance in Escherichia coli in Amerindians from the Guyanese rainforest .
These individuals are reported as never having received treatment with ciprofloxacin or related fluoroquinolone antibiotics .
The Amerindians had , however , received frequent treatment for malaria ( which is a parasite and not a bacterium ) with chloroquine .
Chloroquine is used widely around the world to combat malaria , and it also is a close chemical cousin of the fluoroquinolones .
Fluoroquinolones began widespread use in the late 1980s and now are among the most commonly used antibiotics in North America and Europe .
Because the bacteria carried by the Guyanese Amerindians were resistant to ciprofloxacin , the researchers suggest that it is possible that exposure to chloroquine may make the bacteria that people carry in their intestines resistant to fluoroquinolones - - a theory that , if corroborated by further research , could have important public health implications in developing countries and in the developed world .
" We also found resistance in many other species of bacteria -- including Salmonella - - that are found in rectal swabs .
We only screened that area of the body , but since the same process is occurring in multiple bowel species , it is likely occurring in non -bowel species as well , " said the senior investigator Dr. Michael Silverman , an infectious disease specialist at the Lakeridge Health Centre in Oshawa , Ontario .
" This means that chloroquine use for malaria may make the fluoroquinolones less effective for many common tropical diseases such as typhoid fever , diarrheal illnesses , and possibly also tuberculosis and pneumonia in the developing world . "
He added that plans are being considered by major global health - promotion organizations to launch a campaign of widespread use in Africa and South America of a new anti-malarial treatment regimen called Artemesinin combination therapy ( ' ACT ' ) .
ACT usually includes quinoline drugs similar to chloroquine .
These drugs are closely related to both chloroquine and fluoroquinolones .
" We plan to carry out further studies to identify whether some quinolines may be less likely to induce quinolone resistance than others , and thus may be safer for malaria control programs , " he said .
Dr. Silverman and 19 other volunteer health care professionals traveled by airplane from Bartica , a town that serves as the gateway to the interior of the Guyanese rainforest , to a handful of remote villages as part of annual humanitarian medical missions between 2002 and 2005 .
They took rectal swabs from 535 people in Bartica and the remote villages .
They also asked the local inhabitants about whether they had ever been exposed to chloroquine or fluoroquinolones , and took water samples .
They took the samples home and analyzed them .
The team found that 5.4 % of the rectal - swab samples contained ciprofloxacin - resistant Escherichia coli , with a 4.8 % resistance rate among the remote - village samples .
This is a very high rate -- particularly when compared to the 4 % rate found in a recent study of ciprofloxacin resistance in American intensive care units where fluroquinolones are very intensively used .
It is also particularly remarkable , noted Dr. Silverman , because fluoroquinolones had never been available in these communities .
The ciprofloxacin - resistant E. coli samples were also all found to be highly resistant to chloroquine , and to have characteristics that would confer resistance to all fluoroquinolones including the newer drugs levofloxacin and moxifloxacin .
Furthermore , the team found that one of the water samples they took in 2004 contained ciprofloxacin - resistant E. coli and another contained a small amount of chloroquine , likely from human waste contamination .
Because of a widespread malaria outbreak in rural Guyana in late 2002 , 30 % of the villagers tested by the Canadian team in 2003 said they had been given chloroquine within the past six months , and in 2005 86 % said they had used chloroquine within the past two years .
The rates of chloroquine use may in fact have been much higher the investigators believe .
This is because patient reports are not always reliable , and because of the very extensive treatment with chloroquine during the late - 2002 malaria epidemic .
The data also showed that community - wide fluoroquinolone resistance rose dramatically shortly after the malaria outbreak , further suggesting a link between chloroquine use for malaria and bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones .
These clinical findings were confirmed by team members from Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , led by Drs. Ross Davidson and Ian Davis who demonstrated that in the laboratory E. coli that were exposed to chloroquine became resistant to fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin .
" Together , these data suggest that we must focus our efforts on prevention of malaria using mosquito - control measures such as bednets and by developing vaccines , " concluded Dr. Silverman .
" For the short term , however , we still will have no choice but to use these lifesaving antimalarial drugs .
However we need to investigate which of the antimalarials can be used in the future with the least impact on bacterial drug resistance . "
Electronic voting has made great strides in reliability , but it has a long way to go .
When reformers push for greater safeguards , they often argue that future elections could produce the wrong result because of a computer glitch or be stolen through malicious software .
That ’s being too nice .
There have already been elections in which it is impossible to be certain that the right candidate was declared the winner .
Here are three such races .
It is not just remarkable that these elections were run so badly , but also that the flaws are still common  and could easily create havoc in this fall ’s voting .
1 . The 2002 Georgia Senate and Governor Races  Senator Max Cleland , who lost three limbs in Vietnam , was defeated for re-election and Gov. Roy Barnes , a Democrat , was unseated .
Polls had suggested that both men would win .
The votes were cast on Diebold A.T.M.- style machines .
A whistle - blower who helped prepare the machines reported that secret “ patches ”  software intended to fix glitches  were installed late in the process without being certified by the state , as the law required .
The Hyperlink Trailing Slash
If you ’ve spent any considerable amount of time running a web server you may have heard that adding a trailing slash to your site ’s hyperlinks speeds up how quickly the pages will come up when clicked .
So :
https://danielmiessler.com/study ( slower )
vs .
https://danielmiessler.com/study/ ( faster )
Some consider this gospel , others think it ’s crap .
I ’ve never taken a position because I was too lazy to test it myself .
But no more .
I ’ve done the testing and I now have a well - informed position .
For directories , it absolutely does matter .
A lot .
Proof is in the Logs
This is best shown in the following way :
1.1.1.1 - - [ 15/Jun/2008:12:34:25 -0000 ]
" GET / study HTTP/1.1 " 301 298 1.1.1.1 - - [ 15/Jun/2008:12:34:26 -0000 ]
" GET / study / HTTP /1.1 " 200 22029
The first log entry was me asking for danielmiessler.com / study — without the trailing slash .
Notice the HTTP code returned : a 301 , which is a redirect .
The second line is the result of the second response that apache forced my browser to make .
In short , I ended up making double the GET requests because I asked for the “ study ” resource without the trailing slash .
Some may say , “ So what ?
It was a tiny little request and redirect ; no harm done , right ?
Wrong .
That redirect actually creates a ton of overhead at the TCP / IP level .
How much ?
Well , if you make the request using study / ( the proper way ) your fourth ( 4 ) packet is the actual proper request .
But if you make the request for study by itself you do n’t end up at study / until the fifteenth ( 15 ) packet !
Correct
Client SYNs Server SYN ACKs Client ACKs
Client makes proper request for study /
Suboptimal
Client SYNs Server SYN - ACKs Client ACKs Improper request for study Server ACKs improper request Server PUSHes redirect Server FINS ACKs previous connection Client ACKs Client ACKs Client FIN ACKs Server ACKs Client SYNs Sever SYN ACKs Client ACKs Client makes proper request for study /
Sure , maybe for most sites it ’s pretty minor — especially if you ’re not getting much traffic , but it ’s just inefficient .
If you can help it ( which you can ) why not having your pages come back as a result of only one GET request instead of two ?
And why not use only four packets instead of fifteen ?
The Explanation
Let ’s take note of the reason for this behavior .
When you ask apache for “ foo ” , apache basically says , “ Huh ?
What the hell does ‘ foo ’ mean ? ”
Then it has to go and start taking guesses at what you meant .
And that ’s what it does when it sends you off to foo / : it ’s taking a guess that foo is a directory that you ’re trying to reach .
That takes time and energy , both at the HTTP and the TCP / IP level .
Other Types of Content
Remember that we ’re not always requesting directory resources .
So , danielmiessler.com is a directory and should have a trailing slash appended , but my blog articles are not .
My WordPress URL structure , for example , looks like this :
https://danielmiessler.com/blog/socialism-anarchy-and-ideal-government
Notice the lack of trailing slash .
And if you add one , guess what ?
" GET / blog / socialism - anarchy - and - ideal - government / HTTP/1.1 "
301 - " GET / socialism - anarchy - and - ideal - government HTTP/1.1 " 200 27627
The opposite happens !
It redirects you from the URL with the slash to the URL without it .
So the theme here is simple : know what types of resources you ’re linking to when you hyperlink and build your links accordingly .
If it ’s a directory , be sure to use a trailing slash .
And if it ’s a WordPress blog URL or a direct file ( such as foo / index . php ) leave the slash off .
As always , ping me if I missed something . :
Researchers at security firm Fortinet have discovered a malicious application spreading rapidly across Facebook , prompting users to install adware from Zango , an online media company that promotes free downloads of games and ringtones .
Zango is also a notorious malware distributor that has run into trouble with regulators over its practices .
The widget first appeared under the name " Secret Crush , " and entices users to download the application with a promise of revealing a Facebook friend with a crush on them , according to Fortinet 's research .
No admirer is ever identified .
There is no secret crush to reveal .
Instead , the widget entices users to download the adware , but not before prompting them to pass the application on to their Facebook friends .
In the typical fashion of the cat - and - mouse game of online security , the developers have renamed the widget " My Admirer " following the researchers ' discovery , according to Fortinet Senior Research Engineer Derek Manky .
" Secret Crush " is still named as the developer ; the invitation now reads : " My Admirer by Secret Crush . "
Facebook is working closely with Fortinet to address the problem , Manky told InternetNews.com .
This is believed to be the first malware application of its kind to appear on Facebook through its third - party developer platform , but the researchers have warned that it is unlikely to be the last .
Manky said one concern is that cyber criminals rolling out Facebook applications could post more than adware , such as links that draw users to malicious external Web sites .
MySpace , the largest social network and a Facebook rival , has already come under numerous attacks , including a recent attempt to trick unsuspecting users into installing a rootkit .
" What is happening here is actually simple  social networking sites are becoming what the Internet already is in general : a dangerous place , " Fortinet researcher Guillaume Lovet wrote in his analysis of the Secret Crush widget .
" Keep in mind that , given the odds , people are likely developing Facebook Platform applications for profit rather than just fun , " Lovet said .
Of course , many for - profit widget applications are entirely legitimate .
But the surging popularity of Facebook and other social networks has created a ripe target for malware authors .
Viral Malware
One of the unusual aspects of the Secret Crush / My Admirer adware is how quickly it has spread around Facebook by seizing on some of the elemental features of the social networks : trusted referrals and social curiosity -- the exponential reach that comes through viral distribution .
As of this morning , the application had been downloaded by 4 percent of Facebook 's users , according to Manky .
On Tuesday , when the researchers first posted their findings , the adware had spread to 3 percent of the Facebook community .
Using Facebook 's own estimate of more than 59 million active users on its site , that means more than half a million people have downloaded Zango 's adware in just two days , and that it has reached a total of more than 2 million users .
" It really demonstrates the power of simple social engineering tactics , " Manky said .
The two main security problems confronting Facebook brought to light by the My Admirer / Secret Crush adware are the lack of security awareness among its users and the extensive trust that is placed in the third - party developers under the Platform , according to Manky .
Facebook needs to develop some mechanism for screening the intent of its developers before their applications go live on the site , he said .
At the very least , Facebook could look at the steps that users are required to complete before adding a widget .
The current system places the onus of security entirely on Facebook users , who are so accustomed to installing third - party applications that come recommended by friends that security concerns are often overlooked , Manky said .
Users are all the more likely to ignore security risks when confronted with a widget that excites their curiosity with the promise of revealing some socially titillating bit of information , as My Admirer does .
After agreeing to add the widget , the installation jumps to a screen that reads : " Before You Can Find Out Who Might Have a Crush On You , You Need to Invite At Least 5 Friends ! "
At this point , researchers point out , the user is psychologically hooked .
" Since users have freely chosen to install the widget at the cost of disclosing their personal information , psychologically speaking it is difficult for them to stop the process at that point , " the researchers wrote , so they are likely to pass the malicious widget on to at least five friends , just as Zango planned .
In this sense , My Admirer leverages a user 's escalating commitment to create trusted referrals that spread the adware with exponential rapidity .
Instead of revealing the admirer , after users send the application to five of their friends , they are then prompted to click a " download now " button , which installs the Zango adware on their computer .
Zango has already run afoul of the Federal Trade Commission for its malware practices .
In a $ 3 million settlement with the FTC reached in November 2006 , Zango ( formerly known as 180Solutions ) agreed not to install its adware without obtaining consent after providing clear and prominent disclosure .
Prof. [ Anita ]
Elberse looked at data for online video rentals and song
purchases , and discovered that the patterns by which people shop online
are essentially the same as the ones from offline .
Not only do hits and
blockbusters remain every bit as important online , but the evidence
suggests that the Web is actually causing their role to grow , not
shrink .
Here is the summary article .
Here is the Elberse paper .
Here is Chris Anderson ’s response .
Overall I can not call this one for Elberse .
If you take a genre as given , the web looks less revolutionary but part of the long tail is the creation of new genres .
We have blogs now , for instance , and we did n’t fifteen years ago , even though blog readership is quite concentrated among the top sites .
Or maybe the " Quickflix rental distribution " is n’t so skewed to the left ( the least - rented titles are n’t so popular ) but where were Quickflix , Netflix , and other such services fifteen years ago ?
Static estimation by deciles and related measures is often misleading since in part the " long tail " effect is to make the top deciles thicker than before , not necessarily to raise the status of the bottom decile relative to the top .
In his response , Chris Anderson nails this point :
The best example of this is in what she describes as a growing
" concentration " of sales around a relatively small number of
blockbuster titles .
In the Rhapsody data , she finds , the top 10 % of
titles ( out of more than a million in that data sample ) accounted for
78 % of all plays , and the top 1 % account for 32 % of all plays .
That
sounds pretty concentrated around the head , until you reflect , as she
notes , that " one percent of a million is still 10,000 – [… ] equal to
the entire music inventory of a typical Wal - Mart store . "
Nor does showing that most of the sales are in the top of the distribution refute the claim .
Arguably it is the middle tail which is suffering and the long tail , and the best sellers , are growing in import .
That seems compatible with Anderson ’s core thesis .
The long tail hypothesis may be oversold but the data in the Elberse piece do n’t really dent it .
Elberse wants to define the Long Tail hypothesis as claiming there is
more money to be made in the niches than in the blockbusters ; while I believe you might find a quotation to that effect from Chris Anderson the more
general idea is simply how important the niches are
becoming .
Elberse concedes a lot at one point :
It is undeniable that online commerce has significantly broadened
customers ’ access to products of all varieties , including the most
obscure .
However , my findings suggest that it would be imprudent for
companies to upend traditional practice and focus on the demand for
obscure products .
You could have rewritten that as " The Long Tail hypothesis is basically true , just do n’t sell to the Long Tail alone . "
On that we should all be able to agree .

Getter と Setter ECMAScript 3.1 では、正式に Getter と Setter が仕様化されました 。
文法は、 Firefox や Safari や Opera が今まで独自に実装していたものと同じになっています。 var obj = { value : 1 , get accessor ( ) { return this .value ; } , set accessor ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ; obj.accessor = 3 ; alert ( obj.accessor ) ; また、オブジェクトリテラル以外の箇所で
Getter や Setter を定義したい場合は、 Object .defineProperty を使います。 var obj = { value : 1 } ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' accessor ' , { getter : function ( ) { return this .value } } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' accessor ' , { setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value } } ) ; obj.accessor = 3 ; alert ( obj.accessor ) ; Object.defineProperty は、更に様々な用途に使います。その例については、次章の
Property Descriptor で解説します。
ちょっと脱線 ：
Firefox Safari Opera に存在する __defineGetter__ や __defineSetter__ は ECMAScript 3.1 の仕様には存在しませんが、以下のようにすると 同じものを作ることができます。 Object .defineProperty ( Object . prototype , ' __defineGetter__ ' , { enumerable : false , value : function ( name , fn ) { Object .defineProperty ( this , name , { getter : fn } ) ; } } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( Object . prototype , ' __defineSetter__ ' , { enumerable : false , value : function ( name , fn ) { Object .defineProperty ( this , name , { setter : fn } ) ; } } ) ;
Property Descriptor ECMAScript 3.1 からは Property Descriptor というものが使えるようになります。 Property Descriptor の取得 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor という関数で Property Descriptor を取得できますので、とりあえず例を見てみましょう。 var obj = { hoge : 1 , get fuga ( ) { return this .hoge } , set fuga( hoge ) { return this .hoge = hoge } } ; var desc = Object .getOwnPropertyDescriptor( obj , ' hoge ' ) ; alert ( desc.value ) ; alert ( desc.writable ) ; alert ( desc.enumerable ) ; alert ( desc.flexible ) ; var desc = Object .getOwnPropertyDescriptor( obj , ' fuga ' ) ; alert ( desc.getter ) ; alert ( desc.getter ) ; alert ( desc.enumerable ) ; alert ( desc.flexible ) ; このように、プロパティの特性を示すオブジェクトが
Property Descriptor です。
プロパティの種類によって Property Descriptor が持つプロパティが変わります。 データプロパティ（普通のプロパティ） value writable enumerable flexible
アクセサプロパティ （Getter や Setter） getter setter enumerable flexible
Property Descriptor の設定（プロパティの作成） ECMAScript 3.0 では、プロパティを作る方法は代入（と変数宣言）以外にありませんでした。
しかし、 ECMAScript 3.1 ではオブジェクトに対して Property Descriptor を設定することでプロパティを作ることが出来るようになります。
その方法は、さっきの章 （Getter と Setter）で少し紹介した Object.defineProperty を使います。
例を見てみましょう。 var obj = new Object ; obj.normal0 = 0 ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' normal1 ' , { value : 1 } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' cantDelete ' , { flexible : false , value : 2 } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' readOnly ' , { writable : false , value : 3 } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' dontEnumerable ' , { enumerable : false , value : 4 } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' concrete ' , { enumerable : false , flexible : false , writable : false , value : 5 } ) ; obj.defineProperty(obj , ' normalGetter ' , { getter : function ( ) { return this .value ; } } ) ; obj.defineProperty(obj , ' normalSetter ' , { setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ) ; obj.defineProperty(obj , ' normalAccessor ' , { getter : function ( ) { return this .value ; } , setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' cantDeleteAccessor ' , { flexible : false , getter : function ( ) { return this .value ; } , setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' dontEnumerableAccessor ' , { enumerable : false , getter : function ( ) { return this .value ; } , setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ) ; Object .defineProperty ( obj , ' concreteAccessor ' , { flexible : false , enumerable : false , getter : function ( ) { return this .value ; } , setter : function ( value ) { return this .value = value ; } } ) ; ちなみに writable , flexible , enumerable は指定されない場合は、 true と同じように振る舞います。 その他、 Property Descriptor に影響を与える関数 群
Object.seal は、オブジェクトのすべてのプロパティ（Own Property :プロトタイプのプロパティを含まないプロパティ）の
Property Descriptor の flexible プロパティを false にし、さらに、あらたなプロパティを作れないようにします。 var obj = Object . seal ( { hoge : 1 } ) ; obj.hoge = 2 ; delete obj.hoge ; obj.fuga = 1 ; Object.freeze は、オブジェクトのすべてのプロパティ（Own Property :プロトタイプのプロパティを含まないプロパティ）の
Property Descriptor の flexible , writable プロパティを false にし、さらに、あらたなプロパティを作れないようにします。 var obj = Object . freeze ( { hoge : 1 } ) ; obj.hoge = 2 ; delete obj.hoge ; obj.fuga = 1 ; Object.preventExtensions は、オブジェクトに新たにプロパティを作れないようにします。 var obj = Object . prevent ( { hoge : 1 } ) ; obj.hoge = 2 ; delete obj.hoge ; obj.fuga = 1 ;
プロトタイプ（オブジェクトが継承しているオブジェクト）の取得
ECMAScript 3.1 では、オブジェクトからプロトタイプを取得する方法が定義されました。その方法は
Object.getPrototypeOf という関数を呼び出すことです。 alert ( Object .getPrototypeOf ( [ ] ) === Array . prototype ) ; Firefox や Safari が実装してい る __proto__ を使って書くと以下のような感じになると思います。
Object .getPrototypeOf = function ( obj ) { if ( typeof obj !== ' object ' || obj === null ) { throw new TypeError ; } return obj.__proto__ ; } ; プロトタイプの動的な代入は出来ないので、 __proto__ の全機能が使えるようになった訳ではありません。
new 以外のプロトタイプ継承 ECMAScript では new 以外のプロトタイプ継承方法が可能になりました 。
Object.clone この関数を使うとオブジェクトをプロトタイプとして継承したオブジェクトを作ることができます。
この関数の特徴は、プロトタイプとして継承するだけではなく、関数呼び出しの性質も受け継ぐことができます。 var a = Object .clone ( Array .prototype ) ; a.push ( 1 ) ; alert ( a [ 0 ] ) ; Object .clone ( function ( ) { alert ( 1 ) } ) ( ) ; ただ、この関数の現段階の仕様ではスコープ（内部プロパティ［［Scope］］）が受け継がれないということになっているので、ちょっと不便な気がします。 var a = 1 ; ( function ( ) { var a = 2 ; var f = function ( ) { alret ( a ) } ; f( ) ; Object .clone(f ) ( ) ; } ) ( ) ; Object.create この関数を使うと、オブジェクトをプロトタイプとして継承したオブジェクトを作って、第二引数のオブジェクトのすべてのプロパティ（OwnProperty:プロトタイプのプロパティを含まないプロパティ、 for in で走査できないものも）をマージして返してくれます。
以下のように、クラスの継承的な書き方をするときに便利そうです。 var SuperClass = function () { } ; SuperClass.prototype = { } ; var SubClass = function () { } ; SubClass.prototype = Object .create(SuperClass.prototype , { } ) ;
for in で走査できないプロパティの取 得 ECMAScript 3.1 では Object.getOwnPropertyNames を使うと、 for in で走査できないプロパティも取得することができます。 alert ( Object .getOwnPropertyNames ( Object .prototype ) ) ;
ブロックスコープ ECMAScript 3.1 では、ブロック内の変数スコープが追加されました。
関数宣言で宣言された関数、 const 文で生成された値、 try 文の catch 節で catch された値にのみがこのスコープの範囲に従います 。
以下の三つの例の hoge がブロックスコープに従います。 { hoge ( ) ; function hoge ( ) { alert ( 1 ) ; } } hoge ( ) ; { const hoge = 1 ; alert ( hoge ) ; } alert ( hoge ) ; try { throw new Error ; } catch ( hoge ) { alert ( hoge ) ; } alert ( hoge ) ; 注）ここの節は、まだまだ仕様が変わる可能性があると思います。
use subset cautious プログラムの先頭に書くことで、いろいろ制限できるようです。 eval の中に書くこともできます。ちゃんと調べてません。 use subset cautious ; var b ; ( function ( ) { b = 0 ; } ) ( ) ;
配列がもっと便利に 配列のプロトタイプに色々な関数が追加されました。
Array.prototype.indexOf(searchElement ［ , fromIndex ］)
Array.prototype.lastIndexOf(searchElement ［ , fromIndex ］)
Array.prototype.every( callbackfn ［ , this Arg ］)
Array.prototype.some(callbackfn ［ , this Arg ］)
Array.prototype.forEach(callbackfn ［ , this Arg ］)
Array.prototype.map(callbackfn ［ , this Arg ］)
Array.prototype.filter(callbackfn ［ , this Arg ］)
Array.prototype.reduce(callbackfn ［ , initialValue ］)
Array.prototype.reduceRight(callbackfn ［ , initialValue ］) 全部、名前をどこかで見たことある関数ばかりですね！（説明略）
ググればきっと使い方が出てくることでしょう（ぉぃ
this の束縛、引数の部分適用 this の束縛とか、引数の部分適用するための関 数
Function.prototype.bind ( this Arg ［ , arg1 ［ , arg2 , … ］］ ) が追加されました 。
prototype.js の bind が仕様になったって感じですね。 var add = function ( a , b ) { return a + b ; } ; var succ = add. bind ( null , 1 ) ; alert ( succ ( 2 ) ) ;
JSON のサポート JSON . parse とか JSON.stringify とかできるようになったみたいです。
色々と出来そうなので、また別のエントリでまとめます。
arguments オブジェクトが配列に なりました 。
正確には、 Array .
prototype を継承したオブジェクトになりました。 ( function ( ) { arguments . forEach ( function ( arg ) { alert ( arg ) ; } , this ) ; } ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ただ、現時点での仕様だと arguments の ' 0 ' とか ' 1 ' とか数値プロパティの flexible が false なので、 arguments .
shift とかが出来ない＞ ＜
const 文 ブロックスコープで、書き換え不可な変数が定義できるようです。 alert ( a ) ; const a = 1 ; alert ( a ) ; a = 2 ;
Decimal オブジェクト まだ、あまり調べてないです。 var hoge = new Decimal ( ' 1 ' ) .intValue ( ) ;

IF AF -S VR DX Zoom Nikkor
Editors Note
If you have been pondering owning an all - around convenient zoom lens for your Nikon DSLR , you need to read this .
The lens has already been described as perfect for lightweight travel needs but are there compromises ?
Are you wondering how convenient it really is or how fast will it autofocus ?
These and other pertinent questions are answered in this review .
Victor F. Newman is a demanding pro sports photographer and moderator of the Nikonians Sports Forum .
As owner of a fantastic array of Nikkor glass , from the 8 mm fisheye to the 600 f/4D ED IF AF -S , he is a die hard sharpness fan .
Here he shares his conclusions about this 11.11X zoom lens .
Read on to learn why he decided to buy one and always has it in his bag .

The 18-200 mm lens
Nikon 18-200 mm AF - S VR DX Lens Review - Introduction
Advances in lens design continue to astound me .
This lens , which is designed for DX - format digital SLRs , is a perfect example .
Nikon has packed the latest - generation Vibration Reduction , Silent - Wave autofocus , ED glass , and aspheric elements into an 11.1:1 zoom lens of very high optical performance .
For Nikon to package all these features into a lens of this caliber , and sell it for $ 700 - 750 USD is quite a feat .
As a “ DX ” lens , it is fully compatible only with digital SLRs : The Nikon D1 and D2 series , Nikon D50 , D70 , D100 and D200 .
AF - S ( Silent - wave autofocus ) is fully functional with these cameras .
VR ( Vibration Reduction ) is functional with all except the Nikon D50 while its built - in speedlight is recharging .
As a “ G ” lens , it has no aperture ring , but will work correctly on all digital SLRs .
Using the lens on 35 mm film bodies will result in significant vignetting of the image , and AF - S , VR , and aperture control will not be possible on several not recent models .
First Impression
Upon taking the lens out of the box , the first thing I was struck by is how small this lens is .
The lens is almost identical in size and appearance to the Nikon 24 - 120 mm .
To illustrate , click on the picture at right .
The Tale of the Tape
The construction of this Nikkor lens appears to be similar to that of equivalent lenses offered by third - party manufacturers .
All three current lenses ( Nikon , Sigma , and Tamron ) use some form of low - dispersion / high refractive index glass , and aspherical elements , which help account for the dramatic increase in image quality since the inception of ultra - wide range zooms .
The dimensions and close - focus distance of all the lenses are close enough to make the differences insignificant .
The Sigma and Tamron are noticeably less expensive , but lack silent - wave autofocus and ( most importantly ) Vibration Reduction .

Ever since the human genome was sequenced less than 10 years ago , researchers have been able to access a dizzying plethora of genomic information with a simple click of a mouse .
This digitizing of genomic data — and its public access — is something that would have been unthinkable a generation earlier .
But as molecules go , DNA is pretty straight forward .
With its simple composition and linear structure , it easily lends itself to mathematical models .
Not so with proteins .
In fact , proteins are an order of magnitude more complex than DNA .
It is proteins , not DNA , that carry out the cell 's heavy lifting .
However , with their intricately folded three - dimensional shapes determining a seemingly endless range of possible functions and their manifold interactions with other proteins and with DNA , the leg - work required to mathematically capture the protein universe seems absurd .
And it is .
That is why a team of Harvard Medical School researchers have decided to attack this issue from an entirely new angle .
Rather than build a mountain range of proteomic data one grain of dirt at a time , they have developed a computer program that can take on the responsibility of assembling such a gargantuan model .
Enter Little b , a computational language that can penetrate the " mind " of a cell .
" Through incorporating principles of engineering , we 've developed a language that can describe biology in the same way a biologist would , " says Jeremy Gunawardena , director of the Virtual Cell Program in Harvard Medical School 's department of systems biology .
" The potential here is enormous .
This opens the door to actually performing discovery science , to look at things like drug interactions , right on the computer . "
These findings will be published in the July 23 issue of Journal of the Royal Society Interface .
Most current computational methods of modeling biological systems are not unlike writing a document with pen and paper .
Each new project starts from scratch ; there are no facilities for cutting and pasting , for linking to other texts , for including images , etc. — things that come so " naturally " to electronic documents .
Harvard Medical School researcher Jeremy Gunawardena , a mathematician by training , teamed up with Aneil Mallavarapu , a cell biologist and computer scientist , to lead a project that would bypass these limitations .
" We knew that the secret to doing this would be to assimilate fundamental concepts of engineering , concepts like modularity and abstraction , into the biological realm , " says Mallavarapu , who was recently awarded the Merrimack prize by the Council for Systems Biology in Boston for developing this program .
Modularity involves breaking a problem down into separate modules and constructing each module so that it can interact with the others .
Abstraction refers to extracting generic biological properties and incorporating them into the modules , so that they can use this abstract information in concrete contexts .
Put another way , abstraction means that , unlike the old days of pen and paper , each new model does * not* need to be built from scratch .
Models can be built upon each other and their individual modules refined and re-used .
To do this , Mallavarapu used the programming language LISP , a language widely used in artificial intelligence research .
LISP is famous among computer scientists due to its ability to write code that , in turn , can write code , enabling a programmer to derive new mini-languages .
" LISP is n't like typical programs , it 's more like a conversation , " says Gunawardena .
" When we input data into Little b , Little b responds to it and reasons over the data . "
For example , Gunawardena 's lab works on kinases , a kind of protein that transfers phosphate chemicals to other proteins in order to regulate their activity .
While this property is common to all kinases , there is a great deal of variety in how particular kinases carry this out .
Little b , however , understands this basic property of kinases , this abstraction .
Here , the researchers demonstrated how they were able to interact with Little b to build complex models of kinase activity , using Little b as a kind of scientific collaborator , and not simply a passive tool .
On a larger scale , the researchers also used the program to query the development of fruit fly embryos .
As a result , they discovered levels of complexity in these embryonic structures that previous research had missed .
" This language is stepping into an unknown universe , when your computer starts building things for you , " says Gunawardena .
" Your whole relationship with the computer becomes a different one .
You 've ceded some control to the machine .
The machine is drawing inferences on your behalf and constructing things for you . "
The researchers sometimes admit , half - joking , that Little b sometimes feels a little bit like " The Matrix " — referring , of course , to the film trilogy in which human beings lived in a computer - generated virtual world .
Mallavarapu and Gunawardena have a pretty clear vision for this project : they want every biologist in the world to use it .
But in order to bring the program out from the early adopter community , where it is currently being used by colleagues in the Harvard community , it needs to be more accessible .
" The next step is to create an interface that 's easy to use , " says Gunarwardena .
" Think of web page development .
Lots of people are creating web pages with little or no knowledge of HTML .
They use simple interfaces like Dreamweaver .
Once we 've developed the equivalent , scientists will be able to use our system without having to learn Little b . "
And the more people use it , the smarter it gets .
As researchers around the world input their discoveries into Little b , the program will assimilate that information into its language .
The ultimate goal is to have an in silico , virtual cell — a dynamic biological system living in software .
" Sure , it 's a long way off , " says Gunawardena , " but we 're getting there . "

It seems that Trojan infections are starting to perform new actions when installing a fake anti-spyware application .
From our many articles and removal guides [ , ] we have explained that rogue anti-spyware programs are sometimes installed or downloaded through a Trojan infection .
Now with Internet users wizing up to the Trojan tricks , Trojan makers have tighten the lease on Users ' computers by running files that prevent users from opening other programs or hiding the C : drive .
If Trojan infections continue performing these actions it will be very difficult for any spyware removal program or tool to identify the issue let alone remove the infection .
This is big news and a very serious threat to all computers on the Internet .
If this type of infection becomes widespread it will force many spyware and security vendors to revamp detection and removal procedures .
Below is a list of the identified symptoms of this Trojans behavior .
Identified Symptoms of Trojan behavior :
You are not able to open any programs on your computer including spyware removal tools and your C : drive is hidden or not accessible .
You have more than one user logged on your computer where the second user performs unknown actions in the background without your permission .
What can you do if you encounter this type of Trojan infection ?
Continual updates of your spyware or security software is always recommended .
If you feel the need to download a new spyware removal program you may do so after you perform proper research .
You may utilize removal guides for current Trojan infections to ward off any other malicious files that may aide to the infection of new actions performed by this Trojan .
Once we get more information we should be in position to provide additional assistance in removal of Trojans of this type .
After an unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 2000 , Illinois state Sen.
Barack Obama faced serious financial pressure : numerous debts , limited cash and a law practice he had neglected for a year .
Help arrived in early 2001 from a significant new legal client -- a longtime political supporter .
Chicago entrepreneur Robert Blackwell Jr. paid Obama an $ 8,000 - a- month retainer to give legal advice to his growing technology firm , Electronic Knowledge Interchange .
It allowed Obama to supplement his $ 58,000 part - time state Senate salary for over a year with regular payments from Blackwell ’s firm that eventually totaled $ 112,000 .
A few months after receiving his final payment from EKI , Obama sent a request on state Senate letterhead urging Illinois officials to provide a $ 50,000 tourism promotion grant to another Blackwell company , Killerspin .
Killerspin specializes in table tennis , running tournaments nationwide and selling its own line of equipment and apparel and DVD recordings of the competitions .
With support from Obama , other state officials and an Obama aide who went to work part time for Killerspin , the company eventually obtained $ 320,000 in state grants between 2002 and 2004 to subsidize its tournaments .
Obama ’s staff said the senator advocated only for the first year ’s grant -- which ended up being $ 20,000 , not $ 50,000 .
The day after Obama wrote his letter urging the awarding of the state funds , Obama ’s U.S. Senate campaign received a $ 1,000 donation from Blackwell .
Obama ’s presidential campaign rejects any suggestion that there was a connection between the legal work , the campaign contribution and the help with the grant .
“ Any implication that Sen . Obama would risk an ethical breach in order to secure a small grant for a pingpong tournament is nuts , ” said David Axelrod , Obama ’s chief political advisor .
Image - conscious
Business relationships between lawmakers and people with government interests are not illegal or uncommon in Illinois or other states with a part - time Legislature , where lawmakers supplement their state salaries with income from the private sector .
But Obama portrays himself as a lawmaker dedicated to transparency and sensitive to even the appearance of a conflict of interest .
Recently , Obama expressed regret over a property deal with Illinois power broker Tony Rezko after Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004 .
In an interview this spring with the Chicago Sun -Times , Obama said his regret was not just because the real estate and restaurant entrepreneur was under criminal scrutiny , but because he was “ a contributor and someone doing business before the state . ”
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs , who provided The Times with details of Obama ’s compensation from EKI , said Obama did nothing wrong acting on behalf of Killerspin .
He said the state senator simply wrote a letter backing a worthy project developed by a constituent .
Killerspin ’s owner , Blackwell , was a political supporter and friend as well .
Both men lived on Chicago ’s South Side .
Blackwell , a savvy and successful entrepreneur , was one of the first donors to Obama ’s early campaigns , including the state senator ’s failed bid for a congressional seat in 2000 .
In the presidential race he is credited on Obama ’s website with committing to raise $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 for Obama ’s campaign .
When Blackwell sought backing for his table tennis tournament in 2002 , other politicians , including U.S. Sen.
Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley , offered support for the event .
But Obama was the only one who provided a letter that became part of the initial application for state funds , state records show .
In addition , he wrote a state Senate proclamation heralding the first tournament and an official letter that welcomed “ table tennis friends ” to the 2004 contest and thanked spectators for helping to “ make Chicago the table tennis capital of this nation . ”
Initially , the idea of table tennis receiving funds from a state tourism program -- designed to encourage overnight visits to Illinois -- was met with skepticism by one Republican state official .
But the funding was granted at the $ 20,000 level that first year , grew to $ 200,000 in 2003 and totaled $ 100,000 in 2004 .
High - dollar tourism grants from the state are often reserved for events like the Breeders ’ Cup , an internationally known horse race that brought 50,000 to the Chicago area in 2002 .
But Blackwell and his allies promised good attendance , hotel bookings and international attention .
Today , Illinois Tourism Director Jan Kosner lauds the state ’s decision to support the table tennis tourneys and dismisses the role that letters from politicians play in the grant - making process .
Unofficial estimates place 3,000 to 6,000 spectators in the 8,000 - seat University of Illinois - Chicago arena during some table tennis events .
Blackwell said in a statement that “ the 2002 and 2003 events were among the largest - ever table tennis events held on U.S. soil in terms of attendance . ”
Blackwell deployed high - wattage showmanship that put an international spotlight on his tournaments and his brand of table tennis equipment , DVDs and sportswear .
Under a plan developed by Blackwell , the 2003 and 2004 tournaments were filmed at Killerspin ’s expense for occasional broadcast later by ESPN .
The cost to Killerspin for the broadcast , laced with promotions for the company as well as Illinois tourism , was in effect defrayed by the state aid .
Blackwell said the grants -- which paid only part of the cost his company had to bear -- provided the state with “ thousands of hours of domestic and international exposure via ESPN .
. . .
Additionally , hundreds of hotel rooms were occupied all three years that the state supported the event . ”
‘ A very dry period ’
In his book “ The Audacity of Hope , ” Obama tells how his finances had deteriorated to such a point that his credit card was initially rejected when he tried to rent a car at the 2000 Democratic convention in Los Angeles .
He said he had originally planned to dedicate that summer “ to catching up on work at the law practice that I ’d left unattended during the campaign ( a neglect that had left me more or less broke ) . ”
Six months later Blackwell hired Obama to serve as general counsel for his tech company , EKI , which had been launched a few years earlier .
The monthly retainer paid by EKI was sent to the law firm that Obama was affiliated with at the time , currently known as Miner , Barnhill & Galland , where he worked part time when he was n’t tending to legislative duties .
The business arrived at an especially fortuitous time because , as the law firm ’s senior partner , Judson Miner , put it , “ it was a very dry period here , ” meaning that the ebb and flow of cases left little work for Obama and cash was tight .
The entire EKI retainer went to Obama , who was considered “ of counsel ” to the firm , according to details provided to The Times by the Obama campaign and confirmed by Miner .
Blackwell said he had no knowledge of Obama ’s finances and hired Obama solely based on his abilities .
“ His personal financial situation was not and is not my concern , ” Blackwell said .
“ I hired Barack because he is a brilliant person and a lawyer with great insight and judgment . ”
Obama ’s tax returns show that he made no money from his law practice in 2000 , the year of his unsuccessful run for a congressional seat .
But that changed in 2001 , when Obama reported $ 98,158 income for providing legal services .
Of that , $ 80,000 was from Blackwell ’s company .
In 2002 , the state senator reported $ 34,491 from legal services and speeches .
Of that , $ 32,000 came from the EKI legal assignment , which ended in April 2002 by mutual agreement , as Obama ceased the practice of law and looked ahead to the possibility of running for the U.S. Senate . .
Blackwell said that “ Barack worked extensive hours advising the company on compliance and human resource issues , ” negotiated contracts , reviewed confidentiality agreements and provided reports on topics requested by the company ’s senior management .
Obama was not involved in soliciting city or state contracts for EKI , Blackwell said , and there was an agreement that he would not contact any government agencies .
Full disclosure
Illinois ethics disclosure forms are designed to reveal possible financial conflicts by lawmakers .
On disclosure forms for 2001 and 2002 , Obama did not specify that EKI provided him with the bulk of the private - sector compensation he received .
As was his custom , he attached a multi-page list of all the law firm ’s clients , which included EKI among hundreds .
Illinois law does not require more specific disclosure .
Stanley Brand , a Washington lawyer who counsels members of Congress and others on ethics rules , said he would have advised a lawmaker in Obama ’s circumstances to separately disclose such a singularly important client and not simply include it on a list of hundreds of firm clients , even if the law does not explicitly require it .
“ I would say you should disclose that to protect and insulate yourself against the charge that you are concealing it , ” Brand said .
An Illinois ethics advocate who worked with Obama to pass state ethics reforms , Cynthia Canary , said she was not troubled by Obama ’s handling of the Blackwell business .
She said his listing of all the law firm ’s clients “ was a more complete disclosure than you see 80 % of the time in Illinois . ”
Further , she said that Obama ’s letter on behalf of the table tennis tournament did not “ rise to the level of a conflict of interest ” because Obama did not have decision - making authority over the grant .
Obama ’s spokesman said that listing all clients was appropriate and that doing so allowed the public to see any and all potential conflicts for Obama and his law firm colleagues .
“ He was especially mindful of this responsibility as a leader of ethics reform , ” said Gibbs , his chief campaign spokesman .
Obama ’s wife , Michelle , then a member of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks , reported her husband ’s work for EKI on a city of Chicago financial disclosure form obtained by The Times .
Gibbs said she had identified EKI on her form after consulting with her husband .
Gibbs said the questions on the city form were different from the state ’s and required different answers .
Gibbs said the letter Obama wrote on behalf of the Killerspin - backed tournament was appropriate and entirely unrelated to any payments by Blackwell ’s other firm for Obama ’s legal services .
“ He wrote the letter on behalf of a constituent ” with a worthy cause , Gibbs said , noting that the contest was broadcast internationally , reaching as many as 200 million viewers in 156 countries .
Though Obama ’s formal efforts for Killerspin consisted of writing a letter and a proclamation , the nitty - gritty of obtaining state grants fell to a former state Senate and campaign aide to Obama , Dan Shomon .
Shomon , working part time for Obama ’s campaign and for Killerspin , helped prepare Killerspin ’s initial grant application in 2002 .
Still working part time with Obama , Shomon helped Killerspin secure a $ 200,000 grant for its 2003 tournament and a $ 100,000 grant for its 2004 tournament .

ImageShack , one of the largest media hosting websites , has implemented some significant upgrades to their torrent download service .
One of the most innovative new features is the " video preview " , which allows users to browse through stills of the video they are downloading , to get an impression of the quality of the file .
ImageShack , as the name already suggests , is best known for their image hosting .
However , the site has more to offer , like their torrent download service for example .
ImageShack allows its users to upload a . torrent file to the site , which will then be downloaded to the Image Shack servers .
After the download is complete , the files can be easily downloaded via a http link in any browser .
The service is ideal for people who have throttled connection , and those who do n’t want to give out their IP address to the public .
In April we reported that ImageShack had rolled out the BETA version to the public but since then some exiting features have been added .
One of these new features is the video preview feature .
When you add a popular video torrent to your download queue , it will show you a time - line of image stills , so you can verify the content and the quality of the file .
Below is an example of such a time - line .
Torrent download services are not new , but there are only a few that do n’t change any money .
Jack Levin , the founder of ImageShack explained to TorrentFreak why he started the project : “ We think its going to be a great service for users , especially in the light of ISPs rate - limiting torrent traffic .
There are a lot of free and legal torrents out there that people should have easy access to too .
We have the capacity to do it , and the world needs it . ”
Although the service is free , there is a storage limit of 5GB and a transfer limit of 10 GB per month .
Users that would like to use the service more intensively will have to pay a subscription fee , starting at $ 10 a month for 10 GB disk space and 15 GB bandwidth .
Initially , we had some concerns about the service , because it did not support seeding .
The torrent simply disconnected as soon as the download was finished , which hurts the overall swarm speed .
This has changed as well , as Image Shack now allows users to seed files up to 150 % .
The torrent downloads are pretty easy to manage , and the site provides some basic details about the progress of the downloads .
Under the “ status ” link it lists information about the download progress , connected seeds and leechers , share ratio and more .
Other great features are selective downloading , which is ideal if you only need one file from a big torrent , and the ability to request an email notification when the download has finished .
It ’s doubtful that Hollywood will like the service .
However , Levin is not worried about this : “ DMCA applies , so , if we get reports from copyright owners to take down content , we will comply , ” he told us earlier .
Overall we would say that the service does what it promises , it downloads files much faster than most residential connections would , and has become more friendly to the torrent community now it allows seeding .
Worth a try .
Google bought YouTube in 2006 Viacom has " backed off " from demands to divulge the viewing habits of every user who has ever watched a video on YouTube , the website has claimed .
Google had been ordered to provide personal details of millions of YouTube users to help Viacom prepare its case on alleged copyright infringement .
Google , owners of YouTube , will now hand over the database but without data that could identify users .
Viacom has a $ 1bn ( £ 497 m ) copyright infringement lawsuit against Google .
A class action by other organisations including the English Premier League has also agreed to the new terms .
" We are pleased to report that Viacom , MTV and other litigants have backed off their original demand for all users ' viewing histories and we will not be providing that information , " said a statement on the YouTube blog .
The decision will be welcomed by privacy activists , many of whom expressed concern over a US judge 's order for Google to provide the data in early July .
Continuing battle YouTube , which was bought by Google in 2006 , is in battle with Viacom , which owns MTV and Paramount Pictures , over alleged copyright infringement .
Viacom alleges clips from its programmes have been viewed on YouTube without its consent .
When it initiated legal action in March 2007 , it said it had identified about 160,000 unauthorised clips of its programmes on the website , which had been viewed more than 1.5 billion times .
Following the launch of its billion - dollar lawsuit , YouTube introduced filtering tools in an effort to prevent content that infringes copyright from appearing on the site .
Viacom had said it wanted the log data to " compare the attractiveness of allegedly infringing video with that of non-infringing videos " .
But privacy activists argued in response that the original order " threatens to expose deeply private information " and was in breach of a 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act , which was passed after the rental habits of a Supreme Court nominee were publicised .
The new ruling means that Google will still have to hand over the data logs but in an " anonymized form " , meaning YouTube can swap user logins and IP addresses with other random signifiers
An earlier Viacom request that Google be forced to hand over the source code of YouTube has already been denied by a US court on the grounds it is a " trade secret " .
Despite Tuesday 's agreement , the companies are yet to agree the process of information disclosure regarding viewing of YouTube clips by employees of YouTube and Google .
This is expected to be settled in the coming weeks .
The cases are expected to come to trial in 2009 or 2010 .

US scientists have developed robots using the same principles of electro - magnetics that make balloons stick to ceilings after being rubbed .
The robots , developed by a team in SRI 's Mobile Robotics and Transducers Programme , are around the size of a remote - controlled car and have caterpillar tracks similar to those on toy tanks .
The technology could be used to enable robots to work in areas that are difficult for humans to go , such as tunnels or outside large buildings .

From the inbox : Baseball fan Brad Campeau - Laurion says a uniformed police officer ( perhaps off - duty but working security for overtime ) forcibly ejected him from the stadium last night during the Yankees - Red Sox game .
Why ?
He says all he did was try to go to the bathroom while " God Bless America " was played during the 7th inning stretch .
His letter reads ( plus some updates after the jump ) :
" I attempted to get up to use the restroom , rather urgently , during the 7th inning stretch as God Bless America was beginning .
As I attempted to walk down the aisle and exit my section into the tunnel , I was stopped by a police officer .
He informed me that I had to wait until the song was over .
I responded that I had to use the restroom and that I did not care about God Bless America .
" As soon as the latter came out of my mouth , my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and I was informed that I was being escorted out of the stadium .
A second officer then joined in and twisted my left arm , also in an excessively forceful manner , behind my back .
I informed them they were violating my First Amendment rights and that I had done nothing wrong , with no response from them .
" I was sitting in the Tier Level , and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and I was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium .
About halfway down , I informed them that they were hurting me , repeated that I had done nothing wrong , and that I was not resisting nor talking back to them .
One of them said something to the effect that if I continued to speak , he would find a way to hurt me more .
" When we reached the exit of the stadium , they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles , saying ' Get the hell out of my country if you do n't like it . '
" Nowhere on the Yankee Stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game .
Nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible .
" Furthermore , when the two officers returned to their section , Steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say ' We got to watch ourselves .
One day we 're really gonna get in trouble . '
They were also spreading rumors with a fan with whom they were friendly that I had said ' This country sucks . '
" I do not believe in God , nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism .
The fact that I wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through God Bless America should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game . "
The man tells us he 's left a message with no response from the Operations Office at Yankee Stadium .
He 's also contacted Norman Siegel , the ACLU , and filed a complaint with the NYPD Civilian Complaint Review Board .
We 're still working on getting a response / denial from Yankee stadium , but a regular attendee of Yankee games tells us ,
UPDATE : We just spoke to Brad , whose story is attracting a lot of attention .
He has a few comments , based on your reactions :
1 ) I was not drunk .
I had two beers about an hour apart and this was about an hour after my last one ( hence , needed to pee ) .
I have receipts to prove this , as I was using my credit card , and my friend who was with me as a witness .
2 ) Yes , I am Red Sox fan .
I have lived in New York for over 8 years and I do not cheer loudly or wear blatant Red Sox attire at the games .
In fact , I was dressed in business attire - dress shirt / pants / shoes .
3 ) I may have affected a little attitude , but nothing that warranted a violent response .
Last year , the NY Times looked at this confining policy .
Apparently , post September 11 , fans had complained that other spectators were n't singing or observing a moment of silence ; spokesman Howard Rubenstein told the Times , " Mr. Steinbrenner wanted to do all games to remind the fans about how important it is to honor our nation , our service members , those that died on Sept. 11 and those fighting for our nation . "
UPDATE , 8/28 : The NYPD says it had cause to eject Campeau - Laruion , claiming he was " cursing , using inappropriate language and acting in a disorderly manner . "
But Campeau - Laruon denies it , " That 's ridiculous .
That 's completely false . "

Pump nozzle in hand , Lisa Atkins keeps a close eye on the digital display rapidly adding up the pounds .
Gone are the days when she 'd routinely fill the gas tank to the brim .
She now has to be more cautious .
Ms. Atkins says the surging cost of fuel is discouraging her from taking to the wheel each time she needs to travel .
" I 'm driving less and less , " she says .
" Me and my nan [ grandmother ] go shopping together ....
Weekends we try to just leave the car outside and walk everywhere local . "
She 's not the only one reacting to the $ 9 per gallon gas prices .
Britons are driving less , opting instead for public transportation , car pools , and a reduced number of overall car trips .
Recent surveys show that Britain is leading the way with the change in driving habits , probably because pump prices here are higher than the global average .
British demand for gasoline fell by around 8 percent year - on - year in January and February .
Across the globe , governments are dealing with a string of protests by truckers , fishermen , and others stung by price hikes .
The movement will escalate in Britain on Wednesday when thousands of truckers descend on London to demand urgent financial relief , with the threat of blockades and civil disobedience .
Their protest follows Operation Escargot in France , during which truck drivers drove at a snail 's pace to protest the high price of fuel , causing major traffic jams through June .
According to the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , a Paris - based think tank , the decline in driving is the same across Europe .
" The rest of Europe is pretty much in line with that , although in the UK the effect is slightly higher because prices are higher [ here ] than elsewhere , " says Eduardo Lopez , an oil market demand expert at the IEA .
Gas stations in Britain are reporting unusual changes in buying patterns , says Alex Wells of the Petrol Retailers Association .
" Buying in the morning is down , but not so much in the afternoon , " he says .
" This is because second cars are being used less , the stay - at - home mums are driving less .
They are doing the weekly shopping in one hit . "
Sheila Rainger , deputy director of the Royal Automobile Club Foundation , an independent motorists ' association , says the effect is clear on the roads , too .
" We have a perception that people have cut back on optional journeys , " she remarks .
" We are starting to see a fall in congestion and in traffic . "
Meanwhile , carpooling in the UK , which is still a relatively niche concept , is rising .
Liftshare , a database company that matches journeys for people looking for carpooling possibilities , reports that demand has shot up in recent weeks .
Earlier this year , the company was averaging between 200 and 300 new members a day , but that has shot up above 500 .
One day last week , 582 new members signed on , according to spokeswoman Cecilia Bromley - Martin .
While around 5,000 people registered in April , the number was close to 15,000 in June , she says .
" People are discovering the many benefits of car sharing because the fuel price is a real worry to a lot of people , " says Ms. Bromley - Martin , adding that carpooling can save the average commuter 1,000 pounds ( $ 1,993 ) a year .
Many environmentalists have quietly rejoiced that the high cost of fuel is apparently achieving what governments have largely failed to : a reduction in carbon emissions .
But not all subscribe to this logic .
Tom Burke , an environmental scientist and former government adviser , says high pump prices " inevitably fall hardest on people who can least bear them , instead of on governments who took wrong decisions . "
" You ca n't just say it 's a good thing that prices go up and people will do more sensible things , " he says .
" Older people , people already at the bottom of the pile , will find it harder ... to live and anyone who welcomes that has lost their humanity . "
Mr. Burke adds that the British government should have started upgrading public transport a long time ago so that a proper alternative was available for people who chose to leave their cars at home .
As Ms. Rainger puts it , switching car for bus is only acceptable " if the bus goes where you want it to and if it 's affordable . "
In Britain , that 's not always the case .

The Dark Knight Returns : Frank Miller 's 1986 reinvention of Batman is still one of his best - known and most well - regarded stories .
Sure , a lot of it may not have aged well - all of the Ronald Reagan scenes , for example - but no - one can deny how good it is to see Bruce Wayne come out of retirement to kick some mutant ass and save the world .

Batman : Year One : Going from Batman 's retirement to his origins , Miller 's follow - up to Dark Knight ( illustrated beautifully by David Mazucchelli and Richmond Lewis ) provides not only the tone for Batman Begins but also for most Batman comics for about the next two decades .
Do n't hold that against it , though ; melding noir to superheroics with skill and restraint , this may be the best Batman comic ever .

The Killing Joke :
The potential secret origin of the Joker , courtesy of Alan Moore and Brian Bolland , both at the height of their powers .
For the first time since his creation , Batman 's most famous nemesis comes over and scary and dangerous , and a million miles away from Cesar Romero ... sadly enough for poor Batgirl .

Batman : Year One Hundred : Paul Pope takes a jump to 2039 ( 100 years after Bob Kane invented Batman , hence the title ) and shows us how a totalitarian police state deals with a vigilante Pope describes as " someone with the body of David Beckham , the brain of Nikola Tesla , and the wealth of Howard Hughes , who is pretending to be Nosferatu . "
Like Blade Runner , but with costumes and punching .

Gotham Central : Unresolved Targets :
What happens when the Joker discovers the internet ?
Why , he starts killing people live on webcam and holds the city hostage to the idea that they might be next , of course .
This collection from the sadly short - lived Gotham Central series by Greg Rucka , Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark ( all currently to found on Marvel 's Daredevil series ) shows us the terror from the point of view of Gotham 's cops ... who are n't exactly Batman 's biggest fans .

JLA : New World Order : Anyone who 's read Grant Morrison 's take on the Justice League of America knows that Batman can do anything if he puts his mind to it .
That 's a fact demonstrated best in this first collection , where the Dark Knight single - handedly defeats an alien invasion and saves all the super - powered heroes with only his wits and a box of matches .
Garishly - colored superheroics the way you need it .

Batman : Dangerous Dames and Demons :
An anthology of comics based on the old animated series from the '90s , all written by that show 's executive producer Paul Dini and drawn by various artists from the show , including Bruce Timm .

Showcase Presents : The Brave And The Bold - The Batman Team - Ups Volume 2 : While both Brave and Bold collections are full of enjoyably stupid Batman stories from the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , the second volume is by far the greatest , if only for the stories where Batman meets the ghosts of his dead parents and fights the devil .
Here 's a clue how that one ends up :
The devil wins .

All - Star Batman Volume One :
It seemed like a no-lose proposition for DC Comics : Pair up your hottest artist , Jim Lee , with Frank Miller returning to the character that made his name .
The problem was that the result was a dark - natured parody of the character who 's given to saying things like " Are you dense ?
Are you retarded ?
I 'm the goddamn Batman " to people who ask why he'd dressed in that ridiculous outfit .
Completely over - the - top fun .

BLACKWATER and Halliburton are the names most associated with the work of private contractors in Iraq but plenty of other firms have shared the spoils of war .
Between 2003 and 2007 America 's government lavished $ 85 billion on federal contracts in Iraq , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
America has a rich history of using private contractors to support war efforts .
In the Revolutionary war independent sutlers sold paper , bacon , sugar and the like to Continental Army troops .
But America 's reliance on the private sector has never been higher .
In the Balkans in 1990s the number of private contractors and troops was roughly equal , just as it is in Iraq now .

The government insisted it was doing more to help personnel Almost half of UK military personnel are ready to leave the forces , a Ministry of Defence survey suggests .
Some 47 % of Army and Royal Navy respondents and 44 % of those in the RAF said they regularly felt like quitting .
Among the concerns raised by the 9,000 servicemen and women surveyed were the frequency of tours , levels of pay and the quality of equipment and housing .
The Ministry of Defence said the survey revealed " areas of concern " but that conditions were being improved .
Sense of overstretch FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme
The first survey to assess attitudes across the Army , Royal Navy , Royal Marines and the RAF revealed high levels of concern over morale , equipment and pay .
The regular Army is already short of some 5,000 soldiers , amid worries that experienced young officers and senior NCOs are leaving at an increasing rate .
A sense of overstretch was reflected in all the services , with 36 % saying they were not happy with the level of separation from family and friends .
Asked whether the frequency of tours had an impact on whether to leave or not , 38 % of the Army said it had increased their intention to leave , while 59 % overall said operational commitments and stretch made them more likely to leave .
Overall , more than a third believed operational tours came too often , though well over half believed the level was about right .
Questioned about morale within their service as a whole , 72 % of the RAF rated levels as " low " or " very low " .
In the Royal Navy that was 64 % , the Army 59 % and the Royal Marines 38 % .
Patrick Mercer , Tory MP for Newark and an ex-officer , said the findings reflected the pressures faced by military personnel .
" I think the tempo of operations has produced such a level of stress on the families that it is no wonder so many are thinking of leaving , " he added .
However , 59 % of the armed forces overall said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their own job .
But the survey did highlight wide differences between the levels of satisfaction expressed by officers compared with other ranks .
In the Army 73 % of officers said they had job satisfaction , compared with 57 % of soldiers
In the Royal Marines it was 71 % of officers compared with 50 % among other ranks
70 % of RAF officers had job satisfaction compared with 50 % of other ranks
In the Royal Navy it was 64 % of officers but only 48 % of sailors Asked if they felt valued within their service , 49 % of ratings in the navy said they did not , along with 44 % of soldiers and 53 % of airmen and women .
More than half of those who responded to the survey were not satisfied with standards of military equipment and resources given to them to do their jobs , while some 40 % were unhappy with service accommodation , and 55 % were dissatisfied with the standards of maintenance of their service housing .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The first way to improve the morale of our armed forces is to let them know that they are valued .
Danny , UK
Yet the survey also showed that despite all the difficulties , pride in serving within the armed forces remained high , with 93 % of Army officers and 76 % of soldiers saying they were proud to be in the Army .
Figures were slightly lower in the other services , with 89 % of RAF officers and 69 % of airmen and women expressing pride and 84 % of naval officers and 62 % of sailors proud to be part of the Royal Navy .
Some 24,760 questionnaires were sent out , with almost 9,000 service personnel ( 36 % ) responding between July and October 2007 .
The MoD said a number of measures had recently been introduced , including tax - free operational allowances for those on six - month tours and improved spending on accommodation .
Defence Minister Derek Twigg added : " Since the survey was conducted , we have already implemented a number of important changes such as the recent pay rise , an adjustment to the operational bonus , and the introduction of childcare vouchers .
" Over the next 10 years , we are also spending £ 8.4bn on accommodation , an area that is a high priority for our personnel . "

The Ultimate Reduction Usability Test
Many sites I often use I find cluttered .
To see what would stay on some of those I removed all elements I never used – like navigation items or visual guides – and aligned the left - overs .
( This is not to say all of my removals would increase usability , because different people have different needs and interests .
It still tells something about the level of “ clutteredness ” of particular sites . )

According to an investigative report by the New Orleans City Business newspaper , Orleans Parish District Attorney Keva Landrum - Johnson is routinely seeking five - to - 20 year sentences for minor pot possession offenders .
Smoke Screen District attorney boosts felony convictions with marijuana cases via neworleanscitybusiness.com
Shortly after Keva Landrum - Johnson took over as district attorney following Eddie Jordans resignation Oct. 30 , hundreds of new felony cases flooded the public defenders office , overwhelming the 29 defense attorneys .
The flood of new felony charges didnt target murderers , rapists or armed robbers — they targeted small - time marijuana users , sometimes caught with less than a gram of pot , and threatened them with lengthy prison sentences .
The resulting impact has clogged the courts with non-violent , petty offenses , drained the resources of the criminal justice system and damaged low - income African - American communities .
Landrum - Johnsons decision to accept felony charges on people arrested for second and third marijuana possession offenses is a dramatic break from the tactics of former DAs Jordan and Harry Connick .
A first - time marijuana possession charge in Louisiana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison but typically results in a small fine .
A second offense is a felony that can carry up to five years in jail and a third offense up to 20 years .
Under Jordan and Connick , however , second and third offenses were routinely reduced to misdemeanors that typically did not require a trial .
This freed up public resources to be spent on violent crimes as opposed to minor , victimless offenses .
Question :
Whos the real " bad guy " here ?
The obvious answer is DA Landrum - Johnson , who is throwing the book at minor pot offenders in a cynical effort to appear " tough on crime " and bolster her campaign for Criminal Court Judge .
But the blame should not end with the DA .
The true culprits responsible for this mess are the Louisiana lawmakers who , apparently , believe its quite alright for minor pot offenders to face up to 20 years in prison and a felony record .
It s not the responsibility of each individual DA to try and make rational sense out of what is clearly an irrational law .
In fact , in an ironic twist , DA Landrum - Johnsons actions may actually hasten statewide reforms in Louisiana by once and for all exposing the states dirty little secret : Louisiana possesses some of the most malevolent pot penalties in the country !
Well , it s time that we call them on it .
Write or call your Louisiana state legislators and ask them if they believe that minor marijuana offenders should face five - to - 20 years in prison .
And if they dont , then tell them to sponsor legislation in 2009 to make Louisianas absurd pot penalties a thing of the past .

Simulated minimum sea-ice extent in 2008 when forced with atmospheric data from each year between 1988 and 2007 from the initial state of June 27 , 2008 .
Model derived ice extents have been adjusted with a constant offset to account for discrepancies with satellite - derived ice extents .
The thick black horizontal line displays the yearly minimum ice extent from 2007 .
Credit : Alfred Wegener Insitute
The ice cover in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer 2008 will lie , with almost 100 per cent probability , below that of the year 2005 – the year with the second lowest sea ice extent ever measured .
Chances of an equally low value as in the extreme conditions of the year 2007 lie around eight per cent .
Climate scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association come to this conclusion in a recent model calculation .
They participate with their prognosis in an international scientific contest , in which some of the most renowned institutes on climate research want to fathom out possibilities for seasonal predictions on Arctic sea ice cover by means of different methods and climate models .
" After the strong decrease of the Arctic ice during the last summer , climate scientists all around the world are constantly asked : how will the ice develop in the next years ? " describes Prof. Dr. Rüdiger Gerdes from the Alfred Wegener Institute his motivation .
" To answer this question , we did not want to guess , but to rely on sound calculations . "
The scientists ' problem : scenarios of the long - term development of sea ice clearly indicate a de-creased ice cover - exact prognoses for the following summer , however , are not yet possible .
This is mainly due to the fact that the short - term development of sea ice depends strongly on the actual atmospheric conditions , namely the weather and in particular wind , cloud cover and air temperatures .
Because the exact atmospheric conditions which determine the weather patterns in the Arctic Ocean during the coming months are not predictable , Rüdiger Gerdes and his team have entered atmospheric data of the last twenty years into an ocean sea ice model developed at the Alfred Wegener Institute .
" Through this , we are still not able " , says Gerdes , " to make a definitive statement on sea ice cover in September .
However , this ' trick ' enables us to compute the bandwidth of possible ice covers , and to quantify the probability of extreme events . "
Apart from the variability of atmospheric quantities during the melting season , ice thickness at the beginning of the season determines the new ice minimum .
Accordingly , computations of ice thickness enter the models of the researchers from Bremerhaven .
Start conditions from June 27th 2008 were used for their current prognosis .
Different from long - term prognoses , the researchers ' forecasts can quickly be checked by reality .
This is all right by Rüdiger Gerdes and his team .
" It is a first test , and all participating researchers are eager to know how their prognosis has fared at the end of the summer .
In the end , this small competition serves the optimisation of our models , so that we are able to improve our predictions concerning short - term seasonal fluctuations .
It has to be added , however , that even perfect models would not be able to rule out a component of chance regarding the atmosphere .
These forecasts will always be about probability , and not exact prognoses . "

George Galloway lays it out
for a propaganda - addled Brit

Many people seem not to realize how close the US and the UK are to attacking Iran .
Another group who are vaguely aware of the potential seems to think it would be a good idea .
Is the world really that addled ?
George Galloway goes a good job of laying out the reality of what the latest malevolent plan by the Bush administration will mean for the world .
Ladies and gentlemen , The Bronx is sunburning .
Yankee fans are seeing – and turning – red over a ban on sunscreen , which Stadium security guards say was widely expanded in the last few weeks .
Security guards collected garbage bags full of sunblock at the entrances to Yankee Stadium over the sweltering weekend , when temps hit 96 degrees and the UV index reached a skin- scorching 9 out of 10 – a move team officials said was to protect the Stadium from terrorism .
Have you had bad security experiences at Yankee Stadium ?
E-mail jolshan@nypost.com .
But fans baking in the bleachers and upper deck argued that the sun may be a bigger threat than Osama bin Laden .
“ I was really pissed because , since I am Irish and I have a bald head , I need my sunblock , ” said Sean Gavin , 40 , who had to toss his SPF 30 at the gate Saturday .
“ After they saw me dousing myself with it , it should have been obvious to them that it was sunblock and not some explosive . ”
The team contends that sunscreen has long been on the list of stadium contraband , but there is no mention of it on the Yankee Web site .
Four weeks ago , Stadium officials decided that sunscreen of all sizes and varieties would not be permitted , a security supervisor told The Post before last night ’s game .
“ There have been a lot of complaints , ” he said .
“ We tell them to apply once and then throw it out . ”
For fans who bring babies or young children to cheer on the home team , the guard had suggested they “ beg ” to take the sunblock in .
Seeing the giant bag full of confiscated sunscreen Saturday , one steaming Yankee fan asked whether he could take one of the tubes and apply it before heading into the park .
“ Absolutely not , ” the guard told him .
“ What if you get a rash ?
You might sue the Yankees . ”
Fans said the team seems more concerned with catching the Tampa Bay Rays than ensuring their fans do n’t catch UV rays .
“ Five hours in the upper deck with no sunscreen is crazy , ” season - ticket holder Dan McCourt said .
The Stadium does sell 1 - ounce bottles of Arizona Sun SPF 15 for $ 5 – a huge markup that makes its beer seem cheap .
Dermatologists said that , security concerns or not , leaving 56,000 fans unprotected from potential skin cancer is “ very dangerous . ”
“ This is especially bad for children , as their younger skin is particularly sensitive , ” said Dr. Babar Rao , a specialist at the Skin and Cancer Center of New York .
“ Sunblock needs to be reapplied every two hours , even if you are not swimming in the ocean or pool . ”
Major League Baseball even has a skin - cancer prevention program called “ Play Sun Smart . ”
An hour after being asked about the sunscreen ban , Yankee spokesman Jason Zillo told The Post that the rules would be changed to permit 3 - ounce containers .

Just one month of eating fast food and walking less than 5000 steps in a day is all it takes to impair liver function .
That 's what scientists found in a study published in , a peer review journal for health professionals and researchers in gastroenterology and hepatology .
Just for reference , some doctors recommend that normal , healthy individuals should walk about 10,000 steps ( or about one hour ) per day .
In the study , there were 18 healthy people ( 12 men , 6 women ) and a matched control group .
The subjects in the intervention group ate at least two meals at popular fast food restaurants each day and restricted their physical activity to not more than 5000 steps per day .
Their mission was to increase their body weight by 5  15 % by doubling their normal daily caloric intake and adopting a sedentary lifestyle for four weeks .
In order to monitor liver function , blood samples were taken at the beginning of the study and at regular intervals thereafter .
One way to identify liver damage is to measure alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , an enzyme in the liver .
After only a single week on the fast food diet , ALT levels in the intervention group began to climb .
By the end of the four weeks , seventeen of the eighteen subjects had met their goal of increasing their body weight by 5  15 % , with 5 of the eighteen subjects reaching the 15 % mark .
Thirteen of the study participants developed pathological ALT , which was evident in most subjects after the first week .
Those in the control group did not experience any such increases .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that a sedentary life of fast food gluttony will rapidly lead to ill health .
While one may wonder why anyone would agree to participate in such an experiment , the good news is that it may be possible to reverse liver damage caused by such a lifestyle , according to a Saint Louis University press release .
The way to undo the damage to the liver and other vital organs is to adopt a healthy lifestyle .
Brent Tetri , M.D. , professor of internal medicine at the Saint Louis University Liver Center and preeminent expert on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , conducted a similar experiment using mice .
" There 's strong evidence now that a fast - food type of diet -- high in fat and sugar , the kind of diet many Americans subsist on -- can cause significant damage to your liver and have extremely serious consequences for your health , " he explains .
" The good news , " he continues , " is that most people can undo this damage if they change their diet and they keep physically active .
If they do n't , however , they are asking for trouble .
"
In the study conducted by Dr. Tetri , mice were given a diet that was 40 % fat and loaded with high - fructose corn syrup , a sweetener commonly found in sodas , juices , and bottled sauces and dressings .
The mice were also kept sedentary , emulating the lifestyle of many Americans .
After four weeks , the mice displayed an increase in liver enzymes and the onset of glucose intolerance , known to be a marker for type II diabetes .
Dr. Tetri points out that while not all fast food necessarily causes liver damage , the problem is a diet containing too many calories with too much fat and sugar ( typical in fast food meals consisting of burgers , fries and sodas ) .
Tetri adds ,
" The fact we 're starting to see kids with liver disease should really be a wake - up call for anyone eating a diet high in fat and sugar and who 's not physically active . "
He offers some encouragement to fast food junkies : " Even for those people with the worst kind of diets , it 's not too late to start exercising and eating right .

Advance brings low - cost , bright LED lighting closer to reality WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind . - Operating a " reactor "

Researchers at Purdue University have overcome a major obstacle in reducing the cost of " solid state lighting , " a technology that could cut electricity consumption by 10 percent if widely adopted .
The technology , called light - emitting diodes , or LEDs , is about four times more efficient than conventional incandescent lights and more environmentally friendly than compact fluorescent bulbs .
The LEDs also are expected to be far longer lasting than conventional lighting , lasting perhaps as long as 15 years before burning out .
" The LED technology has the potential of replacing all incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs , which would have dramatic energy and environmental ramifications , " said Timothy D. Sands , the Basil S. Turner Professor of Materials Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering .
The LED lights are about as efficient as compact fluorescent lights , which contain harmful mercury .
But LED lights now on the market are prohibitively expensive , in part because they are created on a substrate , or first layer , of sapphire .
The Purdue researchers have solved this problem by developing a technique to create LEDs on low - cost , metal - coated silicon wafers , said Mark H. Oliver , a graduate student in materials engineering who is working with Sands .
Findings are detailed in a research paper appearing this month in the journal Applied Physics Letters , published by the American Institute of Physics .
LEDs designed to emit white light are central to solid - state lighting , semiconducting devices made of layers of materials that emit light when electricity is applied .
Conventional lighting generates light with hot metal filaments or glowing gasses inside glass tubes .
The LEDs have historically been limited primarily to applications such as indicator lamps in electronics and toys , but recent advances have made them as bright as incandescent bulbs .
The light - emitting ingredient in LEDs is a material called gallium nitride , which is used in the sapphire - based blue and green LEDs , including those in traffic signals .
The material also is used in lasers in high - definition DVD players .
The sapphire - based technology , however , is currently too expensive for widespread domestic - lighting use , costing at least 20 times more than conventional incandescent and compact fluorescent light bulbs .
One reason for the high cost is that the sapphire - based LEDs require a separate mirrorlike collector to reflect light that ordinarily would be lost .
In the new silicon - based LED research , the Purdue engineers " metallized " the silicon substrate with a built - in reflective layer of zirconium nitride .
" When the LED emits light , some of it goes down and some goes up , and we want the light that goes down to bounce back up so we do n't lose it , " said Sands , the Mary Jo and Robert L. Kirk Director of the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue 's Discovery Park .
Ordinarily , zirconium nitride is unstable in the presence of silicon , meaning it undergoes a chemical reaction that changes its properties .
The Purdue researchers solved this problem by placing an insulating layer of aluminum nitride between the silicon substrate and the zirconium nitride .
" One of the main achievements in this work was placing a barrier on the silicon substrate to keep the zirconium nitride from reacting , " Sands said .
Until the advance , engineers had been unable to produce an efficient LED created directly on a silicon substrate with a metallic reflective layer .
The Purdue team used a technique common in the electronics industry called reactive sputter deposition .
Using the method , the researchers bombarded the metals zirconium and aluminum with positively charged ions of argon gas in a vacuum chamber .
The argon ions caused metal atoms to be ejected , and a reaction with nitrogen in the chamber resulted in the deposition of aluminum nitride and zirconium nitride onto the silicon surface .
The gallium nitride was then deposited by another common technique known as organometallic vapor phase epitaxy , performed in a chamber , called a reactor , at temperatures of about 1,000 degrees Celsius , or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit .
As the zirconium nitride , aluminum nitride and gallium nitride are deposited on the silicon , they arrange themselves in a crystalline structure matching that of silicon .
" We call this epitaxial growth , or the ordered arrangement of atoms on top of the substrate , " Sands said .
" The atoms travel to the substrate , and they move around on the silicon until they find the right spot . "
This crystalline formation is critical to enabling the LEDs to perform properly .
" It all starts with silicon , which is a single crystal , and you end up with gallium nitride that 's oriented with respect to the silicon through these intermediate layers of zirconium nitride and aluminum nitride , " Sands said .
" If you just deposited gallium nitride on a glass slide , for example , you would n't get the ordered crystalline structure and the LED would not operate efficiently . "
Using silicon will enable industry to " scale up " the process , or manufacture many devices on large wafers of silicon , which is not possible using sapphire .
Producing many devices on a single wafer reduces the cost , Sands said .
Another advantage of silicon is that it dissipates heat better than sapphire , reducing damage caused by heating , which is likely to improve reliability and increase the lifetime of LED lighting , Oliver said .
The widespread adoption of solid - state lighting could have a dramatic impact on energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with electricity generation since about one - third of all electrical power consumed in the United States is from lighting .
" If you replaced existing lighting with solid - state lighting , following some reasonable estimates for the penetration of that technology based on economics and other factors , it could reduce the amount of energy we consume for lighting by about one - third , " Sands said .
" That represents a 10 percent reduction of electricity consumption and a comparable reduction of related carbon emissions . "
Incandescent bulbs are about 10 percent efficient , meaning they convert 10 percent of electricity into light and 90 percent into heat .
" Its actually a better heater than a light emitter , " Sands said .
By comparison , efficiencies ranging from 47 percent to 64 percent have been seen in some white LEDs , but the LED lights now on the market cost about $ 100 .
" When the cost of a white LED lamp comes down to about $ 5 , LEDs will be in widespread use for general illumination , " Sands said .
" LEDs are still improving in efficiency , so they will surpass fluorescents .
Everything looks favorable for LEDs , except for that initial cost , a problem that is likely to be solved soon . "
He expects affordable LED lights to be on the market within two years .
Two remaining hurdles are to learn how to reduce defects in the devices and prevent the gallium nitride layer from cracking as the silicon wafer cools down after manufacturing .
" The silicon wafer expands and contracts less than the gallium nitride , " Sands said .
" When you cool it down , the silicon does not contract as fast as the gallium nitride , and the gallium nitride tends to crack . "
Sands said he expects both challenges to be met by industry .
" These are engineering issues , not major show stoppers , " he said .
" The major obstacle was coming up with a substrate based on silicon that also has a reflective surface underneath the epitaxial gallium nitride layer , and we have now solved this problem . "
The research , based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy through its solid - state lighting program , is part of a larger project at Purdue aimed at perfecting white LEDs for lighting .

Planets Align Over Australian Radio Telescope Array
Credit & Copyright : Graeme L. White & Glen Cozens ( James Cook University )
Explanation : Last week , Mercury , Venus , and the Moon all appeared close together in Earth 's sky .
This picturesque conjunction was caught on camera behind elements of the Australia Telescope Compact Array ( ATCA ) near the town of Narrabri in rural New South Wales .
The ATCA consists of six radio telescopes in total , each one larger than a house .
Together they form one of the highest resolution measurement devices in the world .
Impressive planetary conjunctions occur every few years .
Involving the brightest objects in the night sky , this alignment was easy to spot just before sunrise .
In the picture , taken on the morning of March 6 , Mercury is the highest of the three bright celestial beacons .
On June 30 , 2008 , a settlement agreement was reached between Dr. Steven Hatfill and agencies of the U.S. Government .
Dr. Hatfill had sued the FBI and the Department of Justice for violations of the Privacy Act , claiming that they had given members of the media confidential information about him from confidential government files .
The Department of Justice admitted no wrong doing but agreed to pay Dr. Hatfill $ 5.8 million to settle all claims against the government .
Dr. Hatfill agreed .
The True Believers who were and who remain firmly convinced that Dr. Hatfill is the anthrax mailer are pointing out that the settlement does not prove Dr. Steven Hatfill 's innocence .
The fact that America 's system of laws is based upon the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty means nothing to a True Believer .
Other True Believers who feel just as strongly about their beliefs that Dr. Hatfill did NOT send the anthrax letters see the Hatfill settlement as proof that their own personal beliefs about who sent the letters are correct .
For example , those who believe that Saddam Hussein or al Qaeda sent the anthrax letters endlessly argue that they knew all along that Dr. Hatfill was innocent , because they know beyond any doubt that Saddam Hussein or al Qaeda sent the anthrax letters .
Facts mean absolutely nothing to those who truly believe .
They can rationalize anything .
They have their own facts -- very selectively acquired with absolutely no objectivity .
They start with a firm belief and then accumulate facts which they can twist and distort to prove that their beliefs are true .
And if you dispute them or try to show how the facts dispute them , they will tell you that you are closed minded .
In the end , it will all boil down to a single question :
Can you conclusively prove to them -- beyond any doubt -- that they are wrong ?
If you cannot , then , to them , that is proof that they are right .
If you tell them that proving the negative is impossible and that you also cannot prove that aliens from outer space did n't send the anthrax letters , they will just shake their heads and tell you that you are hopelessly closed - minded and unable to see the truth .
I 've also been contacted by many people who seem absolutely convinced that someone else -- not Dr. Hatfill , not al Qaeda , not Saddam Hussein -- sent the anthrax letters .
One person even has a web blog where her " person of interest " is described .
I 've had dozens of such people contact me over the years , identifying dozens of such " suspects "
Not all are True Believers , and , while proof might possibly convince a few of them that they are wrong , without the arrest of the actual anthrax mailer , such proof is hard to come by .
And I cannot argue the merits of their beliefs without going into detail on the merits of my analysis as to who I think most likely sent the anthrax letters .
With one exception , none of us want to do as those conspiracy theorists did with Dr. Hatfill and publicly identify another " person of interest " who may be totally innocent .
But there is one exception -- besides Dr. Hatfill -- who many True Believers are totally willing to name every chance they get .
Dr. Philip M. Zack ( & Dr. Marian K. Rippy )
On December 19 , 2001 , The Hartford Courant printed an article titled " Turmoil In A Perilous Place " which described how an Egyptian - born , naturalized - American citizen and former USAMRIID employee named Dr. Ayaad Assaad had been questioned by the FBI as a result of a letter which had been sent to the authorities describing Dr. Assaad as a " ' potential terrorist ' with a grudge against the United States and the knowledge to wage biological warfare against his adopted country . "
The FBI told Dr. Assaad that they had no reason to believe what was in the letter , and , after the brief interview , they let him go .
But when interviewed by the reporters from the Courant , it turned out that Dr. Assaad had his own theory about who had sent that letter about him .
Since the letter was mailed before it was known that someone had sent anthrax through the mails , " My theory is , whoever this person is knew in advance what was going to happen [ and created ] a suitable , well - fitted scapegoat for this action , " Assaad said .
" You do not need to be a Nobel laureate to put two and two together . "
He connected it all to events which occurred before Easter of 1991 , just after the Gulf War ended , when some USAMRIID scientists sent an incredibly childish letter to Dr. Assaad .
The letter contained a lewd poem that was 8 - pages long .
The Courant describes it this way , The poem reads : " In [ Assaad 's ] honor we created this beast ; it represents life lower than yeast . "
The camel , it notes , each week will be given " to who did the least . "
The poem also doubles as an ode to each of the participants who adorned the camel , who number at least six and referred to themselves as " the camel club . "
Two -- Dr. Philip M. Zack and Dr. Marian K. Rippy -- voluntarily left Fort Detrick soon after Assaad brought the poem to the attention of supervisors .
Although there were " at least six " people involved , the only names mentioned are Dr. Zack and Dr. Rippy .
So , in some people 's minds that means that Dr. Zack or Dr. Rippy must or may have been behind the letter about Dr. Assaad , which , in turn , they believe was very likely sent by the anthrax mailer ( although the FBI did n't think so ) .
The timing of the letter is the only real reason for such a belief .
The day following that first Courant article , the same authors produced another .
On December 20 , 2001 , the Courant published an article titled " Anthrax Easy To Get Out Of Lab . "
The article says , All of the scientists interviewed by The Courant over the past week said it would be virtually impossible for an outsider to get into a ``hot zone ' ' lab and steal a biological agent such as anthrax .
But they agreed that someone already inside the institute could have taken vials of anthrax without much trouble .
Then , a month later , the same authors wrote an article titled " Anthrax Missing From Army Lab . "
Published on January 20 , 2002 , the article begins with this : Lab specimens of anthrax spores , Ebola virus and other pathogens disappeared from the Army 's biological warfare research facility in the early 1990s , during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there , documents from an internal Army inquiry show .
The article then describes something which , to some , appears very sinister :
The 1992 inquiry also found evidence that someone was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research , apparently involving anthrax .
A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery researcher , who left the misspelled label " antrax " in the machine 's electronic memory , according to the documents obtained by The Courant .
But far less sinster to others : " In January of 2002 , it 's hard to say how many of those were missing in February of 1991 , " said Vander - Linden , adding that it 's likely some were simply thrown out with the trash .
And who was the " someone " who entered the lab late at night ?
The article says : Documents from the inquiry show that one unauthorized person who was observed entering the lab building at night was Langford 's predecessor , Lt. Col .
Philip Zack , who at the time no longer worked at Fort Detrick .
A surveillance camera recorded Zack being let in at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23 , 1992 , apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy , a lab pathologist and close friend of Zack's , according to a report filed by a security guard .
Okay .
Even though this happened nearly 10 years before the anthrax attacks , it 's enough for some people to see a potential suspect in the anthrax attacks .
And it does n't make any difference that the anthrax spores used in the attacks were created no more than two years before the attacks .
According to The New York Times on June 23 , 2002 : Scientists have determined that the anthrax powder sent through the mail last fall was fresh , made no more than two years before it was sent , senior government officials said .
Dr. Zack 's name also shows up very clearly in a lengthy article on Salon.com dated January 26 , 2002 , which begins with this question :
Who tried to frame Dr. Ayaad Assaad , a former biowarfare researcher at the Army lab ?
Was it the same person responsible for last fall 's anthrax mail terrorism ?
Accusations are often disguised as questions .
However , the article also shows that Dr. Zack was almost certainly a long way away from the mailbox in Princeton , NJ , at the time of the anthrax mailings .
The 4th section of the Salon.com article says , Zack left USAMRIID in December 1991 , first heading to the Army 's Walter Reed Institute , then going to the private pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly , and then to a company in Colorado acquired by St. Louis ' Nexstar Financial Management .
So , at the time of the anthrax attacks , Dr. Zack was evidently living in Colorado .
While there 's nothing in the media about where Dr. Rippy was , some research indicates that she was most likely in Minnesota .
But , it was Dr. Zack who became the focus of theories by most people who saw a connection between those incidents from 1991 and the anthrax attacks of 2001 .
Zack may have been in Colorado , and the anthrax may have been made recently , but there was still one reason for some True Believers to suspect Dr. Zack .
Neo - Nazis versus Dr. Philip M. Zack
There are a large number of True Believers who have no problem stating that they believe Dr. Philip Zack is or could be the anthrax mailer .
And their beliefs are about as illogical as the beliefs that Dr. Hatfill or al Qaeda sent the anthrax letters .
These people , who appear to be mostly neo -Nazis , have singled out Dr. Philip Zack as their suspect , and they are very vocal about it .
They first started contacting me with their beliefs back in 2002 .
Since a little research showed there was no solid reason to suspect Dr. Zack , my thinking back then was that it was best to just ignore the people pointing the finger at him , since there 's no way to change the mind of a True Believer -- particularly a neo -Nazi True Believer -- and putting Dr. Zack 's name on my web site would just give the neo - Nazi beliefs more visibility , which is what they want .
( As with other True Believers , a few have even felt the need to threaten me because I argued against their beliefs . )
Why do neo -Nazis believe so strongly that Dr. Zack is the anthrax mailer .
Simple .
One neo -Nazi web site that points at Dr. Zack can be found HERE .
It says , " Prime Suspect is a Zionist " and , Jewish microbiologist Dr. Philip M. Zack may be behind the deadly anthrax contaminated letters that were mailed to NBC's Tom Brokaw , Senator Tom Daschle and others , according to FBI sources .
Another can be found HERE .
It says , The fact that the Anthrax Letters were NOT sent by an Arab Muslim but by a Jewish gentleman with the intent to FRAME an Arab Muslim strongly suggests that the entire sequence of recent events has been one gigantic frame - up , Another can be found HERE .
It says , If the FBI were truly interested in finding and apprehending the  Anthrax Killer ,  theyd be investigating Philip Zack , a Jewish American that once worked at Fort Detrick Maryland Another can be found HERE .
It says , Dr. Zack left Fort Detrick in December 1991 amid allegations of unprofessional conduct .
The Jewish scientist and others were accused of harassing their co-worker .
Another can be found HERE .
It says there is " Overwhelming Evidence Implicating Philip Zack . "
From my point of view , the " evidence " is far from " overwhelming " and the author 's key item of " evidence " is made clear in this sentence : ' Doctor Zack ' , a Zionist , who was a key suspect and worked at USAMRIID , a military lab at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
And how do all these web sites know that Dr. Zack is a " Zionist " :
The answer can be found HERE .
It says , Well , some research into the name " Zack " reveals that it is a fairly common jewish surname , derived from the Old Testament " Zacharias " .
Dr. Zack is jewish , and given his obvious , fanatical hatred of Arabs - we can safely deduce that he is a hard core Zionist .
The same reasoning using the same words can be found HERE , HERE , HERE , and HERE .
They call all " safely deduce " that Dr. Zack is a " hard core Zionist . "
However , there 's one BIG problem with their safely deduced reasoning : Dr. Philip Zack is a Catholic
On the morning of April 11 , 2008 , someone who truly believes that al Qaeda sent the anthrax letters sent me a clipping from the July 28 , 1974 , issue of The Zanesville , Ohio , Times Recorder .
Here is the section of that clipping which refers to Dr. Zack :
The U.S. Department of Energy announced today that it will provide $ 36 million for 15 projects to further the development of new technologies for the capture of carbon dioxide from the existing fleet of coal - fired power plants .
Today ’s 15 project announcements will focus on five areas of interest for CO2 capture : membranes , solvents , sorbents , oxycombustion , and chemical looping .
“ Currently , the existing U.S. coal fleet accounts for over half of all electricity generated in this country , ” U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel W. Bodman said in a release .
“ The projects announced today will combat climate change and help meet current and future energy needs by curbing CO2 emissions from existing coal - fired plants . ”
But carbon capture and sequestration , along with “ clean coal ” are still perceived by many as mythical technologies that are simply not cost effective .
My question is this :
If carbon capture and sequestration is such a central component of President Bush ’s broader energy vision , why are n’t they doing more about it ?
To put things in perspective , since 2001 the Bush administration has invested more than $ 2.5 billion in clean coal research and development – roughly the same amount it spends per week on the Iraq war .
Oh , and that $ 36 million figure mentioned at the top of this article ?
$ 36 million is roughly equal to what the U.S. spends on the Iraq war in two and a half hours .
Read more about the specific projects receiving funding at the DOE ’s website .

Remember when John Kerry and John McCain were allies ?
Friends ?
Potential ticket - mates ?
Comity , no more .
" What John McCain has done in his comments ** ... is that he has fully embraced willfully , openly , fully embraced the failed , tragic policy of the Bush Administration over the last seven and a half years , " Kerry said on a conference call today .
" He 's really defending a policy that is indefensible .
He 's proving every day that he does n't understand Iraq , or the Middle East , or the war on terrorism . "
McCain is embracing " George Bush post 9 - 11 war of choice strategy , " of which he is " Washington 's biggest supporter . "
McCain " failed to learned the lessons of 9/11 .
He is the candidate of the Iraq War mindset , a mindset that completely misunderstands and dangerously underestimates the threats of the 21st century . "
** = Actually , these were comments offered by McCain adviser Randy Scheunemann , who said on an earlier conference call that Obama , in commenting on terrorism here , was a " perfect manifestation " of the pre-9/11 mindset .
Richard Clarke , the former NSC official in charge of counterterrorism , dismissed the binary choice between treating terrorism as a law enforcement matter or a military matter , and Kerry noted that every Democrat in the Senate voted for war in Afghanistan .
Both Clarke and Kerry insisted that Obama 's approach to terrorism was comprehensive and not limited to any branch or single function of government : law enforcement , military , intelligence gathering .

Senate GOP morale goes down the ' tubes '
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Things had been looking up for the Senate GOP .
During an election year where their brand is less - than - popular , Republicans in the Senate were upbeat earlier in the week , as their message promoting offshore oil drilling seemed to be catching on .
Then , on Tuesday , Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) was indicted for allegedly making false statements in his financial disclosures , leaving the GOP brass " speechless and saddened , " reports Roll Call .
Stevens , 84 , accused of making seven false statements related to over $ 250,000 in gifts from an oil services company , is one of the most senior GOP Senators in Congress .
" ' I 've known Ted Stevens for 28 years and Ive always found him to be impeccably honest , ' Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) said , " wrote John Stanton .
" ' I think he has shown tremendous leadership in the Senate .
...
We all have unexpected moments in our careers , ' Sen. John Warner ( R - Va. ) offered .
' We have to work through them .
I wish him the best . ' "
Even some Democratic Senators were left grasping to Stevens ' innocence , said Stanton , reporting a " somber reaction " during a Democratic luncheon on Tuesday .
Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) in particular espoused his belief his GOP colleague is innocent , while others , such as Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , said the Senate is more like a family than anything , and that he would never " wish ill to Sen .
Stevens or his family . "
Even while declaring his innocence , Sen .
Stevens was forced by GOP rules to give up his ranking member status on the Science and Transportation , Commerce Committee and Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense .
During a Tuesday press conference , at which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) and Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) were expected to discuss the Republicans ' energy initiatives , McConnell instead spent less than a minute at the microphone .
" ' Let me just say that the Republican Conference , like you , just learned of this news , ' " said Roll Call .
" We 'll no doubt have more to say about it later .
But for the moment , I m going to be joining [ Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) ] and see if we can move forward on the energy package that we may be voting on later today , ' McConnell said before walking off without taking questions . "
Excerpts from article : # GOP
Senators believed they were gaining momentum with their message on energy , one of the few bright spots in an election year that portends bruising losses for the minority party .
But then the bombshell hit  that Stevens had been indicted on seven counts for not reporting more than $ 250,000 he received in gifts from an oil services company .
That news trumped their improving fortunes as it swept through the Senate , leaving lawmakers speechless and saddened .
...
Alexander canceled an afternoon press conference with House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam ( Fla. ) that was intended to accuse Democratic leaders of shielding their presumptive presidential nominee , Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill. ) , from casting politically difficult votes on drilling for more oil .
Asked whether the Republicans had been knocked off their game , Alexander morosely stated ,  We have our jobs to do , and well keep doing it . ... News of Stevens legal troubles hit Republicans during their weekly Tuesday luncheon where they had planned to discuss whether to accept Reids offer on amendments .
They left lunch only to be greeted by a barrage of questions about Stevens future , not energy policy .

Occasionally he says something with which I disagree , but usually it ’s on a subtle point , or it ’s an issue where his passion for doing things one way is motivated by his preferred platforms : Windows and the web .
Today Joel shared a very short and dangerous pronouncement on the use of hidden and disabled menu items :
A long time ago , it became fashionable , even recommended , to disable menu items when they could not be used .
Do n’t do this .
Users see the disabled menu item that they want to click on , and are left entirely without a clue of what they are supposed to do to get the menu item to work .
Instead , leave the menu item enabled .
If there ’s some reason you ca n’t complete the action , the menu item can display a message telling the user why .
He ’s absolutely right about hidden menu items , but on the subject he emphasizes , disabled menu items , he ’s absolutely wrong .
Joel argues that instead of disabling a menu item , applications should leave them enabled , and instead display an informative message when the user tries to use them .
This solves one problem : that of the user who is perplexed as to why a menu item is disabled .
I recognize and applaud the desire to fix this issue .
But enabling every menu item creates more usability problems than it solves .
Disabled menu items convey valuable information .
Users who are skimming menus in order to figure out what to do are trained by years of experience to skim past disabled items and look for enabled ones instead .
The more complex the application is , the more valuable this dichotomy becomes .
In essence , disabling menu items gives application designers a means of “ funneling ” user attention to the actions in an application that will actually work at this moment in time .
Sure , it ’s frustrating when you can’t figure out why a menu item is disabled .
But what would be unbelievably frustrating is drowning in a sea of enabled menu items , for which the application offers no immediate usability guidance .
Instead of skimming past disabled items , a user could be forced to select several , each time receiving a valuable instruction ( punishment ) as to why it was a worthless move .
In time the user would learn to avoid these irritatingly enabled menu items , but they would be offered no future assistance in actually avoiding them .
Joel is right that it ’s a bad idea to outright hide menu items .
Users become comfortable with an application by learning its topography : where each menu item is in relation to its menu and the other items in that menu .
When you go about willy - nilly removing and adding items , it can cause confusion .
If you ’ve ever visited an old home town after years away , you know this problem .
You ’re sure your favorite restaurant is around here somewhere , but so many of the shops and landmarks have changed , it ’s hard to find it as quickly as you once could .
Joel ’s suggestion may increase the learnability of an application in one very specific way , but at the expense of long - term usability .
Although it can be argued that an application needs to be learnable in order to attract long - term users , I think user loyalty will be greater when the usability of the application is maximized .
What would be a better solution ?
The idea is to answer the naive user ’s question : why is the menu item disabled ?
For this purpose I can think of many solutions .
The application might show tool tips as the mouse hovers over the disabled menu item .
Or if the problem is especially grievous , it could warrant a dedicated reference page in the documentation , where users could easily look up the cause of their frustration .
The point is to build a framework for application learnability that does not seriously affect the usability of the application for experienced users .
It ’s not often I get to say it , but hear me loud and clear today : do n’t listen to what Joel says about menu items !
It has been a long - held assumption that poor nations will not support efforts to protect the environment since their citizens are too preoccupied with meeting basic needs , such as food and housing .
However , a new study in The Sociological Quarterly reveals that citizens of poorer nations are just as concerned about environmental quality as their counterparts in rich nations .
Riley E. Dunlap , PhD , of Oklahoma State University and Richard York , PhD , of the University of Oregon compared results from four large cross-national surveys , each conducted in several dozen nations ranging with differing economic statuses .
Representative samples of citizens were surveyed in each nation .
Results showed that citizens of poorer nations were equally if not more concerned about the environment compared to citizens in wealthier countries .
The citizens of the poorer nations were supportive of efforts to solve environmental problems .
The authors believe that previous studies failed to recognize that environmental problems are often a threat to material welfare and not just quality of life .
For example , deforestation may threaten the livelihoods of people who depend on forests for firewood , food sources , and economic products .
“ Our results suggest that well - designed policies to promote sustainable development will have more appeal to citizens of poor nations than is often assumed , ” the authors conclude .
In Basra , some worry militias just ' hiding behind fake walls '
BASRA , Iraq — Behind a false wall in a house in a posh neighborhood of Basra , there is a clue that the rogue militias who used to rule this city have n't completely vanished .
In the well - concealed storage space , Iraqi police discovered 1,100 pounds of plastic explosives and dozens of EFPs — the armor - piercing roadside bombs called " explosively formed penetrators " that are the No. 1 killer of U.S. troops in Iraq .
Militants would never have left such a large cache unless they planned to return one day soon , police Lt. Khaled Mohammad said .
" This is where the militias have gone , " Mohammad said , pointing to the ripped - out wall .
" They 're hiding behind fake walls , wearing fake clothes , pretending to be respectable citizens , but they have n't disappeared . "
On the surface , Basra is the safest it has been in years .
Since U.S. - backed Iraqi security forces regained control from Shiite militants in March , this vital port city and oil hub has become an example of the Iraqi government 's improved ability to restore security in formerly lawless areas .
Whether the peace holds in Basra , or whether the militants regroup and seek revenge as many Iraqis fear , will be a test case of Iraq 's ability to govern itself .
As U.S. troop levels continue to decline in the months and years ahead , more responsibility will fall on Iraq 's military and its politicians to not only subdue their armed enemies , but also to determine what way of life will take their place .
" Basra is a turning point for Iraq , " said Lt. Gen. Hussein al - Awadi , the commander of Iraq 's paramilitary national police force .
In this city of about 1.5 million , there are signs of a rebirth of the secular , relatively moderate customs that once distinguished Iraq from most of the rest of the Middle East .
Musicians , banned in the name of Islam when militants ran the city , play openly in the city 's streets .
Women let their veils slip without fear .
At a recent graduation party at Basra University , there was a DJ and dancing for the first time in years .
Even alcohol , though still technically illegal , is widely available on the black market .
Cockfights , which were also banned , have again become a popular pastime .
Perhaps the surest sign that radical Islamist militias no longer hold sway here came last week , when local councilman Nazar Aziz complained to the local news media of sexual discrimination in the school district — against men .
Of the 1,532 teachers hired since April , 1,300 have been women , he said .
However , as elsewhere in Iraq , there are lingering fears that the progress might be temporary .
For example , a boy caught selling beer on the city 's waterfront was shot and killed in May .
Residents say the militants still lurk , waiting to reassert themselves as soon as government forces withdraw .
" I 'm afraid to talk ; they are still watching everything , " says Haidar Abdel Zaher , 25 , a resident of the Hayaniya neighborhood , which was one of Basra 's most dangerous militia strongholds until recently .
" The militias are still here , and the army wo n't be here forever .
If they see me talking with a foreigner , they 'll just wait until the army moves on to other battles and kill me then , " he said .
Many militants have gone undercover within the city , says Iraqi Brig .
Gen. Baha Hussein
Abed , deputy commander of the Iraqi army 1st Division 's quick reaction force .
Others have fled — at least for now — to safe havens in Iran and elsewhere in Iraq , he said .
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker acknowledged the uncertainty of the recent gains against the militias when he told journalists June 5 that it is n't clear whether " the militia era is over " in Iraq or it 's just a " tactical pause .
"
Trouble lurks
The weapons cache hidden behind the false wall underscores the threat that militias still pose .
Iraqi security forces stumbled upon the stockpile on a tip from its former resident , a Sunni police colonel who fled Basra two years ago when he received a death threat .
He returned this month after hearing that Basra was improving and directed police to his old home , which had been turned into a militant safe house .
As police searched the home , the colonel pointed to a white plaster wall where a closet door had once been , said Mohammad , the police lieutenant .
" He came in and said there used to be a door here , " said Mohammad , pointing to a storage space behind the ripped - out wall .
" We would n't have found it otherwise . "
Other such caches are buried in fields and hidden under floorboards throughout Basra , said Abed , the Iraqi army general .
The army has unearthed some of those weapons caches and arrested more than 1,500 suspected militants , including 70 % of the militias ' leadership , Abed said .
" We are dealing now with the smaller guys , the tail end , " he said .
Tail end or not , whoever remains in Basra still has bite .
Even though security forces are deployed throughout the city , militants continue to strike at critics and those who flout their austere vision of Islam .
Over the weekend , the head of Basra 's intelligence department was killed in a drive - by shooting in eastern Baghdad , the Associated Press reported .
Brig .
Gen. Jabar Musaid had played a leading role in the recent crackdown against Shiite militias in Basra .
Zaher , the frightened Basra resident , said one of his relatives was killed in May after he criticized the militias in a street - corner interview with an Iraqi television station .
A pair of Shiite clerics loyal to the government were killed in April .
Since the government declared victory in Basra in April , there have been three bombings by militants at newly reopened music shops , which are symbols of the city 's renaissance .
" The people who do this have stones for brains , " said Khairalla Qassem , who plays in a local music troupe that was attacked during a concert last month .
" Unfortunately , they 're still out there and still forcing us to live in fear . "
Qassem rolls up his left pants leg to reveal a fresh 6 - inch - long scar on his knee .
In early May , Qassem was playing Basra 's unique folk music , known as the Khashaba , at a wedding party in a private garden when someone tossed a grenade over the wall .
" Suddenly there was an explosion , and everyone was screaming , " Qassem said .
" The music stopped . "
No one died in that attack , or in the subsequent three bombings that ripped through Qassem 's music shop and the one next door , but the message was clear : Basra 's musicians were not out of danger , even if the militias were out of sight .
The most recent bomb exploded June 9 , shattering the front window and ripping holes through the sheepskin hides stretched over the store 's tambourines and hand drums .
Rebuilding Basra Success in Basra depends on more than uprooting militants , said Akil al - Furrayji , a local council member who has thrown his support behind the government since the spring offensive .
Militia sympathizers hold many positions in local government bodies , he said .
Though the gun-toting militants have largely disappeared , their allies within the bureaucracy continue to fight in more subtle ways .
The local council reinstituted a ban on alcohol that the militias had when they ruled Basra , despite a federal Iraqi law that prohibits such bans .
The central government 's decision to fire 15 heads of local government agencies who were accused of being soft on the militias has met stiff local opposition .
" The Shiite militias and the Islamic parties that backed them are struggling to retain power now , " al - Furrayji said .
" As long as the roots of the problems are n't solved , with jobs , development and political deals , I fear that the violence can return even worse than it was before . "
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has signaled that rebuilding Basra is a top government priority .
He earmarked $ 100 million to kick - start the city 's economic fortunes and assigned his justice minister , Safa al - Safi , to remain in Basra to head the effort .
Al - Safi said the money will target key infrastructure lacking in Basra , including health care , education , sewage and electricity .
" We hope this money will be used to allow the people to benefit as much as possible , " al - Safi told local leaders this month .
" The projects will begin very soon . "
The promise of reconstruction contracts and a say in how the money will be spent is a powerful carrot the government can use to get support from political and tribal leaders , al - Furrayji said .
" All the reconstruction money is in the hands of the central government now , so people who once opposed the government are now being supportive , " he said .
Elsewhere in Iraq , such as in Sadr City , another Shiite militia stronghold in Baghdad , the government has been slow to distribute such funds .
" In the end , you wo n't defeat the militias with force , only with politics , " al - Furrayji said .

Most unfortunately , American - style fascism , after learning how to walk between 1898 and 1918 , took its Great Leap Forward under Franklin Delano Roosevelt , thirty - second President of the U.S.A. ( 1933 — 1945 ) .
America has not looked back .
The toddler has attained maturity .
Not entirely fascist yet — nobody ’s perfect — we are far gone .
Recent financial events and rumblings are advancing America ’s fascism still further .
By the time we get where we are headed for , full - fledged hardening of the arteries will have set in .
Like the Third Reich , we will collapse .
But we have already come far enough that our mode of government should now be termed fascism .
Our government is not democracy or democratic republicanism .
It is fascist .
We live in a fascist country , and increasingly so .
According to dictionary.com , a fascist State has such features as a dictator with great powers , the suppression of criticism and opposition , regimentation of business , etc. , and aggressive nationalism .
I give us a high grade , almost an A .
We have the dictator with great powers .
That would be Congress and the President .
There is almost nothing that they have not done already and could not do to us " legally . "
A man could not grow a tomato in his back yard if Congress told him not to .
The Federal government has detailed and sophisticated operations and means to quiet criticism and opposition .
There are not yet concentration camps filled with dissidents , although we are coming nearer to that in the treatment of suspected terrorists .
But the mainstream media has , nevertheless , been brought into a condition of remarkable quietude and docility .
The marked deterioration in adhering to the Bill of Rights under Bush II may be placed under this heading .
Regimentation steadily increases , symbolized by what any ordinary air traveler must endure .
But behind the scenes , control over every corner of one ’s personal life has increased .
Toilets , cars , lightbulbs , washing machines , draining land , investing , medical care , education — you name it , the State is telling us what to do and how to do it , or else .
In the realm of business , agriculture is regimented as are most other industries .
There is regimentation in every facet one can think of from hiring to firing , and from product safety to Sarbanes - Oxley .
Aggressive nationalism we have with a vengeance , and have had for almost our entire history as a nation .
Our huge military - industrial complex that reaches deeply into business in many of the 50 states is the visible machinery that reflects this facet of American fascism .
The war in Iraq is yet one more manifestation of it .
LewRockwell.com might be said to be a website that documents American fascism and its growth .
Virtually on a daily basis , its articles document one or more of the four areas noted above : excessive State powers , stifling of dissent and opposition , regimentation , and aggressive nationalism .
The question is then often raised : What do we do about this ?
To which must be replied :
Why do we have a fascist country ?
There are a number of good replies , and more than one of them may be true .
The phenomenon is complex .
I wish to stress this reply at this time .
We have fascism because that is what we have wanted and now want .
We have voted for it , time and again .
Both major parties , and no other parties are worth mentioning , are fascist and have promoted fascism .
Votes cast for either major party are votes for fascism and fascist policies .
And why have we wanted fascism ?
Because we have wanted the government to solve problems that we ( mistakenly and falsely ) thought it could solve .
This is not the whole story , but our own complicity needs to be emphasized .
We ask government to solve the problem of financial security in old age , and it responds with Social Security , a program with dozens of negative aspects .
We ask the government to solve the problem of energy , and it responds by banning drilling and ethanol subsidies , etc .
We ask the government to solve the problem of Dust Bowls and impoverished farmers , and it responds with subsidies to rich farmers .
E.C. Riegel rightly observed " When government undertakes to solve man ’s problem for him it undertakes the mastery of society and it cannot be both master and servant . "
Government is our master .
It has the power to be our master , and we have given it ever more power to be our master , such as by amending the Constitution so that the income tax became legal , or such as by allowing legislation to set up the central bank we call the Federal Reserve System .
We would not rationally set up a master over us unless we thought we could control it , that is , make it also be our servant .
We thought we could limit its powers .
We thought wrongly .
For we ourselves went ahead and decided to give it even more and greater powers to solve problems that we personally should have been solving .
In attempting to solve one set of problems , we created an even larger problem , which is controlling our agent — the government .
Dr. Victor Frankenstein could not control his own creation .
Frankenstein ’s monster was too powerful .
And we have discovered that we had and have no solution to that same problem .
Government cannot be both master and servant because as master it frustrates our every effort to make it serve us .
Government cannot be made to serve while being master .
As master , Government does not serve us .
It does not solve those problems that we hope it will .
Instead , it acts on its own behalf .
It acts in such a way as to secure its own power and longevity .
It acts so as to increase its powers .
Its aims are not our aims .
Therefore its deeds only by coincidence solve the problems we delegate to it .
We have fascism because we blundered .
We erroneously thought we had found a low - cost solution to our many problems , in the form of a servant called Constitutional Government .
Perhaps we blundered because we were greedy , or listened to the siren - song of statists and intellectuals who urged us on and told us fairy tales of great successes in other lands .
Or perhaps we were anxious to rid ourselves of our personal responsibilities .
Perhaps all of these played a part .
It makes little difference .
We , our forefathers and we today , still are the ones that have blundered and are blundering .
We are asking for an impossibility , which is that government solve problems that only we can solve .
And that impossibility takes concrete shape in the form of a fascist system in which the master has dictatorial power , suppresses dissent , regiments us , and involves us in an aggressive nationalism .
Who knows what other heinous facets of fascism will be revealed to us next ?
We are attempting the impossible , which is to grant some of us power over all of us , as our masters , while at the same time we lack the ability to make them serve us .
And that contradiction is resolved in the only way that it can be resolved as long as we continue to attempt it , which is on behalf of the masters and their powers .
The degree of fascism can always be heightened , and financial crisis is the ideal time to ratchet up the financial fascism .
Financial events this year show that the star of financial fascism is ascending , under the guidance of the Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson .
For starters , they want greater centralization of power under the Fed and merging of various separated regulatory agencies .
They want a financial regulatory czar with increased powers .
They want much greater control over investment banks .
They want Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to have direct access to Treasury ( taxpayer ) funds , thereby making the implicit guarantee into a virtually explicit guarantee .
They want these agencies to have direct access to the Fed ’s discount window at low rates of interests .
They have recommended government ownership of some stock of these lenders .
All in all , they want far greater control over investment banks , stock exchanges , brokers , and mortgage lenders .
There is almost no area of economic activity that Bernanke does not address in public .
He continually informs us that the Fed is working on this or that " problem , " be it a falling stock market , liquidity , deceptive credit card practices , mortgage loan practices , energy prices , tight credit , loose credit , the dollar ’s value , the wage and price setting process ( as he puts it ) , inflation , deflation , escalation of commodity prices , political volatility , the world ’s oil reserves , rapid industrialization in emerging economies , weakness in housing markets , etc .
I kid you not .
This menu is from just a single speech , and there is more !
Bernanke and Paulson are fabulous cheerleaders for financial fascism .
This is par for the American course .
They would not be delivering these messages unless they thought there was a receptive audience that is counting on government to solve or at least address all of these " problems . "
It does not matter that many of these problems have hidden origins that lie in government ’s own previous machinations , problems that were originated and raised to maturity by government .
What matters is that we the people have turned to government for solutions to these and many other problems .
What matters is that we are receptive to the messages of fascists like Bush , Bernanke , Obama , McCain , and Paulson .
What matters is that we are continuing the gigantic blunder of those who came before us and placed us on the fascist path .
The only way out of this trap is not to attempt the impossible , not to grant government such powers , not to ask it to solve our problems , and instead to assume the responsibility for solving our own problems .
The stark choice is between slavery and freedom .
And fascism means slavery .
The present course is slavery and will bring more slavery , without satisfactory solutions to any of our problems .
And the amazing thing is that the moment we abandon fascism and powerful government , we will discover that the problems that government is now exacerbating and making worse will suddenly become tractable and manageable .
So , what do we do about it ?
We work in any way we can to dissolve Government as we know it .
In my mind , that means making people aware of the blunder of thinking that government can solve our problems as our servant while at the very same time it is our master .
It is illusion to think that we control the daily machinations of Government by our votes .
We do not .
The only way to control this Government is to cut its legs off at the hip .
Nothing less than fundamental changes like ending the income tax and ending the Federal Reserve will do .
Better still , dissolve the Federal Government and stop living under a defective Constitution .

In a sunny morning of June 10 , 2008 , I was taking a walk on Coralway in Coral Gables , just several blocks from where I live .
It had rained earlier and all plants were wet and shiny under the bright sun light , so I took a camera with me .
I put a big yellow straw hat tied up with a bandanna so the hat would n't get blown by wind .
( scroll down to see photo )
This hat thing was to protect my face from the intense sun light as I easily get sun spots on my face exposed to the sun .
I simply grabbed this piece of fabric to attach the hat to my head to keep the hat on my head .
It never occurred to me that my outfit was too exotic for some xenophobic Coral Gables police officers .
In retrospect , the problem started the very moment the officer saw my outfit .
But the more apparent problem started when he saw me taking a picture of the police motorcycle .
Immediately I was treated like a terrorist / criminal / illegal / lunatic , with a series of interrogations .
He ordered me to hand over my camera , just to discover that all display on the camera was in the Japanese language .
This offended the police officer , not being able to read a thing , in a great deal , fueling to his xenophobia .
He had me help change the language setting to English , and after that he would not let me see what he was doing with my camera .
He actually ordered not to move .
I kept saying to him that he could delete only the pictures with the motorcycle but other digital images should be left alone .
He kept saying he would n't delete the other images .
Before giving me back the camera , he opened up the camera , took out my 1GB ( one gigabyte ) memory card , and threw it to the ground .
At that time I was just coping the situation because I was frightened with this big officer with abusive attitude .
I said , " Would you please not to do that ? " as I picked up the memory card from the ground .
I offered him to put the memory card back to the camera , but he still did n't allow me to touch my camera .
Finally he handed my camera to me , and again , scared me by shouting " Leave now ! "
Naturally I left the area in shock .
I had walked about a block away from the site when I discovered that my 1GB ( one gigabyte ) memory card was totally erased .
I am a visual artist and there were large number of high resolution images of my work and also my personal pictures in the memory card .
All gone .
For what ?
I will not be quiet about this .
Abuse of power by law enforcement officers is an ongoing national problem .
I do n't care how small and trivial my problem may seem .
I refuse to accept police abuse of any scale and any content .

To prevent scarring , keep the wound moist by applying petroleum jelly to it and covering it with a bandage .
This prevents a scab from forming , which is when scarring begins to develop .
While your wound is healing , massage the area in 15 to 30 second intervals throughout the day which can help prevent scar tissue by breaking down the formation of collagen .
At the same time , try to minimize movement that could pull the skin around the wound , since this may cause the scar to widen .
Another way to prevent scarring is to apply gentle and consistent pressure to the wound .
Try to use products like hydrogel and silicone sheets , since they were designed to add constant pressure to wounds .

Mustard on the moon ?
NASA scientists are suggesting that before sending humans back to the moon , we should launch plants there and watch them grow .
Dr. Chris McKay , my former astrobiology mentor at NASA , and plant biologist Dr. Robert Ferl of the University of Florida , presented their plan at a meeting of lunar scientists at NASA Ames this week .
The idea is simple :
Fly a simple plant habitat to the moon .
Bring along seeds ( you do n't have to care for them or feed them on the launch pad or the flight out ) .
Germinate them inside your lunar plant - growth module on the surface and see how they cope with the low gravity , temperature and pressure as well as the high radiation by monitoring their gene expression .
You can even go a step further and add lunar soil to the chamber to monitor the toxicity of the soil or the content of the soil .
Like the white mouse is for mammals , Arabidopsis thaliana ( a member of the Mustard family ) is the model organism for plants .
It can go from seed to seed in six weeks , has a small , fully sequenced genome , can live under low - powered LED light , and has simple techniques for introducing fluorescent marker proteins into its genome .
This allows the plant to be used as a highly sensitive bio-marker ( indicator ) for radiation damage or other stresses .
You simply attach a Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) to a protein known to be produced in response to a given condition or stress .
Then when you look at the plant under 488 nm light ( blue light ) you can see if it is glowing .
A green glow indicates where the tagged bio - marker protein is being expressed .
In addition to being GFP - markable , Arabidopsis has been shown to be able to grow at 10 kPa , or one - tenth of Earth 's sea - level atmospheric pressure and closer to Martian pressure .
Arabidopsis seeds can also be sterilized before launch to be compliant with planetary protection measures designed to insure that Earth microbes do n't hitch a ride to space and interfere with future search for life efforts .

The world ’s oldest democracy faces election every four years , and campaigns begin for the post of the president .
It is considered a great honour to be president of the United States of America .
Still , the citizens are mostly unaware of things happening around them in their own country and in places around the globe .
The election campaign is savage , and it makes you forget the very core principles on which this country was founded .
Time and again institutions like the Centre of Political Studies at the University of Michigan , the Forbes magazine and multiple news columns describe the American voter as an uninformed entity , who votes without the knowledge of what the party stands for , what are the objectives of the candidate and what changes is he promising .
There are two main parties in the political sphere namely , the democrats and the republicans , and the Democrats are known to be a party which support liberal policies on immigration , abortion , the abolishment of arms , military and healthcare .
In contrast , the Republicans are more conservative in nature and want capitalization to progress , and they work on privatisation of all governmental bodies and systems .
The US congress is all - powerful .
President is a dummy .
Conclusion
The United States of America is run on a federal structure which allows each state to make its decisions and create laws according to the culture and people of that state .
On a national level , the country is run and controlled by the House of Representatives which comprises of candidates from each state depending on the population and demographics , also known as the lower house .
The Senate has a total of 100 members , two from each state despite the size and population , each senator serves a term of six years and the United States Senate is also known as the upper house .
The Senate draws its powers from Article One of the constitution of the United States of America .
Its powers are enumerated in Article One of the U.S. Constitution .
The president is not as powerful as the congress , and he is only the commander of the US military and defence , he cannot make laws , pass bills and change taxations regulations by himself .
All bills are supposed to originate in The House of Representatives or the Senate depending on the kind of bill .
The congress and the Senate work as a government think tank and advice the president on matters of International relations , defence strategies , economic development and ratification of treaties .
The judicial system of the United States of America is dependent on the Senate , all justices of the Supreme court of the country need to approve by the Senate , and the case is the same for ambassadors in other countries .
America is one of the most influential nations in the world , Noam Chomsky ; a political philosopher says that after the end of the cold war , there were only two superpowers , the United States of America and the world public opinion .

Children of Divorce & Separation  Statistics Consequences of father absence It 's Official : The Experiment Has Failed
For the best part of thirty years we have been conducting a vast experiment with the family , and now the results are in : the decline of the two - parent , married - couple family has resulted in poverty , ill - health , educational failure , unhappiness , anti-social behaviour , isolation and social exclusion for thousands of women , men and children .
The following is from the newsletter Common Sense & Domestic Violence , 1998 01 30 Allegations of family violence are the weapon - of - choice in divorce strategies .
Lawyers , and paralegals in women 's shelters , call them " The Silver Bullet " .
False abuse allegations work effectively in removing men from their families .
The impact that the removal of fathers has on our children is horrific .
The following lists some of the consequences of the removal of fathers from the lives of their children .
The Impact on our Children I nter - spousal violence perpetrated by men is only a small aspect of family violence .
False abuse allegations are only a small tile in the mosaic of vilifying the men in our society .
They serve well in successful attempts to remove fathers from the lives of our children .
Here are some statistics resulting from that which show more of the whole picture .

71 % of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes .
70 % of juveniles in state operated institutions come from fatherless homes 85 % of all youths sitting in prisons grew up in a fatherless home .
Nearly 2 of every 5 children in America do not live with their fathers .
There are : 11,268,000 total custodial mothers
2,907,000 total custodial fathers
What does this mean ?
Children from fatherless homes are : 4.6 times more likely to commit suicide ,
6.6 times to become teenaged mothers ( if they are girls , of course ) ,
24.3 times more likely to run away ,
15.3 times more likely to have behavioral disorders ,
6.3 times more likely to be in a state - operated institutions ,
10.8 times more likely to commit rape ,
6.6 times more likely to drop out of school ,
15.3 times more likely to end up in prison while a teenager .
( The calculation of the relative risks shown in the preceding list is based on 27 % of children being in the care of single mothers . ) and  compared to children who are in the care of two biological , married parents  children who are in the care of single mothers are : 33 times more likely to be seriously abused ( so that they will require medical attention ) , and
The following is from an article in the ( Canadian ) Report Newsmagazine , Daddy 's girl matures later 
Stepfathers are shown to produce ' precocious puberty ' in young females , by Candis McLean , 2001 04 16 , p. 46 O NE in six girls in Britain now enters puberty by eight years of age , according to recent research .
This compares with one in 100 a generation ago .
" Girls are now having sex before their great - great - grandmothers had their first period .
Half of all girls in Britain will have entered puberty by the age of 10 , " announced Professor Jane Golding , director of the study at Bristol University 's Institute of Child Health last June after tracking the development of 14,000 children from birth .
In North America , one in seven Caucasian girls and half of African - American girls enter puberty ( develop breasts or pubic hair ) by the age of eight .
The parade of suggested triggers has included obesity , pollution and food additives ( see this magazine , Nov. 16 , 1998 ) .
New research , however , suggests a radical new theory -- that the father - daughter relationship is also a very important factor in when girls mature .
One of the leaders in this research , American Bruce Ellis , is a psychology professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch , New Zealand .
...
According to Prof. Ellis ' research , " The clearest finding to emerge from this research was that it was the absence of warm , positive family relationships , rather than the presence of negative , coercive family relationships , that forecast earlier pubertal development in girls . "
But , while warm relations with both parents predicted later puberty , the more relevant was " father - daughter affectionate - positivity " ; in fact , the more time spent by the father in childcare when the daughters were four to five years old , the less pubertal development by Grade 7 . ... Prof .
Ellis does not think that pheremone exposure within the home is the only factor at work .
He continues , " It is also likely that girls who have high - investing fathers in the home tend to begin sex and dating at a later age and thus have less pheromonal exposure to male dating partners in early adolescence . "
He concludes his article ( to be published in a book [ whose title is ]
Just living together : Implications of cohabitation for children , families , and social policy ) with the statement that the inherent instability of cohabiting unions -- an average duration of about two years -- means any children will be three times as likely to live with a biologically unrelated parent which could result in earlier onset of puberty .
In girls , this is associated with negative health and psychosocial outcomes : greater risk of breast cancer in later life , unhealthy weight gain , higher rates of teenage pregnancy , low birthweight babies , emotional problems such as depression and anxiety , and problem behaviours such as alcohol consumption and sexual promiscuity .
[ My emphasis  WHS ]
The Report article recommends to parents that to be successful in , Preserving childhood Stay married
Keep stress levels down ; do not overbook children 's activities
Prevent obesity
Provide a high - fibre diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables
Cut out fast food
Keep your daughter active ; get her interested in a sport or out playing with other kids
Throw out the TV
Send early - developing girls to same - sex or age - segregated schools to reduce exposure to older boys

Homes for € 1 and free money : nine places around the world that pay you to move there
When Montana 's governor , Brian Schweitzer , launched his campaign for re-election this summer he chose to be pictured on a horse lassooing a calf , and in silhouette against a barn door , presumably after a long hard day on the ranch .
What was not mentioned was the word Democrat - a party affiliation that in some parts of the west still conjures up associations with gay marriage , gun control and abortion .
Those sensibilities could be in for a shake - up as Barack Obama launches the Democrats ' most aggressive drive for years for votes from the Rocky Mountain west .
The strategy unrolling now across the west could turn once reliably Republican states such as Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico , and possibly even Montana into America 's new electoral battleground .
But it is Colorado which is viewed as the biggest prize .
" Colorado defines competitive , " said Dick Wadhams , the chairman of the state Republican party .
" I think either party could carry Colorado . "
It all hinges on how you define Democrat - a political label that has been comprehensively altered by a new generation of elected politicians in the west - and an impressive grassroots organisation now being assembled by the Obama campaign .
The big push begins next week , when some 50,000 Democrats are expected to converge on Denver for the party 's convention .
Democrats see the convention , especially the spectacle surrounding Obama 's nomination speech at a giant football stadium , as a chance to impress on voters in Colorado and other states the party 's renewed commitment to the west .
Obama 's first appearances on his return from holiday this week were in Nevada and New Mexico , and he is planning to campaign in Colorado after the convention .
" Colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign , " said Stephanie Mueller , a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign in Denver .
Not that John McCain , the Republican candidate , is expected to yield easily .
McCain has lived in Arizona for the last 25 years , and has made frequent visits to Colorado and Nevada .
But after eight years of an unpopular George Bush , Democrats believe that voters in Colorado and other states are disillusioned with Republicans .
They are frustrated with the rising deficit , the war in Iraq , and worried about the economy .
This could be Obama 's moment .
Unlike previous elections , when the Republicans rode a wave of emotion over terrorism , or issues such as gay marriage and abortion , this time voters ' concerns are down to earth : the economy and the need for renewable energy sources .
That has led to a blurring of the conventional political divisions .
In Colorado , unaffiliated voters outnumber Democrats and Republicans .
Soaring petrol prices have turned conservative farmers into ardent conservationists .
Even the Republican candidates have taken to carrying around solar film panels and using public transport to get to campaign events .
The early signs are encouraging for Obama .
The two candidates are virtually tied in Colorado , although a Rasmussen poll last week put McCain ahead of Obama in the state for the first time in seven months .
McCain and Obama are also running neck and neck in Nevada and New Mexico .
But Obama claims the edge in organising , grafting his campaign on top of rejuvenated local organisations .
In every state of the west , the Obama campaign has taken the lead in voter registration , increasing the number of Democrats .
In New Mexico , the campaign has opened 20 offices - compared to just five in the 2004 elections - and the organising effort has extended into rural areas that have not been involved in presidential contests for decades .
In Colorado , Obama 's campaign has opened 10 offices , including in towns seen as redoubts of the Christian right .
Even in Montana , a state of 950,000 , the campaign has deployed 40 paid organisers to register new voters .
Wadhams insists that much of the excitement about Obama 's organising prowess is over - stated .
" There is a lot of smoke and mirrors , " he said .
But Democrats across the west believe enthusiasm about Obama 's candidacy and the campaign 's investment in the region could make this the Democrats ' moment .
" That investment and the energy that we see on the ground in New Mexico will absolutely translate in November , " said Brian Colón , the chairman of the New Mexico Democratic party .
The challenge for Obama though will be to resist Republican efforts to brand him as an elitist , or a textbook liberal more at home in San Francisco or New York than in the west .
For the last 40 years , the west has sent only Republicans to the White House - except for 1992 when Bill Clinton benefited from a third party candidate who drained Republican support .
By 2000 , Republicans governed all eight states , and controlled 13 of the 16 Senate seats .
Then Democratic activists began to plot their comeback .
In Colorado , local entrepreneurs began funnelling money towards liberal causes , building up institutions that could put Democrats on a surer footing .
First came the thinktanks , then media monitoring organisations .
By 2004 , the local renewal efforts under way in Colorado and other states had a powerful patron in Howard Dean , the Democratic national committee chairman .
Under Dean , the Democrats began putting money and resources into building up party networks even in states which had little prospect of voting a Democrat into the White House .
Western Democrats credit the strategy with gaining a foothold for the party even in staunchly Republican states such as Utah and Wyoming , and say it will prove its value over the coming years .
" In a place like Montana there simply were n't the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non-election years and so it was very difficult , " said Schweitzer .
" It kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates , maintaining voter files , making sure we have county committees that are working and organised . "
At the same time , the Democrats began recruiting a new generation of organisations , and began scouting for political candidates who could appeal to moderate voters in the west .
Eight years on , five of the eight governors of western states are now Democrats , and five of the 16 senators .
Betsy Markey , who is hoping to unseat a Christian right member of Congress in Colorado , has a simple formula for success that Obama might want to heed .
What makes a successful Democrat in the west ?
" The government not telling you how to live your life and what to do , " she said .

DIY Electric Motorcycle Kicks Butt , Gets 300 eMPG
A year ago , EcoModder forum member Ben Nelson got an old , non-running motorcycle and converted it to electric drive .
He ’d never had a motorcycle before and was n’t an expert with electric vehicles , but in true DIY nature , he learned as he went along .
The bike was never designed to be a fast , flashy race bike , but rather a cheap and effective way to get around town in style .
Ben is currently building an electric car , but by all accounts a motorcycle is a great ( and slightly less expensive ) step down the road to electric vehicles .
In the end Ben had built himself a motorcycle with speed up to 40 mph and a range of around 15 miles , all for less than $ 2000 .
The best thing about the conversion is that , unlike many , it is completely street legal , with full registration and insurance .
Here ’s what Ben has to say about the costs of this project :
$ 100 for original cycle
$ 500ish for motor ( used on Ebay )
$ 300ish for New Alltrax AXE 48 v 300 amp programmable controller
$ 160 EACH for 4 Optima yellow top 55 AH batteries .
I am also including in this total cost , a motorcycle safety class , new helmet , a year of insurance , lots of little trips to the hardware store , etc .
So , the total cost for the bike was really only about $ 1500 , with a few new parts ( like the controller ) that could ’ve been found used if you ’re running on a tighter budget .
Currently , the bike is only using three of those four batteries , as Ben is trying to find out how to mount the 4th battery and up the bike to 48 volts .
Comparing the energy content of gasoline to that used by the motorcycle , Ben ’s determined that on average , his bike gets the equivalent of 300 mpg :
This shows that not only is the electric version more efficient , but if you crunch the numbers comparing the current price of gas to the price of grid energy , you ’ll see that this motorcycle is not only cool and environmentally friendly , but has the potential to save a bit of money .
For more info on eMPG , check out this thread .
However , Ben ’s story is n’t all gumdrops and happy endings .
One day , while out riding the motorcycle he managed to blow up the controller .
He and the bike are fine and he ’s got it going again , but when attempting a DIY project like this , especially because it involves a vehicle responsible for your safety , it ’s always good to go in with open eyes and be ready for the unexpected .
That said , it was n’t as dramatic as it sounds .
Besides being a great ecomodder , Ben is also pretty good with video .
Check out these two that he put together , the first one is his neighbor ’s reaction to the electric bike and the second is Ben talking about the project :
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eUqNp70Gpk
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujydj6SBfxM
For more depth about the building and the tech specs behind this bike , check out Ben ’s site and his build thread .
More inspiration for EV motorcycles can be found at the motorcycle section of the Austin EV album .
You can even find Ben ’s bike on there .
UPDATE : I talked to Ben and he told me that he had in fact added the forth battery , and that with that and the system running 48v his top speed has been increased to 45 mph and the range to 20 miles .

Elementary , my dear Borat : Sacha Baron Cohen to star as Sherlock Holmes
Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen is set to trade in his fluorescent mankini to play the master detective Sherlock Holmes .
The controversial comedian will take up the role alongside fellow comic actor Will Ferrell as Watson , the investigator 's parter in crime - solving , according to Hollywood trade publication Variety .
The actors previously starred together as rival racecar drivers in the 2006 comedy Talladega Nights : The Legend Of Ricky Bobby .
Having a laugh : Sacha Baron Cohen and Will Ferrell are set to star in a new Sherlock Holmes movie
' Just the idea of Sacha and Will as Sherlock Holmes and Watson makes us laugh , ' said Columbia Pictures executive Matt Tolmach .
' Sacha and Will are two of the funniest and most talented guys on the planet , and having them take on these two iconic characters is frankly hilarious . '
Baron Cohen , who has a daughter , Olive , with Australian actress Isla Fisher , is currently working on Bruno , a film based on his flamboyant fashionista character creation .
Bye bye Borat : Sacha is trading in his mankini in favour of an overcoat , pipe and Deerstalker hat
Did you know goats could climb trees ?
Well , anyway , I did n’t but it turns out , goats climb trees very often in Morocco .

Algal Fuel One Step Closer To Becoming A Conventional Oil Alternative
July 31st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
A new milestone was reached recently in the race to make fuel from algae a conventional oil alternative : high - octane gasoline that is compatible with any gas - guzzling vehicle .
The feat was performed by Sapphire Energy , a company that manufactures “ green crude ” .
Sapphire uses single - cell algae to produce a chemical mixture that contains extractable fuel for cars and other transport vehicles .
While the green crude is chemically identical to crude oil , it is completely carbon neutral .
The algal energy does n’t require the use of agricultural land and water , and it deliver 10 to 100 times more energy per acre than crop - based biofuels .
The company hopes that their green crude will ultimately be injected into normal crude pipelines .
Fortunately for consumers , Sapphire is n’t the only company looking into “ Oil 2.0 “ .
Silicon Valley company LS9 is working on genetically modifiying single cell organisms to excrete carbon neutral oil .
Like Sapphire ’s green crude , the LS9 oil will also work in conventional vehicles .
Whether these efforts come to fruition as oil replacements remains to be seen — and it mostly hinges on questions of efficiency .
But we should find out soon .
Sapphire expects to start producing their green crude within 3 to 5 years .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush will headline the first night of the Republican National Convention , and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani will deliver the convention 's keynote address at the four - day political rally in St. Paul , Minnesota .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani will give the keynote address during the RNC convention .
The convention , which will take place from September 1 - 4 , will culminate in the nomination of John McCain as the Republican Party 's presidential nominee .
A video will introduce McCain before he delivers his acceptance speech September 4 , senior campaign aides tell CNN .
The Arizona senator is turning to close allies , former rivals , a former Democrat rumored running mates to address the convention in the days leading up to his acceptance speech .
A year ago , four of the speakers were competing against McCain for the Republican nomination .
Another speaker is Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee .
Two speakers represent the battleground state of Florida , and 10 have been rumored to be on McCain 's list of potential running mates .
McCain wanted the list of speakers to showcase the diversity of the Republican Party , said Rick Davis , McCain 's campaign manager .
" I think one of the things that is important , especially for John McCain , as unique a politician as he is , is to demonstrate the diversity and differences of ideology I would say of our party , " Davis said .
" I think one of the things that people forget about is we are not very monolithic as a party .
We really want to show some of that . "
Joining Bush on Monday will be Vice President Dick Cheney , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , Democrat - turned - Independent Lieberman , and first lady Laura Bush .

The last time Bush spoke on the opening night of a GOP convention was during the 1996 meeting in San Diego , California , while he was still governor of Texas .
In recent political history , the only other sitting presidents not running for re-election to appear on the first night of a convention were Bill Clinton in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1988 .
Giuliani will keynote the convention the second night .
He will be preceded at the podium by former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge , former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson , Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle , former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .
On Wednesday , McCain 's yet - to - be announced running mate will formally accept the vice presidential nomination , followed by the roll call for McCain 's nomination initiated by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal .
Prior to the GOP vice presidential nominees ' address , McCain 's wife Cindy , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , Minnesota Sen .
Norm Coleman , former eBay CEO Meg Whitman and former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will speak .
Leading up to McCain 's acceptance speech , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback , Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and Florida Sen. Mel Martinez will address the convention .
Davis also said that Romney will be making appearances in Denver during the Democratic National Convention next week .
McCain will slightly scale back but not entirely cease campaigning during the Democratic Convention .
He is scheduled to make an appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno Monday .
He will address the American Legion National Convention in Phoenix , Arizona , the same day .
The day after the Democratic Convention , Davis said McCain will resume " an aggressive campaign schedule " that will continue through his arrival in St. Paul .

It 's not exactly the pitter patter of tiny feet but Dublin Zoo 's latest arrival has been meeting the public for the first time today .
The newest addition to its animal family - a white rhino calf has been getting familiarised with its surroundings at the heart of the Phoenix park in Dublin ..
The 70kg female was born last week , and zoo keepers say mother and baby are thriving .
The rhino has yet to be named , but it is expected that a public competition will be launched to find a winning name .
It is the first rhino born at the Phoenix Park zoo in fourteen years .

Most people are unexceptional at following up : it sounds obvious , but it should n’t be this way , because followup ( I spell it as a single word ) is key to combining smaller achievements into bigger ones .
Actively following up on conversation is also a trait of people who ’re successful , focused , and relentless about living their dreams .
Lofty yet elegant — and if you excel at followup , you can be sure to incite delight wherever you go , too .
“ Correspondences are like smallclothes before the invention of suspenders ; it is impossible to keep them up . ” - Sydney Smith
Here ’s how I do it .
You ’ll need to find ongoing processes that work for you , but the main ideas are easy to get into !
Do n’t be the first to reply ( or at least , give it a little while )
This sounds counterintuitive .
Say you get a work email Cc:ed to you and several other colleagues .
Should you reply right away ?
Unless you ’ve already thought of a sure answer and / or it ’s time - sensitive , likely no .
Let it “ stew ” and even wait for someone else to reply first — you can star it in Gmail and check the thread a day or so later .
Why ?
First , you ’ll be less rushed .
That much is clear .
Second , by letting it simmer , your mind will have more space to digest the contents .
You ’ll be able to sleep on it , and if it ’s really a memorable email you need to give input on , your feedback will be richer and more worthwhile than something concocted in haste .
Third , you can also thank the person (s ) who did reply first for chiming , and consider their ideas — if they said what you had in mind , you save time , too .
A day is n’t too long anyway , and plenty of time to still be responsive .
Try it !

Well , it does n’t sound as exciting as life on the high seas assassinating renegade ronin , but here ’s what I mean :
When you get cool links shared with you , be they viral videos or articles of interest , they can be time - suckers and distractions from making progress on what you ’re doing now .
Sure you wanna check those links out , but not yet .
Instead of jumping on them right away , I use Firefox 3 ’s star icon on the location bar ( aka “ awesomebar ” ) to bookmark each page with a single click to an Unsorted Bookmarks folder .
You can access it later by going to Bookmarks menu >
Organize Bookmarks , as this lovely video tutorial will show you :
This is exactly what I ’ve been doing for several weeks , and I find myself a nice berth on the weekends to chillax and peruse through one link after another .
I get deeper into the content .
Some are blog posts which merit a comment from me ( a type of followup ) .
Others are clips I want to pass around .
And the rest which are n’t worth my time ?
They get deleted and forgotten .
Which is fine .
Related suggestion : save up video clips to watch on TV .
I do this with my wife : we unsubscribed from cable and line up YouTube & friends ’ madness to watch at dinner ( and other times ) .
With a DVI to video cable , we connected a MacBook Pro to our TV .
Not only did it save us money , it makes us less passive selectors of what we consume , and raises the quality of our entertainment .
And sparks discussion and sharing — followup !

By creating an intense , focused space for all this material , it places your experiences directly in - context of being receptive to both absorbing and feeding back information .
Clip it … to remind yourself !
There ’s no end of to - do reminder programs out there .
My means are simple : I use Google Desktop ’s To Do gadget ( included with default install ) which always sits on the left - hand sidebar of one of my dual monitors .
I quickly jot down short phrases when I ’m in a rush , then have the leisure of expanding on it later — you and even drag - and - drop to recorder , and affix manual [ TAGS ] for visual ease .
By now , you ’re noticing this and the previous 2 sections are about you controlling time .
In addition to bookmarks , I use Firefox ’s Scrapbook add - on for saving parts of webpages to read offline and refer to later ( it has a handy annotation feature which can highlight passages but I do n’t use that ) , and EverNote ( the offline app , not the version 3 beta ) .
My point being : you do n’t need the most feature - filled tools , just ones you habituate to using regularly .
For time - specific , recurring stuff , you ’ll want to set up alarms and appointments .
I use Google Calendar to remind me when to pay the bill and when I might expect mail - in - rebates to arrive ( so I can call if they do n’t ) — and oh yeah , it ’s very nice that Google Desktop also has a Calendar gadget which shows me the day ’s events .
It ’s unintrusive , clean , and saves me daily refreshes of the Gcal webpage , which is what most people do .
Do n’t be most people .
I ’m also searching for a simple , cheap , spontaneous voice recorder .
Got suggestions ?
This may be overkill for some folks , but if you ’re like me and have ideas sprouting out at odd hours of the day , you ’ll want to capture those sprouts because your creativity is worthwhile .
Respond to the best
What the heck does that mean ?
Simply , pay attention to remarkable , amazing comments .
And thankfully I ’ve seen a lot of them on Lifehack , like Shanel Yang’s . ;)

Eclectic questions you ’ve never heard before ( consider making a FAQ out of the ones you do get often )
Knowledge that adds to the value of your or someone else ’s post and makes it that much more useful , and
Observations which have a inimitable brand of humor …
That ’s what you ’re going to remember .
Those words , connected to those people , is what ’s worth continuing a discussion for .
The simple reason is : those people are more likely to followup with you , teaching you applicable knowledge and making you smile .
The best followup , as all healthy relationships are , is reciprocal .
Give and take .
If you ’re drained without inspiration , you wo n’t have the attitude and enthusiasm to followup .
Do n’t force yourself to be social , it serves no earnest purpose and will eventually be forgotten anyway in the sea of the Internet .
Time , once spent , is always depleted .
If you get a lot of thank - you ’s for something you posted , do n’t be pressured to type a different thank - you to each and everyone .
You could , if you ’re imaginative and feeling lively .
But do n’t force it out — flow .
You ’ll learn from experience , as I have over 10,000s of forum posts and blog comments ( and having earned distinguished status like being a Lifehacker star ) , what followup you get in kind .
Use subscribe / keyword reminders whenever possible
Obvious but underused , in my anecdotal experiences asking people if they utilize ’em .
Do n’t be passive : seek out integrated reminder systems !
Many different web services have various implementations .
You may be a forum poster accustomed to vBulletin ’s subscription system , or you may use email / RSS alerts ( different ways of getting the same info ) on a money - saving site like dealnews.com — which is a lucid way of following up on an item you ’ve wanted to buy for awhile , but think it should be cheaper .
Give it time and you ’ll be pinged when the price drops —
Price ! pinx is another tool that can help you .
I also have a bookmark folder in Firefox called “ Waiting for Answers “ .
It ’s a very special one , and I drop links to questions I ’ve asked on forums , blogs , etc .
I detest when the trail goes cold to my curiosity , and I check this folder every few days .
If longer than a couple weeks goes by without a reply , I ’ll post a reminder to “ bump ” things up .
Stuff resolved to my satisfaction of course gets a thank - you , and the bookmark is placed in a subfolder titled “ ANSWERED ” .
Also useful for customer support tickets !
Do n’t say “ Let ’s do lunch sometime ” if you do n’t mean it
This is mainly about your offline life : “ false followup ” is worthless .
Advertising
Do n’t tell a new acquaintance you want to have coffee at some indefinite point in the future if in your heart , you wo n’t .
Some will argue “ this is being polite ” .
I ’ll clarify that politeness means not lying to someone if you have no intention of keeping a commitment .
There are many other things you can say , and the easiest of all is saying nothing at all and smiling .
Economy of words frees your energy for acting on things that matter more .
Indulge in necessary terseness
It ’s better to be pithy than , well , something rude which almost rhymes .
Followup is largely about ( conversation ) flow , and tl ; dr work against being an effective communicator .
Be colorful , be engaging , but do n’t be boring .
Like music , have a sense of dynamics , do n’t engage in loudness wars .
Instead of monolithic , gargantuan writings , divide ideas into sections or multiple installments , as we ’ve seen from some of my fellow Lifehack contributors .
That has the benefit of attracting ongoing readers and allowing them to digest your opinion .
Again , it ’s about controlling your time .

If you ’re a frequent downloader and comfortable on the command line , then you need to try out aria2 .
aria2 is a cross platform download utility , similar to graphical download managers except that it uses less system resources .
aria2 has a number of invaluable features such as download resuming , BitTorrent and Metalink support , segmented downloading , downloading a single file from one or multiple servers ( including integrated BitTorrent and HTTP / FTP transfers ) , downloading many files at the same time , automatic error recovery / repair ( BitTorrent and Metalink downloads only ) , etc .
aria2 is a command line application , but do n’t let that scare you off .
You can use aria2fe , a graphical front end , if that makes you more comfortable .
Keep in mind that aria2 is more for heavy downloading , and if you want a webspider then wget would be a better choice .
How to use it
The easiest way to invoke aria2 is by typing aria2c URL / fileName
$ aria2c http://host/image.iso
The URL can be either a regular URL to a file , a URL to a . torrent file , or a URL to a . metalink file .
For BitTorrent and Metalink downloads , there are extra options available such as throttling upload speed , only downloading selected files , changing listening ports , and seed time and ratio .
To pause a download , press Ctrl - C .
You can resume the transfer by running aria2c with the same argument in the same directory .
Downloading identical files from multiple sources
aria2 supports multiple URLs for the same file .
You can specify them on the command line ( space separated ) and aria2 will download from multiple URLs at the same time .
$ aria2c http://host/image.iso
http://mirror/image.iso
This command will split the download between multiple servers .
aria2 can even download the same file from BitTorrent and FTP / HTTP at the same time , while the data downloaded from FTP / HTTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm .
Repairing damaged downloads
aria2 can repair downloads with errors by using the information in . torrent or . metalink files .
$ aria2c -M test.metalink --check-integrity=true
The -M option specifies a local file called test . metalink to get the information to repair the download .
Parameterized URLs
You can specify set of parts .
The following command will download part of the same file from 3 servers , do n’t forget to escape the parameter to avoid shell expansion .
$ aria2c - P ' http://{host1,host2,host3}/file.iso'
You can specify numeric sequence using [ ] .
This command will download image000.png through image100.png from the same server .
$ aria2c - Z - P ' http://host/image[000-100].png ’
The - Z option is required if the all URIs do n’t point to the same file , such as the above example .
Other options
aria2 has a lot more options , you can for instance use :
- T filename . torrent to specify a local . torrent file .
to specify a local . torrent file .
-M filename.metalink to specify a local . metalink file .
to specify a local . metalink file .
- i textfile will download all the URLs listed in a textfile .
will download all the URLs listed in a textfile .
-s for example - s2 will download a file using 2 connections .
for example will download a file using 2 connections .
-j for example - j5 will download 5 files concurrently .
aria2 has many other options .
To read the man page , type :
$ man aria2c

A Californian mother of three , who escaped from a Michigan prison 32 years ago , is back in jail , and will stand trial on prison escape charge .
Susan LeFevre , a 53 year old woman is said to feel " extremely uncomfortable " after she returned to prison .
Her lawyer William Swor hopes to move her case as quickly as possible , skipping the preliminary examination .
The woman was arrested in April outside her Carmel Valley home in San Diego .
In 1976 , she managed to escape from prison in Michigan after serving one year out of 10 to 20 sentence for selling drugs .
Her grandfather helped Lefevre to escape , waiting for her as she climbed over a barbed - wire fence .
In an interview after her arrest , the fugitive woman said that her involvement with drugs in younger age was connected to the feelings of devastation after her boyfriend 's death in the Vietnam War .
Swor is determined to fight both her initial drug sentence and the new escape charge in Saginaw County Circuit Court .
He added that LeFevre did not expect to face 10 to 20 years in prison after she agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and violation of drug laws more than 30 years ago .
Prosecutors said it was uncommon sentence for the 1970s , but according to the circuit court 's policy , all Saginaw defendants in heroin cases faced 10 to 20 years sentence , regardless of their individual characteristics or criminal records .
The policy was later considered improper by the Michigan Supreme Court .
Barbara Klimaszewski , one of the woman 's attorneys , said that if the LeFevre 's case took place today , the woman would get probation after pleaded guilty to selling small amounts of drugs .
The fugitive woman started a new life as Marie Walsh after she married Alan D.Walsh in 1985 , who did not know about an assumed identity of his wife .
Together they raised three children .

There is nothing we can do to change the past .
We should not dwell on the fact that George W. Bush has personally ruined our careers , destroyed our hard - earned home equity , and driven us into suffocating credit card debt .
Now is not the time for that .
You know what ?
I have had it with all the gloomy , depressing talk about the economy .
I think it is time for us to stop whining , get off our butts , and do something about this mess we find ourselves in .
As usual , the team scored precisely 23,145.0 runs in a perfectly precise execution of baseball .

With Great Wealth Comes Great Responsibility
As you know , over the past thirty years the success of Microsoft has allowed me to amass quite a personal fortune .
Watching my net worth grow to nearly sixty billion dollars has obviously been an exhilarating experience , but I ’d like to take a moment to share the most important thing I have learned on this wild ride :
With great wealth comes great responsibility .
More important than what I can buy myself with all this money is the good I can do for others .
As I finally say goodbye to the company that has brought me riches beyond my wildest dreams , what I most look forward to is dedicating more of my time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Through the Foundation , we hope to use this great fortune as an overwhelming force for good in the world .
Can we end the spread of malaria , a disease that kills millions of people every year ?
With money like this , it would be wrong of us not to try .
What about curing AIDS ?
Or spurring grassroots economic development in the poorest parts of the world ?
Or helping libraries to spread free knowledge around the world ?
Or researching new ways to bring safe drinkable water to everyone on the planet ?
These are just a few of the things you can do when you have virtually unlimited financial resources , as I do .
Being unbelievably rich is fun , but what is most rewarding is leveraging my affluence for the good of mankind .
Woo - Hoo , I ’m Rich !
Damn it feels good to be filthy stinking rich !
When I hit the jackpot with Bill at Microsoft , I knew immediately that the rest of my life was going to be kick - ass awesome .
Seriously , do you even realize how sweet life is when you can afford to buy yourself anything you want ?
Let me give you a few examples .
On the non-rich end of the spectrum , you ’ve got your hard - core sports fans that buy season tickets for their favorite team every year .
When you ’re rich , you buy entire teams and even stadiums .
I ’ve got basketball , football , soccer …
Hell , I ’m not even that much of a sports fan , but I gotta spend all this money somewhere , right ?
Normal people have boats .
I have a 416 - foot superyacht ( yeah , that ’s right , superyacht ) , with its own music studio , basketball court , two helicopters , and two submarines — two submarines !
Maybe you built model rockets as a kid .
That ’s cute .
I used a small portion of my fortune to build an actual spaceship that flew a dude into space .
Suck on that .
Speaking of space , how many science - fiction nerds can say that they ’ve got an entire freakin’ museum dedicated to their personal sci-fi memorabilia collection ?
One , that ’s how many .
( It ’s me . )
While you ’re running SETI on your PC , I built a huge - ass telescope to search for ET .
Here ’s my main point : Being rich is hella sweet .
There ’s no limit to what you can buy yourself when you ’re one of the richest people in the entire world .
U.S. natural gas reserves are far more plentiful than previously estimated , says an industry study being released today — a discovery that heralds a potential remedy to the energy crisis .
The report says the U.S. has up to 50 % more natural gas reserves than earlier projections because of higher - than - expected yields from 22 shale formations in 20 states .
The industry says the findings should prod policymakers to provide incentives to wean the nation from $ 4 gasoline and move to compressed natural gas as a standard fuel in many cars and trucks .
" Everyone knows natural gas is clean and made in America , " says Aubrey McLendon , chairman and CEO of Chesapeake Energy , the largest natural gas producer .
" The only question was is there enough to go around to run cars and trucks .
This proves that there 's plenty of natural gas . "
The U.S. has enough natural gas resources to last up to 118 years , or 2,247 trillion cubic feet ( Tcf ) , says the study by Navigant Consulting for the American Clean Skies Foundation .
That group is largely funded by natural gas companies .
The Potential Gas Committee , an independent research group , estimated in 2006 the U.S. has 1,530 Tcf of gas , an 82 - year supply .
The increase stems from greater production in the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachians and the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and Texas , says Kenneth Medlock , an economics professor at Rice University who worked on the Navigant study .
In recent years new drilling techniques have allowed companies to extract gas deeply embedded in formations of shale rock .
The new study is based on estimates by Navigant , state records and a survey of more than 60 large natural - gas producers .
John Curtis , the committee 's executive director , would not comment on the new estimates .
But he questioned the new report 's reliance on his group 's study , which did not estimate shale reserves , to reach its higher projections .
Medlock says actual resources are likely less than the 118 - year supply estimated by industry but much more than the current 82 - year projection .
Oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens recently unveiled a plan to replace 20 % of natural gas - fired power plants with wind energy and divert that gas to cars .
But McClendon says gas is so abundant there 's no need to channel it from power plants .
Yet to jump - start the industry , he says , Washington must provide incentives to automakers , service stations and consumers .

If there 's one thing that the new development manager has , it 's tenacity .
Joshua has been maintaining his company 's overly complex software for a while now , and found Dave 's eagerness and dedication to learn admirable .
Dave 's training was fast and brutal .
On his first day he was thrust into a task that only the QA lead had done before — deploying the latest software to the build server .
He had to learn it , as he 'd function as the backup when the QA lead was out ( and , coincidentally , he was out on Dave 's first day ) .
Fortunately , the QA lead had recorded some high - level instructions for deployments in the company 's internal wiki :
To build server : Determine what version the new server is Run buildserver .
bat VERSION_NO
Make sure the build succeeded .
Run automation tests .
To deploy server onto QA Log into QA server Take down server Run necessary SQL commands Copy over new jar files Bring server back up
To deploy server onto production Log onto production server
Take down server Run necessary SQL commands Copy over new jar files Bring server back up
When one of the developers came to Dave saying " I just made a massive checkin that changes how virtually everything is cached , " Dave was ready to zip into action .
The developer went on to explain that there was a high probability that the changes would break existing functionality on several pages and that they 'd need at least a week to test it all .
With a smile and a can - do attitude , Dave said he'd get it ready and email him when it was done .
Several hours later , the production server went down .
Everyone was scrambling to figure out what had gone wrong , and the same developer that had asked Dave to deploy the changes went to make sure everything was ok .
Without missing a beat or showing the slightest hint of worriedness , Dave cheerfully said " OK , just give me one sec ...
OK , try it again . "
The developer excused himself and verified that the produciton server was , in fact , online again .
Anxieties eased , production back to normal , the developer had the time to catch his breath and investigate the source of the problem .
He returned to Dave 's office again and began " I 'm really sorry to keep bothering you today , but something is n't sitting quite right with me .
When you were deploying my changes to QA - "
In the middle of asking the question , it dawned on him .
" W - when you were deploying , w - which environments did you d- deploy to ? "
Dave retained his smile , but his eyes narrowed .
Through his smile , he asked " what do you mean ?
I followed the documentation . "
What Dave had n't done , though , was stop after the " To deploy server onto QA " section .
He 'd totally ignored the headings and followed every step in the plan .
The potentially - everything - breaking change ?
After some panicked smoke testing in production , it appeared that everything was working OK .
They had gotten lucky .
Everybody won .
The developer 's change worked .
The business did n't have to run its usual expensive testing cycle .
Dave executed the deployment perfectly ( aside from jumping the gun on production ) .
And Dave took the opportunity to update the documentation ( and increase the font size of the headings ) .
The moral ?
Always deploy changes straight to production without testing them .
Wait , that can't be right .
The Device Has Been Modified

Eliezer Yudkowsky joins us from Overcoming Bias , an econblog devoted to human rationality and the cognitive psychology of mistakes .
And if you think that ’s interesting , you should see his day job .
The Sydney Opera House is among the most epic construction overruns of all time .
Initially slated to be completed in 1963 for $ 7 million , it was finally completed in 1973 for $ 102 million .
But do n’t look down on them : Experiment shows that , deep in our hearts , we all have an inner home improvement contractor .
One study asked students when they thought they ’d complete their academic projects .
Specifically , the students were asked for times by which they thought it was 50 % , 75 % , and 99 % probable they would ’ve finished already .
Care to guess how many students finished on or before their estimated 50 % , 75 % , and 99 % certain delivery dates ?
If so , better guess now , because I ’m about to tell you :
13 % of the students finished their project by the time they had assigned a 50 % probability ;
19 % finished by the time assigned a 75 % probability ;
and only 45 % ( less than half ! ) finished by the time of their 99 % probability .
This phenomenon is more generally known as the “ planning fallacy ” .
Roughly , the planning fallacy is that people think they can plan .
A clue to the underlying problem was uncovered by researchers who found that asking subjects for their predictions based on realistic “ best guess ” scenarios , versus asking subjects for their hoped - for “ best case ” scenarios , produced indistinguishable results .
See , when you ask someone for a “ realistic ” scenario , they envision every event happening the way they think is normal – which usually means , just like I planned it .
No unexpected delays , no unforeseen catastrophes – what people envision by default is the best - case scenario .
Reality , it turns out , usually delivers results somewhat worse than the “ worst case ” .
When you ask people to envision everything that can possibly go wrong , their schedule gets a lot closer to reality – but still not close enough .
Unlike most cognitive biases , the planning fallacy has a simple remedy – though I ’ll warn you , you ’re not going to like it .
The same researchers asked another group of students to describe highly specific plans for their Christmas shopping – plans that described where , when , and how .
Another group was simply asked when they expected to finish their Christmas shopping .
The first group , with the detailed plans , expected to finish shopping more than a week before Christmas – the second group expected to finish an average of 4 days before Christmas – and in reality , both groups finished an average of 3 days before Christmas .
That ’s right : detailed planning made the students more optimistic .
Why ?
Another study , done in Japan , helps to illuminate the answer : A group of Japanese students expected to finish their essays , on average , 10 days before the deadline .
They actually finished 1 day before deadline .
Asked when they ’d finished previous essays , they said : “ One day before deadline . ”
You see , you do have a reliable source of information about how well you ’ll do .
It ’s how well you did last time .
But the more details you visualize , the more chance you have to be optimistic – to visualize everything going exactly as planned – instead of remembering how long it took last time , when things did n’t go as planned .
A similar finding is that experienced outsiders , who do n’t know all the details and all the special reasons why this project is bound to do unusually well , but who do have a lot of experience on projects in that area , tend to be a lot less optimistic and a lot more accurate than the actual planners and implementers .
The “ inside view ” is when you generate your predictions and time estimates by thinking about all the unique details of how it ’s going to go this time – planning where , when , and how .
The “ outside view ” is when you deliberately avoid thinking about the special features of this project – deliberately avoid fine - tuning your estimate – and remember how long it took you to finish broadly similar projects in the past .
The inside view has its uses .
There ’s a certain amount to be said for , like , actually planning things ‘n stuff .
But figuring out how long your project will really take , is not one of those uses .
For schedule estimates , the outside view beats the inside view , hands down , every time .
So there ’s a reliable way to fix the planning fallacy , if you ’ve got the strength to stomach it .
Just ask how long it took you the last few times , without considering any of the special reasons this project will be different .
Better yet , ask an experienced outsider how long broadly similar projects have taken ( and be sure not to tell them the details ) .
You ’ll get back an answer that sounds hideously long , and clearly reflects no understanding of all sorts of important particulars .
This answer is true .
Deal with it .

Forget McCain : How Does Obama Stack Up Against Phelps ?
Subscribe to Portfolio magazineWill bloodmobiles soon be a thing of the past , like vacuum - tube televisions and glass milk bottles delivered daily ?
More important :
Will the use of embryonic stem cells , which became a heated issue during the 2004 presidential election , finally produce a breakout product ?
One that will squelch the controversy for all but a few die - hards who still prefer their milk in glass bottles ?
Researchers at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester , Massachusetts , announced the breakthrough a few days ago .
Working with scientists from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , and the University of Chicago , A.C.T.'s team says it has developed a method for making potentially unlimited and scalable supplies of synthetic blood from embryonic stem cells .
The findings are published in Blood , a scientific journal .
A.C.T.'s chief scientific officer Robert Lanza led the team .
If the claim holds up to scrutiny , it would be a huge boon for humankind , which until now has had to collectively open its veins to provide tons of this basic stuff of life for people who need extra blood because of injuries , surgeries or disease .
The discovery also would remove the danger of blood being tainted by pathogens that cause hepatitis , H.I.V. and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , among other viruses and bacteria .
But will this promise become reality ?
Advanced Cell Technology has made incredible claims before .
Under recently departed C.E.O. Michael West — whom some critics compared with the circus promoter P.T. Barnum — the company routinely asserted that stem - cell therapies were likely to reverse the aging process and grow replacement body parts , while most scientists were talking a more cautious line .
The company was the first to clone an endangered species , an Asian bovine called a gaur , which died soon after — possibly from causes unrelated to the cloning .
A.C.T. also claimed it had cloned the first human embryo , attracting worldwide attention , though the embryos grew to only a few cells in size .
Some blame the company 's over - enthusiasm for playing into the hands of stem - cell opponents in the Bush administration and elsewhere who were bent on squelching this new therapy .
President Bush severely restricted federal funding for stem - cell research in 2001 — restrictions that remain today , and are likely to until the next administration takes office .
Under Lanza , the company may not have fulfilled all of the promises made by West , but it has produced a string of solid discoveries and observations — though none have proved to be commercially viable .
Most recently , Lanza 's team has also induced stem cells to grow into retinal cells in eyes .
Creating synthetic blood has proved difficult ; decades of efforts have so far been in vain .
Several potential products are being tested in human clinical trials , most of them focusing on the critical function that blood plays in transporting oxygen .
Other products , however , have been abandoned when they either did n't work , or proved to have dangerous or deadly side effects .
Blood created by stem cells is very similar to the real thing , and may avoid the pitfalls with other , more artificial techniques .
If further tests confirm A.C.T.'s discovery — and , critically , show that the process is scalable and affordable — stem - cell blood may make the company more attractive to investors as it desperately seeks cash to carry on .
In July , a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that A.C.T. had $ 17 million in current liabilities , but only $ 1 million in cash and other current assets , the Boston Globe reported .
A.C.T.'s stock has been trading at 6 cents per share , down from $ 8 per share three years ago .
It 's hard to know what the new techniques will cost once scaled up , or what revenues the discovery will bring in ; Lanza says that he expects the company to know within two years if the processes will work .
Independent scientists are hopeful that the discovery will pan out .
" The problem with relying on donated blood is that there are always shortages , " Professor Alex Medvinsky , a blood stem - cell expert at the University of Edinburgh , told the Times of London .
" The ability to generate red blood cells in very large numbers would be a very big thing . "
robert hahn a darn good web developer
Building User - Programmable Websites
One of the things that I immediately picked up on when I studied Representational State Transfer ( REST ) was the notion that you could apply Object Oriented terminology to URI ’s quite easily .
Assuming that http://roberthahn.ca/ was a prompt , URI fragments such as book / search seemed to be pretty obviously an object / method call .
In other words , if you were to see this in program code , you ’d probably see book .
search ( ) .
With that realization , I saw a couple of avenues were thought experiments could be conducted .
The first avenue that I ’d like to discuss is whether it ’s considered legal to actually write object / method calls in the URI .
I have n’t properly finished this research , but my first look through RFC 3986 seems to suggest that while characters such as parentheses are reserved , whether they need to be encoded depends on the scheme that you are using .
As far as I know , parentheses do not require encoding for the http scheme .
Ok , so what does that buy me ?
That question segue ’s neatly to my second avenue of research .
How could I write programs with URI ’s ?
If want to design an OO interface to your application , you ’d realize that the only thing to do is to predefine a set of objects and methods , and expose the API to prospective URI hackers , which I ’ll dub ‘ yurihackers ’ .
So : Let ’s consider a hypothetical developer , Alex , building a web enabled address book for me , and wants to build some kind of API for people who will be using this .
For the purpose of the exercise , I ’m setting aside any considerations about how user - friendly writing OO syntax is , because I ’m talking to you - the - developer here .
If I ’m leaving anything as an exercise to the reader , figuring out how to make this user - friendly will be it .
We ’re going to start small , and we ’ll basically talk about three kinds of data this address book will store .
Those would be names , addresses , and phone numbers .
Alex decides to set up three URI - queriable objects : Person , Address , and Phone .
He then adds a basic set of methods for these objects , and , for the sake of keeping this post less long than it already is , preloads my addressbook data , into the database .
NOTE : all the URI ’s you ’ll see DO NOT work - this is a hypothetical example , ok ?
Excited to have at last a web based , programmable addressbook , I try out a search :
http://roberthahn.ca/Phone.find(area_code=519)
And I get a list of phone numbers in the 519 area code .
Hmm … I think I ’m going to need that .
Let ’s save it :
http://roberthahn.ca/p=Phone.find(area_code=519)
So far , since I ’m typing all this into a browser , the natural response would be formatted as HTML .
What if I wanted it formatted in Atom ?
http://roberthahn.ca/p.atom
This search engine is pretty dumb .
As I said , I just get a list of phone numbers that matched my criteria - no names , no addresses .
In fact , the search method is so dumb , it just does a literal substring match of the term 519 to the area code field in the database .
This level of dumbness is exactly what I want , since Alex has thoughtfully provided me with tools to process my own search results in a way that I find relevant to me .
Realizing that the 519 area code will include numbers local to London , Ontario , and Waterloo , ON , I ’m thinking that it would be good to filter down that list so that I ’m only seeing Waterloo phone numbers .
Let ’s try something :
http://roberthahn.ca/w=Address.find(city=Waterloo)
And we get a bunch of Waterloo addresses .
No phone numbers though .
Thankfully Alex added a Results object with some handy methods , like ‘ match ’ :
http://roberthahn.ca/pw=Results.match(p,w)
And what we ’ll get back are a list of phone numbers matched up to their addresses .
Obviously an explanation is owed at this point , but I ’d really like to get the people ’s names first , then spit out the results as a tab delimited format .
http://roberthahn.ca/n=Names.find_all
http://roberthahn.ca/npw=Results.match(n,pw)
http://roberthahn.ca/npw.tdf
Ok , so let ’s talk about what ’s going on .
If you have any experience building web apps , the first thing is obvious : you have to involve a session cookie or this whole exercise is pointless .
The next thing to realize is that if I make an assignment like this : n=Names .
find_all then i’d have to store that string in a database , linked to the session , so that if I might need n later on , the server will have a way to find out what it represents .
Outputting data to different formats really should be a straightforward exercise if you ’ve built your app in such a way that the view logic is separated from the business logic , and that the same view logic is applied to different file formats .
One of the best known apps that play with this idea is blosxom , which has been one of my favourite blogging tools for a long time .
As long as you have the necessary format files prepared , all you need to do to use them is change the file extension on the URI .
The Results. match ( ) object is probably the most interesting aspect to this because what ’s being enabled is the possibility of accessing an object not linked to a database for the purpose of processing search results in a useful way .
This object works simply by examining the arguments passed to it , and looking up the assignments in the saved set of searches for that user ’s session .
Once the assignments are found , they are then processed so that Results. match ( ) has a set of data to work with .
It should be pretty easy to dream up other methods to add to the Results object that would further improve it ’s usefulness .
There perhaps is only one more gotcha left in this idea - how can we parse these URI ’s in a sane way ?
Regex ’s are obviously out of the question .
The inspiration for the answer came to me from this article at perl.com : Lexing Your Data - in short , build a Lexer parser designed to tokenize your URI ’s and turn them into something your application can use .
I have n’t yet had the time to realize these thought experiments as working code , but the notion seemed interesting enough that I wanted to share it first .
If you see some problems with this , please let me know .
If you do n’t get it at all , I ’d like to hear that too .
And if you build something , let me see how you did !
