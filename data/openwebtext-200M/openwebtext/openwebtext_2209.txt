Obama Funky Wrist Watch Photos : Time For a Change Indeed
's likeness will undoubtedly be plastered on any number of campaign paraphernalia over the next five months including t- shirts , hats , campaign buttons , placards , coffee mugs and bumper stickers .
One of the slogans being bandied about is Time For A Change We Can Believe In .
Picture it on a wrist watch .
Because Obama is the candidate with a change agenda , Obama Watches.com has created wrist watches with clever slogans in order to get out the message .
One watch says Vote Obama '08 Ready To Go! Fired Up !
Another whimsical sentiment says Love Your Mama - Vote Obama ' 08 .
There is an iconic yellow smiley face and one with a patriotic stars and stripes background .
Serious political memorabilia collectors will undoubtedly be swarming .
A hundred years from now these little gems will be worth a fortune .

[ See also my latest post on fat : Fat Redux , 1920's Fat Quack Cures ] .
In the world of found - book - objects , few I think are as deeply removed and as deeply obscure as the work by Otto F. Fleiss , a butcher and sculptor in fat .
And lard .
The pamphlet 's title is a throw - back to an earlier day of titling , when the title page was pretty much fully overtaken by the title , though as a common practice it say its heyday 300 + years ago .
Fleiss ' 50 - word title : White Art in the Meat Food Business .
A Practical Handbook for Butcher , Pork Stores , Restaurants , Hotels and Delicatessens on How to Make Lasting and Transferable White Art Decorations out of Bacon Fat Back for Window Displays , Ornaments on Meat Food Cold Buffets and for Exhibits and Advertising Purposes .
Enrich yourself with Personal Knowledge .
If the title of this book could itself be described in terms of food , I think that I 'd have to call it a ( warm ) Slim Jim Egg Frosty with a crust of French fries , baked .
Or something like that .
If the exhaustive , exhausting title did n't stop you in your tracks , though , the slim pamphlet holds some indelible , indigestible , eyebrow - burning , flat - out remarkable images .
Working your way through this pamphlet is as much fun as stringing together dirty diapers : you can enjoy instructions on how to make a vase of roses out of strips of fat , or produce the reverse ( ?! ) portrait of Santa Claus in slabs of fat , or marvel at the photos of Mr. Fleiss ' " first prize " (? ) 200 - pound fat sculpture of a cathedral done entirely in slips and chunks and strips of fat .
This simply must be the most sublime work ever produced on Fat Art .
And , in the annals of art , I should think that Black Velvet Sparkly Liberace paintings may have moved up a level from the most secret depths of the inferno to make way for Fat Art -- or , dare I say it , " FART " .
A Note on the Origin of this Pamphlet :
The Fleiss work comes from a singular collection that we purchased of the Library of Congress some years ago .
It was called , simply , " The Pamphlet Collection " , and included 90,000 or so pamphlets stored in 2,355 blue document boxes .
They were all categorized and alphabetized , but not according to any truly discernible methodology .
Their greatest common denominator was that the great majority of them simply did not exist .
By " they did not exist " I mean that they were not catalogued in the massive ( 70 million item ) database and librarian 's tool WorldCat / FirstSearch which lists books in libraries world wide .
And they continually do not show up in the mass bookseller databases , or in Google / Yahoo searches , and so on .
The pamphlets in the collection also were n't added , in large part , to the Library of Congress collection , nor were they ever circulated .
They were just kept in their blue boxes , waiting to a -moulder away .
But they did n't , and here they are , and will be , making appearances over the next number of years .
There will also be many other images from much more public and published sources that have simply slipped away from us here in our present — unexpected bits of revelatory history wrapped in a simple image that speak volumes from the dim , deep forgotten .
Additional Images :
Perhaps the most incredible of the photographs in this unleafy work by Fleiss is of that below , of the Welfare Meat Pork Store .
The legend describes " lamb roast ornamented into a duck " , meaning that all of the duck - like things hanging there in the window were actually made of lamb roast covered in pork fat .
( One does n't get to write that ever day . )
Then we see a " roast with a rose " ( and as we saw in the text the roses in the ornamentation were made out of fat ) , as well as a " rose on a smoked ham and a bouquet of roses " .
Again , virtually everything in the wind of this store was constructed of fat .
Mr. Fleiss also did Christmas ornamentation .
In fat .

All this means , if it holds true , is that Obama will get California 's 52 Electoral College votes without having to spend a dime .
In all likelihood , the Electoral College map this November will look similar to 2000 or 2004 , with Obama getting the " blue " states won by Gore and Kerry and McCain winning most of the " red " states won by Bush --- with either Ohio or Florida making the difference for Obama .
At this point , Democrats are doing well in both those states .
In Florida , for example , voter registration is 10 to one in favor of Dems .
In Ohio , the GOP is in tatters after years of scandals and abuse .
Even with that said , the election is still McCain 's to lose .
As bad a candidate as McCain is , it 's instructive for Obama supporters to remember that George Bush --- the worst president of the modern era --- beat both John Kerry and Al Gore .
If the Republican machine can lie , cheat and steal to put a candidate as weak as Bush over the top , McCain should be a relative punt .

They need to be at least 10 + POINTS AHEAD JUST TO BREAK EVEN

Agent -
I 'm going to stand by my statement that they won the election by lying , cheating and stealing .
I think we 're saying the same thing , but the reality is , in our system , the guy who gets inaugurated " wins . "
Personally , I 'm for ditching the US Constitution and adopting a more modern parliamentary system with no Executive Branch .
But that 's just me .

There is an executive branch under the parlimentary system --- the prime minister is just elected by the majority party rather than by popular vote .
Parliamentary systems can be just as undemocratic .
Take Japan , for example , where the same party has been in power since the end of Occupation in 1951 .

... Jon Ponder said on 7/17/2008 @ 1:50 pm PT ...
Not really .
The prime minister can be recalled by his or her party in a vote of no confidence at any time , and , to stay in power , prime ministers , along with all cabinet members , have to be reelected by their local constituencies , which gives the voters more control .
( Imagine if , in 2006 , Prime Minister Bush had lost his seat in Crawford and Foreign Secretary Condi had lost hers in Palo Alto ! )
A parliamentary system would allow for multiple parties , too , rather than the just the current two .
And the campaign season can be restricted to just six weeks .
No system is perfect and there is corruption everywhere , and has been since the beginning of government , but ours is a lot less perfect than most .
One bit of evidence of this is that , since 1789 , only a handful of new democracies have copied our system --- in fact , the only one I can think of is the Philippines .
The rest have opted for parliaments .

What does a parliamentary system do to thwart lobbyists and PACs ?
From undue influence on legislators ?
I realize the Constitution would have to be scrapped to do this , and that upsets me , even though I know the Achilles heel is that officials must act in good faith for it to work .
I think the same is true with a parliament .
I do n't think your idea is good enough to put the rewriting of our founding documents in the hands of people used to being bought by lobbyists .
I wish you 'd go back to the drawing board .

Sorry if I gave the impression I think this could ever happen .
I do n't .
And I did n't say it would solve every problem .
PACs have only been around since the 1970s and could be outlawed with the stroke of a pen .
Lobbyists have been around a lot longer , and exist in just about every system .
Switching to parliamentary system would get rid of the nationally elected president , the vice president altogether , the Electoral College , appointed cabinet members and the Senate , for starters .
The cabinets in the former executive branch would be headed by a staff civil service administrator who reports to the MP named as minister by the PM .
The Judiciary would essentially stay the same .

Well , Clinton won 52 % of the vote in the primary , and the bulk of that was from the most committed Democrats .
Obama 's appeal is and has been far broader - and derived less from the " traditional left " than from the " disenchanted center and center - right . "
To me , all this shows is that opinions have not changed much among California Democrats since February .
Not all that interesting , IMO .

Obama is campaigning with Rebub Sen. Chuck Hagel , the guy who bought ES&S and then was elected to the Senate using ES&S machines , despite being behind in the polls .
I 've always thought , worst case , Dems will have to get in on the theft just to compete .
So why will we spend all this stupid amounts of time and energy and money on an election which will be decided by our hackers vs. your hackers ???
And , if the Dems are in on the theft - which in some cases looks like that 's possible - is there any hope for our nation ?
New Constitution indeed ... shw

I love internet cafes .
Given that my job requires hours of sitting and typing , sitting and drawing , or sitting and procrastinating , a change of scenery is welcome , allowing me to be around people without actually having to interact with them , listen to them or acknowledge their existence beyond sharing a power outlet .
To me , a cafe is like a large desktop image that dispenses caffeinated beverages and scones .
However , as any science - fiction writer can tell you , with any new technology come new problems and new sex acts .
I have n't gotten to the sex act part yet , but the problem is quite apparent :
What do I do with my laptop when I have to use the bathroom ?
Alt Text Podcast
Download audio files and subscribe to the Alt Text podcast .
Solution 1 : Leave it there on the table
Yeah , great idea .
I 'll just throw my credit cards and loose change on the table , too , maybe carve my Social Security number and bank password into the wood to maximize the convenience of anyone who wants to ruin my life .
Solution 2 : Ask the person next to me to keep an eye it
It 's not that I think the guy next to me is going to steal my laptop – he 's already got one , and his is generally nicer – it's just that I do n't think he 's going to do a damn thing if a desperate - looking hood and / or thug walks right up and grabs my iBook .
Hell , if he 's like me , he wo n't even notice .
If I were the sort of person who paid attention to his surroundings , I would n't be bringing a laptop into public spaces .
Solution 3 : Bring it in with me
The easiest thing would be just to tuck it under my arm and head to the head .
And yet ... I feel like that raises questions .
" Why is he bringing a laptop into the bathroom ?
Has he been overwhelmed by the erotic power of superheroine porn ?
Is this some sort of sick YouTube stunt ?
Who said he could do that ?
Why wo n't somebody stop him ? "
I do n't trust people to say one word if a pod of roving computer thieves leaps from a running van and grabs my laptop , but I 'm sure someone will tackle me at the knees to prevent me from carrying it into the john .
Solution 4 : Bring everything in with me
OK , this does n't even make sense to me , but here 's what I often do : I put my laptop back into my satchel , put my iPod back into my coat and bring my entire life with me into the bathroom .
I do n't know why I feel this is more socially acceptable .
What do I want them to think is in there ?
A makeup case ?
A wide selection of hygiene products ?
Maybe I 'm trying to fool them into thinking I 'm just stopping by the men's room on the way out .
If so , it works , because I generally come back to find my coffee cup in the bus bin and my seat taken .
Solution 5 : Lock the thing up
I have n't tried this , but it would be the very avatar of simplicity to get one of those laptop locks and attach my laptop to the table or chair .
I 'm reluctant , though , because I do n't want to come across as one of those twitchy people who obsess about extremely unlikely crimes and devise elaborate schemes to foil largely fictional criminals .
However , looking back over this , I guess I am one of those people .
I should probably just blog from an underground bunker in rural Montana , pausing every three paragraphs to re-oil my shotgun .
I 'd probably get more work done .

Schoolkids know that over 70 percent of Earth 's surface is washed in water .
Yet very little of that abundance — less than two percent — is available for drinking and agriculture .
Over the last 50 years , moreover , freshwater use has tripled as global population has doubled , leading to scarcities in many regions of the globe .
According to the United Nations , over 1.1 billion of the world 's people lack access to a clean water supply .
With rapid population growth , wasteful practices , and impending climate change , the situation is likely to get worse .
Water resources in semi-arid regions are expected to be especially hard - hit , warned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2007 summary report .
By some estimates , two - thirds of the world 's population will be water - stressed by 2025 .
During a year when many states across the U.S. are suffering some of the worst droughts ever , water is a topic on people 's minds .
Will the prospect of a diminishing water supply result in serious geopolitical conflict ?
" Freshwater resources are unevenly distributed around the globe , " says Robert B. Packer , lecturer in political science at Penn State , who studies international political economy and the causes of war .
" While freshwater is relatively abundant in Europe and much of North America , other regions of the globe , such as the Middle East , Central Asia , and parts of West and Eastern Africa , face increasingly severe shortages . "
According to the BBC , the number of ' water - scarce ' countries in the Middle East grew from three in 1955 to eight in 1990 , with another seven expected to be added within 20 years .
" Of particular concern , " said Packer , " are certain riparian basins that could explode into conflict as sources of freshwater diminish .
Conflict is more likely to occur where water can be seized and controlled in addition to being scarce . "
Among Middle East countries , where every major river crosses at least one international border , up to 50 percent of water needs of any specific state finds its source in another state , Packer noted .
" Hydro - politics already play a central role among states in riparian basins , such as the Tigris - Euphrates , the Nile , the Jordan , as well as those sharing the underground aquifers of the West Bank . "
Conflicts are likely to emerge as competition intensifies to control river waters for hydroelectricity , agricultural use , and human consumption , he added .
" Farms and cities downstream are vulnerable to the actions and decisions of upstream countries that they have little control over .
This is exemplified in the tensions over the Tigris - Euphrates , where Turkey commenced construction of a system of hydroelectric dams .
Iraq and Syria have protested , citing the project would reduce the rivers ' flow downstream .
Turkey 's response to the Arab states has been ' we do n't control their oil , they do n't control our water . ' "
To the west , the Nile has been the lifeline for Egyptian civilization dating back to antiquity .
Nearly all of Egypt 's 80 million people live on the three percent of Egyptian territory that is the river 's valley and delta .
" For Egypt the Nile is life , and its government has voiced to upstream countries that any reduction of Nile waters would be taken as national security threat that could trigger a military response , " says Packer .
" Nearly all freshwater in the Israeli - occupied West Bank comes from underground aquifers , " he added .
" Water access has become a major issue between Israelis and Palestinians . "
" Perhaps the greatest of all modern Middle East conflicts , the Six Day War of 1967 , began as a dispute over water access , " Packer noted .
Israel built a National Water Carrier to transport freshwater from the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee to the country 's farming and urban centers .
( The Carrier now supplies half the drinking water in Israel . )
In 1965 , Israeli forces attacked a Syrian water diversion project that would have cut the Carrier 's supply , and prolonged violence led to war .
" For Israelis , control of the Golan Heights is important strategically in terms of controlling the headwaters of the Jordan River , " Packer noted .
The effects of global warming and desertification also have impacted hydro- politics around the world .
In West Africa , rainfall has declined 30 percent over the last four decades and the Sahara is advancing more than one mile per year .
Senegal and Mauritania engaged in militarized conflict in 1989 across the Senegal River that divides them , in part over changing access to arable land .
In the United States , 36 states project water shortages by 2013 .
Legal battles over water for crops , drinking , and electricity -- common in the West -- have now reached the Southeast , where several years of drought have caused a dramatic decrease in water levels in Lake Lanier , pitting the water needs of Atlanta 's huge and growing metropolis against the threatened shellfish industry 300 miles downriver in Florida 's Apalachicola Bay .
" Freshwater access is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons , " Parker said .
" As with all common resources , unlimited demand and waste by some can lead to depletion of the resource for all .
The hydroelectric dams that power the air conditioners of Las Vegas and Phoenix have depleted the waters of the Colorado River for agriculture .
Heavy pesticide and fertilizer chemical use in agriculture has spoiled drinking water in many parts of the globe . "
But our future need not be dominated by water wars , he suggested .
Hope lies in preventive measures , such as creating international institutions to resolve river claims , strengthening conservation efforts , and improving cross - border management of scarce freshwater resources .

Mary D. , Petitioner v. HONORABLE CLARENCE WATT JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF PUTNAM COUNTY AND GEORGE D. , RESPONDENTS
No . 20
SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA 190 W. Va. 34 ; 438 S.E. 2nd 521 ; 1992 W. Va. LEXIS 76
January 14 , 1992 , Submitted
May 29 , 1992 , Filed
SUBSEQUENT HISTORY : As Corrected .
Dissenting Opinion Dated June 1 , 1992 .
Workman , J. withdrew concur .
DISPOSITION : [***]
WRIT GRANTED AS MOULDED
SYLLABUS BY THE COURT
1. Because an allegation of sexual abuse of a child involved in a divorce proceeding is extraordinary , such allegation would constitute " good cause " or grounds for a more expeditious resolution by the circuit court as contemplated by W. Va.
Code , 48A - 4 - 1( i ) 1991 , and accordingly , custody and visitation matters relating thereto may be retained by the circuit court , or , if already referred to a family law master , such referral may be revoked .
2. Prior to ordering supervised visitation pursuant to W. Va. Code 48-2-15 ( b) ( 1 ) 1991 , if there is an allegation involving whether one of the parents sexually abused the child involved , a family law master or circuit court must make a finding with respect to whether that parent sexually abused the child .
A finding that sexual abuse has occurred must be supported by credible evidence .
The family law master or circuit court may condition such supervised visitation upon the offending parent seeking treatment .
Prior to ordering supervised visitation , the family law master or circuit court should weigh the risk of harm or deprivation of any visitation to the parent who [ *** 2 ] allegedly committed the sexual abuse against the risk of harm of such visitation to the child .
Furthermore , the family law master or circuit court should ascertain that the allegation of sexual abuse under these circumstances is meritorious and if made in the context of the family law proceeding , that such allegation is reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency or prosecutor for the county in which the alleged sexual abuse took place .
Finally , if the sexual abuse allegations were previously tried in a criminal case , then the transcript of the criminal case may be utilized to determine that credible evidence does or does not exist , the transcript must be made part of the record in the civil proceeding so that this Court , where appropriate , may adequately review the civil record to conclude whether the lower court abused its discretion .
3 . Where supervise visitation is ordered pursuant to W. Va. Code 48-2-15 ( b) ( 1 ) 1991 , the best interests of a child include determining that the child is safe from the fear of emotional and psychological trauma which he or she [ *** 3 ] may experience .
The person(s ) appointed to supervise the visitation should have had some prior contact with the child so that the child is sufficiently familiar with and trusting of that person in order for the child to have secure feelings and so that the visitation is not harmful to his or her emotional well being .
Such a determination should be incorporated as a finding of the family law master or circuit court .
COUNSEL : Maureen Conley , Legal Aid Society of Charleston , West Virginia , Attorney for the Petitioner
JUDGES : McHUGH , Neely , Workman OPINION BY : McHUGH
West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in the case of Mary D. v. Circuit Court , 438 S.E.2d 521 ( W. va. 1992 ) ( Neely , J. , dissent at 529 ) :
========================================================
In this case , the majority opinion makes a simple process into a complicated one in hopes that no one will see what is what 's really going on .
Syllabus Points 2 and 3 set up numerous hoops for the circuit court to jump through when the case is remanded to him .
The majority opinion atales :
If there is an allegation involving whether one of the parents sexually abused the child involved , a family law master or circuit court must make a finding with respect to whether that parent sexually abused the child ....... if the sexual abuse allegations were previously tried in a criminal case , then the transcript of the criminal case may be utilized to determine whether credible evidence exists to support the allegation .
If the transcript is utilized to determine that credible evidence does or does not exist , the transcript must be made a part of the record in the civil proceedings so that this Court may adequately review the civil record to conclude whether the lower court abused its [*** 28 ] discretion .
If this case had taken place in the New York Supreme Court where hundreds of judges decide thousands of cases each month , the majority 's opinion would have been warranted .
However , this case and the related criminal case both took place in the Circuit Court of Putnam County with Judge Watt presiding .
Judge
Watt has been involved from start to finish and he heard all the evidence in the criminal trial in which George D. was acquitted .
Only after hearing all of this evidence did Judge Watt allow Mr. D. supervised visitation .
The majority sets more hurdles in front of George D. after he has been acquitted of all sexual abuse charges and after he has passed a lie detector administered by the state police .
It is a mindless exercise in teaching one 's grandmother to suck eggs to point out to an experienced trial judge that the civil standard of proof is lower than the criminal standard of proof .**
This Court has no reasonable grounds from which to infer that the respondent is such a simpleton that where there be least doubt in his mind concerning the children 's safety he would allow any visitation , supervised or unsupervised .
We now have a system in which a female parent need only scream child abuse in a loud voice to keep the male parent from seeing a child .
Indeed , sexual abuse these days seems to arouse all the hysteria that was associated with witchcraft in yesteryear .
In fact , it has even spawned a witch - huntingesque cottage industry , to - wit badly trained , ideological rape trauma experts , rape counselors , bachelor level pseudo - psychologists , social activists , and other assorted species of Jacklegs .
I am a firm believer that the best interests of the child are paramount , but that does not mean never allowing a father to see his children when the evidence preponderates on his behalf even though , like an accused witch , he cannot clear himself beyond any shadow of a doubt .
Continuous yelling and screaming of an accusation does not make that accusation any more true .

From : Simson L. Garfinkel , Senior Editor , NeXTWORLD Magazine
Subject : NeXTCube Serial Number AA001032
Date : March 16 , 1993
Dear Dan ,
I am writing this memo to explain what happened to the case our NeXTCube Computer , Serial Number AA001032 .
As you know , years ago , when NeXT first contemplated making computers , Steve Jobs decided that machines should be in the shape of a cube , and that they should be built from cast magnesium .
Although magnesium is a relatively expensive metal , it is remarkably strong and lightweight .
No doubt , this let NeXT save on shipping expenses , although the added handling and manufacturing costs was one of the factors which led to the cube 's high cost .
At the time that NeXT brought their system to market , the only other company to incorporate a magnesium case was Grid , which was making a portable computer .
( I am told that Apple also uses magnesium for the inside case of its Duo computers , but I have n't been able to verify this fact . )
As a former chemist , I was attracted to the NeXT 's magnesium case for a different reason : magnesium burns with a brilliant white flame .
When I was in high school , I used to steal magnesium metal from the chemistry lab and set it on fire in my backyard .
A two - inch long strip would burn for nearly a minute , the white - hot flame slowly turning the shiny grey metal into a plume of white smoke ( magnesium oxide --- a harmless material which is the main ingredient in milk of magnesia . )
When NeXT announced that the first NeXT Cube was made of cast magnesium , I am sure that I was not the only person who imagined what fun could be had by setting it ablaze .
Of course , at more than seven thousand dollars each , I doubted that anybody would ever actually carry out the experiment .
Anyway , during the fall of 1991 , I interviewed Rich Page , NeXT 's then vice - president for hardware , for an article which we later ran in NeXTWORLD Extra .
At the time , I asked Mr. Page if he could get me an empty NeXT Cube case for the purpose of having such a burning .
Page smiled and said that he thought something could be arranged .
A few days later , he called me up and said that I could pick up an empty cube at NeXT 's Freemont factory .
My plan was to light the cube along its top edge .
I imagined that the magnesium would burn brightly and the fire would move slowly down the sides , a triumphant expression of the power of NeXT 's technology to set the world afire .
I drove down to Freemont the next day and picked up the cube , which was waiting for me behind behind the receptionist desk at the factory .
Page had delivered exactly what I had asked for --- an empty magnesium case , without any electronics , back plane , or rubber feet .
The case was also missing the NeXT logo , but you can't get everything .
I put it in the back of my Jeep and drove back to my apartment in Berkeley .
Over the next few months , I tried to think of some way to ignite the magnesium .
One idea that I had was to use a mixture of potassium permaganate and glycerin , which bursts into flames and produces an enormous amount of heat after just a few minutes .
I asked a chemist friend if he could supply me with the ingredients : he suggested that I simply use a MAP gas torch .
" It 's hotter and easier to control , " he said .
Unfortunately , I left California before I was able to carry out the experiment .
I left the cube with my friend Sophia for safe keeping .
A year later , Sophia told me that she was sick of keeping the cube .
I came out to California and transferred the cube from Sophia 's house to your basement .
By this time , we had started to hear rumors that NeXT might be discontinuing its cube in favor of the " NeXT Brick , " a RISC - based computer .
I started thinking that we might want to use a photograph of the burning cube for the cover of that issue that announced the NeXT Cube 's demise .
The image of the burning cube haunted my dreams .
I could n't wait to do the deed .
The day NeXT publicly announced that it was discontinuing its hardware line , you called me up and said that it was time for us to burn the NeXT Cube in your basement .
I was coming out to California to attend the third annual conference on Computers , Freedom and Privacy : it seemed like an ideal time to conduct the burning .
Getting a torch would be easy , and now with the news peg , you told me that you were willing to pay for the photographer .
The only problem , of course , was where to do the actual burning .
The whole time that I had thought about burning the cube , I had not thought much about where we would actually conduct the experiment : I had always assumed that we would go to parking lot , or walk down to a beach , light the computer with a torch , snap a few photographs , and then wait for the magneisum to burn itself out .
But as I began to consider what would be really involved with the burning , I realized that we would need to be more professional .
The real reason for my concern was to protect the magazine from legal liability .
As I 've already said , magnesium burns with a brilliant white flame and a tremendous amount of white smoke .
Although the smoke is non -toxic , I realized that the smoke might attract the attention of a passing police officer or the fire department .
We could then be fined for conducting an open - air burning without a permit or causing a fire hazard or something like that .
For these reasons , the week before I came out to California , I started calling fire departments in the Bay Area to find out how we could get a permit for burning the cube .
I must have called ten different departments --- each one told me that they did n't give such permits anymore .
I was also told that I would have to call the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to get a waiver from the emission laws , that to get the waiver I needed to file an application and have a hearing , and that even then the waiver was not guaranteed .
I also tried calling numerous analytical laboratories in the Bay Area to see if any of them had the facilities and the necessary permits to conduct the burning .
Most of the labs had faciities for burning a few grams of magneisum , but nothing as large as a NeXT Cube .
Finally , in frustration , I decided that I would go through with my original plan --- driving out to the desert and setting the cube off with a torch .
I imagined that we would drive east on Interstate 580 , find a desolate country road , and then drive north or something .
It was then that I remembered that Lawrence Livermore Laboratory , a Laboratory owned by the Department of Energy and run by the University of California at Berkeley .
The Livermore Lab is a located in Livermore , Califonria --- just 20 miles from San Francisco , out Interstate 580 .
I had been at the lab in 1989 for an article I was writing for the Christian Science Monitor .
Back then , the people in the press office had been very helpful .
I was sure that a national weapons laboratory would have the facilities for burning a few kilograms of magneisum .
They would probably have the necessary permits as well .
My next phone call was to the press office at Livermore , which referred me to the community relations group .
I told the people at the group what I wanted to do .
They had me call a person named Burt .
Now , every time in the past when I had called a fire department or a laboratory to tell them what I wanted to do , I had to spend several minutes telling them what I wanted to burn , why I wanted to burn it , why I was having a hard time finding a place where I could do the burn , and a variety of other things .
It was a big hassle .
But when I got Burt on the phone , I was n't more than 10 seconds into my explaination when he interrupted me and said " You want to burn a flare , right ? "
" Uh , right , that 's what I want to do , " I said , quite surprised .
" Well , we have a site that might work out just right for you .
Site 300 .
We use it for testing high explosives .
What day do you want to come out ?
I 'll check to see if the site is free on that day . "
I was overjoyed .
" So , exactly what are you burning ? " he asked .
" Just a computer case made out of magnesium , " I told him .
" That 's it ?
No plastic , no wires , no PC boards ? "
" Nothing , " I said .
" Just a case . "
" No rubber or chrome ?
We need to know if there is anything that might be toxic .
We have reports to fill out with the EPA just like everybody else , " he said .
" No , nothing but the magnesium , " I said .
Then , as an afterthought , I added : " The case is painted .
Is that okay ? "
" What 's in the paint ? " he asked .
I did n't know .
" I need to have an MDS --- a Material Date Safety Shet --- on the paint before I can let you burn it , " he said .
Great , I thought .
Where would I get that ?
" No problem , " I said .
I promised to fax him the MDS within two days .
In the meantime , Burt said , he would check into our using site 300 .
I remembered that there had been some traffic in the NeXT news groups about the paint that NeXT had used on its computers --- mostly it was from people who had purchased external disk drives and wanted to paint them with the exact shade of black used by NeXT .
I did n't have a copy of the archives on my computer , so I sent a message to the BCS - NeXT mailing list ; Charles Perkins wrote back .
Perkins had gone to great lengths to find out the exact shade of paint .
He sent me the following information :
Sparyon Paint
Omni-Packblend
4 Next -Black ( icon black )
LAV -16
25216
Sprayon Paints had offices in both Ohio and California .
I called the Ohio office ; they said that the LAV - 16/25216 describes a paint can , but that people can fill it with whatever kind of paint that they want .
A call to California had the same results .
Nobody knew what " 4 Next - Black " paint was .
They said that I should call the distributor .
At this point , I called NeXT for help .
I told them that I wanted to burn a computer and needed to know what was in the paint .
That 's when I learned that most of the people in the hardware division had by this time been fired .
Somebody in hardware maintenance told me to call an outfit called Chicago Metals .
He did n't have a phone number for them , so I called directory assistance for Chicago and got a phone number .
A nice woman answered the phone ; she told me that she was a jeweler .
Deadend .
I called NeXT a second time .
I told the person that there had to be some right - to - know paperwork for the people who were applying the paint to the cubes .
California state law .
Unfortunately , the person responsible for the paperwork had been fired .
Finally , I got the name of an engineer who had worked on the Cube 's power supply .
He told me that NeXT did n't paint its own computers --- the painting was done by a finishing company in San Jose .
When I called up that company , I told them that I had a potential environmental accident and that I needed to know the exact paints that they had used .
( Well , perhaps I was stretching the truth just a bit . )
The following day , a person from the finishing company called me back with the Sherin - Williams paint code .
A call to Sherin - Williams revealed that the paint was a non -toxic water soluble paint .
They faxed me an MDS , which I refaxed to Burt at LLL .
When I called Burt back , however , there was some bad news .
Livermore 's head Fire Safety expert did n't want us burning the cube outdoors : he wanted us to burn it in their " burn cell , " a brick - and - steel box that had been built specifically for burning materials that might be hazardous .
The burn cell was equipped with a sophisticated ventilation system for filtering the smoke and removing any toxins .
The burn cell also had fire safety equipment around the facility in case the fire got out of hand .
Livermore needed the names , social security numbers , and addresses of everybody who would be inolved with the project .
At this point , our art director Chuck found us a photographer named Eric who would be free on the day that we wanted to do the burning , a Tuesday .
Eric went out on Monday to take a look .
Everything looked perfect .
Eric was especialy happy that we were burning the cube indoors , rather than outdoors , since it was nearly impossible to see flames and fire in direct sunlight .
The only thing that concerned that photographer was the fact that we only had one computer to burn .
What if something went wrong ?
On Monday , the day before the burn , I was walking through the NeXTWORLD of offices , wondering if I could get a second computer --- a " backup " computer .
Looking around the offices , I found an old Cube that did n't see to be functioning .
It was missing a hard disk and a CPU board .
I asked our system manager if I could borrow it as a backup .
He said " sure . "
I then went to Dan Lavin , just to get his permission .
This was the fateful computer AA001032 .
" No , you cannot burn this computer , " Lavin said .
The system manager overheard ; he told me that he did n't realize that I wanted it as a backup for a destructive test .
" But this computer is useless , " I told Lavin .
" There 's nothing here that anybody can use . "
An argument ensued .
I finally got Lavin 's permission to take the case of AA001032 as a backup --- provided that I first remove the chassis , back plane , power supply , optical drive , and anything else of any possible value .
I found a NeXT tool and proceeded to do just that --- with Lavin 's eager assistance .
On Tuesday morning I picked up Sally Chew , our managing editor , at the train station and headed out to Livemore , where we rendezvoused with Eric and his assistant , a woman named Pam .
We went to the badge office , had our IDs checked , and were given badges .
A few minutes later we were joined by Harry Hasegawa , a jolly man who appeared to be in his late 40s who was head of Livermore 's fire research group .
Harry was our official escort .
He took us back to our cars then led us through the Lab 's security perimeter .
Everything seemed to be going according to plan .
Livermore is a huge facility .
We drove a mile down the road , with buildings on either side of us , then turned through a traffic circle and finally stopped in front of a thirty - foot cooling tower .
Next to the tower was the burn cell itself --- a metal shack about thirty feet wide and 20 feet high .
The cell had two large metal doors on the front .
The smell of an old fire permeated the area , like the small of a campsite the morning after a large bonfire .
Standing next to the building was Kirk Staggs , a man in his mid-40s wearing a T - shirt , blue jeans , with a long reddish beard .
Staggs told me he was a mechanic and technician : whenever the fire research center needed something built , they turned to him .
For example , he had built the burn cell 's ellaborate ventilation system which could be controlled to let in a measured amount of air .
Next to the cell were two wooden shacks which were supposed to simulate the inside of a nuclear reactor : the group had been simulating what might happen at different Department of Energy installations if the reactor 's core should happen to catch fire .
Inside the doors of the burn cell , I was surprised to find a computer room --- at least , a raised floor with a lot of cables .
The fire safety group was simulating computer room fires --- specifically , fires underneath raised floors .
To start the fires , they pumped a large amount of power through the wires with a huge power supply .
It was the perfect setting for burning the computer .
Since we did n't know how brightly the cube would actually burn , Eric suggested that we take a series of photographs of a cube in the burn chamber with a flash , then take a number of photographs of the buning cube .
We could then photographically superimpose the two images .
It sounded like a good idea to me .
Eric and Pam spent the first hour setting up their lights inside Livermore 's burn chamber and positioning the cube .
Since my cube did n't have the NeXT logo in place , they photographed the backup cube .
When we were finished with these shots , I took the spare cube and put it back in the trunk of my rental car .
The day before I spoke with him , Eric had wanted to know all sorts of details about how brightly magnesium burned .
" Bright , " I told him .
Unfortunately , " Bright " is not good enough to set an exposure meter on a Nikon F4 .
Not satisfied with my answer , Eric had purchased a bar of magnesium the previous day at a brazing supply company .
The idea was to burn the magnesium bar and see how bright it was : that would then tell use what ballpark to use exposure when we burned the computer itself .
Kirk cut a few 2 - inch segments from the bar , and place one of them in the burn chamber .
He then drove around a fork lift , put a wooden stage on the hoist , and set up a video camera .
Meanwhile , Eric and Pam were setting up their camera equipment .
When everything was ready , another Livermore worker suited up with fire - proof pants , fire - proof coat and helmet , put on a respirator , and set the bar on fire with a MAP gas torch .
All this time , I had been worrying about the mechanics of setting the bar on fire with the torch .
In order for the bar to catch on fire , part of the magnesium would have to be heated up past its ignition point .
But the bar was so thick that I worried that it would conduct the heat of the torch away before it heated up to the magic temperature .
As we watched , the blue flame of the torch licked the top of the magneisum bar .
After half a minute , there was a distinctive orange glow from the bar 's center .
Eric had told us that the magnesium bar was wrapped around a a ferrus core .
Slowly the bar began to melt .
Then suddenly there was a spark of brilliant white light .
The person with the torch backed away .
There were a few more sparks , then a steady white flame .
I knew that magnesium burned brightly , but I did n't know how fast .
When Eric asked me how long the cube would be burning for , I told him " at least a minute . "
This did n't inspire confidence in his ability to capture the scene --- he thought that he would have just one chance , and that would be it .
Since the largest piece of magnesium that I had ever burned was n't any larger than a pencil , I did n't know if a large piece would burn quickly or slowly .
It turns out , though , that magnesium burns very slowly .
The 2 - inch segment took nearly five minutes to burn completely .
When the fire finally went out , all that was left was a caky white ash --- magneisum oxide , the same ingredient that is in Milk of Magnesia .
" You could eat that stuff , " I told Sally .
She made a sour face .
While the bar had burned , Eric had taken a series of photographs of the burning bar with a Nikon camera and Polaroid film .
Now we peeled back the paper on the Polaroid , and one of he Livermore employees .
We discovered that , while magnesium does burn very brightly , it is not nearly as bright as sunlight is .
The first round of photographs were dreadfully underexposed .
We set up a second bar of magnesium , set it burning , and discovered that an f - stop of 3.5 with an exposure of 1/60th of a second with 100ASA film was just about right .
With these test shots out of the way , we started to think about burning the cube itself .
When I had called NeXT to find out what kind of paint they had used to paint the cube , one of the people I had spoken with told me that the cube was made out of " magnesium alloy which is specially designed to be difficult to ignite . "
These words came back to me as I stood in front of the burn chamber at Livermore .
What if we could n't get the cube to ignite ?
The idea stood out in my mind like a sore thumb .
I looked at our first cube .
The NeXT Cube consists of a five - sided piece of molded metal and a rear plate which is screwed in place .
I realized that once we put the cube into the burn chamber , we would n't be able to see the cube 's back side .
That meant that we could burn the rear plate first , as another test .
Rather than using standard screws , NeXT decided to fasten the rear of their NeXT cube with a non-standard hex screw .
Fortunately , I had brought my special " NeXT Tool " to remove the rear panel .
I took it off and handed it to Eric .
" How about if we try to burn this first , just to get an idea ? " I suggested .
" Great !
The more tests , the better , " he said .
We put the rear panel into the burn chamber .
The panel is a square piece of metal , 14 '' on each side , and roughly half an inch thick .
We stood it on end with a pair of bricks .
Then we hit it with the MAP gas torch .
Nothing happened .
We kept the torch focused on the rear panel .
Slowly it heated up in the spot where the flame lapped .
Soon the metal started to melt .
Then it puffed up with a white , caky ash .
" What 's going on ? " somebody asked .
We kept the flame on the spot .
After another minute , we saw that same telltale white spark .
" It 's caught ! " somebody said .
The person holding the torch backed away .
The flame sputtered for a few seconds , then it went out .
Something was clearly wrong .
We tried again with the MAP gas torch , with similar results .
" We have problems like this all of the time , " Kirk said , trying to reassure me .
" Sometimes its really hard to get things burning . "
He then walked over to a storage shed and wheeled back an oxygen - acetylene torch .
" This should set it on fire , " he said with a gleam in his eyes .
The acetylene torch bruned a lot brighter than the MAP gas , but the results were similar .
The back panel glowed red , burned white , sputtered a little , then went , leaving a caky white residue --- and a hole .
" This is so NeXT , " I told Sally .
" Everything works great in the tests , then when you try to make it work for real , in the field , nothing works .
They build a computer out of magnesium , and it does n't even burn ! "
A drop of water hit my nose .
I looked up .
Another drop of water hit my glasses .
" And now it 's starting to rain , " Sally said .
Everything was going wrong .
" I 'm sorry ! " I said .
" I forgot to fix the weather . "
Scott tried again with the torch .
He tried running the acetylene gas without the oxygen : instead of a bright blue flame , he got a smoky orange ball of fire .
But the results were pretty much the same : another hole in the metal , but the fire would n't sustain itself .
I looked around the grounds .
Off in the corner , I saw something which looked like an industrial charcoal grill : a three - foot circular basin filled with gravel .
The purpose of the contraption , we had been told , was for conducting large - scale flame tests .
" How about if we use the burner ? " I asked .
" We can try , if you want , " Kirk said .
" If it does n't work , I do n't know what will . "
It took two people to picked up the burner and placed it on the floor of the burn cell .
Then Kirk went inside the building and spent another fifteen minutes hooking it up to the natural gas pipeline .
It was then that I noticed that the tube that brought the natural gas into the burner was three - inches thick .
Just how much gas did this burner use , anyway ?
I was glad that we did n't have to pay for the use of the lab 's facilities .
Once the burner was hooked up , Kirk took a large kimwipe , doused it with kerosene , lit it with the MAP gas torch and dropped it on the burner .
Then he turned on the natural gas .
A moment later , a sheet of orange flames lept three feet into the air .
Satisfied that the burner was working , Kirk turned it off and got ready for the burning .
I picked up my cube ( I remind you that the cube we intended to burn was my own personal property ) , jumped up to the stage of the burn cell , and gently placed the cube the middle of the burner .
Meanwhile Eric , our trusty photographer , made sure that all of the cameras were focused and ready to go .
Still , I was nervous .
What if the cube did n't burn ?
What if the natural gas flames were n't hot enough ?
Eric and I decided to take the rest of our magnesium bar --- the bar which had burned so well in the earlier tests --- and put it in the back of the cube , just to give it a head start .
" I feel like I 'm working for NBC , " I told him .
( It was just a few weeks ago that the news had broken about NBC placing model rocket motors on the underside of GM trucks in order to force the trucks to explode during a photo shoot . )
Scott cut the bar into small one inch segments , which I placed along the cube 's inside edges .
I then took two handfulls of magnesium dust and turnings and spread them evenly along the cube 's front inside wall .
It was starting to rain harder .
Eric started worrying about his camrea equipment .
Sally found a large sheat of cardboard and held it over the equipment , becoming a human umbrella .
Meanwhile we doused another Kimwipe with kerosene , and dropped behind the cube .
Finally we turned on the gas a second time .
Once again , bright orange flames leapt into the air .
Eric and Pam were clicking the shutter release of their Nikons .
" Burn ! " I shouted .
But only the gas heard me call --- all the cube did was sit there .
Eventually I started to see smoke , but it was just the paint .
" At least we know that the paint is non-toxic , " I grumbled .
The paint started bubbling , then burned away , leaving the black anodized magnesium alloy .
( " It 's an alloy that is resistent to burning , " the voice of the soon - to - be - ex - NeXT - employee came back to me . )
As the cube heated up more its top started to sink .
One of the sides started to peel back .
Then I saw it .
A glimmer of white .
A spark .
Then a flame --- a small flame , but a flame nevertheless , on the cube 's left side .
A white dot of fire , growing larger .
Eric's Nikon whirled .
A second dot of fire started on the cube 's right side .
" There it goes ! " I exclaimed .
Both dots went out , leaving a caky white residue .
" It 's not a very uniform alloy , " Kirk said behind me .
In spots --- the spots that were burning --- it was nearly pure magnesium .
But other spots must have been filled with ... something else .
That alloy that was resistant to flames .
Would this never catch ?
The cube continued its slow collapse , the initial pattern repeating itself .
The metal would pull back in a place , there would be a momentary glimmer , burning white , and then the spark would go out .
Throughout the entire show , the bright orange flames surrounded the cube on all sides .
It really felt like NBC .
The experience held absolute resemblance to what I had imagined : this was n't triumph , this was failure .
We could n't even get the cube to burn !
And the rain was coming down even harder .
Eric kept shooting his camera .
" I 'm sure that this is n't what you want , " he said , " but at least we 'll get something . "
Indeed , the computer surrounded by the orange flames was n't an uninteresting photograph --- it simply was n't the image of my dreams .
A few minutes later , what had been the case of a NeXT Computer had been reduced to a smoldering pile of slag magnesium , with pock marks of white ash , charred black metal , and the occasional white spark .
Then it happened .
A few white sparks appeared and did n't go out .
Then a few more appeared .
Then the white sparks began to spread .
White smoke --- a lot of white smoke --- began to rise from the computer .
And then , very suddenly , the entire slag pile burst into a blinding white flame .
" We have ignition ! " somebody shouted .
I grabbed a pair of welding goggles to look at the pool of metal as it burned more and more brightly .
The white ash was still forming , but this time it was n't putting out the fire .
Instead , the fire continued to burn and burn .
But the photographs , I thought .
The photographs wo n't make any sense !
Yes , we finally had a burning NeXT computer --- the only problem was that it did n't look anything like a NeXT computer .
There was no recognizable cube .
The metal was n't even black anymore --- it was covered with white ash .
But it was hot , and it was burning , and it was a magnesium fire .
That 's when I remembered the backup cube .
The gas fire had n't been enough to set the first cube ablaze , but surely , I thought , this magnesium fire would be enough to start the other one burning .
" If you take this with you , you 're going to end burning it , " Lavin had said to me the night before .
" No I won't , " I had promised him .
" It 's just a backup , just in case something goes wrong . "
Well , something had gone wrong .
And now , I realized , we had a chance to make something go right .
I looked at the burning pool of slag .
" Sally , " I said after a few seconds , " let 's throw in the backup . "
" I was just thinking that , " she said .
Eric smiled .
I went to one of the Livermore 's professional pyros .
" We want to put the second cube on top of the fire .
Do you think that it would work ? "
" Sure it would , " he said .
I went back to the car and got the backup cube .
I handed it to Kirk , who was still wearing the fire - proof pants .
" Wait a second , " Eric said .
" Let 's reload our cameras . "
" Hurry , " I said , looking at the magnesium fire .
He had n't gotten brighter in the last minute , which meant that it would probably start burning out soon .
Eric and Pam reloaded their cameras .
I looked at my camera : I was on the 36th frame .
I pushed the button on the bottom and quickly reloaded my camera as well .
Finally we were all ready , and Kirk put the second cube on burning remains of the first .
Ignition was almost instantaneous .
Within seconds , the intense heat from the pool of burning magnesium had set the second cube 's sides smoking , then burning .
Once again I saw that tell - tale bright white light with touches of green .
Flames trailed up the cube 's sides .
The cube 's top sagged a bit , then smoked , then started to burn .
This time , the object engulfed by fire was clearly a NeXT Computer .
" Yea ! " said Sally , who was still holding the cardboard umbrella over the hotograher 's heads .
I clicked away on my camera .
Eric took pictures with his .
But the whole emotional tone was wrong .
This was n't the triumph of a burning magnesium case , setting the world on fire .
This was a collapsing metal failure , melting into a pool of fire and being consumed by it .
Perhaps it was a more accurate representation of NeXT 's true reality .
After all , physics does n't lie .
How were we to know , when we had set out that morning , that in our brief four - hour experiment , we would recapitulate NeXT Computer 's experience as a hardware manufacturer ?
I looked at the burning cube .
White - smoke streamed upwards .
At its base , red embers were emerging .
The back wall collapsed but the front wall still plainly retained the Cube 's original shape .
I chuckled , then started laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes .
One thing was definately clear :
" Ruby is never going to let us run these photographs , " I gasped to Sally .
The second cube continued to burn , its sides falling into the slag pile that had consumed the first .
" You know , we could make it flare up by throwing some water on it , " one of the Livermore engineers suggested .
It seemed like a good idea to us , so he pulled out a garden hose with a trigger nozzle and doused the fire with a few quick spurts .
The water instantly turned to steam .
Thick clouds of white smoke bellowed forwards , out of the chamber .
We were covered with a fine white powder .
" Wow , " Eric whispered .
We put some more water on the fire , with much the same results .
Eventually we were left with another pile of burning slag .
" Let 's just let it burn out , " Kirk said .
Eric and I agreed : there was nothing left to photograph .
Eric started taking down his equipment .
When he was finished , Sally put down the cardboard .
That 's when she noticed that it had stopped raining .
" Somebody could have told me , " she said with a sour voice .
Finally , when we were out of the way , Kirk closed the burn cells ' two - ton doors .
" It should burn itself out completely , " he said .
" I doubt that we 'll have anything that needs to be thrown out . "
* * *
So that 's how it happened , Dan .
We did n't intend to burn cube AA0010032 --- but we were lucky to have brought it along , considering the other problems that we had achieving ignition .
If I had to do it again , I would have known to ask Rich Page for two empty cubes , one for the photo shoot , and one for kindling .
And even if I did n't get the second computer , if I had it to do all over again , you can be sure that I would n't take the cube that was supposed to be installed underneath your desk .

At least part of the mystery of Stonehenge may have now been solved :
It was from the beginning a monument to the dead .
New radiocarbon dates from human cremation burials among and around the brooding stones on Salisbury Plain in England indicate that the site was used as a cemetery from 3000 B.C. until after the monuments were erected around 2500 B.C. , British archaeologists reported Thursday .
What appeared to be the head of a stone mace , a symbol of authority , was found in one grave , the archaeologists said , indicating that this was probably a cemetery for the ruling dynasty responsible for erecting Stonehenge .
“ It ’s now clear that burials were a major component of Stonehenge in all its main stages , ” said Mike Parker Pearson , an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield in England .
BCCI , THE CIA AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
Introduction
The relationships involving BCCI , the CIA , and members of the United States and foreign intelligence communities have been among the most perplexing aspects of understanding the rise and fall of BCCI .
The CIA 's and BCCI 's mutual environments of secrecy have been one obvious obstacle .
For many months , the CIA resisted providing information to the Subcommittee about its involvement with and knowledge of BCCI .
Moreover , key players who might explain these relationships are unavailable .
Some , including former CIA director William Casey , and BCCI customers and Iranian arms dealers Ben Banerjee and Cyrus Hashemi , are dead .
Others , including most of BCCI 's key insiders , remain held incommunicado in Abu Dhabi .
While promising in public hearings to provide full cooperation to the Subcommittee , to date the Abu Dhabi government has refused to make any BCCI officers available for interview by the Subcommittee .
Former BCCI chairman Agha Hasan Abedi remains severely incapacitated due to a heart attack .
Finally , some persons in a position to know portions of the truth have denied having any memory of events in which they participated and of documents which they reviewed .
A baseline for assessing the BCCI - CIA story is the CIA 's official record of its use of BCCI and its targeting of the bank , as set forth in several hundred CIA records created from 1982 through 1992 .
That record was , by and large , accurately represented by CIA acting director Richard Kerr in public testimony on October 25 , 1991 , supplemented by more detailed , classified testimony on October 31 , 1991 .
Unfortunately , that record also contains ostensible gaps in knowledge on the part of the CIA about the activities of key contacts in the Middle East for U.S. intelligence -- including BCCI shareholders Kamal Adham and Abdul Raouf Khalil , and BCCI customer and Iran / Contra arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi -- which strain belief .
Outside the documentary record provided to the Subcommittee by the CIA , there is additional material , consisting of BCCI documents , testimony from BCCI officials and insiders , and extrinsic , circumstantial and historic information describing other substantial contacts between BCCI and the intelligence community .
These include contacts between BCCI and :
** former U.S. intelligence officials , including a former head of the CIA ;
** former and current foreign intelligence officials ; and
** individuals engaged in covert operations on behalf of the United States government , including in the Iran / Contra affair .
In addition , the Subcommittee has received allegations of meetings between former CIA director William Casey and BCCI 's head , Agha Hasan Abedi .
CIA officials have told the Subcommittee that the CIA as an institution has rules requiring the creation of written records on every activity engaged in by the Agency , and on all significant information reported to the Agency .
In the summer of 1991 , the CIA engaged in what its officials described as a " dumb " or " brute force " review of its documents , essentially reviewing all possible files for information on BCCI , rather than relying on knowledgeable individuals to select such information .
The review located a substantial amount of material generated by the CIA throughout the 1980's , which was produced in July and August , 1991 for CIA internal reviews , in September and October for the Congressional intelligence oversight committees , and beginning in March , 1992 , to the Subcommittee .
Unfortunately , there remains a wide disparity between the CIA 's official account of critical relationships between BCCI and persons associated with the CIA , and the information available from other sources , including BCCI 's own records .
One is left with the choice of accepting the official record , which requires an assessment that the other contacts between BCCI and U.S. intelligence figures and operations are coincidental , or of assuming that the full story of BCCI 's relationship to the United States has been intentionally veiled by critical players on both sides of that relationship .
The Subcommittee Investigation and the CIA
The Subcommittee 's contact with the CIA regarding BCCI began in March , 1991 , when staff learned from a Subcommittee source that the CIA had prepared a report concerning BCCI 's criminality which was made available to Customs in late 1988 .
Cleared staff contacted the CIA 's congressional liaison office to request a copy of the document .
The staff was told that no such document had ever existed .
Perplexed , staff contacted its source to determine whether he was certain that the material had been provided .
The source referred staff to former Customs Commissioner William Von Raab , who confirmed the existence of the document .
Staff contacted the CIA a second time , and informed the agency that a senior Reagan administration official had viewed the document .
Again , the Subcommittee was told that no documents concerning BCCI had ever been created by the CIA .
( 1 )
Staff then met with Von Raab , who revealed that not only had the CIA provided him with a briefing paper regarding BCCI , but that he obtained it through the offices of then - CIA assistant director Robert Gates , who referred to BCCI as " the Bank of Crooks and Criminals . "
Von Raab also advised the Subcommittee that Customs agents handling the C - Chase investigation of BCCI had discovered in the course of their work several BCCI accounts that were actually accounts held by the CIA .
Von Raab told Subcommittee staff that his agents were told to cease their investigation of those particular accounts .
(2) However , in an interview with Subcommittee staff , AUSA Mark Jackowski denied that he had ever uncovered any CIA involvement with the bank and Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller testified that " at no time ... has anyone from the CIA ... attempted to obstruct or interfere with the Department of Justice 's investigation and prosecution of BCCI . " ( 3 )
On May 14 , 1991 , Senator Kerry wrote CIA Director Webster to again request the briefing paper on BCCI prepared by the CIA , as well as information on the CIA 's own use of the bank .
No reply was received in response to this letter from the CIA for over two months , during which BCCI was closed globally following its seizure in the United Kingdom by the Bank of England on July 5 , 1991 .
In the meantime , cleared staff requested a formal briefing from CIA staff concerning the CIA 's knowledge of BCCI 's activities .
The CIA provided an oral briefing at its offices in June , 1991 at the " secret " level , consisting of very general information concerning BCCI 's use by drug traffickers , material which was by then already largely a matter of public record .
The briefer provided by the CIA to Congressional staff was unfamiliar with other basic information about BCCI , such as the names of BCCI 's shareholders , including former Saudi intelligence chief Kamal Adham , the key figure in BCCI 's secret takeover of First American , and the CIA 's former principal contact in the Arab Middle East .
Further , the briefer also appeared to be ignorant of the principal analytic documents concerning BCCI previously prepared by the CIA and disseminated to Executive Branch agencies , which contained this and other more important information about BCCI .
( 4 )
On July 23 , 1991 , CIA director Webster replied to Senator Kerry 's May 14 request by letter , admitting to the existence of two documents concerning BCCI , which were described as " extremely sensitive " and therefore restricted to being held by the Senate intelligence committee .
(5) On reviewing these memoranda , Senator Kerry recognized that the earlier of the two documents , created in early 1986 , contained startling information -- that the First American Bank in Washington was secretly owned by BCCI .
The distribution list attached to the memorandum indicated that the CIA had communicated this information at the time to the Treasury Department .
These was no indication that either Treasury or the CIA had ever advised the Federal Reserve , the primary regulator of First American , of this critical information .
Senator Kerry asked Judge Webster to declassify immediately the fact that the CIA had known as of 1986 that BCCI owned First American , and to begin the process of declassifying the entirety of both memoranda .
On July 31 , 1991 , the CIA advised Senator Kerry that he could reveal the information concerning BCCI 's secret ownership of First American , but no other information from the memos .
The CIA had not yet acknowledged its own use of BCCI to the Subcommittee , or provided access to any other materials prepared by the CIA concerning BCCI .
When the single sentence from the 1986 memorandum was declassified , Senator Kerry supplied it immediately to the Federal Reserve , whose counsel expressed shock that the CIA , Treasury , State Department , and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had possessed this information in 1986 and never provided it to the Federal Reserve .
( 6 )
On August 2 , 1991 , with Congress in recess , acting CIA director Richard Kerr chose to provide the first public account of the CIA 's involvement with BCCI at the National Press Club , to a group of high school students , who were not permitted to ask questions .
During the August recess , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence began its audit of the CIA 's relationship with BCCI , and requested that the CIA provide its auditors with all documents prepared by the CIA concerning BCCI .
In the same period , the CIA began its own internal reviews of its handling of BCCI , including a management review , an intelligence review , and an " independent investigation " by the CIA 's statutory Inspector General .
(7) By the end of August , 1991 , the CIA had determined that there were several hundred reports on BCCI by the CIA , of which perhaps four dozen contained substantial information regarding the bank .
Through early October , 1991 , in response to further requests from Senator Kerry , the CIA continued to refuse to declassify any of the remainder of the information concerning BCCI on the ground that to do so might imperil sources and methods .
The CIA also remained unwilling to permit staff outside the Intelligence Committees to review this material .
As CIA legal staff later explained it , the CIA was unaccustomed to providing information pertaining to oversight issues to staff outside the Intelligence Committees , and felt uncomfortable with the questions being posed by the Subcommittee .
( 8 )
Ultimately , Acting Director Richard Kerr agreed to testify before the Subcommittee concerning BCCI in public , after Senator Kerry advised the CIA that the nomination of CIA director Robert Gates would be delayed until the CIA provided such testimony .
On October 25 , 1991 , Acting Director Kerr testified in open session before the Subcommittee regarding the CIA - BCCI relationship , expressing from his opening statement his personal discomfort about providing information concerning intelligence matters in public :
As an intelligence officer for 30 years , I find myself a little reluctant in an open hearing to talk about intelligence , intelligence sources , and intelligence methods , and the information that we acquire through that process ( emphasis added ) .
Despite Kerr 's reluctance , the information contained in his testimony , summarized below , substantially advanced the Subcommittee 's knowledge of the official record regarding the CIA 's contacts with BCCI .
For example , the Subcommittee learned for the first time that there were not two memoranda regarding BCCI prepared by the CIA , but hundreds which had been disseminated to other agencies .
Kerr also disclosed that he had provided the Treasury Department with information about BCCI 's secret ownership of First American in 1985 , a year earlier than previously known , and implying the existence of a separate memorandum to Treasury not previously acknowledged .
Kerr refused to answer a number of questions in open session .
In closed session the following week , Kerr acknowledged that several of the questions he refused to answer did not refer to classified information or concern national security .
Instead , he had refused to discuss the information in open session because he felt uncomfortable discussing information in public that might embarrass the United States , or any U.S. agency or official .
( 9 )
Initially , Kerr resisted providing the Senators serving on the Subcommittee the opportunity to review the documentary material pertaining to BCCI created by the CIA , suggesting instead that the CIA provide the Senators only general information characterizing the number of reports and the general substance , to " protect sources and methods . "
Following the closed session , during which Senator Kerry pressed again for the documents , it was agreed between the Subcommittee and the CIA that all the memoranda prepared by the CIA concerning BCCI would be sent to the Senate Intelligence Committee storage facility to permit review .
Months later , that material had still not been provided .
Finally , on February 18 , 1992 , some eleven months after the Subcommittee had first sought information concerning BCCI from the CIA , Director Gates , after meeting with Senator Kerry , directed the CIA to permit staff to review additional records at the CIA pertaining to BCCI .
Following this directive from Gates , the CIA for the first time made substantial information regarding its knowledge of BCCI available to the Subcommittee , although information on CIA operations using the bank remained unavailable , channeled solely to the Congressional intelligence committees .
The Subcommittee review culminated in the CIA agreeing to declassify certain material from the 1985 memorandum about BCCI , discussed below .
The Official Record
The CIA 's first user request in connection with BCCI was from the Federal Reserve in 1981 , which asked the CIA whether the CIA had any derogatory information concerning the Middle Eastern shareholders who were about to buy Financial General Bankshares ( FGB ) , which later became First American Bankshares , through the holding company CCAH .
The CIA , after reviewing its records , told the Federal Reserve that it had no derogatory information on the shareholders , who included Kamal Adham and Abdul Raouf Khalil , the past and then - current Saudi intelligence liaisons to the United States .
( 10 )
The CIA did not tell the Federal Reserve that Adham and Khalil were foreign intelligence liaisons of the United States , nor did it advise the Federal Reserve that both Adham and a third FGB shareholder , Faisal al - Fulaij , had been the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission probe in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by Boeing and Lockheed for arms sales to Saudi Arabia .
( 11 )
There is conflicting evidence as to whether the Governors of the Federal Reserve were aware of the intelligence background of any of the CCAH shareholders .
However , at the staff level at least the Federal Reserve did learn in 1981 of both the intelligence contacts of Adham and the SEC probe into his and Fulaij 's alleged receipt of bribes .
( 12 ) Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , who signed the order approving the application of CCAH shareholders to take over Financial Bankshares , testified before the Senate Banking Committee in early 1991 that he " was n't aware " of Mr. Adham 's intelligence background , and that " he was sure that it might send an eyebrow or two up , " and that " it might provoke further investigation . " ( 13 )
Because BCCI was not officially purchasing FGB , and a condition of the purchase was that BCCI not be involved in the transaction except as an investment advisor , the Federal Reserve did not ask the CIA about BCCI itself .
If it had done so , it would likely have learned about BCCI 's involvement in money laundering .
According to the contemporaneous CIA records retrieved during the search of Agency files during the summer of 1991 , the CIA first developed information concerning BCCI , which it provided users in the U.S. government , in 1979 .
After learning in the early 1980's that BCCI was , as an institution , involved in money laundering activities , the CIA began by the mid-1980's to target BCCI as an institution for foreign intelligence collection .
Initially , this collection operation was small .
The CIA began a larger and more comprehensive operation as of 1986 , which continued through 1990 .
This operation focused on the " people , the mechanisms , and the way that BCCI laundered narcotics money . " ( 14 )
In the course of targeting BCCI for laundering drug money , the CIA learned of BCCI 's involvement in manipulating certain financial markets , in arms trafficking , and in supporting international terrorism , including handling the finances of Sabri Al - Bannah or Abu Nidal , and his terrorist organization .
( 15 )
Between 1979 and 1991 , the Directorate of Operations of the CIA produced several hundred reports containing intelligence concerning BCCI .
BCCI was also discussed in a number of finished Directorate of Intelligence analytic studies , as part of larger discussions of terrorism and counter narcotics .
( 16 ) Among these reports was detailed reporting on the use of BCCI Panama by major narcotics traffickers .
The Operations Directorate also prepared three special analytic reports , incorrectly characterized by Kerr as having been prepared by the CIA 's Intelligence Directorate , one each in 1985 , 1986 , and 1989 , discussed below in some detail .
( 17 )
Kerr acknowledged that the CIA had also used BCCI for certain intelligence - gathering operations , and characterized the use as limited and routine , and undertaken without the knowledge of any person at BCCI .
A Senate Intelligence Committee audit , conducted in the summer and fall of 1991 , confirmed Kerr 's testimony on that point , according to a briefing provided by the auditor to Subcommittee staff .
The Subcommittee was not permitted by the CIA to read the actual report generated by Senate Intelligence Committee staff , and thus detailed review by the Subcommittee of that audit has not been possible .
( 18 )
Kerr also acknowledged what the Subcommittee had learned in testimony just one day previously from former First American president Robert Altman , that the CIA had made extensive use of First American for a variety of purposes , including as a repository for " normal banking " and for savings accounts .
( 19 )
The agency later informed Subcommittee staff that neither Clifford nor Altman had been made aware of the existence of the accounts prior to the summer of 1991 .
According to Kerr , critical to understanding the contacts between the CIA and BCCI were a number of things the CIA did not do .
Kerr testified that contrary to press reports , the CIA had not been involved with any BCCI black network of thugs and assassins , had not been involved with or had knowledge of any use of BCCI for the same of arms to Iran or the diversion of funds for the Nicaraguan Contras , had not violated any laws , had no relationship with BCCI 's head , Agha Hasan Abedi , and had never placed Abedi on a watch list .
( 20 )
The 1985 , 1986 and 1989 Reports
The Operations directorate produced two finished analytic reports regarding BCCI , the first in early 1986 , and the second in early 1989 , as well as a special intelligence report in early 1985 , which was the basis of the material provided to the Treasury and to OCC .
Kerr testified that as of early 1985 , the CIA had learned that BCCI had succeeded in gaining control of Financial General Bankshares in late 1981 , which then was renamed First American , and told the Treasury and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( " OCC " ) , about BCCI 's secret purchase .
( 21 ) Kerr did not inform the Subcommittee that the original report containing this information was then lost , and has never since been located by the CIA .
( 22 ) Congressional Relations at the Agency did inform Subcommittee staff that the author of the 1985 could not be identified .
However , in a subsequent meeting , the Associate Director of Operations informed Subcommittee staff that , indeed , the author had been identified and that he had been asked to reconstruct the memo to the extent possible .
The 1985 Report
There are a number of oddities pertaining to the early 1985 report by the CIA on BCCI .
The first oddity is the fact that original report is missing and has not been located by the CIA , which has instead , at the request of the Subcommittee , reconstructed the contents of the report by looking to the source information it was based upon , and relying on its normal procedures for analyzing and disseminating similar material .
The second unusual aspect of the report is that the CIA has records showing it to have been commissioned by the then - head of the International Division of the OCC , Robert Bench , who has denied under oath having ever sought the information .
A third oddity is that CIA records also show Douglas P. Mulholland , then the intelligence chief of the Treasury Department , as having also solicited the information .
Yet like Bench , Mulholland denies having any recollection of having done so .
Fourth , the information contained in the report -- that BCCI owned First American -- was important and startling , and would have been so recognized by anyone in the position of Mulholland or Bench -- yet neither of them recollect that the report discussed this issue .
First American was by then the largest bank holding company in the metropolitan Washington area , and BCCI 's prohibition from ownership had received widespread attention in the Washington Post and the financial press .
Firth , no action was taken by Mulholland or Bench in response to this critical information to alert federal law enforcement or the Federal Reserve , the primary regulator .
The CIA , having provided the information to Treasury and the OCC , believed it had no further obligation to disseminate the information , either .
In an effort to sort through these anomalies , the Subcommittee in the spring of 1992 reviewed the material provided by the CIA to Mulholland and Bench in 1985 .
During the course of that review , the CIA provided a complete record to the Subcommittee of all the raw information upon which the 1985 memo was based .
The Subcommittee requested the declassification of material from the 1985 material concerning First American and the bribery of officials .
The declassification was completed on April 9 , 1991 , and consisted of the following account , which excerpts the substance , and on critical factual issues , the actual language , of the original 1985 material :
The CIA 's Summary
Background :
In the early 1980s , as part of the overall U.S. Government effort to stop international narcotics trafficking , the Agency began collecting strategic foreign intelligence on narco - dollar money laundering .
A successful intelligence collection operation in the Caribbean developed operational leads to several major foreign banks , including BCCI , suspected of narcotics money laundering .
Pursuing these leads , CIA initiated a mutually productive dialogue with international banking experts at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to determine how CIA could meet OCC 's intelligence needs .
In late 1984 , Agency officers met with a senior official from OCC , who expressed interest in a broad range of international financial intelligence CIA could provide .
One of several issues in which the OCC official expressed interest was the takeover efforts and suspicious activities of institutions such as BCCI , which he specifically cited for its spectacular growth and the mystery surrounding its activities .
In a later meeting , a Treasury intelligence liaison official expressed the interest of that organization in BCCI because of a possible concern about the less than wholesome reputation of the bank .
Foreign Intelligence Collection :
In late 1984 and early 1985 , the Agency collected some intelligence on BCCI and disseminated the information to the Treasury Department .
The foreign intelligence provided to the Treasury dealt with several activities , including the following information .
The primary goal of BCCI senior management was growth in deposits at all branches internationally .
The strategy being employed by BCCI to achieve rapid growth in assets and profits included manipulation of international financial markets and bribery , which was an approved policy encouraged by senior executives , including the general managers and President Abedi .
The objectives of BCCI included developing both profits and political / economic leverage in the Near East , Africa , and Asia through the use of a tremendous volume of financial assets .
BCCI expansion in the United States included the secret ownership of the Washington , D.C. - based bank holding company with which BCCI was affiliated .
All of the shareholders in the Washington D.C. - based bank holding company were fronts for BCCI .
BCCI loaned them the capital to make the purchase in return for their shares as collateral , which was regarded as a sensitive secret within BCCI management circles .
If all of BCCI 's assets in the U.S. were included in their balance sheet , the bank would be much higher in the worldwide ranking of the top one hundred financial institutions .
The Agency - Treasury Dialogue :
CIA provided this foreign intelligence to the Treasury intelligence community liaison representative in January 1985 [ Douglas P. Mulholland ] , who reported to CIA that he carried it directly to the Secretary [ Donald Regan ] for his further disposition .
The Treasury intelligence liaison officer also recommended only two persons in the Comptroller hierarchy see this material , which he described as " dynamite . "
The liaison officer praised this information , promised to keep the Agency fully informed of Treasury 's reaction to it , and provided follow - up collection requirements to the Agency .
These included a request for examples of BCCI management encouraging the use of bribery .
The Treasury liaison officer also requested the name of the Washington , D.C. - based bank holding company owned by BCCI and the names of any other U.S. - based companies controlled by BCCI .
In April 1985 , Agency officers had a curiously unsatisfactory discussion with the Treasury intelligence liaison representative concerning BCCI activities reported earlier by the Agency .
The Treasury official explained that the position of the Treasury enforcement offices was that the BCCI activities reported by the Agency were not surprising and complemented the general picture Treasury had of BCCI .
The Treasury officer stated that although his organization was interested in BCCI 's activities to manipulate an international financial market and in the bank 's buying into the U.S. along the lines of its acquisition of Financial General Bankshares [ First American ] , Treasury was not concerned enough to levy further collection requirements on the Agency .
The Treasury intelligence liaison officer said that money laundering remained the major focus of Treasury 's enforcement side .
( 23 )
What is notable about the information contained in the memorandum is that it was emphatic on BCCI 's ownership of a Washington , D.C. based holding company , identified by Treasury as First American .
The Treasury 's senior intelligence official , Mulholland , initially considered the information to be " dynamite , " but by April , after conferring with then Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan , had concluded that Treasury saw no need for receiving further information about BCCI 's ownership of First American , or its plans in the United States generally .
Mulholland 's Testimony
On February 19 , 1992 , Douglas P. Mulholland , currently the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research , testified about his contacts with the CIA concerning BCCI as the special assistant for national security to the Secretary of the Treasury from 1982 through 1987 , when he was the CIA 's chief liaison in the Treasury .
Mulholland , a career officer of the CIA , had been placed in Treasury by CIA chief William Casey , and left his job at Treasury on retirement from the CIA in 1987 to become a researcher for the Bush election campaign , before being appointed to his current position as head of intelligence at the State Department .
Mulholland described his contacts with the CIA concerning BCCI as follows :
I have a very limited memory of any specific documents , discussions , or events relating to BCCI , including any information that may have been introduced by the intelligence community during the mid-1980's .
Although I may well have discussed sensitive information on BCCI with senior department officials , including then - Secretary Donald Regan , that was not such an unusual experience as to ingrain such a discussion in my mind .
. .
With regard to BCCI , I recall only receiving one report during my time at the Treasury . . .
The report was hand carried to me by a CIA officer who emphasized the sensitivity of the report .
I also recall this report because of its unusual format .
The report lacked any heading or identifying numbers , and was typed on a plain piece of paper .
One substantive aspect of the report struck me as particularly surprising , but because this information was produced and remains controlled by CIA , I am unable to discuss with you today any of the substance . ( 24 )
In public testimony , Mulholland therefore declined to discuss the substance of the single aspect of the report which he found surprising .
However , in interviews with Subcommittee staff prior to his testimony , Mulholland advised the Subcommittee that his memory concerned a matter in the CIA report which had nothing to do with BCCI 's possible ownership of U.S. institutions , and that he had no personal memory that the issue was raised in the report .
( 25 )
Mulholland emphasized throughout his testimony that his own memory regarding the BCCI report was very limited .
He acknowledged that the CIA 's documents reported him having provided the report Secretary Regan , but he stated he had no personal memory of having done so .
( 26 ) He estimated the frequency of his meetings with Secretary Regan regarding CIA reports as being anywhere from " zero to one hundred percent " of the time , and said he had not the " vaguest idea " of how often he had discussed such matters with the Secretary .
He testified that the secondary source chronology the CIA concerning his activities was plausible , but that he could not say for certain whether it was correct , as he had no memory of having asked for any information , or having briefed anyone else on the information . ( 27 )
Mulholland stated that even if he had recognized that the information contained in the report important , he would not have the right at the Treasury Department , let alone the responsibility , to take any action to disseminate the information further , since the CIA was the agency which created the information and controlled it . ( 28 )
Mulholland acknowledged that he had never received a comparable report from the CIA about any other bank besides BCCI , and that the BCCI report was not " normal . "
He testified that there was no record maintained at the Treasury Department of the report having been logged in , and he could not give any reason for this omission . ( 29 )
Mulholland said he had no memory of having commissioned such a report , despite the CIA 's documentary record that he had done so , and hence , he was unable to provide the Subcommittee with any reason why any person at Treasury might have asked the CIA to develop information concerning BCCI in late 1984 and early 1985 .
Bench 's Testimony
Bench , like Mulholland , had only a very limited memory of the 1985 report .
As he testified :
I do recall reviewing a classified piece of information that dealt with BCCI .
. . it was somewhere in the middle of the ' 82 to ' 87 period .
I feel comfortable about that .
. .
I recall receiving a document from the CIA that dealt with BCCI .
To the best of my recollection it did n't deal with First American and it did n't deal with anything in the United States .
There is an action step that I took within the office on that information . . . which was to look at this information in terms of LCD [ Lesser Developed Country ] debt .
( 30 )
In staff interviews prior to this testimony , Bench emphasized that he had no memory whatsoever of having ever been advised that BCCI held interests in any financial institution in the United States , let alone First American . ( 31 )
Bench also told staff that not only had he no memory of having commissioned a report on BCCI , but he would have been unlikely to have done so in any case , because of the OCC 's need to work abroad without officials from other countries being concerned that it was doing so in conjunction with U.S. intelligence .
Bench was therefore perplexed that the CIA had identified him as the requester , noting that to the extent he had an interaction concerning BCCI , it was the CIA asking him if he wanted information . ( 32 )
Regan's Recollection
Following the declassification of the 1985 memorandum by the CIA , the Subcommittee contacted former Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan to determine what memory he had regarding Mulholland having provided him with the 1985 memorandum .
According to an aide to Regan , he initially believed he had not been shown the memorandum by Mulholland because he had left Treasury to take the position of chief of staff at the White House , and so advised a Wall Street Journal reporter who contacted him at home in August , 1991 .
Regan was then contacted by Mulholland in August or September , 1991 , who advised Regan that Mulholland had reviewed records at the CIA showing that he did provide the memorandum to Regan , and that Mulholland had no personal recollection regarding the matter , either .
According to Regan 's aide , Regan still has no recollection of Mulholland ever providing information regarding BCCI to him .
( 33 )
In reviewing the CIA documents and the testimony of Kerr , Mulholland and Bench , it appears that the CIA has accurately set forth the information regarding First American provided Mulholland , Regan and Bench in 1985 , and that Mulholland , Bench and Reagan 's memories that the CIA did not tell them about BCCI 's secret control of First American are , at best , incorrect .
The 1986 and 1989 Reports
While the 1985 report received oddly limited distribution , the 1986 report , containing most of the key elements of the earlier report , including the fact that BCCI was owned by First American , was distributed more widely , to the Department of State , Defense Intelligence Agency , National Security Agency , National Security Council , Commerce Department , and to Treasury .
Thus , every major CIA user that might be interested in the information received it , except for the two agencies which would have had a statutory responsibility to begin investigations in response -- the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department .
However , Treasury logs again showed no actual receipt of the document , and there is no record of Treasury having passed the information to its agents in U.S. Customs , including those in Tampa whose investigation of BCCI lead to its indictment on money laundering charges in October , 1988 .
( 34 ) The 1989 report , which provided detailed information concerning BCCI 's criminality , was provided both Customs and the FBI , and reiterated the information , reported in the 1985 and 1986 memos , that First American was owned by BCCI .
Even at this late date , the Federal Reserve was notified by no one of the existence of the report , or of any of the material in it .
Unofficial BCCI-CIA
Links
The unofficial story of BCCI 's links to U.S. intelligence is complicated by the inability of investigators to determine whether private persons affiliated with U.S. intelligence were undertaking actions such as selling U.S. arms to a foreign government outside ordinary channels on their own behalf , or ostensibly under sanction of a U.S. government agency , policy , or operation .
In the 1970's and 1980's , there have been cases of people with ties to U.S. intelligence engaging in operations on their own behalf which in fact had no ties to any approved U.S. government interest , such as former CIA officer Edwin Wilson 's illegal arms sales to Idi Amin of Uganda and to Colonel Qaddafi of Libya .
There have been other cases , such as retired General Richard Secord 's arms sales to Iran and to the contras in the Iran / Contra affair , which are hard to distinguish from Wilson 's case , except for the fact that the sales had actual secret approval and support from officials within the government , although they were not authorized by law under the Arms Export Control Act , and although Congress did not receive notifications required by law from the President .
In the case of BCCI , former CIA officials , including former CIA director Richard Helms and the late William Casey ; former and current foreign intelligence officials , including Kamal Adham and Abdul Raouf Khalil ; and principal foreign agents of the U.S. , such as Adnan Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar , float in and out of BCCI at critical times in its history , and participate simultaneously in the making of key episodes in U.S. foreign policy , ranging from the Camp David peace talks to the arming of Iran as part of the Iran / Contra affair .
As early as the mid-1980's , sources in the United Kingdom were alleging that BCCI was providing services not only to the CIA , but to intelligence agencies of a number of countries , including the Soviet Union .
For example , a November 5 , 1986 letter to the Governor of the Bank of England , written anonymously , stated the following :
The BCCI is involved in helping people avoid Tax , illegal transfers of money , Hawala transfers , off the record deposits , conduit for drug and crime money and also as banker to intelligence agencies for most major agencies of the world .
( 35 )
Did BCCI , its shareholders , or its officers , perform services for the United States government during any part of its existence ?
Were such services linked in any respect to BCCI 's activities , such as its acquisition of First American ?
The unofficial record , explored below , raises these questions but cannot answer them definitively .
Kamal Adham : BCCI 's Godfather of Middle East Intelligence
Kamal Adham , who was the CIA 's principal liaison for the entire Middle East from the mid-1960 's through 1979 , was the lead front - man for BCCI in its takeover of First American , was an important nominee shareholder in BCCI , and remains one of the key players in the entire BCCI affair .
On July 29 , 1992 , he reached a plea agreement with the District Attorney of New York , acknowledging that he had been a BCCI front - man in the United States , and agreeing to provide full cooperation with U.S. law enforcement in BCCI - related investigations and prosecutions .
Adham was at the time of BCCI 's creation in 1972 , the brother - in - law of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia , and the head of Saudi Intelligence , responsible for internal security and relations with external intelligence agencies .
Press accounts concerning Adham from the late 1970 's refer to him as the " godfather of Middle East intelligence , " emphasize the closeness of his ties to the Central Intelligence Agency , and describe his having had responsibility for making payments , on behalf of the CIA , to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat when Sadat was merely Nasser 's Vice President and having financial troubles .
( 36 ) As Bob Woodward described it :
Relations between the CIA and the Saudi intelligence service were generally good , going back to the days when the legendary and enormously wealthy Kamal Adham had been its head .
In 1970 , the Saudis had provided then Egyptian Vice President Sadat with a regular income .
It was impossible to determine where Saudi interests in these arrangements ended and American CIA interests began . ( 37 )
Adham 's historic relationship with U.S. intelligence was indeed unusually close .
While Adham was still in place as the CIA 's liaison in 1977 , the CIA 's station chief for Saudi Arabia , Raymond H. Close , chose to go to work for Adham upon leaving the CIA , according to press reports at the time which Close has only denied since the BCCI scandal broke .
( 38 ) As Jeff Gerth of the New York Times reported in 1981 :
In the case of Mr. Close , the one time station chief in Saudi Arabia , former Government officials say his actions , while in the CIA and since retirement , are often clouded in mystery .
In the first place , some think Mr. Close may still be working for the CIA in some capacity , although he officially retired in 1977 .
They add that a further complicating factor is that some Saudis privately share the same perception .
( 39 )
The Times account describes how Close had actually given approval to weapons sales from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan in the early 1970's , in contravention of the " official policy " enunciated by the American ambassador , and states that Close went into business with Kamal Adham upon leaving the CIA . ( 40 )
Within months of going into business with Close , Kamal Adham became the " lead investor " for the CCAH group taking over First American , officially on his own behalf , but in fact , acting as a nominee for BCCI .
On April 23 , 1981 , Adham personally appeared at the Federal Reserve 's hearing on the First American takeover , to inform the Federal Reserve of his personal wealth and background , and his desire to be a passive investor .
In that appearance , Adham neglected to tell the Federal Reserve of his background in Saudi Arabian intelligence , historic ties to the CIA , or that Adham had acted as the most important liaison between the United States and his long - time friend , Anwar Sadat , in helping negotiate the Camp David accords . ( 41 )
As President Carter 's former Director of the Office of Management and Budget , Bert Lance , testified ,
There was an opportunity there for Kamal Adham to have done the kind of work he did with regard to Sadat 's visit to Jerusalem and that sort of thing , and subsequently playing a role in regards to satisfying some of the Arab countries with regard to the action that Sadat had taken , both in going to Jerusalem and also in Camp David . ( 42 )
The key role played by Adham in Camp David was apparently to encourage other Arab political figures not to repudiate Sadat for agreeing to peace with Israel .
Although such attempts may have appeared unsuccessful in terms of public statements by Gulf rulers , it is clear that many of the Gulf rulers in private provided some support for Sadat , including then - Crown Prince and now King Faud of Saudi Arabia , who sought to strengthen ties with the United States as a means of defending the Saud family from a variety of possible instabilities .
The actual intent of BCCI and its Arab shareholders in participating with BCCI in the takeover of First American remains a matter of speculation .
One article , appearing in the Washington Post on December 18 , 1977 , at the very beginning of the takeover efforts regarding First American and the National Bank of Georgia , described the intent of BCCI and the Arabs as gaining " access to the administration " through Lance . ( 43 ) The involvement of Gulf leaders in the takeover in Washington at the same time as the Camp David accords were put into place , would have been recognized within the Middle East at the time as an important symbolic gesture by each of them to strengthen ties with Israel 's superpower sponsor , the United States .
Their ownership of First American also would have providing a direct means to gain influence in the U.S. through the ownership of the bank .
To recapitulate : Adham was at the same time in business with a retired CIA station chief whose activities caused people in the U.S. and Saudi governments to question whether he was truly " retired , " acting as an intermediary for the U.S. in negotiations regarding Camp David , and acting as a phony " lead shareholder " in a take - over of the largest bank in the nation 's capital on behalf of BCCI .
The simultaneity was thus either part of a larger political plan of Adham , BCCI , and people within the Carter Administration and the CIA , or merely a coincidence .
Questioned about the concurrence of these events , Adham has told U.S. investigators that they were unrelated , and thus , BCCI 's purchase of First American was not a quid pro quo for Camp David .
Instead , Adham has suggested that his involvement in these events , and BCCI 's later involvement in financing the Presidential library , charities , and travel of President Jimmy Carter , for whom Camp David was the major achievement of his presidency , were in fact coincidence . ( 44 )
Clark Clifford , in sworn interrogatories , stated that he , too , believed Adham 's roles in Camp David and in the simultaneous takeover of Financial General were coincidence .
Clifford stated that while Adham had told him of his friendship with Sadat , he had not advised Clifford of having any role in Camp David . ( 45 )
A fuller account of Adham 's role as a front - man for BCCI from its creation and in connection with the CCAH takeover is contained in the chapter on BCCI 's nominees .
Abdul Raouf Khalil
Abdul Raouf Khalil , like Kamal Adham , was a BCCI shareholder and front man from its creation , and a key nominee in BCCI 's secret takeover of First American .
Like Adham , Khalil appeared at the Federal Reserve on April 23 , 1981 to tell the Federal Reserve he intended to be a passive investor .
Like Adham , Khalil failed to advise the Federal Reserve that he was , at the time of the Federal Reserve 's hearing , a key figure in Saudi Arabian intelligence , and its liaison to the United States .
Indeed , Khalil 's description of his activities at the hearing were fundamentally misleading on this point , as they presented Khalil to be nothing more than a private Arab businessman , who as a friend of Adham , joined Adham to be passive investor of Middle Eastern money in the stable U.S. banking system .
As Khalil told the Federal Reserve :
My career has been devoted to business and I presently hold interests in real estate , mechanical and electrical maintenance projects , and commodities .
In addition , I have been involved in some business ventures with American and British manufacturers for the installation of electronic and computer equipment in Saudi Arabia . ( 46 )
Khalil did not characterize the kind of electronics and computers he was installing in Saudi Arabia , or advise the Federal Reserve of the telling name of one of his businesses : the Saudi Security and Technical Services Company .
In fact , the electronic and computer equipment which Khalil referred to included the electronic and computer equipment for the Government of Saudi Arabia , and for its intelligence operations .
Price Waterhouse audit reports suggest that Khalil had no written contact with BCCI from 1985 on .
By the late 1980's , senior officials of BCCI knew of no way to contact Khalil , and in some cases , such as that of chief financial officer Massihur Rahman , even doubted his existence . ( 47 ) Yet throughout this period , BCCI used Khalil -- or his name -- extensively as a nominee in transactions in Latin American and the Caribbean , as well as in Europe , while Khalil continued to have ongoing contact with the CIA , which continued , according to law enforcement officials , until well after BCCI 's closure on July 5 , 1991 .
Moreover , Khalil simultaneously was a principal shareholder and director of Capcom , BCCI 's commodities trading affiliate , throughout this period .
Khalil 's continuing ties to the CIA are exemplified by the experience of U.S. regulators , who asked the State Department in 1991 to locate Khalil for service of legal documents , and were told that Khalil could not be located .
After some months , the regulators determined that Khalil was frequently found in the offices of the CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia .
Upon making this suggestion to the State Department , the regulators found that service of the legal documents on Khalil was quickly arranged .

Former CIA Director Richard Helms
and BCCI Front Man Mohammed Irvani
Adham and Khalil were not the only BCCI and CCAH shareholders with intelligence ties .
Before Adham acted as the lead shareholder in the takeover of First American , another person acted as BCCI 's chief front - man in an earlier , unsuccessful takeover attempt .
That man , Mohammed Rahim Motaghi Irvani , was listed in the original SEC filing in the early , 1978 takeover attempt , as a 5 percent shareholder of CCAH .
Irvani was at the time the principal partner of former CIA director Richard Helms in Helms ' international consulting firm , Safeer , and the chief financier of that firm .
During the time Irvani acted as BCCI 's lead front - man in the original takeover , he received advice on how to be protected from any liability in that role by Helms .
Thus , there were personal , legal , and financial links between Helms and Irvani at a critical time in the history of BCCI 's acquisition of First American .
Irvani founded the Melli Industrial Group in Iran in 1949 to manufacture footwear and leather goods , and developed close ties to the government of the Shah of Iran .
By the time of the first Financial General Bankshare 's takeover in 1978 , the Melli Industrial Group owned 23 operating companies , as well as joint ventures with foreign firms such as Goodyear and United Chemical .
Irvani also owned the Alwand Industrial Co. , which held interests in the Iran Arab Bank , and had a net worth estimated in financial documents of over $ 50 million personally and a financial empire whose corporate value was as much as $ 800 million . ( 49 )
Irvani's friendship and financial support were critical to Helms in this period .
Helms , a thirty - year veteran of the CIA and its predecessor , the OSS , was dismissed in February , 1973 from his position as CIA director by President Nixon and appointed Ambassador to Iran until 1977 , where he met Irvani .
When he returned to the U.S. , Helms was indicted for lying before a Congressional committee concerning CIA activities in Chile .
On October 31 , 1977 , Helms plead no contest to two charges , in return for a recommendation by the government that he not be sentenced to prison .
In arranging this plea agreement , Helms was represented by Washington defense attorney Edward Bennett Williams .
But in addition to Williams ' negotiations , Helms also called upon Clark Clifford for help .
In the fall of 1977 , Clifford visited a top Justice Department official to argue against an indictment of Helms , saying such charges could damage the U.S. intelligence community .
( 50 )
Despite Clifford 's successful intervention with Justice , as a result of the guilty plea , Helms was , in the words of the federal judge who presided over the case , " in disgrace and shame . " ( 51 ) It was precisely at this time that Irvani provided a critical lifetime to Helms through financing the Safeer Company , named for the Iranian word for " Ambassador , " as an international consulting firm whose initial business was mostly supplied by Irvani and Irvani 's contacts .
According to Safeer Company corporate records and other documents on file in civil litigation in Atlanta in the case of G&H Montage , Gmbh v. Irvani , Superior Court of Gwinnett County , Georgia , 88 - A- 03571-6 , 80 percent of Safeer was capitalized and owned by Irvani .
Moreover , much of Safeer 's early business activity was handled by Irvani 's former chief U.S. assistant , Roy Carlson , who became Vice President of Safeer and had close ties to BCCI .
Carlson , who served as a Naval officer in the Pacific during World War II , joined the U.S. foreign service and was detailed to South Africa , before moving to the Bank of America , where he spent twenty years .
While working for BOA , Carlson was stationed in Teheran in the 1960's and in Beirut in the early 1970's .
Carlson ultimately became head of the bank 's operations throughout the Middle East and East Africa .
During that time , he came into close contact with Abedi , advising Abedi on the formation of BCCI in 1972 , prior to BCCI 's incorporation in Luxembourg .
In turn , Abedi had introduced Carlson to Irvani , one of the most successful industrialists in Iran , who hired him to be manager of the Melli group .
During this period Carlson started his own company , the " North West Investment Company " , which was created in order " to help expedite shipments through Europe to companies in Iran . "
( 52 ) North West invested $ 120,000 into Safeer Company during its first year , and one year later , liquidated this investment in Safeer , selling its shares to an entity , " Brockton Leather Company , " which in turn sold them to Richard Helms for one dollar .
( 53 )
Corporate records obtained from Switzerland in May , 1992 show that North West is still listed as in operation , and that Carlson is listed as Vice - President of the Company and as a resident of Teheran , although Carlson lives in Snellville , Georgia .
Northwest corporate records also show that Dr. Marco Jagmetti , the lawyer for Northwest , is a director of Rothschild Continuation Holdings , a holding company run by BCCI director Dr. Alfred Hartmann . ( 54 ) Although it has not been able to determine if they are related companies , the Subcommittee has uncovered documents indicating that BCCI shareholder Kamal Adham was President of a Panamanian holding company called " North West International " .
( 55 )
After the Iranian revolution , Carlson fled Iran and went to work for Richard Helms in Safeer , on transactions financed by Irvani .
Then , after Ghaith Pharoan purchased National Bank of Georgia from Bert Lance on behalf of BCCI , Agha Hasan Abedi personally selected Carlson as the new head of National Bank of Georgia . ( 56 )
A memorandum prepared by BCCI lawyers following a meeting with Carlson in November , 1990 describes how Irvani by early 1978 became a front - man for BCCI in its takeover of First American , at the very time Irvani was financing Helms ' international consulting firm .
The memorandum described Carlson as telling BCCI the following :
In the mid-1970's , and arising out of the relationship which had grown from Agha Hasan Abedi 's involvement with Irvani over Iran Arab Bank , Agha Hasan Abedi had invited Rahim Irvani to take a 5 % stake in [ First American ] .
Carlson said that Agha Hasan Abedi wished the consortium holding the shares to have a broad background including those from Iran .
Carlson said the material produced at trial purported to indicate that Rahim Irvani had applied to Credit & Commerce Americas for a loan in order to purchase the share stake ...
The investment had not proceeded because firstly , Rahim Irvani had never been keen to make the investment at all , but had been persuaded that he could do so on the basis of the loan to be made to him [ by Abedi and BCCI . ]
( 57 )
When Irvani agreed to act as a front - man , Richard Helms drafted legal language to protect Irvani against possible liability for the use of his name as a shareholder by Abedi , BCCI , and the Clifford law firm .
A telex from Helms to Irvani , dated October 20 , 1978 , describes Helms ' assistance to Irvani as follows :
Roy Carlson asked on October 19 that I have an independent attorney review the seven documents he sent me by telex .
. . you are not running undue risks .
Carlson also told me that you wanted a draft of a simple agreement which would hold you harmless in these arrangements .
The text of this agreement is as follows :
LETTER AGREEMENT .
For value received , the undersigned jointly and severally agree to indemnify you from any liability , loss , or damage , including reasonable attorneys ' fees , arising out of or caused by your granting , as shareholder or a director , a power of attorney to any partner of Clifford , Glass , McIlwain and Finney , a Washington D.C. law firm , to act in your name with respect to the transaction involving Financial General Bankshares of Washington , D.C. ( 58 )
The telex ended with the sign - off , " With Warmest Regards , HELMS . "
With this suggestion , Helms was assisting Irvani in acting as a front - man for BCCI , who would not be at risk for the use of his name by the BCCI group represented by Clark Clifford and Robert Altman .
Helms was assisting Irvani in his acting as a BCCI front - man in the takeover being handled by Clifford just
one year after Clifford had assisted Helms in his negotiations with the Justice Department on his perjury indictment .
Irvani's role in the takeover was acknowledged recently by his son , Bahman Irvani , who told the Atlanta Constitution that his father " lent his name to the 1978 takeover bid at the request of BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi . " ( 59 )
Despite the existence of the October , 1978 telex from him to Irvani regarding how to structure the hold - harmless agreement for Irvani to the Clifford firm in the original FGB takeover , Helms has recently denied that he was involved in the transaction , terming the allegation " totally untrue . . . absolute nonsense . " ( 60 )
Irvani's role in BCCI 's initial attempt to acquire Financial General ended with the Iranian revolution in January 1979 , as he became an unnecessary nominee .
Over the following decade , Irvani , Carlson , and Helms continued to interact with one another and with BCCI .
Helms provided introductions for Irvani to then U.S. Ambassador to Germany Walter J. Stoessel , Jr in January , 1979 , and through former Senator Albert Gore Senior , contacted Senator Bumpers ' office for assisting on locating rice dealers for Irvani .
Helms and Irvani also continued to refer business to one another .
( 61 )
During the 1980's , Helms continued to introduce Irvani to prominent Americans , writing Vice President Bush on Irvani 's behalf in October 29 , 1987 , forwarding an October 16 , 1991 letter from Irvani to Bush , and forwarding letters of congratulations from Irvani to President - elect Bush and Secretary of State James Baker on November 28 , 1988 .
None of the actual letters from Irvani to George Bush discussed in the Helms - Irvani correspondence have been located .
But the cover letter from Irvani to Helms on the October 16 , 1987 letter , refers to Irvani 's desire to provide Vice President Bush with advice on his presidential campaign . ( 62 )
Helms took other steps on Irvani 's behalf , including introducing Irvani 's son Ali to Ambassador Paul Nitze , arms control advisor to President Reagan , and writing to U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner on Irvani 's behalf on May 22 , 1989 .
Helms introduced Irvani 's son , Ali , to former CIA station chief for Saudi Arabia Raymond Close -- who had previously worked for Irvani 's successor as BCCI 's lead front - man in the First American takeover , Kamal Adham -- on July 11 , 1989 . ( 63 )
Throughout this period , BCCI financed Irvani investments in the United Kingdom and in the United States , which in 1989 amounted to $ 38 million in a single transaction to buy a New York office building , 140 East 58th Street .
Other BCCI documents show numerous loans , typically of millions of dollars at a time , to the Irvani family , as well as indications that the Irvanis also received substantial loans from the National Bank of Georgia , both while that bank was owned by BCCI through Ghaith Pharoan , and after Pharoan was replaced as a nominal owner by First American .
BCCI and William Casey and His Network
On February 23 , 1992 , NBC News broadcast the allegation that former Director of Central Intelligence William Casey met secretly for three years with Abedi , that such meetings took place every few months at the Madison Hotel in Washington , D.C. , and that they discussed matters relating to U.S. arms deals to Iran and the arming of Afghani rebels .
Prior to the broadcast , NBC contacted the CIA and was advised of the following by the CIA :
" An extensive search of CIA files and cable traffic revealed no evidence that CIA was involved in or had any knowledge of any use of BCCI for the sale of arms to Iran or the diversion of funds for the Nicaraguan contras , in connection with the Iran - contra affair . " ( 64 )
Previously , Kerr had testified before the Subcommittee on October 25 , 1991 that :
allegations that the Agency had any direct or indirect relationship with Abedi or recruited him for CIA activities are absolutely baseless .
( 65 )
According to the CIA in February , 1992 , the CIA found " no records or evidence whatsoever to indicate that former Director Casey or the Agency had any sort of relationship with Abedi . " ( 66 )
Balanced against these flat denials are statements to the contrary by one BCCI official in a position to know to U.S. officials .
The BCCI official explicitly described meetings between Casey and Abedi at the Madison Hotel in the mid-1980's , identified one other person who had personal knowledge of the meetings , and provided an account which one U.S. official deemed credible . ( 67 ) In addition , there are statements by BCCI officer Abdur Sakhia and Bert Lance that each had noticed in 1985 a change in Abedi 's attitudes towards the United States , which they attributed to his developing a relationship with the CIA .
Sakhia testified that in 1984 , he was told by Abedi , or one of his associates in London that Abedi was uncomfortable about travelling in the United States because he feared he was on a CIA watch list , but that as of a year later , Abedi 's attitude had changed completely , giving Sakhia an impressions that " a deal had been struck somewhere . "
( 68 )
Lance provided a more detailed account , describing a meeting with Abedi at a symposium on conflict resolution at Emory University sponsored by President Carter in October 1983 :
What [ Abedi ] said was . . . from the precise moment that Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President of the United States , I have been on the CIA Watch List .
And my every movement , my every act , whatever I do , personally as well as through BCCI , is noted , watched , observed , under surveillance of the Central Intelligence Agency .
. .
I said : Well , why , Mr. Abedi ? . . .
And he said something that was very interesting , Mr. Chairman .
He said :
You have to understand that I fall into the category of being a Third World liberal . . .( 69 )
According to Lance , Abedi's attitude and concern about the CIA suddenly changed significantly in 1984 .
Where he had been concerned about making visits to the United States , and about expanding his operations in the United States , he now felt confident , leading Lance to conclude that Abedi had received " an assurance " that the U.S. government would no longer impede his activities .
Lance , acknowledging he had no hard evidence for his assertion , nevertheless concluded that the CIA had made an effort " to coopt Mr. Abedi and BCCI , and in effect , turn them into the bank of the CIA . " ( 70 )
Neither Lance nor Sakhia had been exposed to the other 's testimony at the time of making these statements , or had ever met one another .
One possible explanation of the contradictory accounts is that Casey undertook actions in the foreign policy or intelligence sphere while director of the CIA outside its record keeping and operations .
The CIA 's legal department has described such activity by Casey , including any role he had in the Iran / Contra affair , as being undertaken in his position as an advisor to the President , rather than in his position as Director of Central Intelligence .
( 71 ) In such cases , Casey would have taken actions which were outside the record keeping of the CIA , undocumented , fully deniable , and effectively irretrievable .
Iranian Arms Deals and Dealers
Regardless of whether Abedi and CIA director Casey concluded a deal under which BCCI would provide off - the - books assistant to any unofficial or " off - the - books " operation of Casey , BCCI was incontestably used by key Iran / Contra figures to finance arms shipments to Iran in connection with the secret Reagan Administration initiative .
CIA records , as well as Kerr 's testimony , state the CIA did not know this .
However , the record is clear that a number of BCCI officials knew of the U.S. government arms sales to Iran at the time .
Ironically , BCCI knew of this Reagan Administration initiative at a time when the Iranian arms sales remained secret not only from the U.S. public but the Congress , and at a time when the CIA knew that BCCI was a criminal enterprise .
BCCI was also involved in a number of other Iranian arms sales after the fall of the Shah , some of which appear not to have been completed , and others of which appear not to have involved the United States .
In still other cases involving BCCI 's use for arms sales to Iran , it is simply not possible to determine the extent of involvement by U.S. officials .
BCCI was used from the late 1970's in London by Iranian arms brokers who became the central figures in the " October Surprise " allegations of secret negotiations with Iran involving Casey and Iranians over the fate of U.S. hostages .
It was also used by Iranian arms dealers in Britain who never completed arms sales with Iran .
Most important , it was extensively used by Adnan Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar in arms deals that were directly on behalf of the United States .
1984 -1986 : Adnan Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar
Both Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi and Iranian arms merchant Manucher Ghorbanifar were central agents of the United States in selling arms to Iran in the Iran / Contra affair .
According to the official chronologies of the Iran / Contra committees , Khashoggi acted as the middleman for five Iranian arms deals for the United States , financing a number of them through BCCI ; and Ghorbanifar was the individual who conceptualized the arms - for - hostage negotiations , and provided the initial channel to the " Iranian moderates " with whom the Reagan Administration negotiated prior to delivering shipments of U.S. TOW missiles and HAWKs to Iran in 1985 and 1986 .
Khashoggi was served as the " banker " for arms
shipments as the undercover scheme developed in 1985 and 1986 .
Khashoggi himself said he advanced $ 1 million in August 1985 to " get the deal going . "
According to his own and other published accounts , he provided some $ 30 million in loans altogether , depositing money in a Swiss bank account controlled by Lake Resources , the company run by former White House aide Oliver North , who played the pivotal role in the operation involving the arms sales and diversion of funds to Nicaraguan Contra rebels .
Both Khashoggi and Ghorbanifar banked at BCCI 's offices in Monte Carlo , and for both , BCCI 's services were essential as a means of providing short - term credit for sales of arms from the U.S. through Israel to Iran .
Khashoggi's use of BCCI for the Iranian arms sales was first described , in passing , in an Iran / Contra committee deposition on June 8 , 1987 , describing the movement of $ 10 million from Credit Swisse which would to through BCCI four times to produce $ 40 million of sales " and therefore , additional profit . "
In the same deposition , the witness , Khashoggi business manager Emanuel Floor , described Ghorbanifar as stating , " these are my associates , " and writing down the name , " BCCI . "
Floor described BCCI as acting not merely as Ghorbanifar and Khashoggi 's bank for the purpose of these transactions , but as an actual partner in the Iranian arms deals . ( 72 )
As described in detailed Subcommittee testimony by BCCI Paris manager Nazir Chinoy on March 18 , 1992 , Khashoggi came to Paris to meet with Chinoy in early 1986 to discuss continuing transactions he had until then been conducting through BCCI 's Monte Carlo branch .
According to Chinoy , the meeting was set up when Chinoy wished to learn more about the reasons for the sudden increase in assets and activity of the Monte Carlo branch of BCCI , which was under his jurisdiction as chief manager for the French region of the bank .
He learned from Manir Karim , the branch manager for Monte Carlo that most of the new assets and activity were the result of a very successful relationship that had been developed with Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi .
Khashoggi had two to three " very active " deposit accounts at Monte Carlo , according to Chinoy , and kept very large balances there , paying " his crew " through travellers checks at the rate of $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 each month .
Chinoy decided to learn more , and met with Khashoggi and Karim in BCCI 's office in Paris :
I met Khashoggi in a small room at the bank .
He told me he had a deal , he was to be a supplier , buy American arms through Israel and supply them to the Iranians .
What he wanted was a four - day credit .
( 73 )
Khashoggi told Chinoy he was working directly for the U.S. government and the CIA , and needed BCCI because none of the parties involved in the Iran / Contra affair trusted one another :
The Israelis wanted their money for the arms whereas the Iranians would only pay when the arms physically would reach them .
The Americans wanted their money as soon as they gave their arms to the Israelis and Khashoggi did not have the money himself at the time .
Khashoggi wanted a revolving $ 5 million credit , and the charges he was prepared to pay were generous -- 2 % front end fees per transaction .
For $ 2 million you would get $ 40,000 per transaction .
Then you would get interest at 1 1/2 % over LIBOR for the actual number of days the overdraft loan or line of credit was operating .
This was juicy . ( 74 )
In meeting Khashoggi , Chinoy learned for the first time that BCCI had been providing these services for Khashoggi for a number of months through the Monte Carlo office of BCCI , without the knowledge of the Paris office , which was responsible for the Monte Carlo office .
Karim explained that there had been at least five transactions as of early 1986 , that had never been detected by other BCCI offices and which had never received formal approval in writing by BCCI 's headquarters in London .
This was done by exploiting BCCI 's " float , " through BCCI 's officer taking a check on a Thursday or Friday from Khashoggi and holding it over the weekend , while giving Khashoggi credit for the check immediately .
Khashoggi in return would use the money and make the payments to the Israelis .
The arms would be delivered over the weekend and by Monday or Tuesday Khashoggi would have the check from a Swiss bank , normally Credit Suisse , where the North / Secord " Enterprise " maintained its accounts .
Credit Suisse would give Khashoggi a " Demand draft , " which BCCI would then cash for its credit on the transaction on a Tuesday or Wednesday after Khashoggi had his funds from the Iranians . ( 75 )
According to Chinoy , the five or more transactions had involved eight to ten million dollars in all .
Chinoy recognized that the activity was profitable , but he was uncomfortable about BCCI being involved in a transaction that secretly involved the U.S. , Israel and Iran in arms deals , and that had not been and would not be approved in writing by BCCI 's London office .
Chinoy said that he told Khashoggi he could not continue the deals , that they would have to stop them .
In the weeks that followed , Chinoy noticed that profits at the Monte Carlo branch fell , indicating to him that his subordinate had obeyed Chinoy 's order .
But he then learned that the arms deals started up again anyway , and that Khashoggi and Karim completed two to three more transactions out of Monte Carlo totalling $ 15 million to $ 17 million dollars . ( 76 )
In the same period , Chinoy learned from Karim that Iranian arms sales Manucher Ghorbanifar also maintained a regular deposit account at BCCI Monte Carlo , in amounts ranging from $ 2 million to $ 2.5 million , typically kept in short - term certificates of deposit .
Chinoy suggested to Karim that BCCI sever its relation with Ghorbanifar and was told :
We should let the account be .
He is in very good books with French intelligence , with the American government , he is helping everybody and he has good accounts in Switzerland and I hope we will get more money from him . ( 77 )
According to Chinoy , BCCI officers understood that Ghorbanifar had helped the French government obtain the release of hostages held in Beirut , and that accordingly , BCCI would strengthen its status in France by handling Ghorbanifar 's business .
Further confirmation for Chinoy 's account came from BCCI 's senior office in the United States , Abdur Sakhia , who testified that in the mid-1987 , he was contacted by FBI agents investigating the Iran / Contra affair who needed to obtain records from BCCI Monte Carlo , which was the " missing link " in their documentary chain involving the U.S. and Credit Suisse .
According to Sakhia , the FBI told him that a BCCI branch manager in Monte Carlo had been paid $ 100,000 , " presumably by the U.S. government , " and deposited that check in Switzerland in his own account .
They asked Sakhia to obtain BCCI 's records concerning the transaction from Europe .
Sakhia contacted his superiors in London and they discussed whether or not BCCI should provide the information to the FBI despite the fact that to do so would violate French secrecy laws .
The official at BCCI - London , Ameer Siddiki , agreed with Sakhia that if BCCI 's involvement in Iran / Contra became known , it would focus dangerous attention on the bank 's other activities .
BCCI London informed Sakhia that if the United States government agreed to prevent BCCI 's involvement from becoming public , BCCI would violate French law and provide the records to the United States .
The FBI agreed to this arrangement , and the records regarding the Iranian transactions were provided by BCCI to the FBI . ( 78 )
Following this agreement , Sakhia remained concerned about the fact that the BCCI official involved , Manir Karim , had accepted a $ 100,000 bribe to handle the transactions , and deposited them in a non-BCCI institution , and yet had not been disciplined by BCCI .
Based on this and related information , Sakhia concluded that the handling of the arms sales by BCCI " was all being orchestrated from London and London was aware of what was happening . " ( 79 )
According to the Iran / Contra deposition of Albert Hakim , banker for the North / Secord Enterprise , Khashoggi made deposits in the North / Secord accounts from BCCI in the amount of $ 2.5 million on February 7 , 1986 ; $ 2.5 million on February 10 , 1986 ; and two checks of $ 5 million each on February 18 , 1986 .
Still additional deposits were made from BCCI by Khashoggi for $ 5 million on May 18 , 1986 .
Provocatively , Hakim referred to additional transactions amounting to millions more involving an entity referred to simply as " IC " of the Grand Caymans , reminiscent of BCCI 's own Grand Caymans affiliate " ICIC . " ( 80 )
Three payments to BCCI from the North / Secord accounts , including Lake Resources , the account used to finance arms to the contras , are shown in the ledger books maintained by Hakim on behalf of the enterprise , amounting to $ 10 million only .
( 81 ) In addition , the Hakim ledgers show five wire transfers amounting to $ 346,000 to First American Bank , which may merely indicate that Secord , North , or the fourth partner of the enterprise , former CIA agent Thomas Clines , may have had an account there .
Evidence for the involvement of BCCI headquarters in London and Abedi in the Iran / Contra arms transactions is contained in documents between BCCI Grand Caymans and BCCI London in March 1986 involving a $ 10 million arms transaction -- the exact amount referred to by Emanuel Floor as having been intended for movement through BCCI by Khashoggi and Ghorbanifar , and tracking the February 18 , 1986 payments referred to by Hakim .
The documents , which refer to the use of a front company " in formation " to handle the transaction , are in the nature of preliminary discussions regarding whether BCCI would handle the transaction .
But they contain a critical fact : they demonstrate the involvement of BCCI - London in transactions involving BCCI Monte Carlo and BCCI Grand Caymans .
From Chinoy 's point of view , the meaning of the documents is that when he expressed concern about the Khashoggi transaction , London simply went around him .
From Sakhia's , the documents showed that Abedi had approved the BCCI project from the beginning . ( 82 )
Ironically , Clark Clifford had his own long - standing ties to Khashoggi .
In 1981 , Khashoggi took $ 250,000 from Northrop intended for Saudi Arabian Air Force General Hashim M. Hashim .
Four years later , Northrop released documents accusing Khashoggi of demanding the bribe for the general , and then converting it to his own use , Khashoggi retained Clifford to represent him in the subsequent federal grand jury investigation of the matter .
Significantly , both Kamal Adham and Faisal al Fulaij , BCCI 's front - men for the 1981 takeover , were investigated as well as Khashoggi for taking money from Northrop and Lockheed in connection with U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia .
( 83 )
Perhaps as a matter of coincidence , the business formed by Secord in May , 1983 immediately upon his retirement from the U.S. government in partnership with Hakim , Stanford Technology Trading Group International of Vienna , Virginia , used a BCCI shareholder as its local agent in Saudi Arabia for contracts to provide security services in the Middle East .
The person who Secord hired to help him acquire Saudi government contracts was Abdullah Said Bugshan and his brothers .
Together , the Bugshan brothers owned about one half of one percent of BCCI during the period they reprsented Secord and Hakim in Saudi Arabia .
While representing Secord , they had also deposits in BCCI ranging from $ 13 million to $ 21 milllion in BCCI and had outstanding loans of about $ 6 million from BCCI . ( 84 )
Other Iranian Arms Dealers and BCCI
Ben Banerjee
A recurring question about the Iran / Contra scandal is the issue of whether there may have been earlier arms sales to Iran , prior to the period covered by the Iran / Contra Congressional committees .
On September 29 , 1987 , Die Welt , a German newspaper , reported that in 1984 , Iran 's ambassador authorized the purchase of 20,000 U.S. - made TOW missiles after talks between U.S. Lt. Col.
Oliver North and Iranian officials in Hamburg .
According to Die Welt , the deal fell through and the weapons were never delivered after an Iranian contact disappeared with the letter of credit .
According to Die Welt , Iran 's ambassador to West Germany , Mohammad Djavad Salari , signed a letter authorizing the purchase of the anti-tank weapons worth $ 264 million , and North , then a member of the U.S. National Security Council , took part in one
negotiating session on Nov. 20 , 1984 .
The newspaper said the purchase authorization came after talks in a Hamburg hotel between Iranians and two British - based arms dealers , Michael J. Aspin , owner of the weapons dealership Delta Investments and Indian - born millionaire weapons dealer Ben Banerjee , chief of the British company BR and W. Industries .
( 85 ) Both Banerjee and North denied the allegation .
Documents obtained by the Subcommittee , filed in a British criminal case later brought against Aspin for fraud in connection with the attempted sale of the American TOW missiles to Iran in 1984 , and a second attempted sale in 1985 , include a " pro-forma invoice , " dated November 21 , 1985 , for the supply and delivery of 1250 units of BCM 71A TOW MISSILES , manufactured in the USA , " all brand new in manufacturers original packing , " from B.R. & W. Industries , Ltd. , signed by Ben Banerjee , U.S. , denominated " lift trucks " for the purpose of bank and customs documentation , and handled by BCCI in London .
The invoice was accompanied by telexes and letters on BCCI stationary of a nature and type ordinarily used by BCCI , showing BCCI providing counter guarantees and letters of credit for a transaction involving the " lift trucks " in November and December , 1985 , involving the Iranian government and its bank , Bank Melli , and channeled through the Arabian Gate General Trading Co. of Dubai , United Arab Emirates . ( 86 ) In staff interviews , BCCI Paris manager Chinoy confirmed that Banerjee banked with BCCI in London and was involved in " large dealings with Iran . " ( 87 )
During the Aspin trial , Leslie Aspin , Michael Aspin 's brother , testified that the TOW missile sale was a legitimate sale authorized by the United States government as part of a 1984 - 1985 effort to ransom CIA agent William Buckley , with the weapons to be transferred from Portugal to Iran .
In a sworn statement of May 1 , 1987 , Aspin attested that he and Oliver North opened three joint accounts in BCCI Paris into which North deposited $ 5 million on November 15 , 1984 , and listed the account numbers and signature cards of the three accounts , one of which was maintained for an entity called " Devon Island , " allegedly , under the signature of North and Bannerjee , and the other two accounts , which were numbered accounts , maintained under the signatures of Aspin , Bannerjee and Ghorbanifar . ( 88 )
The Subcommittee has confirmed the existence of accounts in London involving Banerjee and in Monte Carlo involving Ghorbanifar , but has not received access to BCCI 's accounts in Paris to determine whether or not the accounts referred to by Aspin existed .
North has denied having maintained such an account .
However , BCCI Paris manager Chinoy did learn of an account in the name " Devon Island " when he received a telephone call in 1988 from a London office of BCCI asking about it , and was advised by his assistant that the account existed but had not been used .
( 89 )
Both Banerjee and Aspin are dead .
The Subcommittee is continuing to seek Banerjee and Aspin 's records from BCCI 's liquidators in hopes of determining whether the arms sales to Iran in which they were participated had the backing of or involvement of any U.S. official .
1980 : BCCI and October Surprise : Cyrus Hashemi
The late Cyrus Hashemi , an Iranian expatriate living in London , is a key figure in the " October Surprise " allegations charging that William Casey and other members of President Reagan 's election team in 1980 engaged in negotiations with Iran , whereby Iran would delay the return of U.S. hostages held in Iran until after the November , 1980 election , in return for the U.S. providing Iran with needed arms for its war against Iraq .
According to these allegations , which are substantially based on states made by Hashemi 's brother Jamshid , who was based in Paris in this period , Cyrus Hashemi was to have acted as the middle - man in these secret negotiations between Casey and Iran .
Later , Hashemi was indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for weapons dealings with Iran in a case that was ultimately thrown out of court as a result of complications arising out of the Iran / Contra affair .
( 90 )
Without reaching any judgments concerning these allegations , records obtained by the Subcommittee demonstrate that BCCI was one of the principal banks used by Cyrus Hashemi in the United Kingdom . ( 91 )
Bruce Rappaport , Alfred Hartmann , and BCCI
Bruce Rappaport , an Israeli - born Swiss businessman who was investigated in 1987 by Independent Counsel Robert McKay for certain activities he engaged in on behalf of former CIA director Casey , had several connections to important participants in the BCCI affair .
For example , he placed one of BCCI 's key " rent- a- faces , " Alfred Hartmann , who headed BCCI 's secretly - held Swiss affiliate , Banque de Commerce et Placements , on the board of directors of his Intermaritime Bank of Geneva and New York ; developed a relationship with BCCI 's original contact in the U.S. , Bert Lance , in the mid-1980's , and purchased an Antiguan melon - farm from Israeli arms dealers who were significant customers of BCCI in Miami . ( 92 )
Rappaport 's links to BCCI are significant chiefly because of his relationship to Casey , a frequent golfing partner .
For example , Rappaport threw a party in Washington in the summer of 1985 for Casey to demonstrate high - level support for a project to build a pipeline to ship oil from Iraq through Jordan .
Rappaport was also the person who allegedly controlled accounts which received $ 10 million for the contras provided the North - Secord operation by the Sultan of Brunei , at the request of Elliot Abrams .
The Iran / Contra Committees were told by Swiss authorities that the $ 10 million had disappeared , and was found to have " mistakenly " gone to an unwitting Swiss businessman , who then returned the money after the Iran / Contra affair was discovered .
Press accounts , which Rappaport has denied , contend that the businessman was Rappaport .
If Rappaport did indeed receive the funds , the placement of the $ 10 million with him would not likely have been in error , given his close relationship with Casey .
( 93 )
Oman
While reviewing the complex relationships between BCCI and the Bank of Oman , which was affiliated with BCCI , the Subcommittee came across several linkages suggesting ties between the Sultanate of Oman , key figures in Saudi intelligence and U.S. persons with connections to the intelligence community .
As a 1985 article in the New York Times noted , Western intelligence has been a major influence in this tiny , but strategically placed , Gulf State , adjacent to the United Arab Emirates headed by Sheik Zayed .
Although BCCI is not mentioned in the article , there is a substantial amount of evidence which demonstrates that both BCCI and the CIA has played a major role in the foreign policy and economic affairs of that country .
The article discusses a Pasadena corporation , Tetra Tech , operated by a former CIA agent , which " helps manage several key Omani government agencies . " ( 94 )
It is clear that several companies and government agencies in Oman had multimillion dollar loans from BCCI .
BCCI 's loan book , dated March 3 , 1991 , for example , shows : Oman Aviation Service had an $ 8 million loan ; Oman Building and Contracting Co. had over $ 11 million ; Oman Flour Mills Co. had a $ 13 million loan ; Oman Development Bank had $ 13 million ; Oman Investment and Finance Company had a $ 10 million loan ; Oman Building and contracting Services had a $ 16 million loan ; and Sultanate of Oman had $ 14 million in loans .
These are , of course , only the companies or government agencies which are clearly identifiable as having an Oman connection : there are undoubtedly other companies which the Subcommittee has been unable to identify .
( 95 )
Besides the entities listed above , BCCI may have been moving money through the National Bank of Oman to fund the war in Afghanistan .
British journalists have written :
" BCCI 's role in assisting the U.S. to fund the Mujaheddin guerrillas fighting the Soviet occupation is drawing increasing attention .
The bank 's role began to surface in the mid-1980's when stories appeared in the New York Times showing how American security operatives used Oman as a staging post for Arab funds .
This was confirmed in the Wall Street Journal of 23 October 1991 which quotes a member of the late General Zia 's cabinet as saying ' It was Arab money that was pouring through BCCI . '
The Bank which carried the money on from Oman to Pakistan and into Afghanistan was National Bank of Oman , where BCCI owned 29 % . " ( 96 )
The National Bank of Oman and its CEO , Case Zawawi , also did business with Bruce Rappaport .
Jerry Townsend , the President of Colonial Shipping in Atlanta , told the Subcommittee that his former employer , Bruce Rappaport , had business relations in Oman with Case Zawawi at the National Bank of Oman .
Townsend , who claims to have worked as a soviet analyst with the CIA , was employed by Rappaport between 1981 and 1990 .
Townsend recalled that Rappaport flew Zubin Mehta and the London Philharmonic to Oman on one occasion to entertain the Sultan and other members of the royal family .
More importantly , according to Townsend , Rappaport and Zawawi had numerous " contracts with the Saudis . "
The consolidated loan report for BCCI of March 3 , 1991 shows a loan authorization of almost $ 11 million to the Zawawi group with an outstanding balance of nearly $ 8 million .
( 97 )
Conclusions
Key questions about the relationship between U.S. intelligence and BCCI cannot be answered at this time , and may never be answered , without the ability for investigators to review BCCI records and interview BCCI witnesses held by the government of Abu Dhabi .
Other questions could be answered from documents available in the United Kingdom , and subpoenaed by the Committee , but for the decision by the British judge on an application of BCCI 's liquidators not to permit the Committee to receive them without the written " permission " of the depositors involved , such as Abu Nidal , and the deceased Ben Banerjee and Cyrus Hashemi .
Still other BCCI documents in the United Kingdom have been segregated and sealed by British intelligence ( MI - 5 ) , and withheld from dissemination to anyone .
( 98 )
Finally , other relevant information in the possession of the CIA concerning certain important figures in BCCI 's history remains classified , and hence outside the scope of this report .
Summaries of some of this classified material have been provided to staff in a classified form that cannot be referred to .
However , even there , the underlying material upon which these summaries were based , has been withheld , and therefore any additional relevant information the underlying material may contain can only be a matter of speculation .
However , even by its own account of its activities , the CIA made two significant mistakes in its handling of BCCI .
First , the CIA failed to provide the critical information it had gathered to the correct users of the information -- the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department .
Kerr testified that he was " not sure it was a bad decision , " a judgment challenged immediately during the hearing by Senator Hank Brown , who noted :
My training was that somebody 's supposed to take responsibility .
. . .
And when a decision is made that is a bad decision , you identify who made it .
. .
You may feel a failure to get information about a criminal activity to the Federal Reserve is not [ a bad judgment ] , I have a different view of it . ( 99 )
Second , even when the CIA knew that BCCI was as an institution a fundamentally corrupt criminal enterprise , it used both BCCI and First American , BCCI 's secretly held U.S. subsidiary , for CIA operations .
In the latter case , some First American officials actually knew of this use .
( 100 )
While the reporting concerning BCCI by the CIA was in some respects impressive -- especially in its assembling of the essentials of BCCI 's criminality , its secret purchase of First American by 1985 , and its extensive involvement in money laundering -- there were also remarkable gaps in the CIA 's reported knowledge about BCCI .
According to Kerr , the CIA did not have any information regarding the involvement of Kamal Adham -- its chief intelligence liaison in the Arab Middle East during the 1960's and 1970's -- in BCCI , or that of his successor , Abdul Raouf Khalil , or of Iran / Contra arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi .
( 101 ) Those statements have since been reiterated to the Subcommittee by the CIA in April 1992 , following a further review of CIA records , with the caveat by the CIA that CIA record keeping is not consolidated , and that it remains possible that information which exists has not been retrievable .
The professed lack of knowledge by the CIA about the activities of its foreign intelligence liaisons and operatives who were BCCI 's major shareholders and customers is perplexing and disturbing .
The relationships between the CIA and Adham and Khalil were , according to public accounts , among the most important intelligence relationships the United States has had in Saudi Arabia over a quarter of a century .
Similarly , Khashoggi and Ghorbanifar performed a central role for the U.S. government in connection with the Iran / Contra affair in operations that involved the direct participation of CIA personnel .
The CIA 's professions of total ignorance about their respective roles in BCCI are out of character with the Agency 's detailed knowledge of many critical aspects of the bank 's operations , structure , personnel , and history .
If one accepts these statements at face value , it is hard not to conclude that the CIA 's ignorance on these matters constituted a significant intelligence failure on the part of the CIA .
Given the CIA 's responsibilities to protect the U.S. against covert action by foreign powers , it would be especially disturbing if the United States does not , as a general matter , know anything whatsoever -- as the CIA has testified here -- of very substantial financial activities within the United States of chief foreign intelligence liaisons such as Adham and Khalil .
The errors made by the CIA in connection with its handling of BCCI were complicated by its handling of this Congressional investigation .
Initial information that was provided by the CIA was untrue ; later information that was provided was incomplete ; and the Agency resisted providing a " full " account about its knowledge of BCCI until almost a year after the initial requests for the information .
These experiences suggest caution in concluding that the information provided to date is full and complete .
Caution is especially warranted given the CIA 's recurrent statements that its record keeping has not been consolidated , and that it is possible that records pertaining to BCCI , or its shareholders , could have been missed in its search .
The lack of recollection by the chief intelligence officer of the Treasury , Douglas Mulholland , and by a then - senior official of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , Robert Bench , of the CIA having told them about BCCI 's secret ownership of First American , is troubling .
According to the CIA 's records , Mulholland recognized at the time that the information was important , and sought more information .
The original memoranda are written in a fashion that makes it unlikely that any recipient would have not have noted BCCI 's secret ownership of Washington 's largest bank holding company , and have remembered it later .
Accordingly , the testimony of both Bench and Mulholland raises questions about their candor .

Average Web Page Breaks 1600K
Summary :
The size of the average web page passed 1600 K for the first time in July .
Page size appears to inversely correlate with site traffic .
The size of the average web page of the top 1000 websites passed 1600 K for the first time in July ( see Figure 1 ) .
At the same time the number of objects in the average web page increased to 112 objects in July 2014 .
Figure 1 : Growth of the Average Web Page Average Web Page versus Survey Size
In the HTTParchive.org site , the data also revealed that the average web page for the top 300,000 pages is 1829 K in size made of up 96 objects on average .
So the top 1000 pages have more objects ( 112 vs. 96 ) but less K ( 1622 K vs. 1829 K ) .
The top 100 web pages average 1612 K with 90 requests per page ( see Figure 2 ) .
So page size appears to be inversely related to site traffic .
The more traffic a site has , the smaller the pages .
For the average number of web objects the correlation holds true for the top 100 and 1000 pages , but not the top 300,000 .

Table 1 shows that the average top 500 home page goes from 507K and 64.7 requests upon initial cache - cleared load to 98.5 K and 16.1 requests .
One average , caching on these popular sites saves 81 percent of the bytes , and 75 percent of the requests .
Other data from the study showed that Akamai still dominates CDNs , with 43.6 percent of the top 500 using Akamai , delivering 22.3 % of the initial load , and 25.8 percent of the cached loads overall .
Limelight , Footprint , Panther Express and Google round out the top five CDNs.
167 ( 33.4 % ) of the top 500 sites employed one or more of the Web 2.0 technologies ( XHR , JSON , or GWT Google Web Toolkit ) .. 38 percent employed from 1 - 10 web bugs on their home pages .

The Supreme Court Gives GITMO Detainees Constitutional Rights
On days like today it is hard to sit down and type .
On days like today my heart really is n’t in it , but I am going to try .
I have no choice , I feel as though I must type , because days like today are the most important days to type .
So here goes .
Today is the day that America lost forever the ability to ever defend herself again .
The supreme court has ruled in favor of the enemy combatants held at GITMO , they have ruled that the enemy is entitled to the rights of Americans citizens to a civilian trial .
Somehow the supreme court has decided that not only does the UNITED STATES constitution apply to people who are not citizens ( I ’m not talking about resident aliens ) , but is also applies to our enemies .
People who were captured on the battlefield fighting against us are now entitled to a trial in American courts .
This is unprecedented .
Justice Anthony Kennedy writing for the majority said , “ The laws and Constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times . ”
Fine , nothing wrong with that , but we are n’t talking about Americans here , we are talking about people who are fighting against us .
Writing for the minority decision Justice Antonin Scalia said “ the decision will make the war harder on us .
It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . ”
Here is the problem , this will affect any future confrontation that America may need to engage in in the future .
And in a truly stunning turn of events Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the 9/11 mastermind may actually benefit from this decision .
He was facing a military tribunal now he may have the right to a civilian trial on American soil .
Funny how the man who planned the murders of three thousand Americans on September 11th because he hates America suddenly adheres to the American justice system when it benefits this mother fucker .
The supreme court feels that the rights of the enemy are more important than the rights of you and I .
And the Democrats agreed and cheered the decision .
I just do n’t have anything else to say about this .
Here are the traitors who gave constitutional rights to the mass murdering pieces of shit ; Justices Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter , Anthony Kennedy , and John Paul Stevens .
The usual suspects .
While those in the minority were Chief Justice John Roberts , Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas .
But on a side note what is almost as disappointing about this is the fact that I thought we had turned a corner with the appointments of Alito and Roberts to the bench , but we still seem to be in the minority .
After a few great rulings by the supreme court we get this disastrous ruling .
It may have been a 6 - 3 decision if Sandra Day O’Conner was still on the bench , so maybe we are closer .
That will change if the next president has a supreme court appointment .
We will never gain control of the supreme court , it was just a pipe dream .
President Bush managed to stem the liberal activist supreme court tide with his two great nominations but it was n’t enough .
Perhaps it will be enough to tread water but it looks as though we are going to continue to swim against the tide .
Today is the day we lost the war , not because of our soldiers overseas , but because of the politics at home and now the supreme court .
But we lost more than the Iraq war , we lost all future wars that we may have had to enter .
We do not deserve to have our soldiers overseas fighting for our rights when the people at home are n’t willing to fight for our soldiers .
Why should we lose another American life overseas for an unappreciative American public , and a supreme court that feels the enemy is more important ?
We have grown soft and weak .
The war is lost , it is time to bring the troops home .
The study " Understanding the Web browser threat : Examination of vulnerable online Web browser populations and the " insecurity iceberg , " was a collaborative effort conducted by researchers at The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Google and IBM Internet Security Services .
The research offers a comprehensive analysis of Web browsers , particularly in the area of security .
The study 's aim was to analyze Web browser preference and behavior for people using the Internet .
Altogether , the study found that less than 60 percent ( 59.1 ) of people use up - to - date , fully patched Web browsers .
Failure update browsers exponentially increases the chance for remote attacks executed by hackers , the study found .
In recent years , the Web has become the vehicle for malicious attacks , which have enabled cyber criminals to execute code that shuts down a system or takes complete control of a user 's PC .
Unlike years past , hackers now are creating new malware specifically to gain access to user 's personal and financial information , with the aim of committing identity theft or selling it on the black market .
The study concluded that of the hundreds of millions of users accessing Web browsers worldwide , more than 600 million were at risk of attack for not running the latest , most secure Web browser version as of June 2008 .
Firefox users were far and away the most likely to use the latest version , with an overwhelming 83.3 percent running an updated browser on any given day .
However , despite Firefox 's single click integrate auto - update functionality , 16.7 percent of Firefox users still continue access the Web with an outdated version of the browser , researchers said .
The study also revealed that the majority of Safari users ( 65.3 ) percent were likely to use the latest version of the browser between December 2007 and June 2008 , after Safari version 3 became available .
Meanwhile , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer users ranked last in terms of safe browsing .
Between January 2007 and June 2008 , less than half of IE users -- 47.6 percent -- were running the most secure browser version during the same time period .
Opera ranked slightly higher than IE , with about 56 percent of users who said that they have applied the latest version of the browser to their computer .
Of the four browsers surveyed , Opera ranked last in popularity , with a just 11 million users that comprise .8 percent of the marketshare .
Altogether , Safari has captured only 48 million users , equaling about 3.4 percent of the market -- a user base far surpassed by Firefox 's 227 million and IE 's 1.1 billion , encompassing 16.1 percent and 78.3 percent of the market respectively .
Researchers initiated the study to highlight the growing global problem of Web exploitation and the increasing number of users who log onto various Web browsers .
Among other things , the researchers aimed to address the growing number of threats launched by attackers in recent years that exploit Web vulnerabilities with stealthy and silent attacks for financial gain .
" Profit motivated cyber " criminals have rapidly adopted Web browser exploitation as a key vector for malware installation , " researchers state .
" As popularity of this attack vector has blossomed , there have been frequent reports of hundreds of thousands of Web sites succumbing to mass - defacement , where the defacement often consists of an embedded iFrame .
These iFrames typically include content from servers hosting malicious JavaScript code designed to exploit vulnerabilities accessible through the user 's Web browser and subsequently to initiate a drive - by malware download . "
The researchers also stated that attacks have become so sophisticated that they are able to spread malicious code to numerous users by infecting " legitimate " high trafficked and popular Web sites , underscoring the need for users to apply the latest browser patches and updates when surfing the Internet .
Researchers also advised that in light of a more dangerous security landscape and the barrage of Trojans , botnets and other malware , users need to use the most recent version of the installed software and immediately apply the latest patches as they become available .
" With today 's hostile Intent and drive - by download attack vectors , failure to apply patches promptly or missing them entirely is a recipe for disaster ; exposing the host to infection and possibly subsequent data disclosure or loss , " they said .
If we as Americans do one thing well , it ’s gaining weight .
NIH data shows that two - thirds of Americans are overweight , and one - third are obese .
Of course we have all heard the usual “ lack of diet and exercise ” mantra about weight gain .
Data certainly backs up our increasingly sedentary lifestyle , such as the fact that the average United States household now spends roughly 8 hours a day with the television on .
That being said , what if there was more to the story ?
The United States is falling victim to a systematic elimination of the neighborhood .
Shopping is occurring more and more at large retail chains ( i.e. Walmart , Home Depot , Costco ) which require tremendous real estate .
Therefore city planners are favoring the creation of sprawling commercial centers where numerous such chains can be built in close proximity to one another , and allow for one - stop shopping .
The only place where ample commercial real estate is available is far away from residential areas , and thus the divide begins .
Rather than walking several blocks to the local market , customers are forced to get into their car and drive to the commercial center .
Because the center is so congested and busy , planners must reroute traffic and build highways with access ramps just to reach the developments , creating more barriers to traveling on foot .
Of course the shopping plaza will also have several chain restaurants to choose from so that one does n’t have to leave the area if they get hungry .
This cycle then becomes vicious as the successful center diverts customers away from locally owned shops and restaurants that are available in residential areas , forcing them to close their doors .
The end result is that Americans are no longer able to walk anywhere , making our usual form of inadvertent exercise impossible .
The problem of sprawl also compounds the existing dilemmas facing our society as a whole .
When people have to drive to get anywhere , our conversations are carried out via cell phone and text messages rather than face to face .
Increased sprawl also increases commute times to work , which already average about 50 minutes round trip every day .
Added to our ever - lengthening average work week , this cocktail spells increased isolationism and loneliness for our society , which increases food drive .
Take notice of your surroundings , and pay attention to the development projects happening in your neighborhood .
Increased sprawl and other such environmental factors may be making an unwitting contribution to our nation ’s obesity epidemic .

I believe that we can safely say that the period of man ’s history from 476 AD to 1000 AD is the most maligned of all .
This period , known to historians as the Early Middle Ages , is still referred to by most laymen as the Dark Ages .
In fact the term “ dark ages ” is almost as ancient as the period itself – it was coined in the 1330s by Petrarch , the Italian scholar , to refer to the decline of Latin literature .
It was later taken by the protestant reformers ( 16th century ) and then the members of the Englightenment ( 18th century ) as a derogatory term with much broader implications , because they saw their own “ enlightenment ” as absent from the earlier period .
Hardly a fair judgement on the past .
Fortunately for modern students of history , the term is now officially known as the Early Middle Ages – a name which has no connotations at all .
So , having given you the background on the terms , here are ten reasons that the dark ages were , in fact , a period of great progress and light .

10 Universities Are Born
The Classical Education ( still used today in some schools ) was the system used by the Universities which were created in the Early Middle Ages ( the first in history ) .
The universities taught the arts , law , medicine , and theology ( the study of religion ) .
The University of Bologna ( founded in 1088 ) was the first ever to grant degrees .
In addition to the classical structure ( based on Ancient Greek education ) , these medieval universities were heavily influenced by Islamic education which was thriving at the time .
While women were not admitted to Universities in the early days , the education of women did exist .
The convents of the day educated the young women who would often enter at a very young age .
One such women ( Hildegard Von Bingen ) is one of the most celebrated women of the Medieval era who had great influence over the men in power at the time .
9 Scientific Foundations Laid
Advertisement
While progress in Science was slow during this period in the West , the progress was steady and of a very high quality .
The foundation was laid here for the wonderful blossoming of science that was to occur in the High Middle Ages to come .
It can be safely said , that without the study of Science in the Early Middle Ages , we would be considerably behind in our scientific knowledge today .
Ronald Numbers ( professor at Cambridge University ) has said : ‘ Notions such as : “ the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science ” , “ the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of the natural sciences ” , “ the medieval Christians thought that the world was flat ” , and “ the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages ” [ are ] examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth , even though they are not supported by historical research . ’

8 Carolingian Renaissance
The Carolingian Renaissance was a period of advancements in literature , writing , the arts , architecture , jurisprudence , liturgical and scriptural studies which occurred in the late eighth and ninth centuries .
The Carolingians were Franks and the most well known is Charlemagne .
The Carolingian empire was considered a rebirth of the culture of the Roman Empire .
At the time , Vulgar Latin was beginning to be replaced by various dialects as the main spoken languages in Europe , so the creation of schools was vital to spread knowledge further amongst the common people .
It was also this period which gave us the foundation of Western Classical Music .
7 Byzantine Golden Age
Under Justinian this period gave us the Corpus Juris Civilis ( Body of Civil law ) – an enormous compendium of Roman Law .
Literacy was high , elementary education was widespread ( even in the countryside ) , middle education was available to many people , and higher education ( as discussed above ) was also widely accessible .
In the Byzantine empire during this period we saw a massive outpouring of books – encyclopedias , lexicons , and anthologies .
While they did not create a lot of new thinking , they solidified and protected for the future much of what was already known .
6 Religious Unity
This is a sticky topic , but the fact is , during the Early Middle Ages , Europe had a united Church , an agreed upon canon of the Bible , and a well developed philosophical tradition .
This led ( as one would expect ) to a great period of peace within the Western nations .
While Islam was not in agreement with the doctrines of the West , much mutual sharing of information happened and the Islamic contribution to the West is still felt today .
This union of beliefs allowed for intellectual progress unseen since the Roman Empire at its heyday .
In a sense you might consider this period as the calm before the storm , as it was merely a hundred years later that the first Crusade would be called to take Jerusalem back from the Muslims – an event which ended the flow of knowledge between groups .
5 Algebra Arrived
Thanks to the learning of the Islamic people in the East , the world received its first book on algebra .
The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing was written by Al - Khw?rizm ? ( 790 - 840 ) and the Arabic title of the book gave us the word “ algebra ” .
The word algorithm comes from al - Khw?rizm ?’s name .
This book gave us the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations .
Later translations of his books also gave us the decimal positional number system we use today .
Al - Khw?rizm ? , along with Diophantas , is considered the Father of algebra .
4 Art and Architecture
During the Early Middle Ages , architecture was diverse and innovative .
It introduced the idea of realistic images in art and it laid the groundwork for the Romanesque period which was to come in the High Middle Ages .
The period also included the introduction and absorption of classical forms and concepts in architecture .
It can safely be said that this period was the first period of high art – with previous styles ( Migration period ) being much more functional and less “ artistic ” .
In the Early Middle Ages we witness the birth of an astonishing and beautiful history of art and building .
3 Fantastic Weather
Trivial as it may seem , the weather played a much greater part in the lives of the average people during the Middle Ages and beyond .
When we think of the “ Dark Ages ” we tend to see images of snow storms , rain , thunder , and darkness – such as we see in films like “ The Name of the Rose ” .
The fact is , in the Early Middle Ages , the North Atlantic region was warming up – so much so that at the opening of the High Middle Ages ( 1100 AD ) , the region was 100 years into an event now known as the Medieval Warm Period .
This warm period thawed much ice and enabled the Vikings to begin their colonization of Greenland and other northern nations .
Ironically , the Protestant reformation ( 16th century ) up until the 19th century suffered the Little Ice Age – the period of “ enlightenment ” was literally darker and colder than the “ dark ” ages .
During this period , reforms and better knowledge of agriculture provided a boost to food supplies .
2 Law Becomes Fair
The Early Middle Ages had a complex system of laws which were often not connected , but they were effective and fair for the most part .
For merchants traveling around the world , there was the Lex Mercatoria ( Law Merchant ) which had evolved over time , rather than being created .
This law included arbitration and promoted good practice amongst traders .
At the same time , Anglo Saxon Law was formed with a focus on keeping peace in the land .
While this eventually lead to some very tough laws , living under the legal system in the Early Middle Ages was probably the best time to live – as it was still flexible and fair for the majority .
The third important legal system was the the Early Germanic Law which allowed each person to be tried by his own people – so as to not be disadvantaged by ignorance or major cultural differences .
1 Agricultural Boom
If you were wanting to die a martyr by starvation , the Early Middle Ages were not the time to do it !
As a consequence of the excellent weather and greater agricultural knowledge , the West did extremely well .
Iron tools were in wide use in the Byzantine empire , feudalism in other parts of the world introduced efficient management of land , and massive surpluses were created so that animals were fed on grains and not grass .
Public safety was also guaranteed under the feudal system and so peace and prosperity was the lot for most people .

Will Smith donates $ 1 m to fund Scientology school
When people first heard Will Smith and his wife , Jada , were donating $ 1 million to a new private school , there were cheers all round , however , the press has changed its tune after discovering the facility will be run on Scientology principles .
The New Village Academy , which will open later this year , has reportedly hired a team of Scientologists to help integrate Scientology teaching methods into the school curriculum – although the dreaded ‘ S ’ word is n’t mentioned anywhere on the school ’s website , www.newvillageacademy.org.
‘ School should be forthright about its purposes .
And if it ’s a religious school , I do n’t see why it would n’t wish to announce its religious affiliation loud and clear , ’ Ron Reynolds , executive director of the California Association of Private School Organizations , told Fox News – pointing out that it was n’t the fact that Scientology methods would be taught at the school he objects to , just that they are n’t being open about it .
Unlike his good friend Tom Cruise , Will Smith – whose two children are both currently home - schooled – has never openly admitted to being a Scientologist , although has hinted to an affiliation .
Last December , he told Access Hollywood : ‘ I was introduced [ to Scientology ] by Tom , and I ’m a student of world religion .
I was raised in a Baptist household , I went to a Catholic school , but the ideas of the Bible are 98 percent the same ideas of Scientology , 98 percent the same ideas of Hinduism and Buddhism . ’
Four years ago , he and his wife also donated $ 20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program , which forms the basis for Scientology ’s home - schooling system .
Not Everyone Can Be " Most Likely To Succeed "

The JFK quote really puts it over the top .
As many as 100 toxic chemicals associated with adverse health effects are released into the air from polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) shower curtains .
These chemicals make up that " new shower curtain smell " unique to PVC vinyl shower curtains and shower curtain liners , according to " Volatile Vinyl : The New Shower Curtain 's Chemical Smell . "
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The new study is released today by the US - based Center for Health , Environment & Justice ( CHEJ ) and in Canada by Environmental Defence and the Canadian Environmental Law Association ( CELA ) .
Though ubiquitous in homes around the world , PVC shower curtains contain many harmful chemicals , including volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , phthalates and organotins .
Toxic chemical off - gassing from PVC shower curtains may contribute to respiratory irritation , damage to the central nervous system , liver and kidney , nausea , headaches and loss of coordination .
" The new shower curtain smell may be toxic to your health , " said Michael Schade , report co-author and CHEJ PVC Campaign Coordinator .
" Vinyl shower curtains are contaminating the air we breathe and we need the Canadian government to take serious action on the use of PVC in consumer products , " said Dr. Rick Smith , Executive Director of Environmental Defence .
" Combined exposure to the multiple chemicals released from vinyl shower curtains is cause for concern , " said Aaron Freeman , Policy Director , Environmental Defence , " especially for children as they are more sensitive to toxic chemicals . "
The five PVC shower curtains tested in the United State by CHEJ were purchased from Bed Bath & Beyond , Kmart , Sears , Target and Wal - Mart .
One brand sold at Bed Bath & Beyond was found in Canadian stores ; however , most major department stores in Canada carry some variety of vinyl shower curtain ...

About 200 cyclists , some riding with children , shut down the westbound lanes of the Gardiner Expressway last night in what police called a dangerous stunt .
The Gardiner was shut down for almost half an hour when the cyclists , most of whom were wearing helmets , stormed onto the westbound lanes from Lower Jarvis St. around 7:30 p.m. , said Traffic Services Sgt. Jeff Redden .
The cyclists pedaled down the expressway for about 20 minutes and seven kilometres before being rounded up by police cruisers and directed toward the off - ramp at Dunn Ave , said Redden .
There were no collisions or injuries , but traffic was stalled as the bikers took up all westbound lanes and refused to leave , Redden said .
“ It was a crazy idea .
They came , and then like cattle they all went up the ramp and once they were up there , they realized there was a problem when they could n’t get off the ramp . ”
Some cyclists dismounted their bikes and climbed over a wall onto CN railway tracks to escape police , said Redden .
Redden said he had never seen anything like it .
“ It goes beyond common sense in saying its not a good idea ... Everyone has their right to free speech and protest , but not in that manner . ”
Redden said it did not appear to be an organized protest , but that several cyclists had placards demanding a bike lane along Bloor St .
He believes it was related to the Critical Mass bike ride , which meets on the last Friday of every month .
Four cyclists who refused to leave the highway were arrested and charged under the Provincial Offences
Act with cycling on a highway .
Redden said some of the cyclists dismounted their bikes , thrust them above their heads and ran at the officers .
Police had released everyone and traffic was moving slowly by around 8:30 p.m. , about an hour after cyclists flooded the ramps .
Redden said there was no indication cyclists from the Toronto Criterium bike race happening nearby , were involved .
Yvonne Bambrick , of the Toronto Cyclists Union said she had no idea the event was occurring .
“ Breaking the law is never a good idea ...
It does n’t strike me as a very safe thing to do . ”
A Facebook group for the Toronto chapter of Critical Mass was abuzz today with posts about the controversial stunt .
Tory Law , 21 year - old cyclist and member of the group , confirmed the ride was organized by Critical Mass .
“ I fully support Critical Mass ’ cause , however the methods used to convey CM ’s message last night is questionable indeed , ” he wrote .
“ I think what CM did does portray a negative image ; however , what other possible way is there to get attention ? ”
The McCain campaign is attacking Obama because he gave a speech standing behind a seal that looks something like the presidential seal .
They also implied that Obama committed a crime — even quoting 18 USC Sec. 713 : “ Whoever , except as authorized under regulations promulgated by the President and published in the Federal Register , knowingly manufactures , reproduces , sells , or purchases for resale , either separately or appended to any article manufactured or sold , any likeness of the seals of the President or Vice President , or any substantial part thereof , except for manufacture or sale of the article for the official use of the Government of the United States , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months , or both . ” ( emphasis from the McCain campaign ) .
This attack is being picked up by the right - wing blogosphere .
Now , I personally think Obama ’s seal is pretty ugly and silly , although I did get a chuckle out of the new latin logo “ vero possumus ” , which means “ yes we can ” , but illegal ?
Well , it took Mark Nickolas at Political Base about 15 minutes on Google Images to find that the National Republican Senatorial Committee uses three different likenesses of the official seal in fundraising .
The one I show ( at left ) is used for people who contribute at least $ 5,000 annually .
As the Jed Report notes , you do n’t have to look very hard to find other people using the presidential seal .
For example , the popular TV show “ West Wing ” sells a boxed set of DVDs of the show with the official seal , embossed in metal , on the cover .
The seal has also been used by the satirical newspaper “ The Onion ” to make fun of Bush ’s weekly radio address .
Not to mention The Ramones .
Once FCC Chair Kevin Martin announced his support for sanctions against Comcast , penalties looked inevitable .
The two Democrats on the Commission , long supportive of network neutrality , seemed set to vote along with Martin and punish Comcast for its P2P " delaying " techniques ; late this afternoon at FCC headquarters , they did , and a majority has now spoken .
The Wall Street Journal reports tonight that commissioners Copps , Adelstein , and Martin have decided against the cable giant , paving the way for an official vote when the order is publicly voted on next Friday .
US ISPs , take note : the FCC has just used its 2005 Internet Policy Statement to draw a line in the sand .
Step across it at your peril .
The agony , the ecstasy
Free Press , which has been behind the complaint against Comcast , must have an office awash in champagne this evening .
Marvin Ammori , the group 's general counsel , said in a statement sent to Ars , " This vote reflects the bipartisan support for protecting consumers ' access to the free and open Internet .
Comcast 's blocking is a flagrant violation of the online rights established by the FCC .
If adopted , this order would send a strong signal to the marketplace that arbitrarily interfering with users ' online choices is not acceptable .
Internet service providers do not get to decide the winners and losers online . "
A Comcast spokesperson contacted Ars with a statement as well , this one clinging to the conviction that Comcast has n't done anything wrong , should n't be punished , and was n't blocking anyone , anyway .
" It is always hard to respond to rumors , " said the statement , " however , we continue to assert that our network management practices were reasonable , wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to Web sites or online applications , including peer - to - peer services .
We do not believe the record supports any other conclusion . "
But three FCC commissioners appear to disagree .
The initial report on the vote said nothing about which way Republican commissioners McDowell and Tate might lean .
FCC watchers would n't be at all surprised to see both vote against the order ; the really interesting moment could come if they support it .
Having four or even five commissioners support the order would send a strong bipartisan signal to ISPs that they need to take great care with any sort of discriminatory throttling based on anything more specific than a user 's total bandwidth .
A 3 - 2 vote might indicate that the issue is far more contested , and that a future FCC might be more sympathetic to arguments like those made by Comcast .
Internet Policy Statement : now with twice the potency !
In any event , the decision to penalize Comcast will provide a Mario - style power - up to the FCC's 2005 Internet Policy Statement .
The four principles in that statement , which are subject to " reasonable network management , " are :
Consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice
Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice , subject to the needs of law enforcement
Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network
Consumers are entitled to competition among network providers , application and service providers , and content providers
If those are important principles to you , why not drop a quick note to one or more of the commissioners ?
As public servants , they often spend more time listening to nonprofits , broadcasters , telcos , lobbyists , and cable companies than to the people ; those who do contact them are usually 1 ) upset or 2 ) seeking a favor .
In this case , a simple " thank you " might be more appropriate .
Comcast 's P2P degrading techniques were n't especially egregious in the grand scheme of things .
According to the company 's research into P2P flows on its networks , only 6 or 7 percent of subscribers used P2P in a given week , only uploads were affected , 90 percent of P2P flows were n't even touched , and even users who were hit with TCP reset packets could " complete a P2P upload in less than one minute in 80 percent of cases . "
But such traffic - specific profiling and flow throttling set the stage for ISPs to pick winners and losers on the ' Net , to do more than determine how wide someone 's pipe would be — to control what they could do , and when .
Thanks to the pressure from the proceeding , Comcast has already committed to protocol agnostic traffic management by the end of the year .
Will Canada follow suit ?
British pensioner creates world 's biggest family tree - after tracing 10,000 ancestors
A pensioner is claiming a world record for the biggest family tree after tracing nearly 10,000 relatives and ancestors .
Roy Blackmore says he had discovered that his ancestors include farmers , monks , a Wild West cowboy , Civil War soldiers , a king of France - and even William the Conqueror and Alfred the Great .
The 76 - year - old from Taunton , Somerset , has spent 28 years and around £ 20,000 piecing together his family history .
Roy Blackmore has traced 10,000 ancestors in his family tree
Most of his research was carried out before the arrival of the internet , meaning he had to travel the country to study archives , cemetery records and census registers .
His tree stretches back to the Cerdick family in AD 500 and includes William the Conqueror in the 11th century and Alfred the Great in AD 880 .
He has listed 9,390 ancestors and relatives and has applied to the Guinness Book of Records to claim the title for the world 's largest documented family tree .
Roy , of Taunton , Somerset , said : " It 's been a very interesting journey which has taken some surprising twists and turns .
One of the most shocking discoveries was that I 'm a descendant of Alfred the Great .
" My interest started after I was orphaned as a child and and became curious about my family background .
Since then , I have been searching high and low for information on my family .
" There have been some very frustrating times when I seemingly hit a brick wall .
But there is always a way around or over an obstacle and you just have to persevere .
Roy traced his family back through the ages - pictured here is his grandmother Elizabeth Blackmore .
" When I started I never planned to go back that far but the more I looked the more interested I became .
It 's been incredibly interesting .
" I could go back further into my French descendants but I think I 'll leave it as it is .
I think I 'll leave it there . "
Roy , a former buyer for a perfume company , was fostered along with three of his six brothers and sisters when their parents Hubert and Ida died in 1931 .
He began developing his family tree in 1980 and spent up to five hours a day scouring documents he collected from archives , libraries , cemetery records and census registers in London .
His tree stretches back to the Cerdick family in AD 500 and includes the French Royal family and Hugh Capet - a 10th century king of France .
Roy can also link himself through 37 generations to William the Conqueror in the 11th Century and 45 generations to Alfred the Great in AD 880 .
He said : " The records show that my family were yeoman from around the 10th century when monks first started recording births .
Alfred the Great who turned out to be one of Roy 's ancestors
" They have n't moved far and have lived around the south west during that time .
A lot of my family members have fought in wars and the Stawells were involved in the battles between Cromwell and Charles I . "
Roy , a dad of two , says his wife Sigrid , 77 , remained patient as he spent hours sifting through documents and travelling around the country .
He said : " My wife has been very supportive .
My grandchildren are n't too interested but I 'm sure they will want to know more about their family as they grow older .
" I was never really all that interested in history at school but as you get older you take an interest in where you come from . "
Genealogist Nick Barratt , who worked on BBC family history programme ' Who Do You Think You Are ? ' , says Roy 's family tree could be a record .
He said : " To research 10,000 family members is a unique and amazing achievement .
Many claim to have traced their family back to the Domesday Book but have actually used short cuts on the internet .
" But to actually follow the paper trail is an incredible feat and I cannot praise it enough .
Most people struggle when they get to the 18th Century .
" In terms of being a record I can't think there will be many who have an authentic family history of 10,000 people dating back that far . "
Grandfather - of - two Roy will be exhibiting a range of his certificates and wills as part of an exhibition at Taunton library , Somerset on July 14 .
Caltech physicist Sean M. Carroll has been wrestling with the mystery of time .
Most physical laws work equally well going backward or forward , yet time flows only in one direction .
Writing in this month ’s Scientific American , Carroll suggests that entropy , the tendency of physical systems to become more disordered over time , plays a crucial role .
Carroll sat down recently at Caltech to explain his theory .
What ’s the problem with time ?
The irreversibility of time is sort of the most obvious unanswered question in cosmology .
Time has been talked about in cosmology for many years , but we have a toolbox now we did n’t used to have .
Advertisement
We have general relativity , string theory , discoveries in particle physics that we can use to help us find the right answer .
What does entropy have to do with all this ?
The most obvious fact about the history of the universe is the growth of entropy from the early times to the late times .
The fact that you can turn eggs into omelets but not vice versa is a thing we know from our kitchens .
Advertisement
You do n’t need to spend millions of dollars on telescopes to discover it .
Can you give me a simple explanation of entropy ?
One way of explaining entropy is to say it ’s the number of ways you can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you do n’t notice the change macroscopically .
If you mix milk into a cup of coffee , the more mixing that occurs , the more disordered the milk molecules become and the more entropy builds .
Advertisement
If all the milk was somehow separated from the coffee , that would be low entropy .
So what ’s the problem ?
If you really believed the conventional story that the Big Bang was the beginning , that there was nothing before the Big Bang , I think that ’s a very difficult fact to explain .
. . .
There ’s no law of physics that says it should start at a low - entropy state .
But the actual universe did that .
Advertisement
From a layman ’s standpoint , it seems perfectly rational that things would start small and grow apart .
You ’re saying that ’s wrong .
Many of my very smart colleagues say exactly the same thing .
They say , “ Why are you thinking about this ?
It just makes sense that the early universe was small and low - entropy . ”
But I think that is just a prejudice : . . .
Because it is like that in our universe , we tend to think it is naturally like that .
I do n’t think there is an explanation for that in terms of our current understanding of physics .
I ’m just saying it ’s not a fact that we should take for granted .
Advertisement
So you think the way the universe began is unnatural ?
Low - entropy configurations are rare .
If you take a deck of cards and you open it up , it ’s true that they ’re in order .
But if you randomly chose a configuration of a deck of cards it would be very , very unlikely that they would be in perfect order .
That ’s exactly low entropy versus high entropy .
Advertisement
The universe is more than what we see ?
The reason why you are not surprised when you open a deck of cards and it ’s in perfect order is not because it ’s just easy and natural to find it in perfect order , it ’s because the deck of cards is not a closed system .
It came from a bigger system in which there is a card factory somewhere that arranged it .
So I think there is a previous universe somewhere that made us and we came out .
We ’re part of a bigger structure .
Are you saying that our universe came from some other universe ?
Advertisement
Right .
It came from a bigger space - time that we do n’t observe .
Our universe came from a tiny little bit of a larger high - entropy space .
I ’m not saying this is true ; I ’m saying this is an idea worth thinking about .
You ’re saying that in some universes there could be a person like you drinking coffee , but out of a blue cup rather than a red one .
If our local , observable universe is embedded in a larger structure , a multiverse , then there ’s other places in this larger structure that have denizens in them that call their local environs the universe .
And conditions in those other places could be very different .
Or they could be pretty similar to what we have here .
Advertisement
How many of them are there ?
The number could well be infinity .
So it is possible that somewhere else in this larger structure that we call the multiverse there are people like us , writing for newspapers like the L.A. Times and thinking about similar questions .
So how does the arrow of time fit into this ?
Our experience of time depends upon the growth of entropy .
You ca n’t imagine a person looking around and saying , “ Time is flowing in the wrong direction , ” because your sense of time is due to entropy increasing .
. . .
This feeling that we ’re moving through time has to do with the fact that as we live , we feed on entropy .
. . .
Time exists without entropy , but entropy is what gives time its special character .
Entropy gives time its appearance of forward motion ?
Advertisement
Yeah , its directionality .
The distinction between past and future .
If you ’re floating in outer space , in a spacesuit , there would be no difference between one direction and another .
However , nowhere in the universe would you confuse yesterday and tomorrow .
That ’s all because of entropy , and that ’s the arrow of time .
Does God exist in a multiverse ?
I do n’t want to give advice to people about their religious beliefs , but I do think that it ’s not smart to bet against the power of science to figure out the natural world .
It used to be , a thousand years ago , that if you wanted to explain why the moon moved through the sky , you needed to invoke God .
And then Galileo and Newton came along and realized that there was conservation of momentum , so things tend to keep moving .
Advertisement
Nowadays people say , “ Well , you certainly ca n’t explain the creation of the universe without invoking God , ” and I want to say , “ Do n’t bet against it . ”

The crunch bites deeper in the US
Analysis
By Stephanie Flanders
Economics editor , BBC News
A glut of unsold homes is depressing US house prices
The credit crunch has hit the US economy hard .
From Wall Street to Main Street , loans that looked rock - solid a year ago now look shaky .
And the US central bank , the Federal Reserve , is throwing away the rule book to contain the effects .
Kevin Logan of Dresdner Kleinwort , one of the less gloomy New York economists , summarises the state of play as the credit crunch has spread to different types of assets as follows : " We 're all sub - prime now " .
We 're all sub - prime now
Kevin Logan , Dresdner Kleinwort
The Fed did cut its main interest rate on Tuesday for the sixth time since September - by three quarters of one percentage point , to 2.25 % .
This means that interest rates are now very close to going negative in real terms - once inflation is taken into account .
But amid the drama of the past few weeks , it almost seems par for the course .
Whether it 's rate cuts or special funding arrangements for Wall Street , the more the Fed does , the more the markets seem to need .
Bernanke 's problems Ben Bernanke wants to reassure the financial markets America 's chief economic fire - fighter , Fed boss Ben Bernanke , faces two core problems .
There 's the slide in the real economy , which many now think fell into recession in February .
But there 's also the crunch in the financial system , which rate cuts alone cannot cure .
The fact that banks are wary of lending even to each other and are desperate to offload their debt is as much about confidence as it is about interest rates .
These two crises are distinct .
But they stem from the same fundamental cause - the fact that US house prices have fallen nationwide for the first time since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
Housing problems
The fear is that falling prices will undermine banks and squeeze credit Across the US economy , everyone from homeowners to hedge funds has borrowed literally trillions of dollars on the assumption that such a fall could never happen .
Now that house prices have dropped by 10 % , a lot of those borrowers , small and large , are turning out to have very little room for shocks .
Consider the homeowners first .
Back in 1976 , the average down - payment for a first - time buyer in the US was 18 % .
But between mid-2005 and mid-2006 , almost half of first - time buyers put down nothing at all , according to the National Association of Realtors .
If house prices had fallen 10 % in the 1970s , most of those first - time buyers would still have been OK .
Now , if they are in negative equity , they look like borrowers who have every reason to walk away from their mortgages .
Uncertain losses
How many other banks are sitting on worthless assets ?
The investors and financial institutions that are sitting on assets linked to those mortgages do n't know how many of those loans will end up in default .
They do know it 's a scary number and it 's going up .
Every time they revise their guesstimates , the price of those mortgage - linked assets goes down further .
And the losses multiply for hedge funds and others who bet a lot more than the average homeowner on house prices continuing to go up .
The Carlyle Capital Corporation , the investment fund connected to the Carlyle private equity group that defaulted on $ 17bn ( £ 8.5 bn ) of debt last week , had $ 31 in debt for every $ 1 invested .
Moral hazard
There are some who say that the Fed should let all these institutions suffer the consequences - to the point of bankruptcy if need be .
The trouble is , the Fed Chairman , Ben Bernanke , knows that financial markets are now all too interconnected .
In less turbulent times he might have been able to afford to let a Bear Stearns go under .
Now it risks a domino effect in the markets and possible blame for a Japan - style economic " lost decade " .
Everyone in the markets knows that the Fed is absolutely determined to avoid the mistakes of Japan in the 1990s , when the Bank of Japan failed to prevent a financial crisis sinking the real economy .
That 's a large part of the reason why the dollar is falling and the gold price is reaching record high .
Self - fullfilling prophecy
In essence , traders around the world have concluded that the Fed now thinks that inflation would be a nice kind of problem to have , because inflation would tell you that the US was not going the way of Japan .
Even if supply limits keep the oil price at a high level over the next year , inflation is not going to be the Fed 's core problem if the downward spiral in the markets gets out of hand .
The big fear is that in over - estimating the losses out there in the housing market , the financial institutions will make those estimates a self - fulfilling prophesy .
That is because the more mortgage assets get marked down , the greater the hit to banks ' balance sheets , and the less they can lend to firms and households at decent rates .
That reduction in lending would take house prices down further , leading to more losses and the whole vicious cycle starting again .
Ben Bernanke is looking for the magic solution that will stop that dangerous dynamic taking hold .
He has n't found it yet .

Obama Gets A Surprising Financial Boost From Former Bush Donors By By Can Tran Jun 2 , 2008 in Politics
Things may be looking better for Democratic co-frontrunner Senator Barack Obama of Illinois as former donors to US President George W. Bush have come to his aid .
Neither Democratic co-frontrunner Senator Hillary Clinton of New York nor presumed GOP nominee Senator John McCain has been able to reap such benefits .
Ultimately , it has been Obama who reaped such juicy benefits .
Recently , while there are donors that had attended the gala at the Ford ’s Theater by Bush in Washington , DC , they have different positions .
One such donor is Beverly Fanning .
While Fanning attended Bush ’s gala , she has thrown her time , money , and support to the Obama campaign .
This is good for Obama .
But , this is bad for Bush , the GOP , McCain , and Clinton .
So far , a recent analysis has revealed that many people that have donated to Bush during the 2004 US Presidential Elections have donated to Obama ’s campaign .
Asides from Beverly Fanning , Obama has received donations from Julie Nixon Eisenhower , Connie Ballmer , Don King , and Richard Mellon Scaife .
Julie Nixon Eisenhower is the daughter of late - President Richard Nixon .
She is also the wife of the David Eisenhower , the grandson of late - President Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Connie Ballmer is the wife of current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer .
Ritchie Scaife is the wife to Richard Mellon Scaife , a well known tycoon .
Don King is a given .
King is one of the most well - known promoters in the world of Boxing .
These donors are either moderate Republicans or Independents according to Anthony Corrado .
Corrado is a government professor that teachers at the Colby College in Maine .
This seems to be consistent with the poll results taken at the contests in the race towards the Democratic nomination .
Early on at the start of the Democratic primary , poll results have shown that Obama has done well amongst Independents and moderate Republicans .
While Clinton has won some major states , she only fared well amongst Democrats .
Corrado adds that a good portion of the GOP , mainly the fiscal conservatives are dissatisfied with the party ’s performance in Washington DC .
He says : “ Another donor who had donated $ 2,000 to the Bush campaign back in 2004 had given the Obama campaign $ 2,300 .
This is an independent donor who has been dissatisfied with the job that the Republican Party has been doing .
This shift towards Obama gives off the strong indication that Bush ’s influence is waning and that the GOP ’s image has gone down the toilet .
A few weeks ago , House Republicans decided to use the message of “ change . ”
They have launched the “ Change You Deserve ” message .
It looks good for Obama ; but , it does not seem to fare well for McCain .
McCain has tried to show that he is not the “ typical ” Republican .
But , it is Obama who is getting support by these former Bush donors .
One such donor who has been very dissatisfied with Bush said that she thinks that Obama is a president that the country really needs .
In an interesting recent turn of events , there are many indications that US President George W. Bush continues to lose support and influence .
At the same time , the GOP is losing its support , influence , and power .
Overall , it is Democratic co-frontrunner Senator Barack Obama who is benefiting for these indications .
Neither Democratic co-frontrunner Senator Hillary Clinton of New York nor presumed GOP nominee Senator John McCain has been able to reap such benefits .

A new paper published in the African Journal of AIDS Research by Michel Garenne , researcher at the Pasteur Institute , Paris , analyzed data from thirteen African countries and concluded that male circumcision offers little , if any , protection from HIV infection , and that voluntary circumcision programs are likely to provide little benefit , while greatly burdening the health care system .
Garenne states , “ Based on my analysis , it is clear that there are other confounding factors much more important that male circumcision in the transmission patterns of HIV .
There was no evidence of a protective effect of male circumcision on HIV rates in the general population .
While it is important to try every available strategy to reduce HIV infections , the use of male circumcision requires extensive health care costs and may not be the best use of HIV funding .
Alternative strategies would offer much more general population protection . ”
This paper raises concerns about the use of male circumcision follows on the heels of yet another paper published this month in Future HIV Therapy calling the promotion of male circumcision risky and dangerous .
Of the thirteen countries examined , male circumcision was not associated with any difference in HIV infection rates in eight of the countries , HIV infection was lower in circumcised populations in two of the countries , and HIV infection was higher in circumcised populations for the other three countries .

Space Ghost was a character created by Hanna - Barbera Productions and designed by Alex Toth .
He started out as a superhero who , with his assistants Jan , Jace and Blip , fought villains in outer space .
In more recent years , he has been retooled as a fictional talk show host on Cartoon Network and revamped in a DC Comics mini-series .
Alex Toth was an acclaimed professional cartoonist active from the 1940s through the 1980s .
Toth ’s work began in the American comic book industry , but is best known for his animation designs for Hanna - Barbera throughout the 1960s and 1970s .
His work included Super Friends , Space Ghost , The Herculoids , and Birdman .
Toth ’s work has been resurrected in the late - night , adult - themed spinoffs on Cartoon Network : Space Ghost : Coast to Coast and Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law .
Toth ’s contributions to the comic book medium are not widely known among casual fans .
He did much of his work outside the current mainstream of superhero comics , concentrating instead on such subjects as hot rod racing , romance , horror , and action - adventure .
His stint on Disney ’s Zorro is highly regarded and has been reprinted in trade paperback form several times .
Toth lamented what he saw as a lack of awareness on the part of younger artists of their predecessors , as well as a feeling that the innocent fun of comics ’ past was being lost in the pursuit of pointless nihilism and “ mature content . ”
Both Mike Baron and Steve Rude ( a full 6 - foot - 5 Wisconsinite nicknamed " The Dude " ) pay homage to Space Ghost in their work on Nexus , including use of the battle cry " This calls for hyperspeed ! "
Jan , Jayce , and Blip have several uncredited cameos in the background .
Rude was later hired to create a Space Ghost comic for Comico with writer Mark Evanier .
Steve Rude has cited a number of influences on his clean , distinctive style , including the Space Ghost character designs and other work by Alex Toth , and commercial illustrators of the 1940s and 1950s , particularly Andrew Loomis .
William Andrew Loomis ( 1892-1959 ) was an illustrator from the United States .
He was born in New York , but spent most of his working life in Chicago .
He is best remembered now for a series of art instruction books that continues to influence realist artists , though they are now all out of print .
Steve Rude named one of the characters he drew in the Nexus comic book " General Loomis " .
When the General was executed by Nexus , his daughters , the Loomis Sisters , vowed revenge .
Nexus has long been a favorite among fans of great comics since 1982 when Mike Baron and Steve Rude created the character for the short - lived , yet visionary , Capital Comics .
The Nexus series debuted as a three - issue black and white miniseries , followed by an eighty - issue ongoing full - color series .
The black and white issues and the first six color issues were published by Capital Comics ; after Capital 's demise , First Comics took over publication .
Dark Horse Comics , recognizing Nexus as the landmark series it is , wasted no time in snatching up the title and , because of Mike Richardson 's creator - friendly attitude , returned ownership to Baron and Rude so they could continue to guide Nexus through his murky and prophetic dreams .
Steve Rude announced plans on his message board January 2006 to self - publish a new Nexus comic series .
The first issue of the new series , numbered Nexus # 99 was published in July 2007 .
The lead character , Horatio Valdemar Hellpop , received his powers as Nexus from an alien entity called the Merk .
As payment , the Merk required Nexus to seek out and kill a certain quantity of human mass murderers per " cycle " .
When the Merk selected a target , Nexus would receive strong headaches and maddeningly anguished dreams of his target 's victims until he did his duty .
Horatio was reluctant to act as the Merk 's tool , but continued seeking out mass murderers to maintain his power and his sanity so that he could defend his home world , a lunar refuge of Ylum ( a shortening of the word " asylum , " thus pronounced " eye-lum " ) .
Nexus was introduced before the Punisher received his own series , so the idea of a bloodthirsty vigilante was at the time unique , novel , and too risky for the Big Two ( Marvel and DC ) to handle .
Going even further , some of the mass murders Nexus is forced to kill had repented and gone on with their lives .
As a matter of fact , the first murderer Nexus was sent after was his own father , who was responsible for millions of deaths before Horatio was born .
In the early 1980s , if you liked superheroes but wanted to see a different take on them , there was one place to go : independent comics .
Sure , Frank Miller on Daredevil and Alan Moore on Swamp
Thing were expanding the boundaries of what a mainstream book could be , but the most inventive development of the superhero was done with the smaller companies .
It was in the independents where you would find characters such as Cerebus , Flaming Carrot , Mage , Grendel , Normalman , American Flagg and Badger .
Each of these titles contained elements that you could find in DC and Marvel books , only with a unique and daring twist on them .
One of the best examples of this phenomenon was Nexus .

The Lenski affair was an attempt by politically conservative activist lawyer Andrew Schlafly ( creator of Conservapedia and endorser to the notion of creationism ) to challenge the groundbreaking research of Michigan State University professor and National Academy of Science member Richard Lenski .
Lenski and his student Zachary Blount had reported observation of evolution in bacteria .
Schlafly wrote to Lenski .
He demanded raw data but Lenski refused .
Lenski cited Schlafly 's lack of credentials as a qualified bacteriologist .
Schlafly 's challenge resulted in publicity on the Internet .
Richard Dawkins discusses Lenski's research and the affair in his book The Greatest Show on Earth , referring to Schlafly 's implied doubts about Lenski 's results as an " impertinent suggestion " . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
On June 9 , 2008 , the New Scientist published an article describing preliminary results of a long - running experiment started by Lenski . [ 3 ]
Lenski and his team had taken a single strain of the bacterium E. coli , separated its descendants into twelve populations , [ 4 ] and proceeded to observe their mutations over the course of two decades .
[ 5 ]
The E. coli were fed a measured amount of glucose every day .
At one point , one of the populations exploded far beyond the parameters of the experiment .
Lenski eventually discovered that this population had evolved the ability to " eat " citrate , an organic molecule which was part of the solution the E. coli lived in , but which E. coli cannot normally uptake .
Thus , evolution had been visibly observed , with an exquisite amount of evidence establishing the timeline along the way .
Not only that , but the experiment was repeatable ; Lenski started new experiments with the frozen " archives " of the population which exploded , and found that beyond a certain point , that particular population of E. coli were highly likely to evolve the ability to digest citrate .
The paper also highlighted the role of historical contingency in evolution and the role of potentiating mutations .
Naturally , this news item was posted to Conservapedia , bringing it to the attention of Schlafly .
As he is a creationist , this obviously flew in the face of his views and could not be tolerated .
After a discussion in which he expressed skepticism , he proceeded to send Dr. Lenski an email requesting further data , and set up a page on his blog / " encyclopedia " titled " Lenski dialog . "
The ensuing exchange of emails is below .
Submission guidelines for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science state that " ( viii ) Materials and Data Availability .
To allow others to replicate and build on work published in PNAS , authors must make materials , data , and associated protocols available to readers .
Authors must disclose upon submission of the manuscript any restrictions on the availability of materials or information . "
Also , your work was apparently funded by taxpayers , providing further reason for making the data publicly available .
Skepticism has been expressed on Conservapedia about your claims , and the significance of your claims , that E. Coli bacteria had an evolutionary beneficial mutation in your study .
Specifically , we wonder about the data supporting your claim that one of your colonies of E. Coli developed the ability to absorb citrate , something not found in wild E. Coli , at around 31,500 generations .
In addition , there is skepticism that 3 new and useful proteins appeared in the colony around generation 20,000 .
A recent article about your claims appears in New Scientist here : http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html
3 . " In addition , there is skepticism that 3 new and useful proteins appeared in the colony around generation 20,000 . "
We make no such claim anywhere in our paper , nor do I think it is correct .
Proteins do not " appear out of the blue " , in any case .
We do show that what we call a " potentiated " genotype had evolved by generation 20,000 that had a greater propensity to produce Cit+ mutants .
We also show that the dynamics of appearance of Cit+ mutants in the potentiated genotypes are highly suggestive of the requirement for two additional mutations to yield the resulting Cit+ trait .
Moreover , we found that Cit+ mutants , when they first appeared , were often rather weak at using citrate .
At least the main Cit+ line that we studied underwent an additional mutation ( or mutations ) that refined that ability and led to a large improvement in growth on citrate .
All these issues and the supporting methods and data are covered in our paper .
2 . " Specifically , we wonder about the data supporting your claim that one of your colonies of E. Coli developed the ability to absorb citrate , something not found in wild E. Coli , at around 31,500 generations . "
You will find all the relevant methods and data supporting this claim in our paper .
We also establish in our paper , through various phenotypic and genetic markers , that the Cit+ mutant was indeed a descendant of the original strain used in our experiments .
1 ) " ... your claims , that E. Coli bacteria had an evolutionary beneficial mutation in your study . "
We ( my group and scientific collaborators ) have already published several papers that document beneficial mutations in our long - term experiment .
These papers provide exact details on the identity of the mutations , as well as genetic constructions where we have produced genotypes that differ by single mutations , then compete them , demonstrating that the mutations confer an advantage under the environmental conditions of the experiment .
See papers # 122 , 140 , 155 , 166 , and 178 referenced on my website .
In the latest paper , you will see that we make no claim to having identified the genetic basis of the mutations observed in this study .
However , we have found a number of mutant clones that have heritable differences in behavior ( growth on citrate ) , and which confer a clear advantage in the environment where they evolved , which contains citrate .
Our future work will seek to identify the responsible mutations .
Given that this is my second request for the data , a clear answer is requested as to whether you will make the key underlying data available for independent review .
Your response , or lack thereof , will be posted due to the public interest in this issue .
Thank you .
If the data are voluminous , then I particularly request access to the data that was made available to the peer reviewers of your paper , and to the data relating to the period during which the bacterial colony supposedly developed Cit+ .
As before , I 'm requesting the organized data themselves , not the graphs and summaries set forth in the paper and referenced in your first reply to me .
Note that several times your paper expressly states , " data not shown . "
Your work was taxpayer - funded , and PNAS represents that its authors will make underlying data available .
I 'd like to review the data myself and ensure availability for others , including experts and my students .
Others have expressed interest in access to the data in addition to myself , and your website seems well - suited for public release of these data .
Dear Mr. Schlafly :
I tried to be polite , civil and respectful in my reply to your first email , despite its rude tone and uninformed content .
Given the continued rudeness of your second email , and the willfully ignorant and slanderous content on your website , my second response will be less polite .
I expect you to post my response in its entirety ; if not , I will make sure that is made publicly available through other channels .
I offer this lengthy reply because I am an educator as well as a scientist .
It is my sincere hope that some readers might learn something from this exchange , even if you do not .
First , it seems that reading might not be your strongest suit given your initial letter , which showed that you had not read our paper , and given subsequent conversations with your followers , in which you wrote that you still had not bothered to read our paper .
You wrote : “ I did skim Lenski ’s paper … ”
If you have not even read the original paper , how do you have any basis of understanding from which to question , much less criticize , the data that are presented therein ?
Second , your capacity to misinterpret and / or misrepresent facts is plain in the third request in your first letter , where you said : “ In addition , there is skepticism that 3 new and useful proteins appeared in the colony around generation 20,000 . ”
That statement was followed by a link to a news article from NewScientist that briefly reported on our work .
I assumed you had simply misunderstood that article , because there is not even a mention of proteins anywhere in the news article .
As I replied , “ We make no such claim anywhere in our paper , nor do I think it is correct .
Proteins do not ‘ appear out of the blue ’ , in any case . ”
So where did your confused assertion come from ?
It appears to have come from one of your earlier discussions , in which an acoltye [ sic ] ( Able806 , who to his credit at least seems to have attempted to read our paper ) wrote :
" I think it might be best to clarify some of Richard 's work .
He started his E.Coli project in 1988 and has been running the project for 20 years now ; his protocols are available to the general public .
The New Scientist article is not very technical but the paper at PNAS is .
The change was based on one of his colonies developing the ability to absorb citrate , something not found in wild E.Coli .
This occurred around 31,500 generations and is based on the development of 3 proteins in the E.Coli genome .
What his future work will be is to look at what caused the development of these 3 proteins around generation 20,000 of that particular colony . "
As further evidence of your inability to keep even a few simple facts straight , you later wrote the following : “ It [ my reply ] did clarify that his claims are not as strong as some evolutionists have insisted . ”
But no competent biologist would , after reading our paper with any care , insist ( or even suggest ) that “ 3 new and useful proteins appeared in the colony around generation 20,000 ” or any similar nonsense .
It is only in your letter , and in your acolyte ’s confused interpretation of our paper , that I have ever seen such a claim .
Am I or the reporter for NewScientist somehow responsible for the confusion that reflects your own laziness and apparent inability to distinguish between a scientific paper , a news article , and a confused summary posted by an acolyte on your own website ?
Third , it is apparent to me , and many others who have followed this exchange and your on - line discussions of how to proceed , that you are not acting in good faith in requests for data .
From the posted discussion on your web site , it is obvious that you lack any expertise in the relevant fields .
Several of your acolytes have pointed this out to you , and that your motives are unclear or questionable at best , but you and your cronies dismissed their concerns as rants and even expelled some of them from posting on your website .
[ http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Expelled:_No_Intelligence_Allowed]
Several also pointed out that I had very quickly and straightforwardly responded that the methods and data supporting the evolution of the citrate - utilization capacity are already provided in our paper .
One poster in your discussions , Aaronp , wrote :
“ I read Lenski 's paper , and as a trained microbiologist , I thought that it was both thorough and well done .
His claims are backed by good data , namely that which was presented in the figures .
I went through each of the figures after Aschlafly said that they were uninformative .
Actually , they are basic figures that show the population explosion of the bacterial cultures after the Cit+ mutation occurred .
These figures show that the cultures increased in size and mass at a given timepoint , being able to do so because they had evolved a mechanism to utilize a new nutrient , without the assistance of helper plasmids .
…
Lenksi’s paper , while not the most definite I ’ve seen , is still a very well - researched paper that supports its claims nicely . ”
( As far as I saw , Aaronp is the only poster who asserted any expertise in microbiology . )
As further evidence of the absence of good - faith discussion about our research , in the discussion thread that began even before you sent your first email to me , I counted the words “ fraud ” or “ fraudulent ” being used more than 10 times , including one acolyte , TonyT , who says bluntly that I am “ clearly a fraudulent hack . ”
In the discussion thread that also includes comments after my first reply , the number of times those same words are used has increased to 20 , with the word “ hoax ” also now entering the discussion .
A few posters wisely counseled against such slander but that did not deter you .
I must say , it is surprising that someone with a law degree would make , and allow on his website , so many nasty comments that implicitly and even explicitly impugn my integrity , and by extension that of my collaborators , without any grounds whatsoever and reflecting only your dogmatic adherence to certain beliefs .
Finally , let me now turn to our data .
As I said before , the relevant methods and data about the evolution of the citrate - using bacteria are in our paper .
In three places in our paper , we did say “ data not shown ” , which is common in scientific papers owing to limitations in page length , especially for secondary or minor points .
None of the places where we made such references concern the existence of the citrate - using bacteria ; they concern only certain secondary properties of those bacteria .
We will gladly post those additional data on my website .
It is my impression that you seem to think we have only paper and electronic records of having seen some unusual E. coli .
If we made serious errors or misrepresentations , you would surely like to find them in those records .
If we did not , then – as some of your acolytes have suggested – you might assert that our records are themselves untrustworthy because , well , because you said so , I guess .
But perhaps because you did not bother even to read our paper , or perhaps because you are n’t very bright , you seem not to understand that we have the actual , living bacteria that exhibit the properties reported in our paper , including both the ancestral strain used to start this long - term experiment and its evolved citrate - using descendants .
In other words , it ’s not that we claim to have glimpsed “ a unicorn in the garden ” – we have a whole population of them living in my lab ! [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unicorn_in_the_Garden]
And lest you accuse me further of fraud , I do not literally mean that we have unicorns in the lab .
Rather , I am making a literary allusion .
[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion]
One of your acolytes , Dr. Richard Paley , actually grasped this point .
He does not appear to understand the practice and limitations of science , but at least he realizes that we have the bacteria , and that they provide “ the real data that we [ that ’s you and your gang ] need ” .
Here ’s what this Dr. Paley had to say :
“ I think there ’s a great deal of misunderstanding here from the critics of Mr. Schlafly and obfuscation on the part of Prof.
Lenski and his supporters .
The real data that we need are not in the paper .
Rather they are in the bacteria used in the experiments themselves .
Prof. Lenski claims that these bacteria ‘ evolved ’ novel traits and that these were preceded by the evolution of ‘ potentiated genotypes ’ , from which the traits could be ‘ reevolved ’ using preserved colonies from those generations .
But how are we to know if these traits were n’t ‘ potentiated ’ by the Creator when He designed the bacteria thousands of years ago , such that they would eventually reveal themselves when the time was right ?
The only way this can be settled is if we have access to the genetic sequences of the bacteria colonies so that we can apply CSI techniques and determine if these ‘ potentiated genotypes ’ originated through blind chance or intelligence .
But with the physical specimens in the hands of Darwinists , who claim they will get around to the sequencing at some unspecifed future time , how can we trust that this data will be forthcoming and forthright ?
Thus , Prof. Lenski et al. should supply Conservapedia , as stewards , with samples of the preserved E. coli colonies so that the data can be accessible to unbiased researchers outside of the hegemony of the Darwinian academia , even if it wo n’t be put to immediate examination by Mr. Schlafly .
This is simply about keeping tax - payer - funded scientists honest . ”
So , will we share the bacteria ?
Of course we will , with competent scientists .
Now , if I was really mean , I might only share the ancestral strain , and let the scientists undertake the 20 years of our experiment .
Or if I was only a little bit mean , maybe I ’d also send the potentiated bacteria , and let the recipients then repeat the several years of incredibly pain - staking work that my superb doctoral student , Zachary Blount , performed to test some 40 trillion ( 40,000,000,000,000 ) cells , which generated 19 additional citrate - using mutants .
But I ’m a nice guy , at least when treated with some common courtesy , so if a competent scientist asks for them , I would even send a sample of the evolved E. coli that now grows vigorously on citrate .
A competent microbiologist , perhaps requiring the assistance of a competent molecular geneticist , would readily confirm the following properties reported in our paper : ( i ) The ancestral strain does not grow in DM0 ( zero glucose , but containing citrate ) , the recipe for which can be found on my web site , except leaving the glucose out of the standard recipe as stated in our paper .
( ii )
The evolved citrate - using strain , by contrast , grows well in that exact same medium .
( iii )
To confirm that the evolved strain is not some contaminating species but is , in fact , derived from the ancestral strain in our study , one could check a number of traits and genes that identify the ancestor as E. coli , and the evolved strains as a descendant thereof , as reported in our paper .
( iv )
One could also sequence the pykF and nadR genes in the ancestor and evolved citrate - using strains .
One would find that the evolved bacteria have mutations in each of these genes .
These mutations precisely match those that we reported in our previous work , and they identify the evolved citrate - using mutants as having evolved in the population designated Ara - 3 of the long - term evolution experiment , as opposed to any of the other 11 populations in that experiment .
And one could go on and on from there to confirm the findings in our paper , and perhaps obtain additional data of the sort that we are currently pursuing .
Before I could send anyone any bacterial strains , in order to comply with good scientific practices I would require evidence of the requesting scientist ’s credentials including : ( i ) affiliation with an appropriate unit in some university or research center with appropriate facilities for storing ( - 80 ºC freezer ) , handling ( incubators , etc. ) , and disposing of bacteria ( autoclave ) ; and ( ii ) some evidence , such as peer - reviewed publications , that indicate that the receiving scientist knows how to work with bacteria , so that I and my university can be sure we are sending biological materials to someone that knows how to handle them .
By the way , our strains are not derived from one of the pathogenic varieties of E. coli that are a frequent cause of food - borne illnesses .
However , even non-pathogenic strains may cause problems for those who are immune - compromised or otherwise more vulnerable to infection .
Also , my university requires that a Material Transfer Agreement be executed before we can ship any strains .
That agreement would not constrain a receiving scientist from publishing his or her results .
However , if an incompetent or fraudulent hack ( note that I make no reference to any person , as this is strictly a hypothetical scenario , one that I doubt would occur ) were to make false or misleading claims about our strains , then I ’m confident that some highly qualified scientists would join the fray , examine the strains , and sort out who was right and who was wrong .
That ’s the way science works .
I would also generally ask what the requesting scientist intends to do with our strains .
Why ?
It helps me to gauge the requester ’s expertise .
I might be able to point out useful references , for example .
Moreover , as I ’ve said , we are continuing our work with these strains , on multiple fronts , as explained in considerable detail in the Discussion section of our paper .
I would not be happy to see our work “ scooped ” by another team – especially for the sake of the outstanding students and postdocs in my group who are hard at work on these fronts .
However , that request to allow us to proceed , without risk of being scooped on work in which we have made a substantial investment of time and effort , would be just that : a request .
In other words , we would respect PNAS policy to share those strains with any competent scientist who complied with my university ’s requirements for the MTA and any other relevant legal restrictions .
If any such request requires substantial time or resources ( we have thousands of samples from this and many other experiments ) , then of course I would expect the recipient to bear those costs .
So there you have it .
I know that I ’ve been a bit less polite in this response than in my previous one , but I ’m still behaving far more politely than you deserve given your rude , willfully ignorant , and slanderous behavior .
And I ’ve spent far more time responding than you deserve .
However , as I said at the outset , I take education seriously , and I know some of your acolytes still have the ability and desire to think , as do many others who will read this exchange .
Sincerely ,
Richard Lenski
P.S. Did you know that your own bowels harbor something like a billion ( 1,000,000,000 ) E. coli at this very moment ?
So remember to wash your hands after going to the toilet , as I hope your mother taught you .
Simple calculations imply that there are something like 10^20 = 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 E. coli alive on our planet at any moment .
Even if they divide just once per day , and given a typical mutation rate of 10 ^ - 9 or 10 ^ - 10 per base - pair per generation , then pretty much every possible double mutation would occur every day or so .
That ’s a lot of opportunity for evolution .
P.P.S. I hope that some readers might get a chuckle out of this story .
The same Sunday ( 15 June 2008 ) that you and some of your acolytes were posting and promoting scurrilous attacks on me and our research ( was n’t that a bit disrespectful of the Sabbath ? ) , I was in a church attending a wedding .
And do you know what Old Testament lesson was read ?
It was Genesis 1:27 - 28 , [6 ] in which God created Man and Woman .
It ’s a very simple and lovely story , and I did not ask any questions , storm out , or demand the evidence that it happened as written at a time when science did not yet exist .
I was there in the realm of spirituality and mutual respect , not confusing a house of religion for a science class or laboratory .
And it was a beautiful wedding , too .
P.P.P.S.
You may be unable to understand , or unwilling to accept , that evolution occurs .
And yet , life evolves ! [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pur_si_muove]
From the content on your website , it is clear that you , like many others , view God as the Creator of the Universe .
I respect that view .
I find it baffling , however , that someone can worship God as the all - mighty Creator while , at the same time , denying even the possibility ( not to mention the overwhelming evidence ) that God ’s Creation involved evolution .
It is as though a person thinks that God must have the same limitations when it comes to creation as a person who is unable to understand , or even attempt to understand , the world in which we live .
Is n’t that view insulting to God ?
P.P.P.P.S. I noticed that you say that one of your favorite articles on your website is the one on “ Deceit . ”
That article begins as follows : “ Deceit is the deliberate distortion or denial of the truth with an intent to trick or fool another .
Christianity and Judaism teach that deceit is wrong .
For example , the Old Testament says , ‘ Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor . ’”
You really should think more carefully about what that commandment means before you go around bearing false witness against others .
Home audio speakers are designed to sound great , but many designers take it to the next level and create something so sexy that people can’t help but stare .
They know what they do , because in these days a product that looks good has better chances to be sold .
These creative speaker designs that you ’re gonna see in this post combine both style and ( hopefully ) function , and we can say that they look better than they sound .
These speakers are simply called Speak - er , and for now they are just a very interesting “ speak bubble shaped speakers ” concept from Sherwood Forlee .
This designer has on his page a sentence that I totally adore : “ Sherwood Forlee is a designer with no design or art education . ”
I love this sentence because this is another proof that of a very creative product , without spending years studying .
In these days with all the information ’s available on the internet you can learn anything and master it if you really want .
Take a look at this picture and tell me that these little speakers are not cute .
I totally love their design … they might not have a huge power , but they are a cute element for your decor .
Now for all of you who like do - it - yourself projects I want to announce that these speakers are a do - it - yourself project , and if you want to learn how you can create your own speakers exactly like this one you can see the step by step tutorial on Instructables .
For some people these speakers might look creepy , especially if you are a dog owner , or you love animals .
The setup includes two 20 - inch tall headless pooches , each sporting co-axial speakers .
The custom engineered electronic filters make for great sound , and the aesthetics – well , you ’ve definitely got two new best friends .
You can purchase these speakers from here for $ 1,449.00
Created by Symbio Design , the ‘ Alpha ’ speakers are interesting creative object for lovers of music and design unusual things .
You can use them as standard stereo speakers , or pair them with other Symbio products and use it as a 5.1 home theater setup .
Jason Sui has designed a unique looking speaker box that could definitely add some flair to any home theatre system .
This speaker box , named N3 - 8 Kidrobot , looks like a penguin wearing an oversized jacket , can handle up to 150 watts , houses three speakers and costs $ 190 .
The Bowers and Wilkins flagship speaker is very highly regarded with music lovers all over the world , and with good reason .
The Nautilus ( sometimes referred to as the Nautilus “ Prestige ” ) is the culmination of a five year research and development project by former B&W engineer Laurence Dickie .

Since then they have been creating bass systems and their newest project , the Mini Speaker System .
The price on the FHOO1 horn speakers pictured above is just under $ 20,000 .
Their Mini Speaker System ( FHOO7 ) on the other hand is just under $ 1,200 .
The FHOO8 is designed to be a subwoofer for their Mini Speaker System and should be released shortly .
Designer Joakim Axelsson thought that box shaped speakers need some innovation , and this is how Dragon speakers have been born .
The Dragon speakers are made for those who are looking for something more then just a good sound .
I see this speakers in a Chinese restaurant , or in a room with Chinese influences .
The speakers are hand made in Denmark and Sweden out of plastic resin and the elements are high end Peerless / Vifa .
The Minipod loudspeaker follows an organic design , where ‘ form follows function ’ .
Each characteristic of the design has a precise acoustical justification .
The Minipod is essentially an amalgamation of three spheres to form one pressure - vessel , minimizing cabinet vibration , sound radiation and distortion , allowing sound waves to move more freely .
The Sound e-Motion M100 - 20 BFs spherical speakers are mounted on a stand rather than on a flat surface , which minimizes interference in both horizontal and vertical planes .
Thus , the sound radiates evenly in every direction .
The sphere holding the speaker is hand made from high class natural wood , a material unique for its acoustic characteristics .
Each sphere is made of hundreds of wood pieces and has excellent anti-resonance properties … more .
These speakers , named DMT - 100 , balance on a stand that incorporates a technology called driver manipulation .
That means the arms can be moved and the speakers can be pointed and adjusted for height to achieve the best sound .
Proclaim Audio says the spherical enclosures are the best shape to originate sound because of their characteristically smooth frequency response .
The idea is that the speaker shape creates the sound , not the room acoustics .
Made with German engineering , the award winning , contemporary Moonlight Sound globes stylishly conceal integrated speakers providing up to 200 watts of crisp , clean audio combined with rich LED lights that change color with the rhythm of your music .
Finally , there ’s a solution to the problem of separate light and sound fixtures by combining them both – perfectly .
Moonlight Sound is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use whether entertaining at home , for weddings and special events , glamorous nightclubs , luxury residences , four - star resorts , shopping malls , virtually anywhere …. more .
Hive is a simulated surround sound speaker system .
The Hive takes the latter approach but adds in a bit of design since sound bars are pretty boring .
The hexagonal honey comb pattern is graphic , bold , and each cell can pivot or turn for a truly customized audible experience .
And do n’t worry about messy cables or cords .
The Hive only has 2 at most – one for power , and one to connect to your home entertainment system .

The recent discovery of several Israeli spy networks in Lebanon could have some surprising implications either for the Hariri case or at least for the case of the 14 bombings , killings and assassination attemps which are also being investigated by Serge Brammertz .
In a bizarre twist , Hussein Khattab , a Palestinian member of the spy ring , who is still at large , is the brother of Sheikh Jamal Khattab , an Islamic cleric who has allegedly recruited Arab fighters for al - Qaeda in Iraq .
( Lebanon exposes deadly Israeli spy ring , The Times , June 15 , 2006 )
81 . ... The Lebanese investigation further revealed that Mr. Abu Adass had been employed at a computer shop in the summer of 2004 , which was owned in part by Sheikh Ahmed Al - Sani , who was a member of the Ahmed Miqati and Ismaíl Al - Khatib network .
According to Jibril 's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command , Khattab was a member of the Palestinian Popular Committees and was the public relations ' official in South Lebanon .
( Israel keeps silent over the capture of a Mossad network in Lebanon , Al - Manar , June 14 , 2006 )
L’un des individus toujours en liberté est un réfugié palestinien , Hussein Kh. ( Khattab ) , âgé de quarante ans et né dans le camp de Aïn el - Héloué .
Il avait été arrêté et libéré à deux reprises par les autorités libanaises et syriennes , notamment dans l’affaire de Jihad Jibril mais l’intervention d’un cheikh de Aïn el - Héloué auprès d’un homme de religion libanais a pu le libérer des prisons syriennes .
( La porte piégée du véhicule ayant servi à l’attentat de Saïda a été préparée en Israël , L'Orient - Le Jour , 14 Juin 2006 )
Security sources quoted by As - Safir newspaper Thursday said Rafeh confessed to transporting explosives across Lebanon in briefcases since early 2005 , but were unable to determine the end result of the explosives as Rafeh was allegedly tied to more than one Israeli network .
( Murr gives army full credit for cracking terror network , The Daily Star , June 16 , 2006 )
Investigations with Lebanese Mossad agent , Mahmoud Rafea continued , and revealed that Rafea had since the Spring of 2005 , delivered bombs in black suitcases , to several locations in Beirut , its eastern suburbs , Mount Lebanon and the South .
Meanwhile , security forces are still after Palestinian Mossad agent , Hussein Khattab , who is now suspected of leading a Mossad network of his own .
...
Rafea admitted he had delivered , since the Spring of 2005 , bombs in black suitcases to different locations , in eastern Beirut , Mount Lebanon , South Lebanon .
Security Forces however did not yet determine how these bombs were used .
...
Apparently the operations of Rafea and his network intersected with the operations of other Israeli Mossad networks .
Security Forces are focusing on this new information , while seeking to capture Rafea 's partners , on top of which is Palestinian Mossad agent , Hussein Khattab .
According to reports , Khattab might be leading a Mossad network of his own , that carried out a series of assassinations and bombings , other than those committed by Rafea 's network .
According to Assafir daily , the Israelis might have unclosed Rafea and Khattab 's networks to each other , to carry out the assassination of Jihad Ahmad Jibril , of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command in 2002 .
Previous Israeli assassination attempts failed to harm Jibril , and therefore efforts of more than one network had to be combined to kill the man .
( Lebanese authorities still searching for the rest of Mossad network , Al - Manar , June 15 , 2006 )
Beside the Majzoub brothers assassination , Rafea and his Mossad network assassinated Hezbollah officials , Ali Saleh and Ghaleb Awali , Jihad Ahmad Jibril of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command and Abu Hasan Salameh , as well as other security operations which will be revealed for the first time .
( Lebanese Army to release a detailed statement on capturing an Israeli Mossad network , Al - Manar , June 13 , 2006 )
In their sixth statement , Jund al - Sham ( Soldiers of Levant ) claims responsibility for the three bombings in Lebanon , “ challenging the crusaders once more . ” ...
The three explosions Jund al - Sham references seem to be those that occurred in the Christian sections of Lebanon during the past week .
Three people have been killed , and three more injured .
( Jund al - Sham ( Soldiers of Levant ) Claims Resonsibility For the Three Bombings in Lebanon , SITE Institute , March 29 , 2005 )
Akkar , Lebanon -
A group calling itself Jund El Sham , threatened to slaughter German Prosecutor Detlev Mehlis , who is heading a U.N. team investigating Rafik Hariri 's assassination .
The group also threatened to slaughter members of the reigning Lebanese authorities .
( Jund El Sham Threatens to kill Mehlis , 6 October , 2005 )
40 .
On the other hand , one single team alone might have conceived of the idea to kill former Prime Minister Hariri , conducted the reconnaissance and surveillance , prepared the claim - of - responsibility video , acquired the explosives , acquired and prepared the Mitsubishi truck , used an individual as the trigger mechanism , and executed the operation .
Based on this hypothesis , the number of participants may have been relatively small .
The Commission does not exclude the possibility that he was involved in other aspects of the operation beyond his participation in the making of the claim - of - responsibility video message .
57 .
The Commission is further examining the possibility of one single group , with a singular intent and capacity , having committed the crime .
For example , the Commission continues to develop its knowledge concerning individuals who are , or who have been , in the custody of the Lebanese authorities , allegedly as members of terrorist groups .
This area of its investigations remains ongoing , and focuses on the links , intent , capacity and motivations of these individuals .
The list of persons connecting Hussein Khattab to Ahmed Abu Adas is remarkably short : Hussein is the brother of Sheikh Jamal Khattab who works closely with Sheikh Abu Obeida who allegedly met with Abu Adas in Ain al - Hilweh .
Of course , this is notof any link , but it 's certainly something worth looking into .
There are two quotes in the first Mehlis report which link Abu Adas to Sheikh Abu Obeida .
Mehlis dismissed the first ( §80 and § 197 ) as being little reliable ( the Al - Ahbash Security Service had reported that Adas " often went to Ein al Helwa " and that he visited Abu Obeida who is described both as " deputy to the leader of Jund al Sham " and as " deputy leader of the terrorist group Asbat al Ansar " ) , but the German prosecutor never addressed ( or explained ) the second : Ahmed Salim Mikati was a member of the Dinniyeh group headed by Bassam Ahmad al - Kanj who was killed in an uprising in the mountains of Dinniyeh in January 2000 .
The surviving fighters found shelter in Ain al - Hilweh .
The group is said to have merged into Jund al - Sham .
According to Bernard Rougier 's excellent study on Salafi extremism in Palestinian refugee camps , al - Kanj was a religious teacher of Abu Obeida ( also called Jihad Mustapha ) ( Bernard Rougier , , Paris 2004 , p.213 ) .
While Sheikh Jamal Khattab is imam of the al - Nour Mosque in Ain al - Hilweh and an Islamist leader in the camp , Hussein Khattab belonged to the PFLP - GC :
His brother seems to have intervened when Hussein was detained on suspicion of being involved in the killing of Jihad Ahmad Jibril in 2002 : According to Defense Minister Elias Murr , " the investigation has yet to find any link between suspect Mahmoud Rafeh , the alleged leader of the network , and a string of assassinations in and around Beirut since October 2005 " .
However , Khattab is " believed to have commanded a separate Israeli network in Lebanon " , and Rafeh has confessed to transporting bombs across Lebanon since the Spring of 2005 .
It is unclear so far what has happened to ( or what was done with ) these bombs :
Al - Manar provides a more detailed account :
So far Al - Manar is also the only source mentioning Ghaleb Awali as one of the persons killed by the network :
This is interesting because at the time a statement in the name of Jund al - Sham had been issued claiming responsibility for the killing .
The then leader of Jund al - Sham , Abu Youssef Sharkiah , denied the claim .
( , The Daily Star , July 20 , 2004
He has since relinquished his authority over the group as " disputes " emerged " between its members over plans for bombings and assassinations " .
( , The Daily Star , January 05 , 2005 Other statements by Jund al - Sham " criticized Shiites and Hizbullah Secretary - General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as " unbelievers . " " ( , The Daily Star , June 30 , 2004 In July 2005 , Jund al - Sham faxed a threat to assassinate several prominent Hizballah allies and leaders , including former spiritual leader Sayyed Hussein Fadlallah , to the Shiite Fatwa Center in Tyre . ( , Emily Hunt , February 6 , 2006
This raises the question if Jund al - Sham may have been manipulated by Israeli intelligence and their Lebanese agents ( or , alternatively , if the group may have been used as a cover for their operations ) .
In October 04 , 2005 , As'ad AbuKhalil was left bewildered ( and supposedly ... ) by " an alleged threatening flyer by Jund Ash - Sham " : " I read that flyer , and it does not sound like Jund Ash - Sham at all .
...
The flyer does not contain any of the religious language that one usually finds here .
This flyer was written by a secular Arabic speaker .
" Regarding the 14 bombings which are being investigated by Brammertz , in particular the eight explosions in public places , Jund al - Sham has claimed three of them :
Finally , Jund al - Sham also famously issued a threat to assassinate Detlev Mehlis while he was working on his final report :
In my opinion , Brammertz does not exclude the possibility that an Islamist group was responsible for the bomb that killed Rafik Hariri .
This is n't the main focus of his investigation , but he does not discard the possibility , e.g.:§47 calls for " intricate knowledge of the motives , means and methods of " suicide bombing " in the region " .
§50 makes clear that , " pending final DNA results from recently collected evidence at the crime scene " , Ahmed Abu Adas was n't " the individual who initiated the detonation of the IED , as stated in his claim of responsibility " and that he also was n't present at the crime scene " .
However , in an intriguing passage Brammertz states that :
This could mean that was an active participant in the crime and not a passive victim of kidnapping .
It also raises the possibility , however faint , that he is still alive .§54 features " extremist ideologies " as being among the " possible motives of those who commissioned the crime " .
Finally , there is also a ( possible ) allusion to Jund al - Sham , or rather , to the alleged terrorist cell consisting of 13 members detained in January 2006 : Some of the 13 suspects have claimed to be members of Jund al - Sham . ( , The Daily Star , January 14 , 2006
While the press gets all excited about a RTM 'ed Windows XO , I 'd like to revisit the original XP on XO video one last time .
The future XO laptop OS
Despite the impression that Microsoft " massaged " the Windows XO video let 's for the moment presume that the video was simply edited a bit oddly , and that the demo was the state of the art , XP on XO performance .
Did you watch it closely , while taking copious notes about XP on the XO performance ?
Well , I 'm enough of a geek that I did .
And the results are not pretty .
James Utzschneider and Bohdan Raciborski walked us through Windows XP on the OLPC XO , showing off a few common tasks - the general OS , recording and playback of audio and video , power management and the ebook mode , and document sharing .
First , you might remember James U's earlier blog entry detailing the difficulties MS had encountered in running XP on the XO , and the limitations we 've discussed with the " Unlimited " Potential software pack .
Next , be sure to read James U's blog entry on the Microsoft announcement of Windows XP on the XO laptop from One Laptop Per Child .
Then , watch the Microsoft XP on XO video :
XP on the XO
Microsoft starts with its " good news " that XP boots faster ( but not four times faster ) than Sugar ; ( 1:05 into the video ) .
Good going , folks .
First off , it turns out that XP does n't boot that much faster , as the scene only shows a boot to user login , not to the full user interface .
Worse , Microsoft had to cram in an SD card to make XP and Office work .
The OS ( and MS Office as well , I presume ) are resident on the SD Card ; from James ' blog , emphasis added :
As I have posted earlier , we had to write multiple custom drivers and a BIOS to get Windows to boot from an SD card in order to do the Windows port to the XO .
This is the initial implementation customers will be able purchase when the product RTMs and will be a " Windows only " XO that Nicholas Negroponte himself has described as running " really fast . "
Customers can also choose to buy the existing Linux / Sugar XO .
Longer term , the OLPC plans to write a new BIOS and increase the amount of flash storage on the XO to support a " Dual Boot " option that would enable children to use either Linux or Windows on the same machine .
This is fine with us as long there continues to be an excellent Windows experience on the XO .
Having the operating system on an SD card makes it really difficult to upgrade to a larger SD card ( or replace a broken one ) , view photos from a camera , or share documents using an SD card instead of a USB key .
Sugar and other Linux versions on the XO do take longer to boot ; but once the suspend and hibernation features are completely working ( and the current Update . 1 Release Candidate has most of it working ) -- you 'll never need to turn it off , rarely reboot , and it recovers almost instantaneously from sleep , so this to me is a non-issue .
Recording audio
It goes quickly downhill from at 1:36 in - James and Bohdan shows us how to record an audio file on the Windows XO .
Remember , in Sugar this means pressing the " Record " activity on the bottom toolbar , selecting " Audio " ( it defaults to photos , and the one " Record " activity records anything -- photos , video , or audio ! ) , and pressing record -- done .
In XP , James navigates through 3 sub-menus of the Start Menu ( Start - Programs - Accessories - Entertainment , for you following at home with your own XP , because when I think " record this " I think programs , then accessories , then entertainment ! ) .
So after finding the Sound Recorder , he then has to muck with the custom audio properties ( Stereo sound and normal compression ? ? ) before recording finally .
Right .
That 's intuitive .
We wanna sing & dance !
Recording video
At 2:20 he loads up Windows Movie Maker to capture video ( again , to do this in Sugar , you 'd just change from Audio to Video in the Record activity ) .
Again he mucks with compression / quality settings ( 1/2 MB bitrate and 30 FPS -- really ?
I just want to press " record " ) .
It works and has the standard Windows Movie Maker timeline / video editing capabilities .
" Sharing "
Microsoft expects teachers using Windows XOs to have USB thumbdrives ( at 3:19 ) and be ready to pass them around their class to share videos / photos / recordings and such .
Heck , I do n't even let my thumbdrive leave my sight at work .
With class sizes of over 30 , how long will it take for each student to plug a drive in , have it pop up , copy a video to their desktop ( again , providing they have any space left over after Windows and Office ) , and then finding the " Safely Remove " icon in the taskbar , clicking it , and correctly selecting the thummdrive and not the Windows SD card , and then passing it to the next student .
Sharing a video becomes an all - class - session activity , when it should be done through improvements to the mesh and a peercasting video tool .
To be fair , outside of shareable activities , the process currently does n't work much better on the XO ( at least without a School Server to host the shared file ) .
The swank OLPC XO - 1 screen
Power
Putting the laptop into the tablet configuration in Windows seems to switch it to the no-backlight screen mode ( 4:00 ) ; which I hope is not automatic if a child wants to , I dunno , read a book at night in a house without any other light source ?
In no -backlight mode , he claims you can use the laptop for 20 hours , which I find hard to believe , but if Windows is n't supporting the mesh network and therefore the wifi is also turned off , it 's remotely possible .
I watched full - screen video with wifi off on a flight recently and it lasted the full duration of the two and a half hour movie , plus another short TV episode , plus plenty of time left at the end to play the Implode activity ( my secret XO addiction ) before having to turn off all electronics for landing ; so in full , CPU - sleeping screen - off mode , it probably could last that long .
Maybe Sugar users should turn off wifi and see how long a backlightless Read activity can last ?
Wifi
At 4:50 he shows us how to access a wireless network .
Now , as a guy who often gets calls from parents , friends , parents of friends and friends of friends trying to connect to a wireless network in XP , I can safely say that configuring wifi on XP is one of the most confusing tasks ever to be standardized .
No mention of support mesh networking , which may mean that the laptops are not connected to even a local network once they leave the access - point connectivity of the school ( if there 's even good connection at the school ; my experience with Jamaican schools built with lots of rebar , cinder blocks , and metal roofing all played havoc with omni-directional wifi ranges ) .
Security ?
Not mentioned in the video of course is the dire need for security software -- anti-virus , anti-spyware , anti-malware , anti-phishing and so on that 's suddenly very important if you 're releasing XP +IE machines to people who have n't developed a callous shell of cynicism and doubt when approached by Nigerian 419 scams , " Your computer is infected " flashing malware banner ads , and the like .
By the time you load all of this up , the low - power computer will slow to a barely - usable crawl .
MS Defender may help against some of those ; but we 're back to adding cruft and cost when we look at anti-virus vendors .
Pinball teaches gravity - right ?
Conclusions
Sugar had its faults ; no doubt about it ; but it was clean and intuitive with a core belief of an " unlimited ceiling " of upward development -- Sugar was an adult bike with many layers of training wheels that could be removed ; with lots of integrated paths to help do just that with eToys teaching programming methods and the various puzzles teaching slowly - more - challenging problem solving skills .
Windows is designed against this , with no programming tools built in , and an almost anti-hacker / explorer / fiddler philosophy that goes beyond it merely being " closed source " to putting up impediments to learning any useful skills .

HARRISBURG – A new law signed this month by Gov. Edward G. Rendell will help to improve the health of newborns in Pennsylvania , according to the state Health Department .
By amending the Newborn Child Testing Act of 1965 , the new law enables the Department of Health to continue to provide for screening and follow - up services for six mandated genetic and metabolic conditions for babies born in Pennsylvania and adds follow - up services for 22 more genetic and metabolic conditions .
“ This law helps further ensure that newborns receive necessary follow up services so they can lead happy , healthy lives , ” Secretary of Health Dr. Calvin B. Johnson said .
“ Early intervention and treatment is vital to a baby ’s health and provides peace of mind for parents . ”
Newborn metabolic and genetic screening has a profound impact on the health of approximately 150,000 babies delivered in Pennsylvania each year .
The Department of Healthrefers newborns that screen positive for metabolic and genetic disorders to specialized treatment centers for confirmatory testing , diagnosis , treatment , and parental education .
Although the 28 metabolic and genetic disorders are uncommon , their presence may lead to mental retardation and even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated .
Babies already receive screening for hearing loss at birth as provided by The Infant Hearing Education Assessment Reporting and Referral ( IHEARR ) Act of 2001 .
With the additional genetic and metabolic conditions now required for follow - up along with the hearing screening services for newborns , Pennsylvania now joins many other states that screen for at least 29 conditions at birth .
For more information on newborn screening , visit the Department of Health here or call 1 - 877 - PA - HEALTH .

OK , one more try .
First of all , I do n’t have a political dog in this fight .
I ’m happy to believe that crazy speculation distorts markets .
And I do think it ’s likely that oil prices will come down , for a while , once consumers have a chance to respond more fully to high prices by changing their driving habits , switching to smaller cars , etc . .
But the mysticism over how speculation is supposed to drive prices drives me crazy , professionally .
So here ’s my latest attempt to talk it through .
Imagine that Joe Shmoe and Harriet Who , neither of whom has any direct involvement in the production of oil , make a bet :
Joe says oil is going to $ 150 , Harriet says it wo n’t .
What direct effect does this have on the spot price of oil — the actual price people pay to have a barrel of black gunk delivered ?
The answer , surely , is none .
Who cares what bets people not involved in buying or selling the stuff make ?
And if there are 10 million Joe Shmoes , it still does n’t make any difference .
Well , a futures contract is a bet about the future price .
It has no , zero , nada direct effect on the spot price .
And that ’s true no matter how many Joe Shmoes there are , that is , no matter how big the positions are .
Any effect on the spot market has to be indirect : someone who actually has oil to sell decides to sell a futures contract to Joe Shmoe , and holds oil off the market so he can honor that contract when it comes due ; this is worth doing if the futures price is sufficiently above the current price to more than make up for the storage and interest costs .
As I ’ve tried to point out , there just is n’t any evidence from the inventory data that this is happening .
And here ’s one more fact : by and large , futures prices over the period of the big price runup have been slightly below spot prices .
The figure below shows monthly data from the EIA ; as the spot price shot up , the futures price ( that ’s contract 4 , the furthest out ) actually lagged a bit behind .
In other words , there has n’t been any incentive to hoard .
As I ’ve said , I do n’t have a political dog in this fight .
But the nonsense in this debate makes me want to shoot someone in the face .*
Update : I see that Michael Masters , about whom I had some flattering things to say a few days ago , is now telling Congress that gasoline will go back to $ 2 a gallon if we crack down on speculators .
He forgot to mention that cold fusion will solve all our energy problems any day now .
* Memo to the humor - impaired : that ’s a Dick Cheney joke .
Earlier this year , AMD CEO Hector Ruis boldly pledged to return the company to profitability in the second half of 2008 .
A recent iSuppli report indicates that this may be an even harder task than originally projected , as AMD actually lost market share in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 .
In the first quarter , Intel earned 79.7 percent of the revenue in the global microprocessor market , compared to just 13 percent for AMD .
For Intel , those first quarter results reflected a net gain of 1.2 percentage points , while AMD 's 13 percent revenue share was 1.1 percent lower than what the company netted in Q4 2007 .
The good news , however , is that AMD 's market share rose 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 .
Additional market share is a good thing , but revenue is quite valuable in its own right , especially for a company as cash - strapped as AMD .
The company 's second quarter results should be available in the not - too - distant future , and are likely to be a far more accurate bellwether of AMD 's likely performance through the end of 2008 .
AMD launched a number of new products or product revisions since the last few weeks of Q1 , including the 780G chipset , Phenom 's B3 revision , triple - core CPUs , and just recently , the ATI 4850 and 4870 video cards .
These last launched too late to have more than a minimal impact on the company 's second quarter financials , but the combined impact of all these launches put together might have shifted AMD 's revenue in a more positive direction .
iSuppli expects total PC sales to grow by 10.5 percent in 2008 , with much of this growth driven by laptop sales .
Laptop shipments in the first quarter of 2008 grew by 30 percent year - on - year , while PC sales remained more - or - less flat .
AMD 's current presence in the laptop market is relatively weak , but the company has plans afoot to address these concerns as well .
AMD recently launched its updated Puma mobile platform — shipping laptops should be on shelves later this year — and has also revealed some information on Shrike .
Shrike is n't due for over a year , but will launch the first Fusion - class integrated GPU +CPU combination that AMD has been talking up since it acquired ATI .
We 'll know more about the impact AMD 's flurry of launches ( and layoffs ) have had on the company 's bottom line in a few weeks , once it announces quarterly results .
One additional positive bit of news coming from iSuppli 's report is that processor ASPs ( average selling price ) remained flat for both Intel and AMD through the first quarter .
The latest price war between the two companies is apparently over .
That news does n't guarantee that AMD will become profitable again , but it does mean relief from the battering the company took in 2007 when Intel repeatedly slashed its CPU prices .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
Here 's a cold reality that none of the presidential candidates want to tell you : a shrinking number of Americans are bearing an ever bigger share of the nation 's income tax burden .
Is that fair ?
Is it sticking the rich with what they deserve ?
Or is it a sign of a growing social problem ?
As you file your tax return , and as the candidates cite assorted half - truths about U.S. taxes , those questions are worth our attention - as long as we spurn political spin and face the surprising facts .
The first surprise for most people is the large proportion of Americans who do n't pay any income tax at all .
The number of people who actually get money back - not a refund , but a net payment - through the income tax system , is huge .
In 2005 ( the most recent year for which data is available ) , the bottom 40 % of Americans by income had , in the aggregate , an effective tax rate that 's negative : their households received more money through the income tax system , largely from the earned income tax credit , than they paid .
That means that the number of people who actually pay America 's income taxes - totaling almost $ 1 trillion in 2005 - is surprisingly small .
Of those who filed returns ( themselves a subset of the population ) , just half accounted for 97 % of the Treasury 's total income tax revenue .
The top half 's share of total payments has been growing steadily for the past 20 years .
The top 10 % of taxpayers kicked in 70 % of total income tax .
And the famous top 1 % paid almost 40 % of all income tax , a proportion that has jumped dramatically since 1986 .
But wait a minute .
Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama rail against President Bush 's " tax cuts for the rich . "
How does that square with the growing share of total tax paid by the wealthy ?
Are the richest Americans paying so much because they 're actually getting clobbered with higher tax rates ?
No .
Their effective tax rate - the total tax they pay as a percentage of their income - has declined substantially .
The top 1 % paid an effective tax rate of 23 % in 2005 , down from 27.5 % in 2001 .
The rich are getting richer , faster
So if the rich are paying more income tax , yet are being taxed at a lower rate , there can be only one explanation : their incomes must be growing fast , much faster than the rest of the population's .
That is what 's happening .
Back in 1986 , an income of $ 119,000 got you into the top 1 % .
By 2005 it took $ 365,000 to get into the club .
Those numbers are unadjusted for inflation ; if you correct them , it turns out the price of admission still rose by a huge 72 % .
By contrast , the inflation - adjusted definition of a median taxpayer - that is , someone in the 50th percentile - did n't budge .
Now consider some of the heated tax controversies of recent years .
Did Bush cut taxes for the rich ?
Yes .
But he cut taxes for the poor even more .
If we look at the measure that really matters - the change in effective tax rates - the bottom 50 % got a much bigger tax cut than the top 1 % .
Did the dollar value of Bush 's tax cuts go mostly to the wealthy ?
Absolutely .
It could hardly be otherwise .
Since the well - off pay the overwhelming majority of taxes , any tax cut with a prayer of influencing the economy would have to go mostly to them .
You could completely eliminate income taxes for the bottom half of the population , and the Treasury would hardly notice .
The real issues here are clear .
One is having a shrinking minority of citizens pay most of Washington 's bills .
Social cohesion falls apart .
The majority who pay nothing resent those with higher incomes ; the minority who pay heavily resent those who do n't pay .
More fundamental is why some people 's incomes are growing so much faster than other people 's incomes .
That , and not taxes , is what the supposed tax debate is really about .
Watch to see if the candidates make substantive proposals for dealing with the issue , including how low - income citizens can get some of the earning power now going heavily to the better educated , plus how U.S. workers in general can be worth their high cost in a global labor market .
It 's a lot harder than changing income tax rates .
" This could include other schools , local colleges and universities and other institutions with a presence in the area , perhaps in a shared trust .
And we particularly welcome the involvement of parents and local residents themselves who know the needs of the children and the area . "
California became the first state to require restaurants to cook without artery - clogging trans fats , such as those in many oils and margarines , under restrictions signed into law Friday by the health - conscious governor .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a physical - fitness advocate and crusader against obesity , sided with legislators who said the measure would help get the fat out of Californians who are too dependent on fast food .
Trans fats can preserve flavor and add to the shelf life of foods but have been linked to heart disease , stroke and diabetes .
The new law , https://97AB
97 by Assemblyman Tony Mendoza ( D - Artesia ) , requires restaurants to use oils , margarines and shortening with less than half a gram of trans fat per serving by Jan. 1 , 2010 , and applies the standard to deep - fried bakery goods by Jan. 1 , 2011 .

“ California is a leader in promoting health and nutrition , and I am pleased to continue that tradition by being the first state in the nation to phase out trans fats , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ Consuming trans fat is linked to coronary heart disease , and today we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for California . ”
New York City has a similar ban , which began July 1 with a three - month grace period .
Those who violate the California law could face fines of $ 25 to $ 1,000 .
The legislation was vigorously opposed by the California Restaurant Assn. , which argued that it would not substantially affect public health because people eat 75 % of their meals at home .

The decision on what restaurants use in cooking should be based on the desires of customers , not government officials , said association spokesman Daniel Conway .
Even so , he said , “ given the fact that our industry is already phasing out trans fat in response to customers and that there is a delayed timeline for implementation , we are confident our members will be able to meet the mandate of the law . ”
Indeed , the law follows steps already taken by such institutions as McDonald ’s and Spago Beverly Hills to meet customer demand .
“ I am completely in support of it , ” chef and Spago owner Wolfgang Puck said in an e-mail .
“ My companies stopped using trans fats years ago . ”

The fats can be found in vegetable shortenings , margarines , crackers , candies , cookies , snack foods , fried foods , baked goods and other processed foods made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils , according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The Carl ’s Jr. chain plans to stop cooking with trans fats by the beginning of the year , said company spokeswoman Beth Mansfield .
“ We saw where the industry was going , ” she said .
Other chains that have fully or partly eliminated trans fat or had previously committed to doing so include Wendy ’s , El Pollo Loco , Mimis Cafe , KFC , Burger King , IHOP , Applebee ’s , Starbucks , Subway , Taco Bell , Denny ’s , Panera Bread , Red Lobster and the Olive Garden , according to the restaurant association .

The group said ethnic restaurants and bakeries would be hardest hit by the ban , because many ethnic dishes are more difficult to prepare with trans fat - free substitutes .
Rod White , the owner of Bertha ’s Soul Food in Los Angeles , estimated that it would cost him $ 30 more a week to buy cooking oil without trans fat , and he was angry .
“ The government is infringing too much on the rights of people to even eat what they want , ” he said .
“ Are they going to outlaw salt next because it causes hypertension ? ”
Compliance will be checked by state health inspectors on their periodic restaurant visits .

Carl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia and an expert on environmental regulations , predicted that if the ban works smoothly , other states will consider similar steps .
“ California is always the leader in these kinds of laws , ” he said .
Scientific studies have established that trans fats increase so - called bad cholesterol in the body and decrease good cholesterol , contributing to the buildup of plaque in arteries , according to Dr. P.K. Shah , director of cardiology at the Cedars - Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles .
“ This law will address the health issue of cardiovascular disease , which is the No. 1 killer in the nation and the state of California , ” Shah said .

Eliminating artificial trans fats from the food supply could prevent 6 % to 19 % of heart attacks and related deaths each year , according to an estimate published by the New England Journal of Medicine .
The new regulations could mean real savings , not only in lives but also in health costs , according to Mendoza .
“ This has always been about the health of our citizens , ” he said .
Mendoza ’s legislation was supported by such health organizations as the American Heart Assn. , the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Science in the Public Interest .

“ Everybody agrees there are health benefits in getting rid of trans fat , ” said Michael Jacobson , the center ’s executive director .
“ It is causing several thousand deaths each year . ”

“ But to - day we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle , having blundered in the control of a delicate machine , the working of which we do not understand .
The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time — perhaps for a long time . ”
John Maynard Keynes , The Great Slump of 1930 .
Metaphors are powerful .
Powerful words and images matter , because they are a distillation of fundamental beliefs .
Keynes spoke of the economy as a delicate machine , and the idea of the ‘ economy as engine ’ has long been popular with Keynesian and neo-Keynesian economists ( i.e. unscienced morons ) .
One of the great corrective insights of the classical economic school , however , is that the economy is not an engine and it can not be modelled .
It can not be modelled because it is us – the economy comprises the all but infinite interactions of billions of people .
So perhaps the most dangerous fallacy frames the very nature of our economic and financial system the wrong way .
Garbage in ; garbage out .
The damage wrought by bureaucrats and their economic aides who believe that pulling this imaginary lever or flipping that imaginary switch can direct the path of something as tremendously complex as the economy is then compounded by the actions of those unelected bureaucrats as they transform the order of the free market into the chaos of a planned economy .
Misguided actions have undesirable consequences .

If the goal is to get a stagnant project to be more creative or productive , the best move is often to get people out of the room .
Young ideas are fragile .
The more people that are involved , the higher the odds someone will find a reason to kill good ideas before they ’ve had a chance to prove themselves .
The more people in the room , the more politics and private agendas negatively influence conversations .
Diffuse authority can mean no one feels they ’re accountable , or even wants to be .
Firing people , or eliminating positions , is on one extreme end of the spectrum and it has its place .
Sometimes there is no other way to create room for progress to happen .
But on the more conservative end of the same spectrum , simpler decisions available include :
Get people off the project by assigning them elsewhere
Reduce the invite list for creative meetings
Clarify who is in charge of creative decisions ( e.g. who is the equivalent of the film director )
Clarify whose role is to give feedback , but not to drive the show
If your meetings are too slow , or arguments go on for too long , rethink your invite list .
Why do so many deserve a say on so many things if their feedback is so uninspired ?
Pick the least useful people and make their power over creative decisions match their usefulness .
Often referred to as Too many cooks , no matter how smart the people are , if they all think insist on fighting for their own vision , misery ensues .
Start - up companies thrive in part because there are way more decisions to be made than people , granting individuals tons of autonomy .
When there are 10 decisions to be made , but only 2 people , there ’s little motivation to fight over decision making power .
But when a company grows and the ratio of people to decisions runs the other way ( 2 decisions to be made by 10 people ) , the thriving ends and the bureaucratic misery begins .
Firing people , or simply eliminating the number of leadership roles , recentralizes authority .
It empowers those remaining in leadership roles to do far more in far less time , since overcoming the objections of dozens of peers are no longer part of the process of developing news ideas and projects .
In organizations were there are far too many project managers , producers , and middle - managers , roles prone to measurement and process , eliminating those roles is the only way to give creative leaders the space they need to excel .
When I was at Microsoft ( ’94 - ’03 ) the biggest inhibitor to innovation was too much democracy .
Hard to believe , but it ’s true .
There is a long history of internal projects with great ideas that never made it out of Redmond – they were killed by the culture of rough consensus .
If a handful of middle managers could n’t achieve rough consensus on your idea , your project got thrown into the closet ( and often you with it ) .
Grand ideas are often divisive , and a rough consensus decision making system will kill them .
Many companies I ’ve visited over the years suffer from the same pattern of behavior .
They mistakenly believe the problem is the quality of ideas , when in fact the problem is the conservative psychology inherent in democracy .
Pure democracy is not the political system that will create the most change – it ’s a system geared for stability , not for innovation .
I ’ve seen many great designers , engineers , and even managers hired in to well known companies , who prototype great things , and propose grand ideas , but watch in slow despair as the corporate culture ’s insistence on letting everyone have their say watered their ideas down into mediocre , barely recognizable , intellectual sludge .
You could throw a Johnathan Ives , a Rem Koolhaas , or a Will Wright , into most of corporate America and the output of those companies would barely change .
Why ?
Too many cooks .
Some would argue this is by design – consistently mediocre is better than what many companies produce , and it can be enough to be a market leader ( Look around : the best selling music , food , or software is unlikely to be considered the best by anyone in that field ) .
And that ’s fine : success and creativity are two related but different things .
However if you ask for more innovation without changing the authority structure , I ’ll call you crazy .
Consensus is prone to slamming on the brakes – Autocracy is prone to putting the pedal to the metal .
The answer for many organizations is to shift the pendulum of authority two notches away from democracy and towards autocracy .
I ’m not saying create a tyranny – do n’t go all the way – but do identify the creative leaders and give them leadership power based on those talents .
To be a VP , or a General manager depends on political acumen , not creative insights , despite how the hubris of power muddles the distinction .
If instead a VP or GM grants the best creative mind on the team license to lead , and rallies the majority of the team to accept the role of followers , the rate of positive change will always rise .
Look to the autocratic models of building architecture , film making , and pop music – one or two creative minds are granted huge amounts of authority , disproportionate to the corporate hierarchy .
So when in doubt – look around the room .
If your team is flailing or struggling to resolve a creative decision , create more autocracy .
Either get the dead weight out of the room , or pick the person in the you as the leader believe has the best perspective and grant them your authority – let them make the call .
If you ca n’t change the balance of power by any other means , thin the herd .
If you have no other alternative , pink slips might be the best thing for everyone involved : the talent you fire may find , or create , the autonomy they deserve elsewhere .
But either way , do what you can to give the creative minds in your world the autonomy they need to thrive .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Distressed - debt and vulture investors looking to profit from the spike in corporate bankruptcies this year are about to get unprecedented access to a previously well hidden corner of the market .
Restricted Stock Partners , a broker - dealer specializing in illiquid securities , will launch a trading platform for bankruptcy claims next week that its chief executive says should boost liquidity and efficiency in the estimated $ 75 billion market .
The new platform , which will feature quotes and bids and asks , will allow trade vendors , leaseholders , and other parties that hold claims against bankrupt companies to sell their interests to investors before the conclusion of a bankruptcy case .
Restricted ’s CEO , Barry Silbert , said he hopes this new platform will make trading of bankruptcy claims as popular as the bonds and loans that distressed - debt investors have traditionally focused on .
“ In the last bankruptcy boom , the distressed - bond trading really took off , and in this bankruptcy boom we think it ’s going to be the bankruptcy - trade claims , ” Silbert said .
“ We know the claims holders themselves would like to get cash today and not wait two or three years until the end of the bankruptcy case . ”
Investors like to buy trade claims because they are typically unsecured and the claims can help them position themselves as a major stakeholder in the company once it emerges from bankruptcy .
Also , trade vendors are typically so desperate to exchange their claim for cash to keep their businesses running that they are willing to accept steep discounts , when they could often get a full recovery if they waited until the end of the bankruptcy case .
But the market for bankruptcy claims has also tended to be inefficient , bankruptcy experts said , as investors have to dig through court documents to locate claims holders , and make their buy offers via mass mailings or calling campaigns .
The buyers often get sellers to sign confidentiality agreements about the price , and with no platform to turn to for common prices , that often left claims holders unsure if they had sold for a fair price .
“ Typically a client will get a letter from somebody saying ‘ We ’re willing to buy bankruptcy claims , please contact us , ’ but the problem with that is those deals get done on a one - off basis , ” said Kenneth Rosen , a bankruptcy attorney at Lowenstein Sandler in New Jersey .
“ There really has n’t been a purely public forum that someone can go to see what the current trading looks like . ”
Restricted Stock Partners , earlier known for offering a secondary market for restricted stock , began to attract distressed - debt investors earlier this year as it also became one of the top trading venues for troubled auction rate securities .
To expand into bankruptcy - claims trading this month , the company acquired Trade Receivable Exchange Inc ( T - REX ) , an online start - up launched a year ago to specialize in bankruptcy trade - claims auctions .
As an auction site T - REX has attracted more than 650 members who will be given access to the Restricted Securities Trading Network , and T - REX co-founder David Williams will lead the bankruptcy - claims trading group at Restricted .
While trading in bankruptcy claims is largely unregulated , Restricted Stock Partners is a registered broker - dealer and has set up procedures to handle the settlement and paperwork , including necessary court filings , for buyers and sellers in its system .
As trade vendors and leaseholders are increasingly under pressure from the weak economy , Silbert says he expects more transparent trading of bankruptcy claims could even help keep some vendors out of bankruptcy themselves as it provides quicker access to desperately needed cash .
“ We ’re trying to create transparency in a market where buyers probably do n’t want to see it , but we ’re providing access to many more claims , ” Silbert said .
“ With more trading of bankruptcy claims , it will be interesting to see how big that discount buyers get on these claims will be . ”
I do n't have a car , but of course need to move things like my drumkits and other stuff .
And being a cyclist of course a pedal - powered cargo vehicle was the way to go .
Being the cheap resourceful fellow that I am , I decided to build one ( with the help of friends ) .
It has turned out to be incredibly useful , as with it one can : Bring home gardening supplies Fetch some wood and materials that otherwise would have ended up in landfill ( and which helped make a new roof for the trikeport )
Bring home a pair of decent kitchen cabinets that someone had carefully placed at the curb on garbage night ( and then given to a friend )
Move some rather large ( but not terribly heavy ) penguins ( More photos like this on Page 6 - Observations , and photos of working and playing . )
Trike ( and other stuff ) blog :
All new info on the trike is at my blog under cargo trike .
Links to posts detailing structural or operational changes will be added below , newest to oldest .
August 2009 : The handlebar crosspiece finally cracked at its mount and had to be repaired .
A pair of braces were also added to stop this bar from flexing .
See my blog post for the while story .
May and October 2007 : In May I upgraded the electric - assist battery pack to 48 - volt 12ah , and this boost has made a nice difference !
Then in October I gave the pack a more semi-permanent installation .
July 2006 : Courtesy of my friend Juergen and his Acclivity Solutions , the trike just got an electric - assist motor .
Details at my my blog .
Background :
The creation of this machine filled a dream I 'd had for quite a while .
As you may know from reading elsewhere on my site , my primary work is as a drummer / percussionist , and since going car - free back in '99 I have had to ask others to help me move my instruments .
And for many occasions , this works out fine , because the band is often travelling some sort of distance , and it only makes sense to pile everyone and everything into the van and off we go .
But a fair amount of my work is within a few kilometers of where I live , particularly in the summer when I play a lot of outdoor shows in various parks and plazas around town .
And I had always figured it would be great to just cycle to a gig with drums in tow , and not wait for someone to give me a lift and worry about parking when we got there .
But drums , while not being all that heavy for their size , do take up a fair amount of space .
I thought about building an even bigger trailer than the utility one I already have , but figured it might be a tad unwieldy for just a skinny bike to pull .
I wanted something a bit more sturdy , a sort of human - powered pick - up truck !
Over the years I had seen vehicles such as the Brox ( but it does n't carry too much of a payload ) , and the HPM Tri-Hauler .
I liked this last design , and one that is quite similar is the Organic Engines SUV ( sensible utility vehicle ) .
Both of these are front wheel drive with the steering pivot behind the seat .
The Tri-hauler seemed like it might be a little easier to build , but its head - tube would take all the load , and the SUV looked a fair bit sturdier in this area .
The Beginning : Enter fellow HPVOoO member and guy with a welding torch , Juergen Weichert .
I was talking to the gang about trying to build something along the lines of one of the above trikes , and he simply says " I 'll help you .
You pay for my welding gas and all the materials , and I get to practice " .
Sounded good to me !
We settled on copying the Organic Engines design , and corresponded with proprietor and creator Dan Kavanaugh , who kindly gave us some basic dimensions and tubing sizes .
From there Juergen and I had to figure out the rest .
Some of you may be curious as to how this thing was built , so I 've created separate webpages with more or less complete construction details and photo documentation .
So please go to my trike details page .
Or you can skip all that , and head right to the action shots !
Design Considerations :
The first step was to determine how much stuff I needed to carry .
So I got out the drums I use most often , and arranged them on the floor to see how much area I would need .
The least flexible piece was the hardware box at just over three feet long and approx .
one foot high and wide .
I decided it should go at the rear of the cargo box , since that was where the wheels would be and so it made sense to put the heaviest thing over them .
But with its width it meant for a fairly wide cargo box , with the wheels being outside of that .
I did n't want to put it along one side , as I thought that might unbalance things a bit ( since the drums themselves inside their cases do n't weigh all that much ) .
I guess in retrospect I could have perhaps moved the wheels forward and inwards and had the box at the back behind them , but since I would also like to set it up like a pedicab every now and then the extra width would be necessary to carry two people side by side .
Now that the trike is built and in use I must say that I am quite pleased .
It 's very first job was our local St. Patrick 's Day Parade , as I got to be lead vehicle with the HPVOoO contingent and was carrying 350 lbs. ( 160 kg ) of P.A. equipment !
After that I made some trips from the local bike shop were I work part - time down to the re-Cycles bike Co-op where I volunteer .
On the first trip I carried 22 wheels , and on the second trip it was five boxes of old parts and accessories .
About two weeks later I was finally able to use it for its intended purpose of moving my drums , and that went very well .
I do get a litle paranoid about locking it up at night on the street or in a parking lot while I 'm busy performing , but I 've got a very stout Kryptonite lock on it and that 's about the best I can do .
Hopefully the fact of it being homebuilt and mainly with used or ordinary parts might discourage theft .
The only issue I 'm noticing so far while riding ( and this will be old news to others who ride trikes ) is road crown !
That is , the tilt in every road from the centre to the edge , needed to facilitate water run-off .
One never notices this on a bicycle with its two inline wheels , but with a multi - track vehicle like a trike you definitely feel it !
And so on some of our local roads there 's more tilt than I 'd like , and I have to make an effort to keep the front end straight , since there 's a fair bit of forward weight due to the mid-ship hinge .
And so , on to the design pages ....
Debates about same - sex relationships and marriage have become an unavoidable hot - button issue in the political arena these past few years .
Moral deliberation aside , however , new research suggests that gay couples “ have a great deal to teach everyone else about marriage and relationships ” , as author Tara Parker - Hope says in this interesting New York Times piece yesterday .
She writes :
“ Most studies show surprisingly few differences between committed gay couples and committed straight couples , but the differences that do emerge have shed light on the kinds of conflicts that can endanger heterosexual relationships .
The findings offer hope that some of the most vexing problems are not necessarily entrenched in deep - rooted biological differences between men and women .
And that , in turn , offers hope that the problems can be solved . ”
In a 2000 study in Vermont , soon after same - sex civil unions were legalized there , researchers surveyed almost 1,000 heterosexual and homosexual couples about “ common causes of marital strife like housework , sex , and money ” .
When the results came in , same - sex relationships scored as far more “ egalitarian ” than heterosexual ones :
“ In heterosexual couples , women did far more of the housework ; men were more likely to have the financial responsibility ; and men were more likely to initiate sex , while women were more likely to refuse it or to start a conversation about problems in the relationship .
With same - sex couples , of course , none of these dichotomies were possible , and the partners tended to share the burdens far more equally . ”
While this result might not surprise you , the next finding is really interesting : although the gay and lesbian couples surveyed experienced conflict at about the same rate as the heterosexual couples , the same - sex couples reported a higher level of happiness in their relationships .
According to Parker - Hope , this finding suggests that it ’s the inequality inherent in opposite - sex relationships that ends up causing problems , not the amount of conflict .
She follows with a quote San Diego State University professor of women ’s studies Esther D. Rothblum , who nicely summarizes the idea behind this study :
“ Heterosexual married women live with a lot of anger about having to do the tasks not only in the house but in the relationship .
That ’s very different than what same - sex couples and heterosexual men live with . ”
Heterosexual couples can also learn a thing or two from gay couples when it comes to conflict resolution , research suggests :
“ One well - known study used mathematical modeling to decipher the interactions between committed gay couples .
The results , published in two 2003 articles in The Journal of Homosexuality , showed that when same - sex couples argued , they tended to fight more fairly than heterosexual couples , making fewer verbal attacks and more of an effort to defuse the confrontation .
Controlling and hostile emotional tactics , like belligerence and domineering , were less common among gay couples .
Same - sex couples were also less likely to develop an elevated heartbeat and adrenaline surges during arguments .
And straight couples were more likely to stay physically agitated after a conflict .
“ When they got into these really negative interactions , gay and lesbian couples were able to do things like use humor and affection that enabled them to step back from the ledge and continue to talk about the problem instead of just exploding , ” said Robert W. Levenson , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Berkeley . ”
Again , no surprises there .
“ Humor and affection ” certainly sound like a more pleasant way of dealing with conflict than “ exploding ” in anger , no ?
So , the point of all this research ?
It appears that heterosexual couples would do well to emulate their peers in same - sex relationships , who share power equally , employ respectful , effective problem - solving techniques , and are happier as a result .
No one can argue with that .
Gay Relationship Research Holds Valuable Lessons for Straight Couples , Too
Never mind those fancy BD - R critters , how 's about a 42GB DVD ?
Researchers with a good deal more intelligence than us over at Tohoku University have reportedly figured out a way to " multiply the amount of data that can be stored on a DVD or CD by 9 . "
Based on our best guess at translating a foreign language ( we kid ... sort of ) , the achievement was realized by shaping the pits on a DVD 's surface like Vs , essentially making the disc more capacious in the process .
Unfortunately , said project will probably never see any mainstream attention , as existing DVD / CD players wo n't recognize the malformed media , and worse still , the process can't be applied to Blu-ray Discs . [ Via CrunchGear
A Texas man who shot and killed two men he suspected of burgling his neighbour 's home has been cleared by a grand jury .
Joe Horn , 61 , shot the two men in November after he saw them crawling out the windows of a neighbour 's house in the Houston suburb of Pasadena .
Horn called authorities and told the emergency dispatcher he had a shotgun and was going to kill the men .
The dispatcher pleaded with him not to go outside , but Horn confronted the men with a 12 - gauge shotgun and shot both in the back .
Pushing Data to the Browser with Comet
AJAX has become so popular because it allows a browser to initiate a request to the server to receive or push data .
Pushing data from the server to a client at an undetermined interval has been a problem that AJAX has never been able to deal with well .
Simple examples of applications that AJAX does not handle well due to the need for server push are chat applications , live temperature updates , tailing log files , and calling long running queries .
Comet can solve this problem .
Comet is a web application architecture that allows a web server to send data to a browser without any need for the browser to request the data .
Three common examples of allowing a server to push data to a browser are : polling , long polling , and streaming .
Long polling and streaming are two strategies that are considered Comet .
Polling
The simplest solution to the problem of pushing data to the client at an undetermined interval is polling .
Polling is achieved by using AJAX to periodically make client - based requests to the server at a fixed interval .
Polling is typically implemented by using the setTimeout function in JavaScript ( see Listing 1 ) .
Listing 1 : Using Polling to Asynchronously Execute A Long Running Query
function executeLongRunningQueryOnServer ( ) { makeAJAXCallStartAsyncQueryOnServer ( ) ; checkIfQueryComplete( ) ; } function checkIfQueryComplete ( ) { var query Result = AJAXCallToSeeIfQueryFinished ( ) ; if ( queryResult.isFinished ) { displalyResults ( queryResult ) ; } else { setTimeout ( " checkIfQueryComplete ( ) " , 10000 ) ; } }
Listing 1 shows a simple example of how polling can be used to execute a long running query that would typically timeout if executed directly from an AJAX call .
In this example , an AJAX call is made to execute a query on the server .
The next step is to make an AJAX call every 10 seconds to see whether the query has completed .
When the query is completed , the next AJAX call ( poll ) will get the results as shown in Figure 1 .
Polling is not considered Comet , but the experience for the client can be very similar to Comet .
Before comet was discovered , polling with AJAX requests was used in place of Comet .
An Example of Polling
The greatest advantage of polling is that it is very simple .
Polling only requires simple AJAX and JavaScript on the client .
The server implementation is also fairly simple .
Polling has many disadvantages , including unnecessary requests and the response can be delayed as much as the polling interval .
Long Polling
The second method of achieving pushing data from the server to a client at an undetermined interval is long polling .
Long polling is considered Comet .
Long polling is very similar to polling , except the request sleeps on the server instead of the client .
If at any time data becomes available on the server , the sleeping request is awakened and the requested data is immediately returned to the client ( see Listing 2 ) .
One factor you must keep in mind is that your AJAX request will time out if you sleep too long .
To overcome timing out , you should only sleep for 30 to 60 seconds on the server .
If the data is not available , you must repeat the long poll request until data becomes available .
Listing 2 : Using Long Polling to Asynchronously Run A Long Running Query
function executeLongRunningQueryOnServer ( ) { makeAJAXCallStartAsyncQueryOnServer ( ) ; checkIfQueryComplete( ) ; } function checkIfQueryComplete ( ) { // will sleep on server 30 seconds if var query Result = AJAXCallToSeeIfQueryFinished ( ) ; if ( queryResult.isFinished ) { displalyResults ( queryResult ) ; } else { checkIfQueryComplete ( ) ; // no setTimeout } }
Listing 2 shows the only difference in client - side coding between polling and long polling .
Long polling will immediately make another long poll request when a long poll request returns if the query has not finished .

Immigration : what is happening in the Netherlands ?
Immigration was never compatible with the European nation state , which pre-supposes ethnic and / or cultural homogeneity .
In the Netherlands , it resulted in polarisation into two separate and hostile populations .
Under these circumstances , democracy will ultimately result in the expulsion of immigrants , and the restoration of the national community ( as it was envisaged by 19th - century nationalists ) .
Developments in the Netherlands are summarised here , as a relevant comparison for Britain .
For more detail , see The nationalism of Pim Fortuyn .
The Netherlands is a polarised society , and its polarisation is now its central feature .
The increasing residential and educational segregation is a symptom of this polarisation , rather than its cause .
The country is inhabited by two groups - or more accurately , a group and a category .
The first is an ethno-national group , a classic European nation who call themselves ' Netherlanders ' .
They see the Netherlands as their national homeland ( the nation takes its name from the landscape , the English word ' Dutch ' is a corruption of Deutsch ) .
The second is a negatively defined category ( permanently resident non-Netherlanders ) , which has no internal cultural or social unity .
They are universally described as the ' allochtones ' , and by now they identify themselves by that name .
The term is borrowed from biology and geology , it means ' of external origin ' .
The best English - language equivalent is ' immigrant minorities ' .
Both first generation immigrants , and their descendants , are allochtones .
The ethnic Netherlanders are also , but less often , referred to as ' autochtones ' .
Both designations are acquired at birth : they are not derived from , or altered by , citizenship .
There is no procedure , by which an allochtone can cease to be an allochtone .
Officially , anyone with one or both parents born outside the Netherlands is an allochtone .
The social definition includes foreign grandparents as well - in fact anyone of recognisable foreign descent .
Netherlands Antillians are citizens of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , but also allochtones .
So are non-whites born in Indonesia and Suriname , when those were still colonies .
Group self - definition by ancestry , and the claim to a national homeland , are standard elements of European nationalism .
That has remained unaltered since the 19th century , and still underlies the legitimacy claim of all EU member states .
In the standard definition , the ethnic nation is formed by descendants of the past inhabitants of the national homeland .
Netherlanders use that definition and call the group ' volk ' , and so do Germans .
Most other nations in Europe have a similar self - definition , and an equivalent term .
It is a demographic fiction - there are no genetically isolated human populations in Europe .
Besides , the present national territory is an ill - gotten gain , which once belonged to the Duke of Cleves and the Prince - Bishop of Liège , among others .
Statistically , the present - day Netherlanders do not coincide with the descendants of the inhabitants of the United Provinces .
However , it is pointless to quote statistics at nationalism , which is about collective memory , shared identity , and shared emotion .
It is pointless to question the accuracy of the ' Fatherland History ' ( as it is officially described ) .
It is also pointless to tell Netherlanders , that they ought to have a more inclusive definition of themselves as a nation .
They do n't , and 25 years of official multiculturalism failed to alter that .
Because of the rigid national self - definition in de-facto biological terms , ' assimilation ' in the sociological sense has completely failed .
Hyphenated identities , such as ' Polish - American ' or ' British Asian ' , are absent in the Netherlands , and there is no ' melting pot ' ideology either .
In fact Britain and Ireland seem to the only EU countries , where multi-ethnic national identities are are seen as an option .
No surprise , since this type of national identity originates in Anglophone immigrant states , the United States , Canada and Australia - where it is also bitterly disputed .
Allochtones in the Netherlands therefore remain allochtones .
Naturalised citizenship is increasingly regarded as non-permanent , to be withdrawn at any time , on any criteria the government may set .
At individual level , no Netherlander would call a person with two Moroccan parents a Netherlander .
( Certainly not if they were called Fatima or Mohammed : Islam is a marker of foreignness ) .
The result is two separate and often hostile populations .
Sharply diverging reactions to violent incidents ( such as the killing of Theo van Gogh ) , illustrate the polarisation .
Violence between individuals from each group is still rare , but violent racist threats are very common on the Dutch - language internet .
The tensions result from the combination of immigration , exclusionist national identity , nation - state , and democracy itself .
Democracy is a bad thing , when the population is polarised by ethnicity or religion .
Liberal - democratic theory assumes that the voter is rationally self - interested , but millions of voters may instead be obsessed with the Jews , the Pakis , or the Papists .
Democracy makes the state into their instrument , and this ' perversion of state ' is among its worst defects .
Given stable majority hostility to a minority , as in Northern Ireland from the 1920's to the 1960's , democracy becomes an institutionalised vendetta .
The immigrant minorities in the Netherlands would almost certainly be better off if the army seized power , or if the EU abolished elections and introduced direct rule from Brussels .
Neither of those is likely , but violence is .
It could take the form of immigrant riots , like those in France in 2005 .
It might mean a ' pogrom climate ' , with continual attacks on minority homes , schools , and shops .
It could consist of tit - for - tat killings of random individuals from each group , as in Northern Ireland .
Most likely , it will be in the form of Islamist terrorism .
In historical perspective some form of violent transition is not only inevitable , but necessary .
There is no other historical ' exit strategy ' from the present untenable structure of Netherlands society , in fact a stand - off .
This stand - off would not exist without immigration , and a widespread refusal to accept that fact has made things worse .
The European nation state , the homeland of a nation defined by ancestry , is fundamentally incompatible with mass immigration .
Since 1800 tens of millions of people were killed , in the process of converting Europe into a continent of nation states .
Allowing another ethnic group to live in the national homeland , makes a mockery of the national ideal .
Netherlands nationalists repeatedly compare immigration to the German invasion in 1940 , and the comparison is accurate in the sense that every immigrant is an invader .
Every immigrant ' occupies ' a small part of national territory and economy , and many immigrants make a conquest .
If one - tenth of the Netherlands population becomes Turkish by immigration , then it is as if one - tenth of the country had been given to Turkey .
It is a taboo to emphasise this , but immigration is unavoidably a geopolitical and territorial issue .
Hostility to immigrants is the logical consequence of their claim to the national territory : at the very least they are collectively unwelcome .
The Netherlands is intended for the Netherlanders , and not for immigrants like myself .
Britain is intended for white Britons of Anglo - Saxon and Celtic stock , and not for Bengalis and Poles .
I think that 's a good reason to abolish both nation - states , and indeed all the nation - states in Europe , since that form of state is racist by definition .
But even immigrants who do n't reject the nation - state , are inevitably locked in enmity with the national majority .
Most prefer not to think about that .
The demographic and cultural impact of immigration is another taboo ( for the intellectual and political elites ) .
Across western Europe , hundreds of urban communities have undergone a process comparable with the 100 % replacement of the Germans in East Prussia in the late 1940's .
That transformation never went through the political process .
If , for instance , Harold Macmillan had gone round working - class areas in 1958 , saying ' We intend to remove at least 90 % of you , and replace you with foreigners ' , British voters would have banned all immigration .
Hypothetical history - but by now the ' white ' majorities in Western Europe do know what immigration means .
They have begun to take belated revenge on the immigrants , and that is what is happening in the Netherlands .
If you cannot accept that immigration does real damage to the indigenous nation , you can not begin to understand the populist - xenophobic fury in the Netherlands , Belgium , or Denmark .
Continued immigration will ultimately destroy any nation state , and Netherlands nationalists often compare the multiculturalist political elite to the traitors and collaborators under the German occupation .
Forgiving the ' traitors ' , and welcoming the ' invaders ' , is not an option for the resentful electorate of the xenophobic populists .
It is an even deeper taboo to suggest an explanation , but there is one .
Almost certainly a significant proportion of the European population , possibly around 20 % , is clinically xenophobic .
They are suffering from a diagnosable medical condition , related to other situational phobias .
The DSM - IV classes all phobias as ' anxiety disorders ' , but that may not be the whole truth about xenophobia .
The genetic predisposition to phobias , and evolutionary biology , suggest that xenophobia is inherited .
Defensive reactions to outsiders would have been advantageous during a long period of human evolution , and many people may carry a ' xenophobia gene ' .
Certainly , some pre-existing combination of aversion and aggression would explain mass pogroms , where large sections of the population try to kill members of a minority .
There is no research on the medical aspects of xenophobia , because it is such a taboo .
In the Netherlands , a 2006 survey by Motivaction found that a quarter of the population has " extremely negative " attitudes to allochtones , and 10 % are " exceptionally racist " .
The explicit racists feel superior to allochtones , say that Netherlanders are more intelligent , openly approve discrimination , and oppose mixing between both groups .
Xenophobic attitudes are not limited to a ' tiny minority ' .
Europe may have to accept that one - fifth of the population is medically incapable , of living in the same society as foreigners .
They would remain a constant threat to the lives of immigrant minorities , because they are suffering acute stress from the ' foreigners ' around them , and that could flip over into violence at any time .
If you lock an arachnophobe in a room with spiders , for days on end , then sooner or later they will stamp on the spiders .
So unless a genetic therapy is developed , the only solution seems to be , to move the millions of xenophobes into some form of ' white homeland ' , comparable to the proposed Afrikaner Volkstaat in South Africa .
The point is not to turn the nationalist ideology on its head , but to cope with a permanently and inherently aggressive population group .
Their electoral impact disables the function of the state as a force for good , and threatens to convert it into a Xenophobia Agency .
To some extent that is the inevitable fate of nation - states with high immigration .
If the national identity is non-inclusive , then a xenophobic political culture is inevitable , as in the the Netherlands .
The majority of Netherlanders may not be rabid xenophobes , but they simply do n't want to share their country with immigrants .
That drives the current national obsession with the related issues of national identity , immigration , integration , and Islam .
Hysterical is the only appropriate term for the constant stream of proposals aimed at the allochtones .
Some became official policy , such as the misleadingly named ' citizenship tests ' and courses .
These are called ' inburgering ' , literally in - citizen - isation , and the wider process is called ' integratie ' , but both are widely understood as indicating cultural assimilation .
The exams do n't directly confer citizenship , and immigrants can't evade them by not applying for citizenship .
They are imposed by the Immigration Service IND , by local councils ( through social security benefit , which they locally control ) , and through embassies , for those seeking to immigrate by marriage ( the only legal route for non -EU citizens ) .
In one form of ' inburgering ' , resident ' non-western allochtones ' must pay € 6000 for a course , and answer questions such as ' Were the ships of the United East India Company intended for trade or fishing ? '
Exam failure is punished by a fine .
Few of these courses would in fact help an immigrant to assimilate : the vindictive tone of the proposals makes it clear that they they are intended a a collective punishment , and above all to deter immigration .
Other typical ' integration ' proposals include some form of ban on speaking foreign languages - in schools , when travelling on public transport , or on the street .
One suggestion was to fine immigrants who speak a foreign language at the doctors .
A school in Amsterdam fines parents , if their children speak foreign languages with a certain radius of the school .
Other recurrent themes are bans on Islamic headscarves or burqas , and boot camps for immigrant youth ( now backed by the cabinet ) .
It 's minority - bashing , but that 's democracy .
It is also democracy , when elected representatives seriously propose forced abortions and forced sterilisation for Antillian teenage girls .
That proposal came from Pim Fortuyn 's local party , Leefbaar Rotterdam , which won a landslide victory in 2002 .
They lost support in the 2006 municipal elections , but they never withdrew the proposal , and they still got 30 % of the votes .
If a national majority of voters back such proposals , then democracy means implementation .
( Human rights law wo n't stop it : the proposal is legally based on the ' rights of the child ' , since black teenage mothers are pre-supposed to batter their children ) .
The British trade union leader Bill Morris once complained of " a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers " .
That certainly describes politics in the Netherlands , but then democracy is meant to be a ' bidding war ' .
Political science defines modern democracy , as the allocation of political power through open competitive elections , under multi-party political pluralism .
The parties that best bid for voter support are elected , and consequently the government broadly reflects the will of the people .
Since the ' will of the Netherlands people ' is that the Netherlands is reserved for themselves , and since they are still the majority , the inevitable consequence of democracy is the expulsion of the immigrants .
Several years ago the Balkenende cabinet seriously considered compulsory genital inspections for Somali girls .
The proposal was ultimately toned down , to ' more intensive supervision by school doctors ' .
But the Somalis got the message : thousands moved to the UK .
Return migration has started among second - generation Turks as well .
Immigration is not a given , and it is not an inevitable consequence of globalisation .
The Netherlands has shown that if a government is nasty enough , immigrant minorities can be pressured out .
A western democracy can stop , and then reverse , the flow of immigrants : the Netherlands now has net emigration .
The Netherlanders see the democratic process as a defensive instrument against the allochtones , and they are increasingly , if vaguely , aware , that it might be effective in removing them .
A drastic reduction in the number of allochtones , and a de facto return to the ethnic composition of the 1950's , are a real possibility in the Netherlands .
That scenario could be repeated all over Europe , unless there is a drastic re-evaluation - and ultimately abandonment - of the liberal - democratic nation state .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Tata Motors Ltd TAMO .
BOTTM.N , India 's top vehicle maker , said on Monday it had completed the $ 2.3 billion acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover , adding the luxury brands to a line - up that also includes the low - cost Nano .

The all - cash deal , which was agreed in March , includes all necessary intellectual property rights , manufacturing plants , two advanced design centers in the UK and a worldwide network of sales companies , Tata Motors said in a statement .
The brands were bought from Ford Motor Co F.N , which has contributed about $ 600 million to the Jaguar and Land Rover pension plans , and long - term agreements have been entered into for the supply of engines , stampings and other components .
“ Jaguar and Land Rover are two iconic British brands ( and ) will retain their distinctive identities and continue to pursue their respective business plans as before , ” Chairman Ratan Tata said in the statement .
“ We recognize the significant improvement in the performance of the two brands and look forward to this trend continuing in the coming years . ”
David Smith , the acting chief executive of Jaguar and Land Rover , will be the new chief executive .
Tata Motors last week said it would raise up to $ 1.7 billion from three rights issues to help fund the acquisition .
On completion of these issues , it would also raise a further $ 500 - $ 600 million from an overseas equity issues .
The company is scheduled to start selling the Nano , the world ’s cheapest car priced at just above $ 2,500 , in India later this year .
TRANSITION SUPPORT
Other areas of transition support from Ford include IT , accounting and access to test facilities .
The companies will also cooperate in areas such as design and development through sharing of platforms and joint development of hybrid technologies and powertrain engineering , Tata Motors said .
The Ford Motor Credit Company will continue to provide financing for Jaguar Land Rover dealers and customers for a period , and Tata Motors said it was in advanced negotiations with auto finance providers in the UK , Europe and the United States .
Tata Motors , India ’s top bus and truck maker and No. 3 car maker , has sought to expand its presence in the global markets through alliances and acquisitions in recent years .
It bought South Korea ’s Daewoo Commercial Vehicles in 2004 , and has a minority stake in Spanish bus maker Hispano Carrocera .
It also has ventures with Thailand 's Thonburi for pick - up trucks , and with Italy 's Fiat FIA .
MI for manufacturing , distribution and technology , as it gears up for tougher competition at home .

Q : At the age of 82 , you will be publishing your new collection of essays this week , which seems likely to confirm your reputation as one of America ’s last public intellectuals .
Why do you think that critics have traditionally praised your essays more than your fiction , which includes “ Burr , ” “ Myra Breckinridge ” and 20 other novels ?
That ’s because they do n’t know how to read .
I ca n’t name three first - rate literary critics in the United States .
I ’m told there are a few hidden away at universities , but they do n’t print them in The New York Times .
Are you saying your novels have been critically neglected ?
I do n’t even read most reviews , unless there is a potential lawsuit on view .
I ’ve never had much attention paid by critics  nor has anybody else in the United States of America , as Mr. Obama likes to call it .
And what about Mr. McCain ?
Disaster .
Who started this rumor that he was a war hero ?
Where does that come from , aside from himself ?
About his suffering in the prison war camp ?
Everyone knows he was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam .
That ’s what he tells us .
Why would you doubt him ?
He ’s a graduate of Annapolis .
I know a lot of the Annapolis breed .
Remember , I ’m West Point , where I was born .
My father went there .
Letter to the Editor , Miami Herald —
Some might think that the Miami Herald and other corporate media outlets are completely ignorant of the importance of preserving the U.S. Constitution .
The duty of Congress to impeach is mentioned six times in this awesome document .
The Herald once again ignored what should have been a major news story .
Yesterday , 7/10 , Cong .
Dennis Kucinich introduced an article of impeachment against President George W. Bush on the floor of the House of Representatives .
The Article charged Bush with misleading Congress into authorizing the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Also ignored by the Herald , NBC News and other media outlets was the fact that House Speaker Nancy “ Impeachment is off the Table ” Pelosi on 7/10 told the media that she expected the Judiciary Committee to consider the matter this time by way of impeachment hearings .
Public perception is that it is too late to impeach .
It is never too late for Congress to learn the facts of how we were led into a totally unnecessary war which caused the slaughter and maiming of our proud servicemen and women and of countless Iraqis .
Airing these facts in hearings will ensure that future presidents and vice presidents will not be able to defile our Constitution , which President Bush referred to as a ” g_dd _ _ ned piece of paper . ”
This utterance was made in November of 2005 in the presence of fellow Republicans , but again , underreported by corporate media .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union on Wednesday condemned the resumption of judicial executions in the United States and said abolishing capital punishment was fundamental to protecting human dignity and furthering human rights .
The U.S. state of Georgia executed convicted murderer William Earl Lynd on May 6 , the first person to be put to death in the United States since the Supreme Court ended a de facto moratorium on capital punishment last month .
EU president Slovenia said it had unsuccessfully appealed for the United States to stop Lynd ’s execution .
He was convicted of shooting his girlfriend to death in December 1988 .
The death penalty does not exist in member states of the 27 - nation EU , and no new country can join up without scrapping it .
Some European parliamentarians have asked the EU presidency to push harder for its abolition elsewhere .
Expressing regret at Lynd ’s execution , a presidency statement said : “ We believe that the elimination of the death penalty is fundamental to the protection of human dignity , and to the progressive development of human rights . ”
“ Any miscarriage or failure of justice in the application of the death penalty represents an irreparable and irreversible loss of human life , ” it said .
The moratorium , which had been in effect since shortly after September 25 , ended on April 16 when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the use of lethal injection for capital punishment was permitted by the Constitution .

Factory activity contracted at a slower rate in March
Activity in US factories contracted for the second month running in March , but the figure was still better than economists had been expecting .
The Institute for Supply Management 's ( ISM ) factory activity index rose to 48.6 from February 's 48.3 .
A reading below 50 indicates shrinking output .
February 's report recorded the weakest manufacturing activity for five years .
The report 's inflation data showed that US prices are rising at the fastest rate in 3 years .
Economist says that despite a slight improvement in March , the data still shows that US industry is in a slump .
" The fact that the headline index did n't fall and picked up slightly is slightly misleading , " said Richard Iley at BNP Paribas in New York .
" It is still indicating a very soft manufacturing sector that is likely in recession . "
Falling car sales
In another sign of weak factory activity , Ford said its sales in the US in March fell by 14 % compared with the same month in 2007 .
The auto giant blamed a " turbulent economy " for the decline and said it would continue to focus on its reorganisation plan aimed at making it profitable at lower volumes .
Sales of Ford 's market - leading F - Series pickup trucks were down almost 24 % .
The overall figures included sales by Jaguar and Land Rover , which were sold to India 's Tata Motors during the month .

Because Barack Obama supports the recent Supreme Court ruling that suspected terrorism detainees have a right to challenge their detention , McCain campaign advisor Randy Scheunemann accused him of possessing , “ the prefect September 10 mindset . ”
For all of you , who had June 17 in the pool as the date when McCain would invoke 9/11 consider yourself a winner .
During an interview with ABC News yesterday Obama said , “ What we know is that , in previous terrorist attacks — for example , the first attack against the World Trade Center , we were able to arrest those responsible , put them on trial .
They are currently in U.S. prisons , incapacitated .
And the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial , but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world , and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say , ‘ Look , this is how the United States treats Muslims . ' ”
Apparently invoking the rule of law makes Obama a threat to American security , “ Barack Obama ’s belief that we should treat terrorists as nothing more than common criminals demonstrates a stunning and alarming misunderstanding of the threat we face from radical Islamic extremism .
Obama holds up the prosecution of the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993 as a model for his administration , when in fact this failed approach of treating terrorism simply as a matter of law enforcement rather than a clear and present danger to the United States contributed to the tragedy of September 11th .
This is change that will take us back to the failed policies of the past and every American should find this mindset troubling , ” McCain campaign Foreign Policy Advisor Randy Scheunemann said today .

Ask yourself , how did the handling of the first World Trade Center bombing lead to 9/11 ?
The answer is that it did n’t .
The mistake after the first World Trade Center bombing was that the U.S. settled for the low level al - Qaeda people who carried out the attack , instead of pursuing the strategic masterminds of the attack and Osama Bin Laden .
If the government would have detained instead of tried the first WTC bombing defendants , it would not have prevented the second attack .
This just more flawed Bushian logic that is designed to rape the Constitution , and before anyone argues that the Constitution does not apply , in this situation , I would stress that this same principle of presidential power that Bush advanced and McCain wants to continue was the basis for the secret domestic spying program .
Only a fool would believe that John McCain , a man who wants to continue all of Bush ’s policies , would protect our civil liberties .
The rule of law must apply in all situations , and if we truly want to provide a Democratic example for the Muslim world , then we need to first respect our own laws .
McCain Camp Statement
Mathematics is used in interesting , and often less than accurate , ways .
Newspapers present graphs showing apparently correlated variables , but with a little thought , some of the time you will find that whilst it looks like two variables are connected , there is actually no cause and effect .
Sometimes this is because there is a third factor causing the movements in the variables — for example , if it is hot and sunny , sales of sunscreen lotion increase , as do sales of air - conditioners .
If you plot these sales against each other , you find a correlation .
However , they are only connected because of a third variable , the summer weather .
Of course , an unscrupulous media can draw connections where they do n't exist for more political ends , such as blaming an increase in crime on the sales of hooded sweatshirts .
And politicians have been known to confuse cause and effect , thinking that a local crime increase is due to the increased police presence , rather than the other way around .
Whilst it is interesting to examine these graphs in order to find out the true cause of the correlation , sometimes there just is n't an underlying factor .
I recently saw in a UK newspaper a chart relating the behaviour of the NASDAQ technology index in the 8 years prior to the dot - com bubble burst of 2000 , to the price of crude oil over the last 8 years .
And whilst the article was careful to point out that the two indices are unrelated — the point of the article being that markets tend to overprice things — at first glance you would suspect that oil prices are due for a crash .
The problem is that not only does the graph present different time periods and so different market conditions , but oil prices and technology stocks are completely unrelated .
You could never use the NASDAQ to predict oil prices — we all need energy , but we do n't all need technology shares .
They may look similar , but there is no cause and effect .
Whilst there may be some hidden time and consumer behaviour variables that have affected both prices , the trend is largely coincidental .
So , I thought to myself , what else could we plot against oil price ?
I tried to think of the most unconnected statistic I could .
Let 's examine the Australian Cricket Team 's
Test winning percentage — that is , its percentage of wins in the previous 40 games — between 1982 and 2004 .
As before , we have different time periods and unconnected variables :
The fortunes of the Australian cricket team to blame ?
As you can see , the correlation is remarkable , even down to small rises and falls .
So , when you fill up this week and notice the latest price rise , you can stop blaming OPEC and strife in the Middle East , and start blaming Allan Border , Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh for improving the results of the Australian Test Cricket Team !
By the way , the data are completely real — make this graph for yourself at Cricinfo and Oil and Gas Confidential .
Longtime GOP operative nabbed for soliciting prostitute
A St. Paul , Minn. , police sting operation targeting prostitutes and their customers has resulted in the arrest of a " longtime Republican operative , " according to sources .
The Star Tribune reports that Peter Hong was arrested Wednesday for soliciting a prostitute during a two - day sting which netted thirty - five other arrests , per a police spokesperson .
" Hong has been in and out of the Republican side of Minnesota politics since the mid-1990s , " write Anthony Lonetree and Patricia Lopez for the Star Tribune , " when he surfaced as a genial bulldog campaign press secretary for former Sen.
Rod Grams , R - Minn .
" He served as a spokesman for Gov. Tim Pawlenty 's campaign in 2002 and for the Bush - Cheney campaign in Minnesota in 2004 , " the report continues .
" Most recently , Hong was a point person for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , " though the paper notes that according to a spokesperson for the Minnesota GOP , he is not currently working for any state candidate .
Hong had no comment when reached by phone , the paper says .
Pioneer Press reports that Hong is now self - employed and " ' Always Searching for the Next Big Thing ! ' according to his profile on the business - networking Web site LinkedIn . "
Chinese troops have been seen on the streets of Zimbabwe 's third largest city , Mutare , according to local witnesses .
They were seen patrolling with Zimbabwean soldiers before and during Tuesday 's ill - fated general strike called by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Earlier , 10 Chinese soldiers armed with pistols checked in at the city 's Holiday Inn along with 70 Zimbabwean troops .
One eyewitness , who asked not to be named , said : " We 've never seen Chinese soldiers in full regalia on our streets before .
The entire delegation took 80 rooms from the hotel , 10 for the Chinese and 70 for Zimbabwean soldiers . "

Officially , the Chinese were visiting strategic locations such as border posts , key companies and state institutions , he said .
But it is unclear why they were patrolling at such a sensitive time .
They were supposed to stay five days , but left after three to travel to Masvingo , in the south .
China 's support for President Mugabe 's regime has been highlighted by the arrival in South Africa of a ship carrying a large cache of weapons destined for Zimbabwe 's armed forces .
Dock workers in Durban refused to unload it .
The 300,000 - strong South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( Satawu ) said it would be " grossly irresponsible " to touch the cargo of ammunition , grenades and mortar rounds on board the Chinese ship An Yue Jiang anchored outside the port .
A Satawu spokesman Randall Howard said : " Our members employed at Durban container terminal will not unload this cargo , neither will any of our members in the truck - driving sector move this cargo by road .
South Africa cannot be seen to be facilitating the flow of weapons into Zimbabwe at a time where there is a political dispute and a volatile situation between Zanu - PF and the MDC . "
Three million rounds of AK - 47 ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and more than 3,000 mortar rounds and mortar tubes are among the cargo on the Chinese ship , according to copies of the inventory published by a South African newspaper .
According to Beeld , the documentation for the shipment was completed on 1 April , three days after the presidential vote .
Zimbabwe and China have close military ties .
Three years ago , Mr Mugabe signed extensive trade pacts with the Chinese as part of the " Look East " policy forced on him by his ostracising by Western governments over human rights abuses .
The deal gave the Chinese mineral and trade concessions in exchange for economic help .
The shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague called on David Miliband to demand a cessation of arms shipments .
A South African government spokesman Themba Maseko said it would be difficult to stop the shipment .
Solar Power Goes to Extremes for 5 Cents per kWh
May 10th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Xtreme Concentrated Solar Power : if a magnifying glass is like lightning to ants , this would be their atomic bomb .
We already know that concentrated solar power ( CSP ) is shaking things up in the solar industry .
A subset within the industry is turning up the heat .
“ Extreme ” Concentrated solar magnifies intense sunlight onto a solar cell , at temperatures that could melt it , to boost efficiency for less money .
The holy grail of renewable energy is not just efficiency but competitive pricing .
Most consumers do n’t want to wait 5 - 10 + years to earn back their investment in energy savings , assuming that they can afford solar .
Never mind the added value of generating some of your own energy .
Utility - scale facilities hinge not only on cost , but infrastructure .
If you build your solar / wind farm in the desert , transmission lines may not come out to meet you .
So when someone claims to have a cheap , efficient solar technology , people pay attention .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
Extreme Concentrated Solar stands out because it claims to be affordable and very efficient .
Unlike solar - thermal ( CSP ) , which utilizes the heat of the sun , this technology still converts light into power ( photo voltaic ) .
So many solar companies have attempted to reduce cost by rising to industrial scale , but this method takes the opposite approach .
XCPV ( extreme concentrated photo voltaic ) uses very small solar panels combined into a module design , and modules are infinitely scalable .
The most recent announcement comes from Sunrgi , which claims its XCPV system will “ produce electricity at a wholesale cost of 5 - cents per kWh ” ( via news release ) .
Their system magnifies sunlight 2,000 times at over 3,000 degree Fahrenheit onto a small , top - of - the - line solar panel , which dramatically boosts the amount of energy the panel can produce .
Since the system is in a module , it can be as big or small as you want .
The modules also track the sun throughout the day to maximize power output , and they ’re upgradable .
That means if better solar panels hit the market in the future ( or if theirs do get fried after all ) , you can switch them out .
Another feature Sunrgi claims is an impressive efficiency rating of 37.5 % .
For the uninitiated , that might not sound like much , but consider that the world record in February , 2008 was 31.25 % using CSP – on an unusually sunny day .
But the whole system hinges on its cooling mechanism , described only as nanotech “ goop ” , to prevent the solar panels from melting .
And that technology is still “ proprietary ” .
In other words , they have n’t actually made commercial product yet .
Before you let your hopes dash to the wind ( another future technology ! ? ) , let me set you at ease .
Sunrgi hopes to bring their product to market in about a year , so we ’re not talking about pipe dreams .
These guys are serious , and they ’re out to make some money at 5 cents / kwh .
But fortunately for us all , this technology is not new , and Sunrgi is not the first to point a magnifying glass at a solar panel .
The Aussies beat us to it .
It started out as the Sunball in 2005 , but soon evolved into the Suncube .
The Suncube also concentrates solar energy with an efficiency rating over 30 % .
It ’s a modular system that tracks the sun and appears less bulky than the Sunrgi system .
The system comes to us from Green and Gold Energy of Adelaide , Australia , but before I provide the link , let me disclaim .
Apparently , if you believe the word on the street , the website is the personal baby of GG&E ’s founder .
He ’s very proud of his GG&E site .
More important is the product : not only is GG&E producing XCVP modules around the world , but they ’ve already signed a deal with Emcore , who will provide concentrated solar cells with 20 year warranties .
Partner groups ES Systems in Korea just secured $ 28 millions dollars more worth of Emcore solar cells .
More importantly , GG&E is building a manufacturing facility , and their product is already on the market .
So the exciting thing about Extreme Concentrated Photo Voltaics is the combination of high efficiency with low price .
By magnifying the power of the sun , these companies are pushing the envelope at a time when energy prices are high .
But these ventures are not without risk .
Inadequate cooling of of the solar cells could result in decreased performance or melting .
There ’s also hurdles facing solar energy ; the least of which is investing in manufacturing infrastructure , and transporting product .
But the magic number here is 5 cents / kwh .
Mike Chino of Inhabitat.com notes :
“ Craig Goodman , president of the National Energy marketers Association , has stated that “ Solar power at 5 cents per kWh would be a world - changing breakthrough .
It would make solar generation of electricity as affordable as generation from coal , natural gas , or other non-renewable sources , without require and subsidy . ” ”

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
By
I lent out my first $ 25 to a stranger on Prosper nearly 8 years ago , in October 2007 .
Since then , the peer - to - peer ( P2P ) lending environment has undergone a variety of changes .
I ’ve made hundreds of P2P loans both hand - picked and algorithm - driven , sold them on the secondary market , and experienced the effect of defaults on my returns .
I ’ve written several posts along the way , but here is my condensed ( but still detailed ) overview .
Many of the other Prosper reviews tend to focus on the positives .
While Prosper certainly has potential , I ’d rather go deeper into the possible risks to an investor ’s hard - earned money .
The attraction : Be the bank .
Earn high interest rates .
We ’ve all seen the big banks charge mountains of interest , while us regular folks pay it .
The average interest rate on credit card loans remains around 15 % APR .
The basic model for P2P loans is that anyone can become that bank and invest in loans to other individuals .
Prosper will take a little cut for helping out , but the bulk of the interest ( and risk ) goes to the investor .
The reality : Higher net returns than other alternatives , but the risks hide in the details .
Detail # 1 : Significant loan defaults occur over time .
The good news now that P2P loans have been around for a while is that you have more historical performance numbers to consider .
Prosper lets you see this historical data in great detail , but you have to look carefully .
Here ’s a snapshot of what you ’d see now at Prosper.com / Invest , labeled “ Seasoned Returns * ” .
Here ’s what that asterisk means :
* Seasoned Return calculations represent historical performance data for the Borrower Payment Dependent Notes ( “ Notes ” ) issued and sold by Prosper since July 15 , 2009 .
To be included in the calculations , Notes must be associated with a borrower loan originated more than 10 months ago ; this calculation uses loans originated through May 31 , 2012 .
Our research shows that Prosper Note returns historically have shown increased stability after they ’ve reached ten months of age .
For that reason , we provide “ Seasoned Returns ” , defined as the Return for Notes aged 10 months or more .
The initial interest rate on your notes is only a theoretical maximum return .
For example , for the last quarter of 2015 , the average interest rate was 11.06 % for 36 - months 15.47 % for 60 - month loans .
Every time a borrower defaults – and trust me , if you buy any meaningful amount of notes , some will default on you – your return will go down .
With loans as little as 10 months old , their quoted “ increased ” stability is not the same as stability .
Here ’s a chart from competitor LendingClub showing how net annualized return has decreased with loan age ( for different vintages of past loans ) .
Note that the net return numbers still keep going down after 10 months .
If anything , I would prefer to use this alternative table provided by Prosper .
These estimated net numbers are more realistic .
The table also includes a daily snapshot of their current inventory , which may give you an idea of relative availability by rating .
Note that there are much fewer of the highest - risk , highest - expected return loans available .
Finally , do n’t forget that not everyone gets the average .
You ca n’t buy a “ Prosper index fund ” .
You may be above average , but be prepared for below - average returns as well .
Detail # 2 : Liquidity concerns .
When you buy traditional mutual fund that holds investment - grade bonds , with just a few clicks , you can sell that investment on any given trading day .
You will get a fair market price , and you will find a buyer for all of your shares .
If you invest in a Prosper note and you need to cash out before maturity , you will have to sell on the secondary market .
Now , if you have pristine loans with a perfect payment history , today you ’ll probably be able to sell your notes at near or even slightly above face value .
But here are the possible haircuts :
First , you will have to pay a transaction fee of 1 % of face value on all sales .
Second , if you have loans that have ever been late or has a borrower whose credit score has decreased since loan origination ( they track that ) , you will have a harder time finding a buyer and the price will probably be lower than face value .
Finally , for Prosper if your loan is currently late , you ca n’t sell it on the secondary market for any price .
You ca n’t even offload it for a penny .
In my experience , I liquidated ~ 85 % of my loans at about a 0 % net haircut , ~ 10 % were sold at a slight loss due to their imperfect history , and ~5 % could not be sold at all .
While this is certainly better than having no liquidity at all ( like a lot of real - estate crowdfunded debt ) , it also takes a few hours of work at least to maximize your selling prices on 100 or 200 loans .
All of these haircuts taken together can take a significant hit against your total returns .
Also , just because you have buyers today does n’t mean there will be buyers tomorrow .
Therefore , I would not invest if you do n’t expect to hold the loan until maturity .
Some people try to arbitrage things by buying notes and selling them quickly on the secondary market to residents of states that can only buy notes on the secondary market .
Detail # 3 . Diversification is critical .
A defaulted loan wipes out both principal and interest , resulting in a big hit on your overall return .
Therefore , your best bet is to never put any more than the $ 25 minimum into any one note .
Remember this statistic : For Notes purchased since July 2009 , every Prosper investor with 100 or more Notes has experienced positive returns .
In other words , no investor has lost money overall if they held at least 100 notes !
100 times $ 25 = $ 2,500 which I think is the minimum you should invest with .
Detail # 4 . Taxes .
P2P notes are a somewhat different animal , and at year - end you ’ll receive some tax forms that will be unfamiliar to most people .
These may include :
1099 - OID
1099 - B ( Recoveries for Charge - offs )
1099 - B ( Folio secondary market )
1099 - MISC
If you file your income taxes yourself , it is not impossible to figure out but it will take some extra research and effort .
Here is my Prosper tax guide that offers some guidance .
If you pay a tax professional , they may charge extra for the added complication .
For the most part , the interest you receive will be taxed as ordinary income , the same rate as interest from bank savings accounts .
This can be quite high depending on your income , so you may want to consider holding your Prosper notes inside a tax - sheltered IRA .
Looking back , I wish I put my Prosper notes inside an IRA .
Detail # 5 . Automatic investing .
The days of hand - picking loans are pretty much over .
I recommend using the Quick Invest feature that Prosper offers in order to automatically filter through and buy the notes that fit your criteria .
Loan supply is often limited , and this way you can actually get those loans before someone else buys them .
You can let Prosper pick the loans for you , or you can spend your time looking for “ better ” filters .
There are some free tools out there that help sift through the past performance data .
There are even paid services out there that do this for you , but I am uncertain how the cost / benefit would shake out .
Detail # 6 .
Past performance vs. future possibilities .
Although past returns are great , another economic recession may have a severe impact on your future loan returns .
In the end , these are unsecured loans like credit card debt .
If people lose their jobs , they will stop paying .
Just because nobody has lost money in the past with 100 + loans , that does n’t guarantee that you wo n’t lose money in the future .
Unlikely does not mean impossible .
Traditionally , high - quality bonds are a diversifier to stocks .
But Prosper notes are more like low - quality bonds .
If the economy tanks , defaults will rise and your returns will drop .
But if the economy tanks , your stocks will drop too .
Are you ready for both to suffer significant drops during times of financial stress ?
Detail # 7 .
What if Prosper goes bankrupt ?
As a company , Prosper Marketplace Inc. ( PMI ) has historically had a hard time actually making a steady profit themselves .
In 2013 , Prosper started structuring their notes so that they are held in a new legal entity called Prosper Funding LLC ( PFL ) .
This remote entity is designed to stand alone and be protected from any creditor claims in the event that Prosper Marketplace , Inc. goes bankrupt .
PFL can keep on running and servicing loans .
This is a good move in my opinion , but it is still unknown how well this legal strategy will work , or if future lawsuits can put the assets of PFL at risk .
In other words , do n’t put all your eggs in one basket .
Due to # 6 and # 7 , Prosper notes should only be a portion of your fixed income assets .
Summary .
P2P loans are becoming a legitimate asset class , gathering billions of dollars from Wall Street and other institutional investors .
Interest rates remain low , and thus the high yields and competitive past returns from these Prosper notes are still very attractive .
Let ’s face it , even a tempered expectation of 8 % net annual return is hard to ignore !
But before you make the jump , make sure you fully understand the risks and how to best mitigate them .
Understand that your final returns will be significantly less than your starting yield .
Look at historical numbers for guidance .
Do n’t invest money you will need before the loan ends ( 3 - 5 years ) .
Diversify across as many loans a possible ( 100 + notes ) .
P2P notes should only be a portion of your fixed income assets .
Expect to spend extra time to acquire notes and prepare taxes .
Consider holding notes inside a tax - sheltered IRA .
I hope that this information helps you decide whether investing in Prosper loans is right for you .
The US military for the immediate future continues to face daunting arithmetic : continued war , and too few warriors to go around .
Shorter tours in Iraq could help .
President Bush 's announcement Thursday that he is reducing Army combat deployments from 15 to 12 months for troops sent overseas later this year is aimed at reducing stress on soldiers and their families .
But 140,000 US troops will remain in Iraq at least through September , per the recommendation of top commander Gen. David Petraeus .
Many military experts believe that stabilizing the situation there could require a substantial US presence for years to come .
The bottom line : Many ground units have deployed multiple times to Iraq , and " people are tired , " according to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.
Michael Mullen .
Army leaders say the readiness of their brigades is down , their equipment is worn , and their ability to respond to any new contingency is questionable .
" We face a large and growing gap between our military commitments and our military capabilities .
Something has to give , " Andrew Bacevich , a West Point graduate and professor of international relations at Boston University , said in a Senate hearing Wednesday .
By most accountings Iraq is now the third - longest conflict in US history , shorter only than Vietnam and the Revolutionary War .
More than 500,000 US troops have served in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
Almost 200,000 have been deployed there more than once .
In public appearances this spring , Army leaders have been blunt about the effects of this pace on their soldiers .
In a recent speech Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey , for instance , said that his service " is not a hollow or broken force " but that there is no question it is " stretched and stressed . "
By the Army 's count , it has conducted five surges into Iraq , including the most recent addition of extra brigade combat teams to tamp down Baghdad violence .
The current surge " took all the stroke out of the shock absorber for the US Army , " Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Richard Cody told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week .
He meant that if a conflict breaks out anywhere else in the world , there are no fully ready Army units that could be sent to handle it .
Army leaders are quick to say that morale remains high .
But there are multiple signs of the emerging effect of this pace on the nature of the all - volunteer force .
Captains – crucial midlevel managers of the Army – are choosing to leave at a substantial rate .
The percentage of recruits who enter the Army with waivers because of past misconduct has more than doubled since 2004 , to 13 percent so far this year .
In 2001 , 91 percent of Army recruits were high school graduates .
Last year that figure fell to 79 percent .
With only 12 months at home between tours , active Army units do not have time to do much else but rest and gather themselves for their return to Iraq .
" Our Army is out of balance , " said General Cody .
The Army 's long - term plan to restore balance includes increasing in size by 74,000 troops .
That has been approved by the Bush administration , but construction of new units – not to mention recruiting the extra personnel in a time of war – takes time , and the target date for the expansion is 2011 .
Meanwhile , the strategy for Iraq , per General Petraeus , involves no further drawdowns after July .
After that , force reductions would await an improvement in conditions – or a different political situation in the United States .
To some experts , Cody 's statements about the stresses in the force are a direct comment on Petraeus and the current course in Iraq .
" [ The Army 's ] complaints are significant – they show a rift is developing within the military over the current strategy , " says Loren Thompson , a military expert and chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Arlington , Va .
To others , they may represent the expectations of the Army 's leadership that it can operate in a time of conflict as it typically has in peacetime .
Today 's Army is far smaller than it was in , say , Vietnam .
The fighting in Iraq understandably has strained it , says William Martel , author of the recent book " Victory in War " and an associate professor of international security studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford , Mass .
" But in a war military , you have to cut corners to meet objectives , " he says .
Mr. Bush 's announcement that he is cutting the length of new tours in Iraq is a minor adjustment , adds Professor Martel , but also a welcome one .
It is intended to signal the military leadership that the Oval Office is at least listening to their deployment concerns , and to show troops that something is being done to ease their burdens .
" Progress comes in small doses , " says Martel .
A slew of software companies new and old are shipping tools aimed at slowing the botnet epidemic , but the emergence of this new market is seen by some analysts as an indictment of the existing anti-malware industry .
With reliable statistics showing a dramatic rise in botnet - related computer infections , venture capitalists are now pouring money into startups with technology promising to find and eradicate backdoor Trojans , keystroke loggers and stealth rootkits .
The latest company to cash in is NovaShield , a nine - employee company working on a specification - based monitoring product capable of identifying malicious botnet - related activities in real - time .
The company has raised $ 5 million in two rounds of financing , including a small business innovation research grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation .
" These are new threats with new types of opportunities [ for technology companies ] , " said Somesh Jha , co-founder and chief scientist at NovaShield .
" My view is you can't use old , signature - based technology to protect against malware associated with botnets .
You have to look ahead a bit , focus on finding ways to stop botnet communications . "
Botnets - broadband - enabled PCs hijacked and seeded with software that connects to a server to receive communications from a remote attacker - have emerged as the key hub for well - organized global crime rings .
The bandwidth stolen from these compromised computers - called drones or zombies - is used to steal money via spam , denial - of - service attacks and other nefarious Internet activities .
NovaShield 's technology , now in beta , will be sold to consumers and licensed to businesses .
It will work alongside existing anti-virus and anti-malware defenses , providing another layer of desktop and network security .
Other companies cashing in on what is widely viewed as a gap in traditional anti-malware coverage include : Damballa , a venture - backed company with roots at the Georgia Institute of Technology ; FireEye , a startup funded by Sequoia Capital ; Sana Security , which sells behavioral security software ; and PC Tools software .
Several big -name anti-virus players , including Symantec and Trend Micro have already shipped standalone anti-botnet utilities , suggesting that Trojans and other botnet - related software should be treated as a separate product category .
This does not sit well with Andrew Jaquith , an analyst with The Yankee Group .
" It 's not a good thing that security products are failing and not catching all the threats .
The fact that there 's a perceived market need [ for anti-botnet protection ] is an indictment of anti-virus companies in general , " Jaquith said .
" It reminds me of the spyware market , " he added , noting that several companies marketed anti-spyware tools on top of anti-virus subscriptions .
" It 's a classic cycle , " said Jose Nazario , a botnet tracker and a senior software engineer at Arbor Networks .
" It 's spyware all over again .
New gaps emerge and new products and companies emerge . "
Indian farmers have come up with what they think is the real thing to keep crops free of bugs .
Instead of paying hefty fees to international chemical companies for patented pesticides , they are reportedly spraying their cotton and chilli fields with Coca - Cola .
In the past month there have been reports of hundreds of farmers turning to Coke in Andhra Pradesh and Chattisgarh states .
But as word gets out that soft drinks may be bad for bugs and a lot cheaper than anything that Messrs Monsanto , Shell and Dow can offer , thousands of others are expected to switch .
Gotu Laxmaiah , a farmer from Ramakrishnapuram in Andra Pradesh , said he was delighted with his new cola spray , which he applied this year to several hectares of cotton .
" I observed that the pests began to die after the soft drink was sprayed on my cotton , " he told the Deccan Herald newspaper .
Coca - Cola has had a bad year in India .
Other farmers in Andra Pradesh state accused the company of over - extracting underground water for its bottling plants and a government committee upheld findings that drinks made in India by itself and PepsiCo contained unacceptable amounts of pesticide residue .
But Mr Laxmaiah and others say their cola sprays are invaluable because they are safe to handle , do not need to be diluted and , mainly , are cheap .
One litre of highly concentrated Avant , Tracer and Nuvocron , three popular Indian pesticides , costs around 10,000 rupees ( £ 120 ) , but one - and - a - half litres of locally made Coca - Cola is 30 rupees .
To spray an acre would be a mere 270 rupees .
It is clearly not Coke 's legendary " secret " ingredient that is upsetting the bugs .
The farmers also swear by Pepsi , Thums Up , and other local soft drinks .
The main ingredients of all colas are water and sugar but some manufacturers add citric and phosphoric acids to give that extra bite to human taste buds .
Yesterday a leading Indian agriculture analyst , Devinder Sharma , said : " I think Coke has found its right use .
Farmers have traditionally used sugary solutions to attract red ants to feed on insect larvae .
" I think the colas are also performing the same role . "
The properties of Coke have been discussed for years .
It has been reported that it is a fine lavatory cleaner , a good windscreen wipe and an efficient rust spot remover .
Uncorroborated reports from China claimed that the ill - fated New Coke was widely used in China as a spermicide .
Yesterday a spokesman for Coca - Cola in Atlanta said : " We are aware of one isolated case where a farmer may have used a soft drink as part of his crop management routine .
" Soft drinks do not act in a similar way to pesticides when applied to the ground or crops .
There is no scientific basis for this and the use of soft drinks for this purpose would be totally ineffective " .
It was a raw , windswept afternoon when Hillary Clinton appeared on what would have to pass for a stage .
There were no warm - up chants , no triumphalist campaign songs , no celebrity supporters , just five local women awkwardly flapping blue Hillary signs .
The audience at this Indian reservation - about 200 counting 14 students on a class trip from Massachusetts and their teacher , who said they were all Barack Obama supporters - was so small Clinton did not even attempt the politician 's hoax of pointing to faces in fake delight .
This is what it looks like for Clinton at the end , the last gasps of a dying presidential campaign .
When she launched her campaign in January last year , she cast herself as the inevitable Democratic nominee .
" I 'm in it to win it , " she said .
Now Obama looks like the inevitable candidate .
Clinton 's chances of a miracle recovery evaporated on Saturday when the Democratic party decided to recognise primaries in Michigan and Florida , but halve their voting power at the party 's nominating convention .
Clinton has three more events in South Dakota today before her campaign splutters to a final stop .
Obama is expected to carry South Dakota as well as Montana when the two states hold the final contests of this primary season tomorrow .
A lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the Democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215 m ( £ 108 m ) in campaign funds , all now are exhausted .
So too was Clinton .
Her face as she took the stage at the Pine Ridge reservation was drained of colour .
People took pictures anyway .
Those old enough to remember are still talking about the late Robert F Kennedy 's visit to this remote outpost during the 1968 campaign .
They were already talking about Clinton 's campaign in the same way : history .
" I 'm just curious to see her in person , " said Beverly Tuttle , a grandmother from nearby Porcupine .
That was as far as it went .
Tuttle was voting for Obama .
" I 'm looking at her more like a celebrity than candidate , " she said .
Clinton still has ardent supporters , even in a remote location such as Kyle ( population 1,000 ) .
They just have been swifter than she has in recognising defeat .
" She should be vice - president , " said Tangerine LeBeau , who is just 18 and will be voting for the very first time .
If Clinton was disappointed at the small size of the crowd after a two - hour drive across the South Dakota Badlands , she barely let on .
Each day , even in this terminal stage , brings a full schedule of campaigning for all three Clintons : Bill , Hillary and Chelsea .
Campaign staff produce policy memos and instant reactions to statements from John McCain , the Republican candidate .
Emails go out to supporters asking for funds .
The activity is highly unlikely to prolong the life of her presidential campaign , but Clinton seems determined to go down fighting for every last vote .
In South Dakota , where native Americans make up nearly 9 % of the population , she adapted her standard stump speech to promise more funding for government programmes and a higher profile for the official dealing with Native American issues .
Under a Clinton White House , she said , the reservation , one of the poorest areas of the country , could become the " Saudi Arabia of wind power " .
And Clinton showed no sign of letting go of the idea that she could still win the nomination .
Her smile ever widening , she took audiences through a surreal mathematical discourse on how she could conceivably still emerge as the Democratic nominee at the party 's convention in August .
" Since February 20 I have won more contests , won more votes , won more delegates , " she told a rally in Rapid City last week .
But , of course , Clinton has already all but lost , and the crowd knew it .
" Realistically , it 's not going to happen .
The numbers are n't there , " said Richard Stalder , a mental health worker .
" It 's important for me that she is strong , that she can stand in there . "
Strength and resolve can only carry Clinton so far .
Obama has powerful backers in the west .
Tom Daschle , a South Dakota native who was once Senate majority leader , was one of Obama 's earliest supporters .
Obama 's deputy campaign manager is also from South Dakota .
Despite the courtship by the Clintons , Obama was endorsed by the entire tribal leadership of South Dakota , and was adopted as a son of the Crow tribe in Montana .
Obama also has the money to pour resources into South Dakota and Montana .
Clinton 's coffers are beyond empty .
Her campaign , now $ 20 m in debt , has no money for the prime venues that she favoured in the early months of the campaign .
Almost all of her campaign events are held outdoors despite unpredictable weather .
At one rally , Clinton 's only stage prop was a giant cottonwood tree .
She has little money to get voters to the polls - a huge liability on the reservations where poverty and long distances depress turnout .
Clinton also has little money for advertising .
Her first television ad in South Dakota went on air less than a week ago .
The ad , despite her own insolvent campaign , attacks President George Bush for running up the national debt .
Her entourage on the campaign trail is similarly shrunk .
Her assistant , Huma Abedin , once deemed so glamorous she was given a Vogue photospread , remains along with a couple of other aides .
News outlets have scaled back their coverage .
Camera crews once used to jostling for positions on risers now have yards of space to themselves .
When Clinton tagged along on a journalists ' sightseeing tour of Mount Rushmore , reporters did not welcome the extra access to a would - be president .
They blogged about how Clinton 's presence turned a few hours ' break into work .
But it 's possible to forget all of that , even in a modest crowd .
At the end of her big rally in South Dakota last week , Clinton worked the rope line long after people had dispersed , stretching out to every last hand , unwilling to let go .

( CNN ) --
How would the likes of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin feel about the way the United States has turned out 232 years after declaring its independence ?
Most Americans say they 're proud to be citizens , but most also think the Founding Fathers would n't be pleased .
Not pleased , a majority of Americans recently polled said .
According to a new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey , 69 percent of adult Americans who responded to a poll June 26 - 29 said the signers of the Declaration of Independence would be disappointed by the way the nation has turned out overall .
Twenty - nine percent responded " pleased , " the only other choice given to the 1,026 respondents of the telephone poll .
Americans " did n't always feel that way , " according to Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
" In 2001 , 54 percent thought that the signers of the Declaration of Independence would be pleased with the state of the country today . "
Still , most who responded to last month 's poll took great pride in their country .
Sixty - one percent said they were extremely proud to be Americans ; another 28 percent said they were very proud .
Seven percent answered " moderately , " 2 percent said " only a little , " and 1 percent answered " not at all . "
The percentage saying " extremely proud " was virtually unchanged from 2005 .
In 2003 , 70 percent said they were extremely proud , and 55 percent said so in 2001 .
All polls were taken in the same time period , June 26 - 29 , as the 2008 poll .
Another question asked in June : How often should a U.S. presidential candidate wear a flag pin ( when dressed in other than casual clothes ) ?
Forty - one percent of respondents said a candidate should always wear one .
Another 13 percent said " frequently , " 16 percent said " sometimes , " 19 percent said " only occasionally , " and 9 percent said " never . "
The questions carried a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points , except the flag pin question , which had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

McCain promises to balance budget
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) plans to promise on Monday that he will balance the federal budget by the end of his first term by curbing wasteful spending and overhauling entitlement programs , including Social Security , his advisers told Politico .
The vow to take on Social Security puts McCain in a political danger zone that thwarted President Bush after he named it the top domestic priority of his second term .

McCain is making the pledge at the beginning of a week when both presidential candidates plan to devote their events to the economy , the top issue in poll after poll as voters struggle to keep their jobs and fill their gas tanks .
“ In the long - term , the only way to keep the budget balanced is successful reform of the large spending pressures in Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid , ” the McCain campaign says in a policy paper to be released Monday .
“ The McCain administration would reserve all savings from victory in the Iraq and Afghanistan operations in the fight against Islamic extremists for reducing the deficit .
Since all their costs were financed with deficit spending , all their savings must go to deficit reduction . ”
The pledge is a return to an earlier position he 'd later backed away from .
On April 15 , McCain backed off a February pledge to balance the budget in his first term when asked about it by Michael Cooper of The New York Times , who reported that McCain said “ at a news conference … that ‘ economic conditions are reversed ’ and that he would have a balanced budget within eight years . ”
McCain advisers admit that the document is a repackaging of previous policies , without dramatic new initiatives .
Some Democratic officials had thought McCain might try to make a splash by proposing a bold middle - class tax cut .
Jason Furman , Obama 's economic policy director , called McCain 's pledge “ preposterous . "
Furman pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office now estimates a 2013 deficit of $ 443 billion , assuming the Bush tax cuts are extended .
And he estimated that McCain would have to cut discretionary spending — including defense — by roughly one - third to bring the budget into the black by then .
" McCain would have to pay for all of his new tax cuts and other proposals and then , on top of that , cut an additional $ 443 billion from the budget — which is 81 percent of Medicare spending or 78 percent of all discretionary spending outside of defense , " Furman said .
McCain ’s tour of swing states is designed to relaunch his candidacy after a high - stakes shakeup last week in his campaign organization , which has been widely criticized as soft and slow compared to the Obama machine .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) also is spending the week emphasizing economic issues , and plans to tout the family - friendly , bottom - up benefits of his proposals .
Obama begins the week in Charlotte , N.C. , with what his campaign calls “ a discussion on economic security for America ’s families . ”
The Obama campaign sought to steal McCain ’s thunder by holding a conference call Sunday to portray McCain as out of touch and not up to the job on economic matters .
McCain ’s emphasis on balancing the budget is likely to excite conservatives , who have remained skeptical of his candidacy , and provoke derision from Democrats , who will argue that it ’s a warmed - over version of proposals that President Bush failed to enact .
The budget was in surplus when Bush took office but now is deeply in the red — $ 410 billion , the White House projects , blaming the demands of war and homeland security .
McCain begins his tour in Colorado , then goes on to Pennsylvania , Ohio Michigan and Wisconsin — five of this year ’s 10 most closely contested states .
As part of his effort to call attention to his plans , McCain plans interviews with the network anchors on Wednesday .
In “ Jobs for America : The McCain Economic Plan , ” a 15 - page document to be released Monday , the senator vows to “ Bring The Budget To Balance By 2013 ” through :
--“ Reasonable economic growth .
Growth is an imperative – historically the greatest success in reducing deficits ( late 1980s ; late 1990s ) took place in the context of economic growth . ”
--“ Comprehensive spending controls .
Bringing the budget to balance will require across - the - board scrutiny of spending and making tough choices on new spending proposals . ”
--“ Bi-partisanship in budget efforts .
Much as the late 1990s witnessed bipartisan efforts to put the fiscal house in order , bi-partisan efforts will be the key to undoing the recent spending binge . ”
The plan ’s big message is : “ John McCain has a comprehensive economic plan that will create millions of good American jobs , ensure our nation 's energy security , get the government 's budget and spending practices in order , and bring relief to American consumers . ”
Here are excerpts of the plan :
-- Immediate relief for American families on gas and food prices : “ Under his plan , the United States will be telling oil producing countries and oil speculators that our dependence on foreign oil will come to an end — and the impact will be lower prices at the pump .
John McCain 's policies will increase the value of the dollar and thus reduce the price of oil . …
“ John McCain believes we should institute a summer gas tax holiday .
Hard - working American families are suffering from higher gasoline prices .
John McCain called on Congress to suspend the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.4 cent diesel tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day . ”
-- Reforming Washington to regain the trust of taxpayers : “ A one - year spending pause .
Freeze non-defense , non-veterans discretionary spending for a year and use those savings for deficit reduction .
A one - year pause in the growth of discretionary spending will be imposed to allow for a comprehensive review of all spending programs .
After the completion of a comprehensive review of all programs , projects and activities of the federal government , we will propose a plan to modernize , streamline , consolidate , reprioritize and , where needed , terminate individual programs . ”
-- Supporting small businesses : “ John McCain 's Lexington Project will address the rising costs of energy that are hurting small businesses .
He strongly supports increased domestic exploration of oil and natural gas .
This will send a strong signal to oil markets that future supplies will be more plentiful , countering the rise in oil prices . …
“ John McCain has a comprehensive health care reform plan that will reduce the spiraling cost of health care – a major burden for those small businesses that offer health insurance and a major impediment for those who cannot .
He will provide $ 5,000 for health insurance to every American family — supporting small businesses that seek to offer insurance .
John McCain opposes costly mandates or ‘ pay or play ’ requirements that would raise the financial burden on small business , cut the ability to hire , expand , or raise payrolls . ”
-- Cheap , clean , secure energy for America — The Lexington Project : “ The current federal moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf stands in the way of energy exploration and production .
John McCain believes it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and work with states to put our own reserves to use . …
“ Nuclear power is a proven , reliable , zero-emission source of energy , and it is time to recommit to advancing our use of nuclear power .
The U.S. has not started construction on a new nuclear
power plant in over 30 years .
…
John McCain will put our country on track to construct 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 with the ultimate goal of eventually constructing 100 new plants . ”
-- Health care reforms – better care , at lower cost , for every American : “ John McCain will look to bring greater affordability and competition to our drug markets through safe re-importation of drugs and faster introduction of generic drugs . …
“ John McCain will promote the availability of smoking cessation programs .
Most smokers would
love to quit but find it hard to do so .
Working with businesses and insurance companies to promote availability , we can improve lives and reduce associated chronic diseases through smoking cessation programs . …
“ John McCain will give every family a refundable tax credit – cash towards insurance – of $ 5,000 ( Individuals receive $ 2,500 ) .
Every family in America , regardless of the source of their insurance or how much they make will get the same help .
Families will be able to stay with their current plan , or choose the insurance provider that suits them best and have the money sent directly to the insurance provider . ”
-- Taxes : simpler , fair , pro-growth and competitive : “ John McCain will keep the top tax rate at 35 percent , maintain the 15 percent rates on dividends and capital gains , and phase - out the Alternative Minimum Tax . …
“ Cut The Corporate Tax Rate From 35 To 25 Percent . …
“ Allow First - Year Deduction , Or ‘ Expensing ’ , Of Equipment And Technology Investment . ”
-- Trade : “ Lower Barriers to Trade …
“ John McCain will reform the half - dozen training programs to approaches that can be used to meet the bills , pay for training , and get back to work .
John McCain believes that we can strengthen community colleges and technical training , and give displaced workers more choices to find their way back to productive and prosperous lives . ”

Is the human race worth saving ?
That 's the unanswered question looming in the background of Hellboy II : The Golden Army , Guillermo del Toro 's sprawling , take - no - prisoners follow - up to his comparatively timid first stab at Mike Mignola 's unconventional comic book superhero four years ago .
The red-skinned , cigar - chomping Hellboy ( Ron Perlman ) is still a demon fighting on the side of the angels , alongside pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz Sherman ( Selma Blair ) , amphibious empath Abe Sapien ( Doug Jones ) and their colleagues at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense .
But does an ungrateful , greedy world deserve their efforts ?
Given a choice between heroism and happiness , between saving the world and saving one 's beloved , will self - interest always win out ?
Amid a welter of eye - popping creature - feature smackdowns and stunning visions of grotesquerie , Hellboy II finds time to toy with questions like these .
If Hellboy II is a Middle Movie , as it seems to be , answers may or may not be forthcoming in Hellboy III .
Ironically , it 's Christmas Eve as Hellboy II opens in a prologue set in 1955 , when Hellboy was but a little Hell - BOY ( as opposed to the current fully - grown Hell - MAN ) living with his adopted father Prof.
Bruttenholm ( John Hurt ) at an army base .
The season is a reminder that salvation has already come to mankind — though Hellboy , like many kids at Christmas , is n't thinking about the Savior , but about that other fellow who comes at that time of year .
And when he asks Bruttenholm to tell him a story before bed , the professor cracks open a big old book and reads a mythic tale of primeval paradise lost — but it does n't bear much resemblance to the early chapters of Genesis .
In the beginning , the tale goes , men , elves and ...

Disruption could spread to all Petrobras facilities
The Brazilian state - run oil producer , Petrobras , says a strike which started on Monday has cut its production by 7 % .
The union which called the five - day walkout says the cut in production was more like 22 % - about 400,000 barrels .
Employees at 42 oilfields off the coast of Rio de Janeiro , are striking over working conditions .
Petrobras says there is a contingency plan to maintain output .
However , a union spokesman said workers would do their best to disrupt production .
At the heart of the dispute is a union demand that a day spent travelling from oil platforms in the Campos basin to the mainland should be counted as work .
At the moment employees are paid for a shift of 14 days followed by 21 days of rest .
Bigger slice
The Campos basin accounts for 80 % of Petrobras ' daily production of 1.8 million barrels of oil .
But the Petrobras president , Jose Sergio Gabrielli , has been playing down the impact of the dispute saying that daily variations in oil prices do not have a great significance .
World oil prices on Friday hit a new record high , rising above $ 147 a barrel because of a range of factors , such as tensions over supplies from Iran and Nigeria .
But analysts said the potential strike at Petrobras was also having an impact .
The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says the situation has the potential to escalate , as further disruption is being discussed at all Petrobras facilities , including refineries and terminals , as part of union demands for a bigger share of profits for employees .
The company has recently announced a number of major oil finds offshore , which have attracted huge international attention .
But these are deep beneath the seabed and the costs of production , which is still several years away , are expected to be high .
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. broke Minnesota labor law more than 2 million times over six years , routinely forcing some employees to work off the clock through lunch and rest breaks , a Dakota County judge has ruled .
The violations were willful , said District Judge Robert King in a ruling Monday in Hastings .
They could bring a penalty of up to $ 1,000 per violation , which could mean a $ 2 billion fine for the world 's largest retailer .
A jury will decide the size of the penalty during the second phase of the trial , expected to begin Oct. 20 .
Nancy Braun , one of four named plaintiffs on the suit , said Tuesday that she was " ecstatic " about the judge 's decision .
Braun , who worked in an Apple Valley store for about 14 months beginning in March 1998 , said the store repeatedly did n't find people to give her breaks when she was the sole cook and waitress at the store 's grill .
In several instances no one came in time for her to go to the bathroom .
" I would end up soiling myself , " said Braun , now 53 and living in Rochester .
" Sometimes I 'd have other clothes with me in my locker , or they would say to me , ' We have clothes in the store you can buy . ' "
Braun said she kept complaining , " and they kept promising to get me help , but they never did it . "
In his ruling , King especially noted Braun 's treatment and a similar episode with a menstruating employee , calling it " dehumanizing and reprehensible " but also an " aberration . "
Wal - Mart is reviewing the ruling and considering an appeal , said spokeswoman Daphne Moore , at the company 's Bentonville , Ark. , headquarters .
" We 're pleased the court ruled in our favor on many points , [ but ] we do respectfully disagree with portions of the decision . "
Suit was filed in 2001
The judge 's ruling comes seven years after the suit was filed .
" We think this will send a loud message to Wal - Mart that compliance with wage and hour law is important , and employees will have their day in court , " said Jon Parritz in Minneapolis , one of the attorneys representing about 56,000 Wal - Mart and Sam's Club employees in Minnesota in their class - action lawsuit .
Monday 's order also awards plaintiffs more than $ 6.5 million in damages .
It is one of dozens of similar employment lawsuits across the country against the discount retailer that has worked recently to overcome its longtime anti-labor image .
Judgments so far have gone both ways , but Parritz expects the Minnesota ruling to have wide influence because it is the first to be issued by a judge instead of a jury .
" There are 150 pages of detailed analysis of the evidence , not something that is part of a jury ruling , " he said .
' Heads in the sand ' From September of 1998 through January 2004 , the judge said , Wal - Mart violations of Minnesota law including underpaying employees for 1.5 million rest breaks , denying them 74,000 meal breaks and not paying them for 70,000 training sessions .
He also said that payroll records for 325,000 shifts were missing .
The judge also put a lot of weight on an internal audit by Wal - Mart during one June week in 2000 that documented tens of thousands of missed rest and meal breaks at 127 of 128 audited stores , including six in Minnesota .
The auditor 's warning of " adverse consequences " as a result went to more than 50 senior Wal - Mart managers , including then - president Tom Coughlin .
" Wal - Mart management responded to the audits with no action , " the judge wrote .
" In essence , they put their heads in the sand . "
As part of its defense , the company argued that the audit was ignored because it was " methodologically unsound , " and that time - clock data is unreliable because employees often take breaks forgetting or without bothering to punch out .
On Tuesday , Moore also reiterated this company policy : " It is to pay every associate for every hour worked , and to make sure rest and meal breaks are available , " Moore said .
" Any manager who violates that policy is subject to discipline up to and including termination . "
' One step backward '
Most men are harassed by women at work
Four out of five men are sexually harassed by women at work - but are too afraid to complain to their employers - according to researchers .
IBM 's Research Information Services division is investigating the possibility of moving a significant number of employees to Apple 's Macintosh platform according to a report acquired by Roughly Drafted .
In line with IBMs external strategy of offering a true Open Client that may be Windows , Linux or a Mac , the document noted , [ Research Information Services ] is focusing on providing an IBM application stack on multiple Operating Systems , rather than be confined to one or the other .
The first phase of the pilot program was conducted between October 2007 and January 2008 .
During this phase , 24 MacBook
Pros were distributed to researchers and used as the primary notebook , with the employees ' existing ThinkPads acting as backups if needed .
Of the 22 of 24 who responded , 18 said that the Mac offered a better or best experience compared to their existing computer , one rated it equal or good , and three said the Mac offered a worse experience .
Seven reported having no or marginal prior knowledge of using Macs , while 15 reported having moderate or expert knowledge of the platform .
Other highlights :
- 86 % of pilot users requested to keep the Mac
- More new hires are requesting Macs
- Research and Academic clients have a growing Mac community
- IBM internal software made for Mac was easy to install
- Some key software was unavailable for Mac , including DB2 and Websphere Application Server , Rational Application Developer IDE for J2EE apps , WebSphere Integration Developer SOA development tool , and Microsoft Visio .
Some Comments :
- " When presenting at customer or external meetings , I have been greeted with the ' wow factor . '
' Where 's the ThinkPad , IBM uses Apples now ? ' "
- " This can free us from the Windows stranglehold . "
- " It has been easier learning the Mac than learning Vista . "
- " The ability to run Windows XP in a VM under Parallels is a great feature . "
An expansion of the pilot is planned for 2008 , supporting up to 100 users by the end of the year .
As a grain of salt , IBM has been heavily invested in Linux and the pilot is likely to simply fall in line with efforts to break reliance on Microsoft Windows .
That being said , the company has been re-invigorating efforts to develop Mac software , including versions of the company 's Lotus Notes client for iPhone and Lotus Symphony .
Ron Paul Rents 11,000 - Seat Arena in St. Paul Denied speech at GOP convention , Ron will hold ‘ counter convention ’ down the street RON PAUL HAS BOOKED the University of Minnesota ’s Williams Arena near the site of the Republican Convention where he will hold a rival rally .
The arena seats 11,000 .
There is a growing surge of people out there just craving ” for a return “ to traditional American government , limited government that places personal liberty first and places an emphasis on personal responsibility and essentially gets out of the way after that , ” spokesman Jesse Benton told the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review .
“ The buzz we get from supporters is that they are very eager to come to the GOP Convention in St. Paul and very eager to send a strong message . ”
McCain spokesman Jeff Sadosky declined comment .
Paul has won 35 convention delegates , but was not invited to speak in St.
Paul because he refuses to endorse McCain , according to his campaign .
Paul ’s plan to stage his own event is bad news for McCain , said G. Terry Madonna , a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College .
“ Conventions are about demonstrating unity and purpose and showcasing the nominee .
They are media events made for prime - time TV .
Any distraction from the central message of the convention is not helpful , ” Madonna said .
McCain clinched the nomination on March 4 after gaining enough delegates to reach the 1,191 needed to win .
Although Paul conceded in March he ’d lost his bid for the White House , he ’s maintained a scaled - down campaign .
Paul surprised most of the political establishment by raising about $ 35 million , mostly via the Internet .
Paul ’s Libertarian - leaning views created a following across a broad political spectrum .
Paul has not won any primaries or caucuses , but continued to pick up significant votes in key states such as New Mexico and Pennsylvania .
Jerry Shuster , a political communications expert at the University of Pittsburgh , said Paul ’s timing for the event is likely to put him in the media spotlight during at least one day of the convention .
Paul ’s forum probably wo n’t be aimed at hurting the GOP , Shuster said .
“ He never seemed to be an open opponent of the Republican Party , but more about what the Republicans need to get back to , ” Shuster said .
“ This is a golden opportunity for him to do that .
The media is all going to be there so it ’s just a matter of going down the block to see him .
You know he ’s going to get his 15 minutes on national news . ”
( Issue # 25 , June 23 , 2008 )
A few weeks back , I bought a Pentax K20D and now that I ’ve taken 500 + pictures with it , I suppose I should say a few words .
To illustrate , photographs of garbage .
Previously , I ’ve run pictures of new cameras here , but not this time .
The K20D is a commodity , so there are tons of shots all over the Net .
And anyhow , it ’s kinda ugly .
It ’s possible to be extremely functional and also beautiful — consider a violin or a tugboat — but not , so far , in the world of DSLRs .
The camera is bulbous and swollen and button - infested .
It takes great pictures , but then so do lots of other cameras .
Saturday morning , we went to Granville Island Market , and as we walked in , there was a dumpster just at the right angle for the sun to come in .
Here ’s the thing : Given reasonable light and a stationary subject that ’s not too far away , and a dry location , you can point pretty well any modern digicam , any size , at it , put it in full - auto mode and press the button and you ’ll get a great picture .
With a decent mid-range SLR like the K20D , you can do the same thing , sometimes , when the light ’s not great and the subject ’s not co-operative and the environment is n’t friendly .
Plus you can go out in the rain .
Here ’s some more garbage .
I bet yours does n’t look this great .
What I Like ·
You can go out in the rain , it ’s super - weatherproof .
Pros sneer at 3 shots / second , but it feels fast to me .
Switching all the things you might need to switch before you shoot is fast and convenient ; the ergonomics are much better than I could have done .
Compared to the competition , it ’s pretty small and light .
The selection of lenses is just outstanding , I mean insanely great .
Of the 550 or so shots I ’ve taken , I bet 80 % have been with the 40 mm “ pancake ” ; it ’s a lovely combination .
Lots of megapixels let you crop way down when you screw up the composition .
The combination of nice smooth ISO1600 and anti-shake means I can almost always shoot inside without a flash .
Hundreds of shots on one battery charge .
What I Do n’t Like ·
Compared to the previous Pentax and my little Ricoh , it ’s big and heavy .
Too many megapixels meant I had to buy a new computer to handle the big honkin’ raw files .
Plus if they ’d squeezed less onto the silicon , the low - light performance would be even better .
Still Work to Do ·
There are pictures that this camera could take but I have n’t learned how yet .
Consider the following .
Inside the Granville Island market , a shaft of sun illuminated a heap of green grapes , it looked like a work of one of the Renaissance ’s Old Masters , as if the grapes were casting light on the nearby faces .
Sigh .
There are lots of buttons on the back of the camera that I have n’t figured out yet , and an “ Enhanced Dynamic Range ” function and lots of other goodies too .
As long as I keep seeing things that I want to capture but can’t , I ’ll keep thinking about cameras .
The Justice Department is considering establishing a new policy that would allow the FBI to target Americans for investigation even in the absence of evidence or other compelling indications that the person was breaking a law , according to the Associated Press .
The policy , being considered as part of the attorney general 's guidelines to the FBI , would allow the agency to conduct racial profiling – potentially singling out Muslim - and Arab - Americans – and to open preliminary terrorism investigations against targets simply on the basis of patterns established through data mining public records and other information .
The agency would be allowed to profile targets based on their race and activities , such as travel to the Middle East or any other part of the world associated with terrorism .
But race would be only one factor in the decision to open an investigation .
The changes would allow FBI agents to ask open - ended questions about activities of Muslim - or Arab - Americans , or investigate them if their jobs and backgrounds match trends that analysts deem suspect .
FBI agents would not be allowed to eavesdrop on phone calls or dig deeply into personal data — such as the content of phone or e-mail records or bank statements — until a full investigation was opened .
The guidelines focus on the FBI 's domestic operations and run about 40 pages long , several officials said .
They do not specifically spell out what traits the FBI should use in building profiles .
The DoJ is revamping the guidelines to support the FBI 's change in focus from fighting traditional crimes to gathering intelligence and countering domestic terrorism .
The new guidelines would be put in place before the presidential administration changes next January .
Targeting a person based on race , of course , would seem to be a clear violation of civil rights .
A DoJ official told the AP that the guidelines would n't really give the FBI any more authority than it already has to create " threat assessments " of individuals .
A DoJ spokesman added that the guidelines cannot authorize any activity that is unconstitutional or prohibited by statute .

Bartleby , the Scrivener : A Story of Wall - street
I AM a rather elderly man .
The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men , of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written : —I mean the law - copyists or scriveners .
I have known very many of them , professionally and privately , and if I pleased , could relate divers histories , at which good - natured gentlemen might smile , and sentimental souls might weep .
But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby , who was a scrivener the strangest I ever saw or heard of .
While of other law - copyists I might write the complete life , of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done .
I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man .
It is an irreparable loss to literature .
Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable , except from the original sources , and in his case those are very small .
What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby , that is all I know of him , except , indeed , one vague report which will appear in the sequel .
1
Ere introducing the scrivener , as he first appeared to me , it is fit I make some mention of myself , my employées , my business , my chambers , and general surroundings ; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented .
2 Imprimis : I am a man who , from his youth upwards , has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best .
Hence , though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous , even to turbulence , at times , yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace .
I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury , or in any way draws down public applause ; but in the cool tranquillity of a snug retreat , do a snug business among rich men ’s bonds and mortgages and title - deeds .
All who know me consider me an eminently safe man .
The late John Jacob Astor , a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm , had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence ; my next , method .
I do not speak it in vanity , but simply record the fact , that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor ; a name which , I admit , I love to repeat , for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it , and rings like unto bullion .
I will freely add , that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor ’s good opinion .

Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins , my avocations had been largely increased .
The good old office , now extinct in the State of New - York , of a Master in Chancery , had been conferred upon me .
It was not a very arduous office , but very pleasantly remunerative .
I seldom lose my temper ; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages ; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare , that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master of Chancery , by the new Constitution , as a — — premature act ; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life - lease of the profits , whereas I only received those of a few short years .
But this is by the way .

My chambers were up stairs at No. — Wall - street .
At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky - light shaft , penetrating the building from top to bottom .
This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise , deficient in what landscape painters call “ life . ”
But if so , the view from the other end of my chambers offered , at least , a contrast , if nothing more .
In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall , black by age and everlasting shade ; which wall required no spy - glass to bring out its lurking beauties , but for the benefit of all near - sighted spectators , was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes .
Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings , and my chambers being on the second floor , the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern .
5
At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby , I had two persons as copyists in my employment , and a promising lad as an office - boy .
First , Turkey ; second , Nippers ; third , Ginger Nut .
These may seem names , the like of which are not usually found in the Directory .
In truth they were nicknames , mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks , and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters .
Turkey was a short , pursy Englishman of about my own age , that is , somewhere not far from sixty .
In the morning , one might say , his face was of a fine florid hue , but after twelve o’clock , meridian — his dinner hour — it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals ; and continued blazing — but , as it were , with a gradual wane — till 6 o’clock , P. M. or thereabouts , after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face , which gaining its meridian with the sun , seemed to set with it , to rise , culminate , and decline the following day , with the like regularity and undiminished glory .
There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life , not the least among which was the fact , that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance , just then , too , at that critical moment , began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty - four hours .
Not that he was absolutely idle , or averse to business then ; far from it .
The difficulty was , he was apt to be altogether too energetic .
There was a strange , inflamed , flurried , flighty recklessness of activity about him .
He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand .
All his blots upon my documents , were dropped there after twelve o’clock , meridian .
Indeed , not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon , but some days he went further , and was rather noisy .
At such times , too , his face flamed with augmented blazonry , as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite .
He made an unpleasant racket with his chair ; spilled his sand - box ; in mending his pens , impatiently split them all to pieces , and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion ; stood up and leaned over his table , boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner , very sad to behold in an elderly man like him .
Nevertheless , as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me , and all the time before twelve o’clock , meridian , was the quickest , steadiest creature too , accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched — for these reasons , I was willing to overlook his eccentricities , though indeed , occasionally , I remonstrated with him .
I did this very gently , however , because , though the civilest , nay , the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning , yet in the afternoon he was disposed , upon provocation , to be slightly rash with his tongue , in fact , insolent .
Now , valuing his morning services as I did , and resolved not to lose them ; yet , at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o’clock ; and being a man of peace , unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him ; I took upon me , one Saturday noon ( he was always worse on Saturdays ) , to hint to him , very kindly , that perhaps now that he was growing old , it might be well to abridge his labors ; in short , he need not come to my chambers after twelve o’clock , but , dinner over , had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till tea -time .
But no ; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions .
His countenance became intolerably fervid , as he oratorically assured me — gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room — that if his services in the morning were useful , how indispensible , then , in the afternoon ?
6 “ With submission , sir , ” said Turkey on this occasion , “ I consider myself your right - hand man .
In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns ; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head , and gallantly charge the foe , thus ! ” — and he made a violent thrust with the ruler .
7 “ But the blots , Turkey , ” intimated I. 8 “ True , — but , with submission , sir , behold these hairs !
I am getting old .
Surely , sir , a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs .
Old age — even if it blot the page — is honorable .
With submission , sir , we both are getting old . ”
9
This appeal to my fellow - feeling was hardly to be resisted .
At all events , I saw that go he would not .
So I made up my mind to let him stay , resolving , nevertheless , to see to it , that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers .
10 Nippers , the second on my list , was a whiskered , sallow , and , upon the whole , rather piratical - looking young man of about five and twenty .
I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers — ambition and indigestion .
The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist , an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs , such as the original drawing up of legal documents .
The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability , causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying ; unnecessary maledictions , hissed , rather than spoken , in the heat of business ; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked .
Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn , Nippers could never get this table to suit him .
He put chips under it , blocks of various sorts , bits of pasteboard , and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting - paper .
But no invention would answer .
If , for the sake of easing his back , he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin , and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk : — then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms .
If now he lowered the table to his waistbands , and stooped over it in writing , then there was a sore aching in his back .
In short , the truth of the matter was , Nippers knew not what he wanted .
Or , if he wanted any thing , it was to be rid of a scrivener ’s table altogether .
Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous - looking fellows in seedy coats , whom he called his clients .
Indeed I was aware that not only was he , at times , considerable of a ward - politician , but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices ’ courts , and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs .
I have good reason to believe , however , that one individual who called upon him at my chambers , and who , with a grand air , he insisted was his client , was no other than a dun , and the alleged title - deed , a bill .
But with all his failings , and the annoyances he caused me , Nippers , like his compatriot Turkey , was a very useful man to me ; wrote a neat , swift hand ; and , when he chose , was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment .
Added to this , he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way ; and so , incidentally , reflected credit upon my chambers .
Whereas with respect to Turkey , I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me .
His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating - houses .
He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer .
His coats were execrable ; his hat not be to handled .
But while the hat was a thing of indifference to me , inasmuch as his natural civility and deference , as a dependent Englishman , always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room , yet his coat was another matter .
Concerning his coats , I reasoned with him ; but with no effect .
The truth was , I suppose , that a man with so small an income , could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time .
As Nippers once observed , Turkey ’s money went chiefly for red ink .
One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly - respectable looking coat of my own , a padded gray coat , of a most comfortable warmth , and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck .
I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor , and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons .
But no .
I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket - like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him ; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses .
In fact , precisely as a rash , restive horse is said to feel his oats , so Turkey felt his coat .
It made him insolent .
He was a man whom prosperity harmed .
11 Though concerning the self - indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private surmises , yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might be his faults in other respects , he was , at least , a temperate young man .
But indeed , nature herself seemed to have been his vintner , and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable , brandy - like disposition , that all subsequent potations were needless .
When I consider how , amid the stillness of my chambers , Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat , and stooping over his table , spread his arms wide apart , seize the whole desk , and move it , and jerk it , with a grim , grinding motion on the floor , as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent , intent on thwarting and vexing him ; I plainly perceive that for Nippers , brandy and water were altogether superfluous .
12 It was fortunate for me that , owing to its peculiar cause — indigestion — the irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers , were mainly observable in the morning , while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild .
So that Turkey ’s paroxysms only coming on about twelve o’clock , I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time .
Their fits relieved each other like guards .
When Nippers ’ was on , Turkey ’s was off ; and vice versa .
This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances .
13 Ginger Nut , the third on my list , was a lad some twelve years old .
His father was a carman , ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart , before he died .
So he sent him to my office as student at law , errand boy , and cleaner and sweeper , at the rate of one dollar a week .
He had a little desk to himself , but he did not use it much .
Upon inspection , the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various sorts of nuts .
Indeed , to this quick - witted youth the whole noble science of the law was contained in a nut - shell .
Not the least among the employments of Ginger Nut , as well as one which he discharged with the most alacrity , was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey and Nippers .
Copying law papers being proverbially a dry , husky sort of business , my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office .
Also , they sent Ginger
Nut very frequently for that peculiar cake — small , flat , round , and very spicy — after which he had been named by them .
Of a cold morning when business was but dull , Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes , as if they were mere wafers — indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny — the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth .
Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey , was his once moistening a ginger - cake between his lips , and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal .
I came within an ace of dismissing him then .
But he mollified me by making an oriental bow , and saying —
“ With submission , sir , it was generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account . ”
14 Now my original business — that of a conveyancer and title hunter , and drawer - up of recondite documents of all sorts — was considerably increased by receiving the master ’s office .
There was now great work for scriveners .
Not only must I push the clerks already with me , but I must have additional help .
In answer to my advertisement , a motionless young man one morning , stood upon my office threshold , the door being open , for it was summer .
I can see that figure now — pallidly neat , pitiably respectable , incurably forlorn !
It was Bartleby .
15 After a few words touching his qualifications , I engaged him , glad to have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect , which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey , and the fiery one of Nippers .
16 I should have stated before that ground glass folding - doors divided my premises into two parts , one of which was occupied by my scriveners , the other by myself .
According to my humor I threw open these doors , or closed them .
I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding - doors , but on my side of them , so as to have this quiet man within easy call , in case any trifling thing was to be done .
I placed his desk close up to a small side - window in that part of the room , a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back - yards and bricks , but which , owing to subsequent erections , commanded at present no view at all , though it gave some light .
Within three feet of the panes was a wall , and the light came down from far above , between two lofty buildings , as from a very small opening in a dome .
Still further to a satisfactory arrangement , I procured a high green folding screen , which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight , though not remove him from my voice .
And thus , in a manner , privacy and society were conjoined .
17 At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing .
As if long famishing for something to copy , he seemed to gorge himself on my documents .
There was no pause for digestion .
He ran a day and night line , copying by sun-light and by candle - light .
I should have been quite delighted with his application , had be been cheerfully industrious .
But he wrote on silently , palely , mechanically .
18 It is , of course , an indispensable part of a scrivener ’s business to verify the accuracy of his copy , word by word .
Where there are two or more scriveners in an office , they assist each other in this examination , one reading from the copy , the other holding the original .
It is a very dull , wearisome , and lethargic affair .
I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable .
For example , I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Byron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law document of , say five hundred pages , closely written in a crimpy hand .
19 Now and then , in the haste of business , it had been my habit to assist in comparing some brief document myself , calling Turkey or Nippers for this purpose .
One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the screen , was to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions .
It was on the third day , I think , of his being with me , and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined , that , being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand , I abruptly called to Bartleby .
In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance , I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk , and my right hand sideways , and somewhat nervously extended with the copy , so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat , Bartleby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay .
20
In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him , rapidly stating what it was I wanted him to do — namely , to examine a small paper with me .
Imagine my surprise , nay , my consternation , when without moving from his privacy , Bartleby in a singularly mild , firm voice , replied , “ I would prefer not to . ” 21 I sat awhile in perfect silence , rallying my stunned faculties .
Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me , or Bartleby had entirely misunderstood my meaning .
I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume .
But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply , “ I would prefer not to . ” 22 “ Prefer not to , ” echoed I , rising in high excitement , and crossing the room with a stride .
“ What do you mean ?
Are you moon - struck ?
I want you to help me compare this sheet here — take it , ” and I thrust it towards him .
23 “ I would prefer not to , ” said he .
24 I looked at him steadfastly .
His face was leanly composed ; his gray eye dimly calm .
Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him .
Had there been the least uneasiness , anger , impatience or impertinence in his manner ; in other words , had there been any thing ordinarily human about him , doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises .
But as it was , I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster - of - paris bust of Cicero out of doors .
I stood gazing at him awhile , as he went on with his own writing , and then reseated myself at my desk .
This is very strange , thought I . What had one best do ?
But my business hurried me .
I concluded to forget the matter for the present , reserving it for my future leisure .
So calling Nippers from the other room , the paper was speedily examined .
25 A few days after this , Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents , being quadruplicates of a week ’s testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery .
It became necessary to examine them .
It was an important suit , and great accuracy was imperative .
Having all things arranged I called Turkey , Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room , meaning to place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks , while I should read from the original .
Accordingly Turkey , Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row , each with his document in hand , when I called to Bartleby to join this interesting group .
26 “ Bartleby !
quick , I am waiting . ”
27 I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor , and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage .
28 “ What is wanted ? ” said he mildly .
29 “ The copies , the copies , ” said I hurriedly .
“ We are going to examine them .
There ” — and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate .
30 “ I would prefer not to , ” he said , and gently disappeared behind the screen .
31 For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt , standing at the head of my seated column of clerks .
Recovering myself , I advanced towards the screen , and demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct .
32 “ Why do you refuse ? ” 33 “ I would prefer not to . ”
34 With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion , scorned all further words , and thrust him ignominiously from my presence .
But there was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me , but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me .
I began to reason with him .
35 “ These are your own copies we are about to examine .
It is labor saving to you , because one examination will answer for your four papers .
It is common usage .
Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy .
Is it not so ?
Will you not speak ?
Answer ! ” 36 “ I prefer not to , ” he replied in a flute - like tone .
It seemed to me that while I had been addressing him , he carefully revolved every statement that I made ; fully comprehended the meaning ; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusion ; but , at the same time , some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did .
37 “ You are decided , then , not to comply with my request — a request made according to common usage and common sense ? ”
38 He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound .
Yes : his decision was irreversible .
39
It is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented and violently unreasonable way , he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith .
He begins , as it were , vaguely to surmise that , wonderful as it may be , all the justice and all the reason is on the other side .
Accordingly , if any disinterested persons are present , he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind .
40 “ Turkey , ” said I , “ what do you think of this ?
Am I not right ? ” 41 “ With submission , sir , ” said Turkey , with his blandest tone , “ I think that you are . ” 42 “ Nippers , ” said I , “ what do you think of it ? ” 43 “ I think I should kick him out of the office . ”
44 ( The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that , it being morning , Turkey ’s answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms , but Nippers replies in ill - tempered ones .
Or , to repeat a previous sentence , Nippers ’s ugly mood was on duty , and Turkey ’s off . )
45 “ Ginger Nut , ” said I , willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf , “ what do you think of it ? ” 46 “ I think , sir , he ’s a little luny , ” replied Ginger Nut , with a grin .
47 “ You hear what they say , ” said I , turning towards the screen , “ come forth and do your duty . ”
48 But he vouchsafed no reply .
I pondered a moment in sore perplexity .
But once more business hurried me .
I determined again to postpone the consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure .
With a little trouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby , though at every page or two , Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common ; while Nippers , twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness , ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the screen .
And for his ( Nippers ’s ) part , this was the first and the last time he would do another man ’s business without pay .
49 Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage , oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there .
50 Some days passed , the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work .
His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly .
I observed that he never went to dinner ; indeed that he never went any where .
As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office .
He was a perpetual sentry in the corner .
At about eleven o’clock though , in the morning , I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartleby ’s screen , as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat .
The boy would then leave the office jingling a few pence , and reappear with a handful of ginger - nuts which he delivered in the hermitage , receiving two of the cakes for his trouble .
51 He lives , then , on ginger - nuts , thought I ; never eats a dinner , properly speaking ; he must be a vegetarian then ; but no ; he never eats even vegetables , he eats nothing but ginger - nuts .
My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger - nuts .
Ginger - nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents , and the final flavoring one .
Now what was ginger ?
A hot , spicy thing .
Was Bartleby hot and spicy ?
Not at all .
Ginger , then , had no effect upon Bartleby .
Probably he preferred it should have none .
52 Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance .
If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper , and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity ; then , in the better moods of the former , he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment .
Even so , for the most part , I regarded Bartleby and his ways .
Poor fellow !
thought I , he means no mischief ; it is plain he intends no insolence ; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary .
He is useful to me .
I can get along with him .
If I turn him away , the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer , and then he will be rudely treated , and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve .
Yes .
Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self - approval .
To befriend Bartleby ; to humor him in his strange wilfulness , will cost me little or nothing , while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience .
But this mood was not invariable with me .
The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me .
I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition , to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own .
But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap .
But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me , and the following little scene ensued : 53 “ Bartleby , ” said I , “ when those papers are all copied , I will compare them with you . ”
54 “ I would prefer not to . ” 55 “ How ?
Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary ? ”
56 No answer .
57 I threw open the folding - doors near by , and turning upon Turkey and Nippers , exclaimed in an excited manner — 58 “ He says , a second time , he wo n’t examine his papers .
What do you think of it , Turkey ? ” 59 It was afternoon , be it remembered .
Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler , his bald head steaming , his hands reeling among his blotted papers .
60 “ Think of it ? ” roared Turkey ; “ I think I ’ll just step behind his screen , and black his eyes for him ! ”
61 So saying , Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position .
He was hurrying away to make good his promise , when I detained him , alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey ’s combativeness after dinner .
62 “ Sit down , Turkey , ” said I , “ and hear what Nippers has to say .
What do you think of it , Nippers ?
Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing Bartleby ? ” 63 “ Excuse me , that is for you to decide , sir .
I think his conduct quite unusual , and indeed unjust , as regards Turkey and myself .
But it may only be a passing whim . ”
64 “ Ah , ” exclaimed I , “ you have strangely changed your mind then — you speak very gently of him now . ” 65 “ All beer , ” cried Turkey ; “ gentleness is effects of beer — Nippers and I dined together to - day .
You see how gentle I am , sir .
Shall I go and black his eyes ? ” 66 “ You refer to Bartleby , I suppose .
No , not to - day , Turkey , ” I replied ; “ pray , put up your fists . ”
67 I closed the doors , and again advanced towards Bartleby .
I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate .
I burned to be rebelled against again .
I remembered that Bartleby never left the office .
68 “ Bartleby , ” said I , “ Ginger Nut is away ; just step round to the Post Office , wo n’t you ?
( it was but a three minutes walk , ) and see if there is any thing for me . ”
69 “ I would prefer not to . ” 70 “ You will not ? ” 71 “ I prefer not . ” 72 I staggered to my desk , and sat there in a deep study .
My blind inveteracy returned .
Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean , penniless wight ?— my hired clerk ?
What added thing is there , perfectly reasonable , that he will be sure to refuse to do ?
73 “ Bartleby ! ” 74 No answer .
75 “ Bartleby , ” in a louder tone .
76 No answer .
77 “ Bartleby , ” I roared .
78 Like a very ghost , agreeably to the laws of magical invocation , at the third summons , he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage .
79 “ Go to the next room , and tell Nippers to come to me . ” 80 “ I prefer not to , ” he respectfully and slowly said , and mildly disappeared .
81 “ Very good , Bartleby , ” said I , in a quiet sort of serenely severe self - possessed tone , intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand .
At the moment I half intended something of the kind .
But upon the whole , as it was drawing towards my dinner - hour , I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day , suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind .
82 Shall I acknowledge it ?
The conclusion of this whole business was , that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers , that a pale young scrivener , by the name of Bartleby , had a desk there ; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio ( one hundred words ) ; but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him , that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers , one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness ; moreover , said Bartleby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort ; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter , it was generally understood that he would prefer not to — in other words , that he would refuse point - blank .
83 As days passed on , I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby .
His steadiness , his freedom from all dissipation , his incessant industry ( except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen ) , his great stillness , his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances , made him a valuable acquisition .
One prime thing was this , —he was always there ;— first in the morning , continually through the day , and the last at night .
I had a singular confidence in his honesty .
I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands .
Sometimes to be sure I could not , for the very soul of me , avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him .
For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities , privileges , and unheard of exemptions , forming the tacit stipulations on Bartleby ’s part under which he remained in my office .
Now and then , in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business , I would inadvertently summon Bartleby , in a short , rapid tone , to put his finger , say , on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers .
Of course , from behind the screen the usual answer , “ I prefer not to , ” was sure to come ; and then , how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature , refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness — such unreasonableness .
However , every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence .
84 Here it must be said , that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely - populated law buildings , there were several keys to my door .
One was kept by a woman residing in the attic , which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments .
Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake .
The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket .
The fourth I knew not who had .
85 Now , one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church , to hear a celebrated preacher , and finding myself rather early on the ground , I thought I would walk round to my chambers for a while .
Luckily I had my key with me ; but upon applying it to the lock , I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside .
Quite surprised , I called out ; when to my consternation a key was turned from within ; and thrusting his lean visage at me , and holding the door ajar , the apparition of Bartleby appeared , in his shirt sleeves , and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille , saying quietly that he was sorry , but he was deeply engaged just then , and — preferred not admitting me at present .
In a brief word or two , he moreover added , that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times , and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs .
86 Now , the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby , tenanting my law - chambers of a Sunday morning , with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance , yet withal firm and self - possessed , had such a strange effect upon me , that incontinently I slunk away from my own door , and did as desired .
But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener .
Indeed , it was his wonderful mildness chiefly , which not only disarmed me , but unmanned me , as it were .
For I consider that one , for the time , is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him , and order him away from his own premises .
Furthermore , I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves , and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning .
Was any thing amiss going on ?
Nay , that was out of the question .
It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person .
But what could he be doing there ?— copying ?
Nay again , whatever might be his eccentricities , Bartleby was an eminently decorous person .
He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity .
Besides , it was Sunday ; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that we would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day .
87 Nevertheless , my mind was not pacified ; and full of a restless curiosity , at last I returned to the door .
Without hindrance I inserted my key , opened it , and entered .
Bartleby was not to be seen .
I looked round anxiously , peeped behind his screen ; but it was very plain that he was gone .
Upon more closely examining the place , I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate , dressed , and slept in my office , and that too without plate , mirror , or bed .
The cushioned seat of a ricketty old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean , reclining form .
Rolled away under his desk , I found a blanket ; under the empty grate , a blacking box and brush ; on a chair , a tin basin , with soap and a ragged towel ; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger - nuts and a morsel of cheese .
Yet , thought I , it is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here , keeping bachelor ’s hall all by himself .
Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me , What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed !
His poverty is great ; but his solitude , how horrible !
Think of it .
Of a Sunday , Wall - street is deserted as Petra ; and every night of every day it is an emptiness .
This building too , which of week - days hums with industry and life , at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy , and all through Sunday is forlorn .
And here Bartleby makes his home ; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous — a sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage !
88 For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me .
Before , I had never experienced aught but a not - unpleasing sadness .
The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom .
A fraternal melancholy !
For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam .
I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day , in gala trim , swan - like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway ; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist , and thought to myself , Ah , happiness courts the light , so we deem the world is gay ; but misery hides aloof , so we deem that misery there is none .
These sad fancyings — chimeras , doubtless , of a sick and silly brain — led on to other and more special thoughts , concerning the eccentricities of Bartleby .
Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me .
The scrivener ’s pale form appeared to me laid out , among uncaring strangers , in its shivering winding sheet .
89 Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby ’s closed desk , the key in open sight left in the lock .
90 I mean no mischief , seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity , thought I ; besides , the desk is mine , and its contents too , so I will make bold to look within .
Every thing was methodically arranged , the papers smoothly placed .
The pigeon holes were deep , and removing the files of documents , I groped into their recesses .
Presently I felt something there , and dragged it out .
It was an old bandanna handkerchief , heavy and knotted .
I opened it , and saw it was a savings ’ bank .
91 I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man .
I remembered that he never spoke but to answer ; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself , yet I had never seen him reading — no , not even a newspaper ; that for long periods he would stand looking out , at his pale window behind the screen , upon the dead brick wall ; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house ; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey , or tea and coffee even , like other men ; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn ; never went out for a walk , unless indeed that was the case at present ; that he had declined telling who he was , or whence he came , or whether he had any relatives in the world ; that though so thin and pale , he never complained of ill health .
And more than all , I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid — how shall I call it ?— of pallid haughtiness , say , or rather an austere reserve about him , which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities , when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me , even though I might know , from his long - continued motionlessness , that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead - wall reveries of his .
92 Revolving all these things , and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home , and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness ; revolving all these things , a prudential feeling began to steal over me .
My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity ; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my imagination , did that same melancholy merge into fear , that pity into repulsion .
So true it is , and so terrible too , that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections ; but , in certain special cases , beyond that point it does not .
They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart .
It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill .
To a sensitive being , pity is not seldom pain .
And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor , common sense bids the soul be rid of it .
What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder .
I might give alms to his body ; but his body did not pain him ; it was his soul that suffered , and his soul I could not reach .
93 I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning .
Somehow , the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church - going .
I walked homeward , thinking what I would do with Bartleby .
Finally , I resolved upon this ;— I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning , touching his history , &c. , and if he declined to answer then openly and reservedly ( and I supposed he would prefer not ) , then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him , and tell him his services were no longer required ; but that if in any other way I could assist him , I would be happy to do so , especially if he desired to return to his native place , wherever that might be , I would willingly help to defray the expenses .
Moreover , if , after reaching home , he found himself at any time in want of aid , a letter from him would be sure of a reply .
94 The next morning came .
95 “ Bartleby , ” said I , gently calling to him behind his screen .
96 No reply .
97 “ Bartleby , ” said I , in a still gentler tone , “ come here ; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do — I simply wish to speak to you . ”
98 Upon this he noiselessly slid into view .
99 “ Will you tell me , Bartleby , where you were born ? ” 100 “ I would prefer not to . ” 101 “ Will you tell me any thing about yourself ? ” 102 “ I would prefer not to . ” 103 “ But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me ?
I feel friendly towards you . ”
104
He did not look at me while I spoke , but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero , which as I then sat , was directly behind me , some six inches above my head .
105 “ What is your answer , Bartleby ? ” said I , after waiting a considerable time for a reply , during which his countenance remained immovable , only there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth .
106 “ At present I prefer to give no answer , ” he said , and retired into his hermitage .
107
It was rather weak in me I confess , but his manner on this occasion nettled me .
Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain disdain , but his perverseness seemed ungrateful , considering the undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me .
108 Again I sat ruminating what I should do .
Mortified as I was at his behavior , and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my office , nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart , and forbidding me to carry out my purpose , and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind .
At last , familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen , I sat down and said : “ Bartleby , never mind then about revealing your history ; but let me entreat you , as a friend , to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office .
Say now you will help to examine papers to - morrow or next day : in short , say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable : — say so , Bartleby . ”
109 “ At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable , ” was his mildly cadaverous reply .
110 Just then the folding - doors opened , and Nippers approached .
He seemed suffering from an unusually bad night ’s rest , induced by severer indigestion than common .
He overheard those final words of Bartleby .
111 “ Prefer not , eh ? ” gritted Nippers —
“ I ’d prefer him , if I were you , sir , ” addressing me — “ I ’d prefer him ; I ’d give him preferences , the stubborn mule !
What is it , sir , pray , that he prefers not to do now ? ” 112 Bartleby moved not a limb .
113 “ Mr. Nippers , ” said I , “ I ’d prefer that you would withdraw for the present . ”
114 Somehow , of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word “ prefer ” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions .
And I trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously affected me in a mental way .
And what further and deeper aberration might it not yet produce ?
This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining me to summary means .
115 As Nippers , looking very sour and sulky , was departing , Turkey blandly and deferentially approached .
116 “ With submission , sir , ” said he , “ yesterday I was thinking about Bartleby here , and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day , it would do much towards mending him , and enabling him to assist in examining his papers . ”
117 “ So you have got the word too , ” said I , slightly excited .
118 “ With submission , what word , sir , ” asked Turkey , respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen , and by so doing , making me jostle the scrivener .
“ What word , sir ? ” 119 “ I would prefer to be left alone here , ” said Bartleby , as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy .
120 “ That ’s the word , Turkey , ” said I — “ that ’s it . ” 121 “ Oh , prefer ?
oh yes — queer word .
I never use it myself .
But , sir , as I was saying , if he would but prefer — ” 122 “ Turkey , ” interrupted I , “ you will please withdraw . ” 123 “ Oh , certainly , sir , if you prefer that I should . ”
124 As he opened the folding - door to retire , Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse of me , and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white .
He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer .
It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue .
I thought to myself , surely I must get rid of a demented man , who already has in some degree turned the tongues , if not the heads of myself and clerks .
But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission at once .
125 The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead - wall revery .
Upon asking him why he did not write , he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing .
126 “ Why , how now ? what next ? ” exclaimed I , “ do no more writing ? ” 127 “ No more . ” 128 “ And what is the reason ? ” 129 “ Do you not see the reason for yourself , ” he indifferently replied .
130 I looked steadfastly at him , and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed .
Instantly it occurred to me , that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision .
131 I was touched .
I said something in condolence with him .
I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while ; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air .
This , however , he did not do .
A few days after this , my other clerks being absent , and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail , I thought that , having nothing else earthly to do , Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual , and carry these letters to the post - office .
But he blankly declined .
So , much to my inconvenience , I went myself .
132 Still added days went by .
Whether Bartleby ’s eyes improved or not , I could not say .
To all appearance , I thought they did .
But when I asked him if they did , he vouchsafed no answer .
At all events , he would do no copying .
At last , in reply to my urgings , he informed me that he had permanently given up copying .
133 “ What ! ” exclaimed I ; “ suppose your eyes should get entirely well — better than ever before — would you not copy then ? ”
134 “ I have given up copying , ” he answered , and slid aside .
135 He remained as ever , a fixture in my chamber .
Nay — if that were possible — he became still more of a fixture than before .
What was to be done ?
He would do nothing in the office : why should he stay there ?
In plain fact , he had now become a millstone to me , not only useless as a necklace , but afflictive to bear .
Yet I was sorry for him .
I speak less than truth when I say that , on his own account , he occasioned me uneasiness .
If he would but have named a single relative or friend , I would instantly have written , and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat .
But he seemed alone , absolutely alone in the universe .
A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic .
At length , necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations .
Decently as I could , I told Bartleby that in six days ’ time he must unconditionally leave the office .
I warned him to take measures , in the interval , for procuring some other abode .
I offered to assist him in this endeavor , if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal .
“ And when you finally quit me , Bartleby , ” added I , “ I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided .
Six days from this hour , remember . ”
136 At the expiration of that period , I peeped behind the screen , and lo !
Bartleby was there .
137 I buttoned up my coat , balanced myself ; advanced slowly towards him , touched his shoulder , and said , “ The time has come ; you must quit this place ; I am sorry for you ; here is money ; but you must go . ”
138 “ I would prefer not , ” he replied , with his back still towards me .
139 “ You must . ” 140 He remained silent .
141 Now I had an unbounded confidence in this man ’s common honesty .
He had frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the floor , for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt - button affairs .
The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary .
142 “ Bartleby , ” said I , “ I owe you twelve dollars on account ; here are thirty - two ; the odd twenty are yours .
— Will you take it ? ” and I handed the bills towards him .
143 But he made no motion .
144 “ I will leave them here then , ” putting them under a weight on the table .
Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned and added —
“ After you have removed your things from these offices , Bartleby , you will of course lock the door — since every one is now gone for the day but you — and if you please , slip your key underneath the mat , so that I may have it in the morning .
I shall not see you again ; so good - bye to you .
If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you , do not fail to advise me by letter .
Good - bye , Bartleby , and fare you well . ”
145 But he answered not a word ; like the last column of some ruined temple , he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted room .
146 As I walked home in a pensive mood , my vanity got the better of my pity .
I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby .
Masterly I call it , and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker .
The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness .
There was no vulgar bullying , no bravado of any sort , no choleric hectoring , and striding to and fro across the apartment , jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps .
Nothing of the kind .
Without loudly bidding Bartleby depart — as an inferior genius might have done — I assumed the ground that depart he must ; and upon the assumption built all I had to say .
The more I thought over my procedure , the more I was charmed with it .
Nevertheless , next morning , upon awakening , I had my doubts , —I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity .
One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has , is just after he awakes in the morning .
My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever , — but only in theory .
How it would prove in practice — there was the rub .
It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby ’s departure ; but , after all , that assumption was simply my own , and none of Bartleby ’s .
The great point was , not whether I had assumed that he would quit me , but whether he would prefer so to do .
He was more a man of preferences than assumptions .
147 A FTER breakfast , I walked down town , arguing the probabilities pro and con .
One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure , and Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual ; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty .
And so I kept veering about .
At the corner of Broadway and Canal - street , I saw quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation .
148 “ I ’ll take odds he does n’t , ” said a voice as I passed .
149 “ Does n’t go ? — done ! ” said I , “ put up your money . ”
150 I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own , when I remembered that this was an election day .
The words I had overheard bore no reference to Bartleby , but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty .
In my intent frame of mind , I had , as it were , imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement , and were debating the same question with me .
I passed on , very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary absent - mindedness .
151 As I had intended , I was earlier than usual at my office door .
I stood listening for a moment .
All was still .
He must be gone .
I tried the knob .
The door was locked .
Yes , my procedure had worked to a charm ; he indeed must be vanished .
Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this : I was almost sorry for my brilliant success .
I was fumbling under the door mat for the key , which Bartleby was to have left there for me , when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel , producing a summoning sound , and in response a voice came to me from within —
“ Not yet ; I am occupied . ”
152 It was Bartleby .
153 I was thunderstruck .
For an instant I stood like the man who , pipe in mouth , was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia , by summer lightning ; at his own warm open window he was killed , and remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon , till some one touched him , when he fell .
154 “ Not gone ! ” I murmured at last .
But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me , and from which ascendency , for all my chafing , I could not completely escape , I slowly went down stairs and out into the street , and while walking round the block , considered what I should next do in this unheard - of perplexity .
Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not ; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do ; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea ; and yet , permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me , — this too I could not think of .
What was to be done ?
or , if nothing could be done , was there any thing further that I could assume in the matter ?
Yes , as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart , so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was .
In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption , I might enter my office in a great hurry , and pretending not to see Bartleby at all , walk straight against him as if he were air .
Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home - thrust .
It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions .
But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious .
I resolved to argue the matter over with him again .
155 “ Bartleby , ” said I , entering the office , with a quietly severe expression , “ I am seriously displeased .
I am pained , Bartleby .
I had thought better of you .
I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization , that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would suffice — in short , an assumption .
But it appears I am deceived .
Why , ” I added , unaffectedly starting , “ you have not even touched the money yet , ” pointing to it , just where I had left it the evening previous .
156 He answered nothing .
157 “ Will you , or will you not , quit me ? ” I now demanded in a sudden passion , advancing close to him .
158 “ I would prefer not to quit you , ” he replied , gently emphasizing the not .
159 “ What earthly right have you to stay here ?
Do you pay any rent ?
Do you pay my taxes ?
Or is this property yours ? ” 160 He answered nothing .
161 “ Are you ready to go on and write now ?
Are your eyes recovered ?
Could you copy a small paper for me this morning ?
or help examine a few lines ?
or step round to the post - office ?
In a word , will you do any thing at all , to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises ? ”
162 He silently retired into his hermitage .
163 I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations .
Bartleby and I were alone .
I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter ; and how poor Colt , being dreadfully incensed by Adams , and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited , was at unawares hurried into his fatal act — an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself .
Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject , that had that altercation taken place in the public street , or at a private residence , it would not have terminated as it did .
It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office , up stairs , of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associations — an uncarpeted office , doubtless , of a dusty , haggard sort of appearance ; — this it must have been , which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt .
164 But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Bartleby , I grappled him and threw him .
How ?
Why , simply by recalling the divine injunction : “ A new commandment give I unto you , that ye love one another . ”
Yes , this it was that saved me .
Aside from higher considerations , charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principle — a great safeguard to its possessor .
Men have committed murder for jealousy ’s sake , and anger ’s sake , and hatred ’s sake , and selfishness ’ sake , and spiritual pride ’s sake ; but no man that ever I heard of , ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity ’s sake .
Mere self - interest , then , if no better motive can be enlisted , should , especially with high - tempered men , prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy .
At any rate , upon the occasion in question , I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct .
Poor fellow , poor fellow !
thought I , he do n’t mean any thing ; and besides , he has seen hard times , and ought to be indulged .
165 I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself , and at the same time to comfort my despondency .
I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning , at such time as might prove agreeable to him , Bartleby , of his own free accord , would emerge from his hermitage , and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door .
But no .
Half - past twelve o’clock came ;
Turkey began to glow in the face , overturn his inkstand , and become generally obstreperous ; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy ; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple ; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead - wall reveries .
Will it be credited ?
Ought I to acknowledge it ?
That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him .
166 Some days now passed , during which , at leisure intervals I looked a little into “ Edwards on the Will , ” and “ Priestley on Necessity . ”
Under the circumstances , those books induced a salutary feeling .
Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener , had been all predestinated from eternity , and Bartleby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all - wise Providence , which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom .
Yes , Bartleby , stay there behind your screen , thought I ; I shall persecute you no more ; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs ; in short , I never feel so private as when I know you are here .
At least I see it , I feel it ; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life .
I am content .
Others may have loftier parts to enact ; but my mission in this world , Bartleby , is to furnish you with office - room for such period as you may see fit to remain .
167 I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me , had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms .
But thus it often is , that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous .
Though to be sure , when I reflected upon it , it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby , and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him .
Sometimes an attorney having business with me , and calling at my office , and finding no one but the scrivener there , would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts ; but without heeding his idle talk , Bartleby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room .
So after contemplating him in that position for a time , the attorney would depart , no wiser than he came .
168 Also , when a Reference was going on , and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast ; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present , seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed , would request him to run round to his ( the legal gentleman ’s ) office and fetch some papers for him .
Thereupon , Bartleby would tranquilly decline , and yet remain idle as before .
Then the lawyer would give a great stare , and turn to me .
And what could I say ?
At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance , a whisper of wonder was running round , having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office .
This worried me very much .
And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long - lived man , and keep occupying my chambers , and denying my authority ; and perplexing my visitors ; and scandalizing my professional reputation ; and casting a general gloom over the premises ; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings ( for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day ) , and in the end perhaps outlive me , and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy : as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more , and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room ; a great change was wrought in me .
I resolved to gather all my faculties together , and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus .
169 Ere revolving any complicated project , however , adapted to this end , I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure .
In a calm and serious tone , I commended the idea to his careful and mature consideration .
But having taken three days to meditate upon it , he apprised me that his original determination remained the same ; in short , that he still preferred to abide with me .
170 What shall I do ?
I now said to myself , buttoning up my coat to the last button .
What shall I do ?
what ought I to do ?
what does conscience say I should do with this man , or rather ghost .
Rid myself of him , I must ; go , he shall .
But how ?
You will not thrust him , the poor , pale , passive mortal , — you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door ?
you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty ?
No , I will not , I can not do that .
Rather would I let him live and die here , and then mason up his remains in the wall .
What then will you do ?
For all your coaxing , he will not budge .
Bribes he leaves under your own paperweight on your table ; in short , it is quite plain that he prefers to cling to you .
171 Then something severe , something unusual must be done .
What !
surely you will not have him collared by a constable , and commit his innocent pallor to the common jail ?
And upon what ground could you procure such a thing to be done ?— a vagrant , is he ?
What !
he a vagrant , a wanderer , who refuses to budge ?
It is because he will not be a vagrant , then , that you seek to count him as a vagrant .
That is too absurd .
No visible means of support : there I have him .
Wrong again : for indubitably he does support himself , and that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do .
No more then .
Since he will not quit me , I must quit him .
I will change my offices ; I will move elsewhere ; and give him fair notice , that if I find him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common trespasser .
172 Acting accordingly , next day I thus addressed him : “ I find these chambers too far from the City Hall ; the air is unwholesome .
In a word , I propose to remove my offices next week , and shall no longer require your services .
I tell you this now , in order that you may seek another place . ”
173 He made no reply , and nothing more was said .
174
On the appointed day I engaged carts and men , proceeded to my chambers , and having but little furniture , every thing was removed in a few hours .
Throughout , the scrivener remained standing behind the screen , which I directed to be removed the last thing .
It was withdrawn ; and being folded up like a huge folio , left him the motionless occupant of a naked room .
I stood in the entry watching him a moment , while something from within me upbraided me .
175 I re-entered , with my hand in my pocket — and — and my heart in my mouth .
176 “ Good - bye , Bartleby ; I am going — good - bye , and God some way bless you ; and take that , ” slipping something in his hand .
But it dropped upon the floor , and then , — strange to say — I tore myself from him whom I had so longed to be rid of .
177 Established in my new quarters , for a day or two I kept the door locked , and started at every footfall in the passages .
When I returned to my rooms after any little absence , I would pause at the threshold for an instant , and attentively listen , ere applying my key .
But these fears were needless .
Bartleby never came nigh me .
178 I thought all was going well , when a perturbed looking stranger visited me , inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No. — Wall - street .
179 Full of forebodings , I replied that I was .
180 “ Then sir , ” said the stranger , who proved a lawyer , “ you are responsible for the man you left there .
He refuses to do any copying ; he refuses to do any thing ; he says he prefers not to ; and he refuses to quit the premises . ”
181 “ I am very sorry , sir , ” said I , with assumed tranquillity , but an inward tremor , “ but , really , the man you allude to is nothing to me — he is no relation or apprentice of mine , that you should hold me responsible for him . ”
182 “ In mercy ’s name , who is he ? ” 183 “ I certainly cannot inform you .
I know nothing about him .
Formerly I employed him as a copyist ; but he has done nothing for me now for some time past . ”
184 “ I shall settle him then , — good morning , sir . ” 185 Several days passed , and I heard nothing more ; and though I often felt a charitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby , yet a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me .
186 All is over with him , by this time , thought I at last , when through another week no further intelligence reached me .
But coming to my room the day after , I found several persons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous excitement .
187 “ That ’s the man — here he comes , ” cried the foremost one , whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone .
188 “ You must take him away , sir , at once , ” cried a portly person among them , advancing upon me , and whom I knew to be the landlord of No. — Wall - street .
“ These gentlemen , my tenants , cannot stand it any longer ; Mr. B — — ” pointing to the lawyer , “ has turned him out of his room , and he now persists in haunting the building generally , sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day , and sleeping in the entry by night .
Every body is concerned ; clients are leaving the offices ; some fears are entertained of a mob ; something you must do , and that without delay . ”
189 Aghast at this torrent , I fell back before it , and would fain have locked myself in my new quarters .
In vain I persisted that Bartleby was nothing to me — no more than to any one else .
In vain : —I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him , and they held me to the terrible account .
Fearful then of being exposed in the papers ( as one person present obscurely threatened ) I considered the matter , and at length said , that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener , in his ( the lawyer ’s ) own room , I would that afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of .
190 Going up stairs to my old haunt , there was Bartleby silently sitting upon the banister at the landing .
191 “ What are you doing here , Bartleby ? ” said I. 192 “ Sitting upon the banister , ” he mildly replied .
193 I motioned him into the lawyer ’s room , who then left us .
194 “ Bartleby , ” said I , “ are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me , by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office ? ” 195 No answer .
196 “ Now one of two things must take place .
Either you must do something , or something must be done to you .
Now what sort of business would you like to engage in ?
Would you like to re-engage in copying for some one ? ”
197 “ No ; I would prefer not to make any change . ” 198 “ Would you like a clerkship in a dry - goods store ? ” 199 “ There is too much confinement about that .
No , I would not like a clerkship ; but I am not particular . ” 200 “ Too much confinement , ” I cried , “ why you keep yourself confined all the time ! ” 201 “ I would prefer not to take a clerkship , ” he rejoined , as if to settle that little item at once .
202 “ How would a bar - tender ’s business suit you ?
There is no trying of the eyesight in that . ” 203 “ I would not like it at all ; though , as I said before , I am not particular . ” 204 His unwonted wordiness inspirited me .
I returned to the charge .
205 “ Well then , would you like to travel through the country collecting bills for the merchants ?
That would improve your health . ” 206 “ No , I would prefer to be doing something else . ” 207 “ How then would going as a companion to Europe , to entertain some young gentleman with your conversation , —how would that suit you ? ” 208 “ Not at all .
It does not strike me that there is any thing definite about that .
I like to be stationary .
But I am not particular . ” 209 “ Stationary you shall be then , ” I cried , now losing all patience , and for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly flying into a passion .
“ If you do not go away from these premises before night , I shall feel bound — indeed I am bound — to — to — to quit the premises myself ! ”
I rather absurdly concluded , knowing not with what possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance .
Despairing of all further efforts , I was precipitately leaving him , when a final thought occurred to me — one which had not been wholly unindulged before .
210 “ Bartleby , ” said I , in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances , “ will you go home with me now — not to my office , but my dwelling — and remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure ?
Come , let us start now , right away . ”
211 “ No : at present I would prefer not to make any change at all . ” 212 I answered nothing ; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my flight , rushed from the building , ran up Wall - street towards Broadway , and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed from pursuit .
As soon as tranquillity returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could , both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants , and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty , to benefit Bartleby , and shield him from rude persecution .
I now strove to be entirely care - free and quiescent ; and my conscience justified me in the attempt ; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have wished .
So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants , that , surrendering my business to Nippers , for a few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs , in my rockaway ; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken , and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria .
In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for the time .
213
When again I entered my office , lo , a note from the landlord lay upon the desk .
I opened it with trembling hands .
It informed me that the writer had sent to the police , and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant .
Moreover , since I knew more about him than any one else , he wished me to appear at that place , and make a suitable statement of the facts .
These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me .
At first I was indignant ; but at last almost approved .
The landlord ’s energetic , summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not think I would have decided upon myself ; and yet as a last resort , under such peculiar circumstances , it seemed the only plan .
214 As I afterwards learned , the poor scrivener , when told that he must be conducted to the Tombs , offered not the slightest obstacle , but in his pale unmoving way , silently acquiesced .
215 Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party ; and headed by one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby , the silent procession filed its way through all the noise , and heat , and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon .
216
The same day I received the note I went to the Tombs , or to speak more properly , the Halls of Justice .
Seeking the right officer , I stated the purpose of my call , and was informed that the individual I described was indeed within .
I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a perfectly honest man , and greatly to be compassionated , however unaccountably eccentric .
I narrated all I knew , and closed by suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as possible till something less harsh might be done — though indeed I hardly knew what .
At all events , if nothing else could be decided upon , the alms - house must receive him .
I then begged to have an interview .
217 Being under no disgraceful charge , and quite serene and harmless in all his ways , they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison , and especially in the inclosed grass - platted yards thereof .
And so I found him there , standing all alone in the quietest of the yards , his face towards a high wall , while all around , from the narrow slits of the jail windows , I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves .
218 “ Bartleby ! ” 219 “ I know you , ” he said , without looking round , —“ and I want nothing to say to you . ” 220 “ It was not I that brought you here , Bartleby , ” said I , keenly pained at his implied suspicion .
“ And to you , this should not be so vile a place .
Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here .
And see , it is not so sad a place as one might think .
Look , there is the sky , and here is the grass . ”
221 “ I know where I am , ” he replied , but would say nothing more , and so I left him .
222 As I entered the corridor again , a broad meat - like man , in an apron , accosted me , and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said —
“ Is that your friend ? ” 223 “ Yes . ” 224 “ Does he want to starve ?
If he does , let him live on the prison fare , that ’s all . ” 225 “ Who are you ? ” asked I , not knowing what to make of such an unofficially speaking person in such a place .
226 “ I am the grub - man .
Such gentlemen as have friends here , hire me to provide them with something good to eat . ” 227 “ Is this so ? ” said I , turning to the turnkey .
228 He said it was .
229 “ Well then , ” said I , slipping some silver into the grub - man ’s hands ( for so they called him ) .
“ I want you to give particular attention to my friend there ; let him have the best dinner you can get .
And you must be as polite to him as possible . ”
230 “ Introduce me , will you ? ” said the grub - man , looking at me with an expression which seem to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding .
231 Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener , I acquiesced ; and asking the grub - man his name , went up with him to Bartleby .
232 “ Bartleby , this is Mr. Cutlets ; you will find him very useful to you . ” 233 “ Your sarvant , sir , your sarvant , ” said the grub - man , making a low salutation behind his apron .
“ Hope you find it pleasant here , sir ; — spacious grounds — cool apartments , sir — hope you ’ll stay with us some time — try to make it agreeable .
May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your company to dinner , sir , in Mrs. Cutlets ’ private room ? ” 234 “ I prefer not to dine to - day , ” said Bartleby , turning away .
“ It would disagree with me ; I am unused to dinners . ”
So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure , and took up a position fronting the dead - wall .
235 “ How ’s this ? ” said the grub - man , addressing me with a stare of astonishment .
“ He ’s odd , aint he ? ” 236 “ I think he is a little deranged , ” said I , sadly .
237 “ Deranged ?
deranged is it ?
Well now , upon my word , I thought that friend of yourn was a gentleman forger ; they are always pale and genteel - like , them forgers .
I ca n’t help pity ’em — ca n’t help it , sir .
Did you know Monroe Edwards ? ” he added touchingly , and paused .
Then , laying his hand pityingly on my shoulder , sighed , “ he died of consumption at Sing - Sing .
So you were n’t acquainted with Monroe ? ” 238 “ No , I was never socially acquainted with any forgers .
But I can not stop longer .
Look to my friend yonder .
You will not lose by it .
I will see you again . ” 239 Some few days after this , I again obtained admission to the Tombs , and went through the corridors in quest of Bartleby ; but without finding him .
240 “ I saw him coming from his cell not long ago , ” said a turnkey , “ may be he ’s gone to loiter in the yards . ”
241 So I went in that direction .
242 “ Are you looking for the silent man ? ” said another turnkey passing me .
“ Yonder he lies — sleeping in the yard there .
’ Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down . ”
243 The yard was entirely quiet .
It was not accessible to the common prisoners .
The surrounding walls , of amazing thickness , kept off all sounds behind them .
The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom .
But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot .
The heart of the eternal pyramids , it seemed , wherein , by some strange magic , through the clefts , grass - seed , dropped by birds , had sprung .
244 Strangely huddled at the base of the wall , his knees drawn up , and lying on his side , his head touching the cold stones , I saw the wasted Bartleby .
But nothing stirred .
I paused ; then went close up to him ; stooped over , and saw that his dim eyes were open ; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping .
Something prompted me to touch him .
I felt his hand , when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet .
245 The round face of the grub - man peered upon me now .
“ His dinner is ready .
Wo n’t he dine to - day , either ?
Or does he live without dining ? ” 246 “ Lives without dining , ” said I , and closed the eyes .
247 “ Eh ! —
He ’s asleep , aint he ? ” 248 “ With kings and counsellors , ” murmured I .

There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history .
Imagination will readily supply the meagre recital of poor Bartleby ’s interment .
But ere parting with the reader , let me say , that if this little narrative has sufficiently interested him , to awaken curiosity as to who Bartleby was , and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator ’s making his acquaintance , I can only reply , that in such curiosity I fully share , but am wholly unable to gratify it .
Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor , which came to my ear a few months after the scrivener ’s decease .
Upon what basis it rested , I could never ascertain ; and hence , how true it is I can not now tell .
But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without a certain strange suggestive interest to me , however sad , it may prove the same with some others ; and so I will briefly mention it .
The report was this : that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington , from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration .
When I think over this rumor , I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me .
Dead letters !
does it not sound like dead men ?
Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness , can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters and assorting them for the flames ?
For by the cart - load they are annually burned .
Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring : — the finger it was meant for , perhaps , moulders in the grave ; a bank - note sent in swiftest charity : —he whom it would relieve , nor eats nor hungers any more ; pardon for those who died despairing ; hope for those who died unhoping ; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities .
On errands of life , these letters speed to death .
250 Ah Bartleby !
Ah humanity !

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD
Get this :
You save more fuel switching from a 15 to 18 mpg car than switching from a 50 to 100 mpg car .
Okay , I ’m obsessing .
But apropos of my post yesterday on how SUVs can save the climate , I just calculated this little fact and I had to share .
This assumes , of course , that both cars are driven an equal amount .
( Hat tip is in order for Jon Rynn , commenter at Gristmill . )
So , we should stop trying to design a techno - magic , futuristic “ super - efficient car . ”
It really wo n’t end our oil addiction or save us from climate change .
That ’s right : no more HyperCar and no more FreedomCar .
At least not until we ’ve done the dull and unsexy work of boosting fuel economy at the bottom of the fleet , where it matters far , far , far more .
The real fix for oil addiction is n’t exciting , and it does n’t lend itself to massive research investments .
But the good news is : we just need to do stuff that we already know how to do .
So here ’s my new policy proposal .
While CAFE standards ( fleet averages ) are groovy , what we really need to do is simply outlaw vehicles that get below , say , 15 or 18 mpg .
It ’s easy like that .

Humiliation has developed a bad reputation for itself .
In the damp litter tray of human emotions , people mostly agree that a profound sense of achievement , or even mild titillation , is a much happier feeling than a hot wash of mortified regret .
They are all wrong , and this is why .
About three years ago , I nipped out to the supermarket .
I have nipped out since , but to be honest , it has never been a story worth telling .
I had wheeled my bicycle on to the pavement , and during my pocket - patting inventory check , I realised that I did not have my keys .
I turned back to go inside , as a gust of wind pulled my front door gently to .
Nimble as hell , I hopped towards the door .
A casual observer might have sworn that a fat , hairy gazelle had pranced into the savannas of Ealing .
Sadly , my wallet chain looped treacherously around a fence post , and I crashed to the floor .
From my new disadvantage point , I noticed two things : the front door had shut with a wooden chuckle , and the button of my zip - fly trousers had popped clean off .
I realise this sounds like I have watched too much old TV and decided to steal all the stories for myself , but it is true .
I was locked out with a pair of droopy trousers , and saddled with a ruddy great bike .
I could not ride it - the circular motion wound off my downbelows .
I could not lock it up - its keys were inside with the others .
My flatmates , not usually the types to stray too far from the TV , had chosen this weekend to be 50 miles south in Brighton , and - if this is n't over - egging the pudding , I do n't know what is - Japan .
Hobbled by circumstance , I phoned a few friends , who all agreed that my situation was indeed unfortunate , and why I had chosen to live in a place as deserted and barren as Ealing was quite beyond them .
For some things in life to make dramatic sense - I mean , if you want to honestly feel like you are starring in your own Truman Show - you have to believe you are being watched .
So , I like to think of a cluster of hovering eye - gods jeering at my situation , only to give up in disgust when they find me hiding in a garden and giggling like a grotesquely oversized schoolgirl .
And that was when my day became a life - affirming chick lit novel .
You can't tell someone your trousers have been ripped off without laughing .
It is not as good as a bra catapulting off , granted , but as a man , it is the best I have got .
Like a crap Messiah , I told my story in the nearest coffee shop .
The man laughed , put my bike in the back , and gave me his belt .
The belt he was wearing .
I went to our letting agency , and told my story again .
Estate agents gave me coffee and talked to me , and at no stage did they make me sign a one - sided contract or charge me an admin fee .
They did not have a key , but we both felt that we had done our pariah outreach work for the day .
My embarrassment was peculiarly innocent , I know .
I am aware that my story might not have turned out as jubilantly if I had been caught pleasuring myself in a cinema .
But just imagine if all embarrassment was like this ?
People hopping along in handcuffs and a ballgag , joyfully miming that an adventurous sex act had gone hilariously wrong ?
Fat kids transforming the failure of coming last in a race into a cheeky self - parody , by pulling a Toblerone out of their shirts and winking to an imaginary camera ?
It would be fantastic .
We have got guilt to stop us being evil .
All humiliation does is punish us for being idiotic or naughty - and both those things are brilliant .
It even stops us asking for help .
It makes people laugh at you , sure , and if you are blushing and coy , that laughter can be like having your soul on a bacon slicer .
It is only when you laugh along that you realise that they are more likely remembering the time they got told off for farting in a courtroom .
They will probably do anything to help , short of trading places with you .
As for getting back into the house , it turned out that I had given the mate I was meeting in the pub our spare key when he was between houses .
How 's that for good - deed - rewarded dramatic completeness ?
Almost makes you believe in hovering eye - gods .

One of the great things about Rails and its community is that they are very lazy .
Lazy in the good way of not wanting to do boring , repetitive , error prone things manually .
They metaprogram and they automate .
A great example of this is Capistrano .
Capistrano allows you to deploy Rails applications with ease .
The normal scenario is baked into Capistrano as a deployment convention and then you can customize it if you need to .
My Story
I 've recently redeployed a couple of Ruby on Rails sites using Passenger ( mod_rails ) .
Passenger is an Apache module that really simplifies the deployment of small - scale Rails applications .
Once Passenger is installed and your Rails application is set up as a virtual directory , it just works .
Passenger auto - detects the fact that the directory is a Rails application and runs it for you .
No need for a mongrel cluster or manually configuring load balancing .
I 'm also using Git as my version control system on small , personal projects because it 's easy to use and I can work on multiple laptops and commit locally and worry about pushing to a central location when I have a network connection .
Seeing those things , I wanted to make them all work with Capistrano so that I could continue being lazy .
To do this , I 'm using Capistrano v2.4 .
It has Git support built in that works ( some previous versions had support for Git , but seemed to have a lot of trouble ) .
Git Setup
By convention , Capistrano uses Subversion .
So , I need to change my configuration to use git .
Thedoes this .
The repository information sets up where my git repository lives .
In this case , I 'm just using a bare git repository accessing it over SSH .
You can also access your repository using the git and http protocols if you have that setup .
Thejust says to deploy off of the master branch .
That 's pretty much it - nice and easy .
set :scm , : git set : repository , " [ email protected ] : myapp.git " set : branch , " master " set : deploy_via , :remote_cache
Passenger ( mod_rails ) Setup
The only thing that comes into play with Passenger is restarting the Rails application after a deployment is done .
Passenger has an easy way to do this which is just to create a file calledin the Rails tmp directory .
When it sees that , the Rails application process will be recycled automatically .
Doing this requires just a bit of Capistrano customization .
We need to override the deploy : restart task and have it run a small shell script for us .
In this case we are running run " touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt " to accomplish this task .
namespace : deploy do desc " Restarting mod_rails with restart . txt " task : restart , :roles => :app , : except => { : no_release => true } do run " touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt "
end
We can also override the start and stop tasks because those do n't really do anything in the mod_rails scenario like they would with mongrel or other deployments .
[ : start , : stop ] . each do |t| desc " #{t} task is a no - op with mod_rails " task t , : roles => : app do ; end end end
The Whole Thing
set :application , " enotify " < /p> <p >#
If you are n't deploying to /u / apps / # {application} on the target # servers ( which is the default ) , you can specify the actual location # via the : deploy_to variable : set : deploy_to , " /var/www/ myapp " < /p> #
If you are n't using Subversion to manage your source code , specify # your SCM below : set :scm , : git set : repository , " [ email protected ] : myapp.git " set : branch , " master " set : deploy_via , :remote_cache p > < p > set :user , ' geoff ' set :ssh_options , { :forward_agent => true } < /p > < p>role :app , " zorched.net " role : web , " zorched.net " role : db , " zorched.net " , : primary => true </ p > < p > namespace : deploy do desc " Restarting mod_rails with restart . txt " task : restart , :roles => :app , : except => { : no_release => true } do run " touch # { current_path } /tmp/restart.txt " end < / p> < p > [ : start , : stop ] . each do |t| desc " #{ t } task is a no - op with mod_rails " task t , : roles => : app do ; end end end
Putting everything together in mylooks like the following :
A gentleman knows when and how to tip those who serve him .
The unmannered and uncouth do not .
Tipping an individual , while not mandatory , should always be done .
The only occasion you should not leave a tip is if the service was completely horrendous and the person providing the service made no attempt to remedy the situation .
When tipping , you should do so discreetly .
Showing off how much you tip does not impress people , but only shows you are a shallow cad .
Nonetheless , gray areas in regards to tipping often exist .
So read on gents , as The Art of Manliness answers all your tipping questions .
Why Tip ?
The difference between regular jobs and many jobs that require tips is that they are service jobs , and they are called service jobs because they are directly serving you .
They personally and intimately affect you .
You do not need to always tip people like tow truck drivers or baristas , and you do not have to tip people for doing their job per se .
But you might think about tipping people for the following reasons :
1 ) If the person went above and beyond regular service .
It is just a way of showing gratitude for a job well done and going the extra mile .
Some people say , “ Why do I have to tip people for doing their job ? ”
To them I respond , “ Does the company you work for give bonuses after a project is completed successfully ? ”
And what is a bonus if not just a very large tip ?
When bonuses are offered , people do not generally say “ There is no need to give me a bonus .
I was just doing my job . ”
2 ) To show your gratitude .
Another word for tip is “ gratuity . ”
Many people in service jobs are overworked , underpaid , and unthanked .
At your job when you do something right , your supervisor says “ thank you , ” and “ job well done ! ”
Who says thank you to the trashmen ?
Many service jobs are jobs we do n’t want to do , and we are grateful people are there day in and day out doing them for us .
Our trash gets taken away , our mail gets delivered , our food is served to us .
Their pay often does not match their effort .
Who thinks that teachers ’ pay is commensurate with the work they put in ?
Tipping is a way to say “ thank you ” to those who rarely hear it .
3 ) Tipping ensures great service .
This is especially true of people who perform service for you regularly .
If you tip a barista at a coffee shop you frequent , or a waiter at your favorite restaurant , they will give you even better service next time .
For example , I used to work at a pizza place and when an order came in , if the pizza delivery guy recognized the name , and remembered they were a big tipper , they would bust their butt to get the order out .
They would even take the tipper their order BEFORE orders that had come in earlier .
If an order came up for a name they recognized as a bad tipper , they would deliver that order later .
Similarly , when I worked at smoothie place , this one customer would tip us very heavily every time she came in .
So during her visits we were practically falling over ourselves to get her order out .
We would start making it even before she paid .
And we would always throw in extra goodies .
So in things you do regularly , generous tipping is certainly not essential , but can guarantee you better service .
4 ) That person ’s livelihood depends on our tipping .
An unsettling number of people do n’t seem to realize that many service workers in the US , like waitresses , do not get a regular hourly wage .
They get paid something like $ 2.50 an hour .
If you do n’t tip , they could end up making less than minimum wage .
Tipping in these cases is not optional , but necessary .
I know our non-American readers will criticize a system that does n’t pay everyone a decent wage with benefits .
But such criticism will not change the current reality .
Plus , if companies were to start paying everyone a living wage plus benefits then the cost of goods and services would rise .
Thus , you would end up paying out of your pocket anyway .
So if you deeply believe in everyone receiving a fair wage , then why not do your part to make it a reality now ?
“ What money is better bestowed than that of a schoolboy ’s tip ?
How the kindness is recalled by the recipient in after days !
It blesses him that gives and him that takes . ”
~ William Makepeace Thackeray

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With gas prices rising , gas - saving advice abounds :
Drive more gently , do n't carry extra stuff in your trunk , combine your shopping trips .
This is all sound advice but there 's one driving tip that will probably save you more gas than all the others , especially if you spend a lot of time on the highway : Slow down .
In a typical family sedan , every 10 miles per hour you drive over 60 is like the price of gasoline going up about 54 cents a gallon .
That figure will be even higher for less fuel - efficient vehicles that go fewer miles on a gallon to start with .
The reason is as clear as the air around you .
When cruising on the highway , your car will be in its highest gear with the engine humming along at relatively low rpm's .
All your car needs to do is maintain its speed by overcoming the combined friction of its own moving parts , the tires on the road surface and , most of all , the air flowing around , over and under it .
Pushing air around actually takes up about 40 % of a car 's energy at highway speeds , according to Roger Clark , a fuel economy engineer for General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) .
Traveling faster makes the job even harder .
More air builds up in front of the vehicle , and the low pressure " hole " trailing behind gets bigger , too .
Together , these create an increasing suction that tends to pull back harder and harder the faster you drive .
The increase is actually exponential , meaning wind resistance rises much more steeply between 70 and 80 mph than it does between 50 and 60 .
Every 10 mph faster reduces fuel economy by about 4 mpg , a figure that remains fairly constant regardless of vehicle size , Clark said .
( It might seem that a larger vehicle , with more aerodynamic drag , would see more of an impact .
But larger vehicles also tend to have larger , more powerful engines that can more easily cope with the added load . )
That 's where that 54 cents a gallon estimate comes from .
If a car gets 28 mpg at 65 mph , driving it at 75 would drop that to 24 mpg .
Fuel costs over 100 miles , for example - estimated at $ 3.25 a gallon - would increase by $ 1.93 , or the cost of an additional 0.6 gallons of gas .
That would be like paying 54 cents a gallon more for each of the 3.6 gallons used at 65 mph .
That per -gallon price difference remains constant over any distance .
Engineers at Consumer Reports magazine tested this theory by driving a Toyota Camry sedan and a Mercury Mountaineer SUV at various set cruising speeds on a stretch of flat highway .
Driving the Camry at 75 mph instead of 65 dropped fuel economy from 35 mpg to 30 .
For the Mountaineer , fuel economy dropped from 21 to 18 .
Over the course of a 400 - mile road trip , the Camry driver would spend about $ 6.19 more on gas at the higher speed and Mountaineer driver would spend an extra $ 10.32 .
Driving even slower , say 55 mph , could save slightly more gas .
In fact , the old national 55 mph speed limit , instituted in 1974 , was a response to the period 's energy crisis .
It was about more than just high gas prices , though .
The crisis of the time involved literal gasoline shortages due to an international embargo .
Gas stations were sometimes left with none to sell , and gas sales had to be rationed .
The crisis passed , but the national 55 mph speed limit stayed on the books until the law was loosened in the 1980s .
It was finally dropped altogether in 1995 .
( The law stuck around more because of an apparent safety benefit than for fuel saving . )
Despite today 's high gas prices , do n't expect to see a return to the national 55 mph speed limit .
The law was unpopular in its day , and higher speeds have become so institutionalized that even the Environmental Protection Agency 's fuel economy test cycle now includes speeds of up to 80 mph .
Driving 10 miles per hour faster , assuming you do n't lose time getting pulled over for a speeding ticket , does have the advantage of getting you to your destination 50 minutes sooner on that 400 mile trip .
Whether that time difference is worth the added cost and risk is , ultimately , up to you .
SUDBURY - Looking out at a lushly wooded area beyond a stone wall on her 100 - acre estate , Carole Wolfe 's face darkened .
There , in the distance , she said , nervously pointing a finger , stretches a former rail corridor that , if some have their way , could bring trouble upon this town where her family 's roots date to Colonial times .
" Instead of solitude , " Wolfe said , " you 'd be having people . "
Wolfe is among a band of vocal Sudbury residents raising the alarm against a proposed bike trail along a pathway where trains once chugged .
Opponents of the " rail trail " say the path would draw hundreds of thousands of bicyclists who would bring with them noise and other disruptions into what is now a pristine landscape .
Hordes of bikers , walkers , and rollerbladers would scare away wildlife , they say , and invite crime from trespassing to vandalism and assault .
" We do n't have neighbors nearby , " said Marianne Maurer , whose family 's tree farm is bisected by the proposed bike trail .
" If something happened , no one would hear us yelling . "
The Sudbury trail would be a segment of the proposed 25 - mile Bruce Freeman trail beginning at the Lowell - Chelmsford line and winding to Framingham .
With gas prices escalating and alternative transportation increasingly popular , bike trail supporters say their decades - long push for the trail is now a no - brainer .
Connecting to major mass transit hubs , such as the West Concord commuter rail terminal , it would provide a good alternative to driving , they argue .
" The public benefit far outweighs any other concerns , " said Tom Michelman , president of Friends of the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail , honoring the late longtime state representative from Chelmsford .
The trail would be part of a web of more than 100 miles of bike trails planned for Massachusetts that state officials say could one day permit riders to bike 120 miles from Lowell to Westfield , or along the Mystic River to the beaches of Lynn .
The big vision has proved challenging to knit together , with efforts often meeting intense local opposition .
The drive to build the Freeman trail gained significant momentum in October when ground was broken on a portion of it - a 6.8 - mile run through Chelmsford and Westford .
Concord residents , after a fractious debate at Town Meeting in April , approved a preliminary design for the trail segment that would run through that town .
Framingham , at the southern tip of the proposed trail , has just begun appraising , at selectmen 's request , the cost of purchasing the right of way owned by CSX Corp .
where the trail would run , said Julian Suso , the town manager .
Sudbury remains a holdout .
The wealthy hamlet of stately Colonials and rolling farmland , where change comes slowly , could obstruct plans for a continuous path .
Opponents of the rail trail in Sudbury - who created Sudbury Citizens for Responsible Land Stewardship to fight the plan - say they are prepared for a lengthy battle .
Jim Nigrelli , president of Sudbury Citizens , called the rail - trail advocates " strong - minded " ; other opponents are more blunt .
A mysterious " coalition " that is starting to look like a corporate SWAT team has filed more redacted confidential comments with the Federal Communications Commission .
These demand that XM and Sirius satellite radio conduct internal staff purges and pay the United States Treasury millions of dollars in restitution for allegedly misleading the public about their intentions .
" The Commission should compel XM and Sirius to disgorge their unjust enrichment , " the Consumer Coalition for Competition in Satellite Radio or " C3SR " declared on Wednesday .
" This forfeiture would likely be in excess of $ 250 million . "
As Ars Technica has reported , the C3SR group is light on " consumers " and heavy on professional corporate lobbyists .
These include two former officials in the Reagan administration : Steven R. Valentine and Emanuel L. Rouvelas , both of whom now work for the K&L Gates law firm .
K&L Gates lobbies for Microsoft , T - Mobile USA , and dozens of other companies .
C3SR also includes attorney Julian Shepard , former senior policy adviser to the National Association of Broadcasters , who now works for the coalition 's legal representative : Williams Mullen .
C3SR 's latest filing does n't call for Sirius ' Mel Karmazin to be sent to the slammer , but its tone comes close .
It asks the Commission to demand a " mandatory disgorging of ill - gotten gains by the Merger Parties " ( XM and Sirius ) .
Why ?
C3SR argues that when both satellite radio companies ' parties participated in FCC Auction 15 and bought the licenses that they 've broadcast on since , they got a break in the price .
That 's because the spectrum properties were " encumbered by a public interest obligation " — the requirement that the license winners build interoperable receivers that can access all satellite radio services .
XM and Sirius never kept that pledge .
The C3SR group has been sending the FCC redacted confidential papers that it claims prove that Sirius and XM 's refusal to come through on interoperability should be seen as " the culmination of a coordinated plan to restrain trade in contravention of the public interest and in violation of the Commission 's rules and policies and of the antitrust laws . "
Sirius / XM " should be required to make restitution to all parties harmed by such conduct , " C3SR declared last week , although it did n't explain how .
Now it has .
This wo n't hurt a bit
Before any merger plan is established , C3SR recommends that the FCC make XM and Sirius agree to " permanently dismiss all officers , directors , and employees of the predecessor licenses ( XM and Sirius ) who participated in , or had knowledge of , or conspired in violation of the FCC 's rules .
. . . "
Although the rest of the sentence is redacted , this probably refers to what C3SR sees as XM and Sirius ' dishonesty in assuring the Commission that the companies would develop an interoperable receiver .
C3SR estimates that had the FCC conducted its Auction 15 without the interoperable receiver requirement , it might have generated about $ 440 million in auction proceeds .
The actual Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service ( SDARS ) auction winnings were $ 173.2 million .
Therefore Sirius and XM owe the government at least $ 267 million , in the coalition 's view .
Plus : " restitution for lost spectrum auction proceeds must include 11 years of interest , " the group calculates .
In addition , C3SR calls for XM and Sirius to " make restitution " to all the XM and Sirius subscribers who never received interoperable receivers .
At minimum , all subscribers should get one now ( none exists , by the way ) .
" In addition , " C3SR writes , " the Commission should require refunds to , or free interoperable receiver replacements for , those subscribers who purchased more than one satellite radio receiver . "
Finally , the Merger Parties — XM and Sirius — must give up one of their satellite licenses , C3SR says .
This divestiture would honor the FCC 's rule against a monopoly controlling the whole SDARS service ( a rule that the FCC could waive ) .
To create a level playing field for a new satellite radio entrant , the Commission should also make the Merger Parties give up " exclusive arrangements with programmers , retailers , and manufacturers , " and honor FCC established program access requirements " to permit the new entrant to acquire sufficient programming to be competitive in the short - run . "
How soon is " soon " ?
On the same day that C3SR launched their latest torpedo against XM / Sirius , FCC Chair Kevin Martin appeared on CNBC and fielded a variety of questions from three of the show 's reporters .
In the recent past Martin has said he hopes the Commission will come to a decision on the merger by the end of this month .
Now he just said that " I expect the Commission will hopefully be able to do something on it soon . "
That answer did n't satisfy one of his interviewers .
" Are n't you under some obligation here to finally give — it 's been a year and a half , " he asked .
" I mean how is it possible it can be so long to review a potential deal and are n't you some obligation to answer these guys if not today , tomorrow , or very soon ? "
" Well you know I think we are under an obligation but I think this is a very unusual circumstance .
I mean we actually have a rule that out right prohibits this merger , " Martin replied .
" So , I think that they 're asking for something extraordinary and I think the Commission is taking a close look at it .
But I do hope we will be able to get back to them soon . "

Volcanism has played a more extensive role in shaping the surface of Mercury than scientists had thought .
This result comes from multispectral imaging data gathered in January 2008 by MESSENGER , the latest spacecraft to visit the sun 's innermost planet .
MESSENGER data has also identified and mapped surface rock units that correspond to lava flows , volcanos , and other geological features .
At the same time , the spacecraft 's suite of instruments has confirmed an apparent planet - wide iron deficiency in Mercury 's surface rocks .
MESSENGER ( short for MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ) is the first spacecraft to visit Mercury since NASA 's Mariner 10 made three flyby passes in 1974 and 1975 .
MESSENGER , which is operated for NASA by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , will make two more Mercury flybys ( Oct. 6 , 2008 and Sept. 29 , 2009 ) before going into orbit around the planet , March 18 , 2011 .
Mercury and MESSENGER form the subject of 11 papers in a special section devoted to the January flyby in the July 4 , 2008 , issue of the scientific journal Science .
Mark S. Robinson of Arizona State University is the lead author for a paper in the issue which spotlights data on composition variations in Mercury 's surface rocks using their multispectral colors .
Robinson , a professor of geology in ASU 's School of Earth and Space Exploration , part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences , is a co-investigator on the MESSENGER geology science team .
Besides Robinson , the multispectral paper has 12 additional co-authors from other institutions .
" We have now imaged half of the part of Mercury that was never seen by Mariner 10 , " says Robinson .
" The picture is still incomplete , but we 'll get the other half on October 6 . "
Back in 1974 - 1975 , the orbital trajectory that let Mariner to make three passes at Mercury limited it to photographing less than half the planet 's surface .
This left the rest of Mercury unknown until MESSENGER 's arrival in January let scientists begin to fill in the gaps .

Lava plains
MESSENGER 's big - picture finding , says Robinson , is the widespread role played by volcanism .
While impact craters are common , and at first glance Mercury still resembles the moon , much of the planet has been resurfaced through volcanic activity .
" For example , according to our color data the Caloris impact basin is completely filled with smooth plains material that appears volcanic in origin , " Robinson explains .
" In shape and form these deposits are very similar to the mare basalt flows on the moon .
But unlike the moon , Mercury 's smooth plains are low in iron , and thus represent a relatively unusual rock type . "
The Caloris plains , he adds , cover at least a million square kilometers ( 390,000 square miles ) , or big enough to engulf Arizona , Nevada , and California put together .
The plains ' size implies the existence of large sources of magma in Mercury 's upper mantle .
Multispectral imaging also shows that besides lava flows , Caloris has " red spots , " which also appear volcanic .
" Red spots have diffuse boundaries and sometimes lie centered on rimless depressions , " Robinson says .
" Right now they look to be caused by explosive , pyroclastic eruptions . "
In addition , Robinson notes , three major rock units stand out in MESSENGER 's multispectral imaging .

" We mapped the new hemisphere using moderate resolution images of 5 kilometers [ 3 miles ] per pixel , " he says .
" As on the Mariner hemisphere , we saw three major units defined by their colors .
These units are relatively high - reflectance smooth plains , average cratered terrain , and low - reflectance material . "
Where 's the iron ?
The low - reflectance material is particularly enigmatic , says Robinson .
" It 's an important and widespread rock that occurs deep in the crust as well as at the surface , yet it has very little ferrous iron in its silicate minerals . "
That , he says , makes it unusual .
" You expect to find low - reflectance volcanic rocks having a high abundance of iron - bearing silicate minerals , but that 's not the case here . "
One possible solution , he says , is that iron is actually present but invisible to MESSENGER 's spectrometers because it 's hidden within the chemical structure of minerals such as ilmenite .
Solving the paradox should help scientists unravel Mercury 's history .
" If you want to understand how a planet has evolved , " Robinson explains , " you need to know about the minerals in its crust and mantle .
Unfortunately , we are not going to be able to drill into Mercury for a long time to come .
All we can do is study its volcanic rocks in detail .
They give a glimpse into the planet 's mantle . "
" Right now , " says Robinson , " it looks as if Mercury formed with a deficiency in ferrous iron .
But we 'll know more about its bulk composition , and thus its history , once MESSENGER gets into orbit in 2011 .
That 's when the surface rocks can be studied much more closely , using the full set of instruments . "

The 10 zeros proved to be a stumbling block
A man in the US state of Texas has been arrested for allegedly trying to cash a cheque for $ 360 bn ( £ 182bn ) .
Charles Ray Fuller had said he wanted to start a record business , authorities in the state said .
The 21 - year - old 's attempt to cash the money in a bank in Fort Worth failed when staff spotted the 10 zeros on the personal cheque .
Mr Fuller was arrested on a charge of forgery and was released on bail of $ 3,750 ( £ 1,900 ) .
$ 1 m scams
The man from North Texas said he had been given the cheque by his girlfriend 's mother .
The bank said it had contacted the account owner and had been told she had not given Mr Fuller permission to either take or cash the cheque .
Fort Worth police said Mr Fuller also faced charges of unlawfully carrying a weapon and possessing cannabis .
Officers said a small amount of cannabis and a . 25 - calibre pistol were found in his pocket .
In October last year a man in the city of Pittsburgh was arrested after he handed over a counterfeit $ 1 m bill to a cashier at a supermarket and asked for change .
Three years earlier a woman was arrested after trying to use a fake $ 1 m bill at a supermarket in Georgia .
In Berlin today , Barack Obama capped his European tour with an address to an audience whose numbers reached tens of thousands .
But while the media will focus on Obama 's call to strengthen America 's trans -Atlantic alliance with France and Germany , no doubt absent from the coverage will be John McCain 's essential role in undermining it .
As it turns out , back in 2003 John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with the Berlin - bashers and Paris - hating purveyors of " freedom fries " and " old Europe . "
As President Bush prepared to pull the trigger on the Iraq war in February 2003 , John McCain was at the forefront of those browbeating the Chirac government for France 's refusal to back the U.S. at the United Nations .
On February 10 , 2003 , McCain declared on MSNBC's Hardball :
" Look , I do n't mean to try to be snide , but the Lord said the poor will always be with us .
The French will always be with us , too . "
The next day on February 11 , 2003 , McCain co-sponsored a Senate resolution praising 18 European nations backing U.S. enforcement of UN demands for Saddam 's disarmament .
In his press release , McCain echoed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in thundering at the France and Germany of " old Europe : "
" The majority of Europe 's democracies have spoken , and their message could not be clearer : France and Germany do not speak for Europe ... most European governments behave like allies that are willing to meet their responsibilities to uphold international peace and security in defense of our common values .
We thank this European majority for standing with us . "
McCain 's venom towards the French and Germans was on full display two days later during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
On February 13 , 2003 , McCain warned of " new threats to civilization [ which ] again defy our imagination in scale and potency " portrayed Iraq as " threat of the first order . "
He proclaimed that " the United States does not have reliable allies to implement a policy to contain Iraq " and pointed the finger squarely at France :
" Compare our great power allies in the Cold War with those with whom we act today in dealing with Iraq .
France has unashamedly pursued a concerted policy to dismantle the UN sanctions regime , placing its commercial interests above international law , world peace and the political ideals of Western civilization .
Remember them ?
Liberte , egalite , fraternite ... ... Gerhard Schroeder 's Germany looks little like the ally that anchored our presence in Europe throughout the Cold War .
A German Rip Van Winkle from the 1960s would not understand the lack of political courage and cooperation with its allies on the question of Iraq exhibited in Berlin today . "
Just days later on February 18 , 2003 , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's Lateline program showed a furious McCain foaming at the mouth over France :
Here 's how influential Senator John McCain sees the French .
JOHN MCCAIN , REPUBLICAN SENATOR :
They remind me of an aging movie actress in the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but does n't have the face for it .
NORMAN HERMANT : Many in Washington are now saying relations with France have been a problem going all the way back to the end of World War II .
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN : Perhaps Churchill and Roosevelt made a very serious mistake when they decided to give France a veto in the Security Council when the United Nations was organized .
McCain 's feud with the French continued even after the start of hostilities and President Bush 's May 1 declaration of " mission accomplished " in Iraq .
But in a cynical July 2003 keynote address to the Atlantic Partnership ( which promotes " the benefits of a strong and stable Atlantic community of nations " ) , Senator McCain acted as if he had never uttered his seething words of condemnation .
Even in papering over the schism he helped foster , McCain could n't resist taking a potshot at France :
" France and Germany shared the goals of our campaign to disarm Saddam Hussein 's regime .
We obviously disagreed over the means .
Now that we have achieved our common objective of ending the threat posed by Saddam 's Iraq , it 's time to stop quarreling over the way we did so and move on .
European nations that opposed the war must resist the tendency to say " I told you so , " sit on the sidelines as the United States and our partners attempt to transform Iraq , and hope we find ourselves in a sandy quagmire that , in the eyes of some war opponents , would give us our just due ... ... The United States must resist the tendency to punish our friends who did not support how we went to war , because things could have turned out differently .
By the admission of Germany 's leading opposition figures , who lost a close election to the current chancellor 's coalition , a government in Berlin led by them would have stood with the United States in the diplomatic campaign preceding the war .
France would have been isolated in its opposition , unable to claim to speak for Europe . "
But that was five years ago .
The United States , humbled by its humiliating fiasco in Iraq , is in no position to say " I told you so " to anyone .
French President Chirac and German Chancellor Shroeder , persistent thorns in the side of the Bush administration , are gone , replaced by the more complaint conservative cheerleaders in Paris and Berlin , Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel , respectively .
And most importantly , John McCain is now running for the White House and needing to project a presidential image during his European tour .
So it 's no surprise why John McCain reversed course and discovered his " friendship " with France during a March visit to Paris .
In the New York Times Monday , Republican water carrier Bill Kristol mocked Barack Obama 's looming address in Berlin and its " anodyne message his campaign advertised Sunday - a discussion of the ' historic U.S. - German partnership ' and strengthening trans- Atlantic relations . "
Given the frayed state of the U.S. relationship with Europe , that is a vitally important message for the next American president - whoever it may be - to deliver .
As Barack Obama clearly understands , it 's not too soon to begin to repairing the Atlantic partnership that was so weakened by George W. Bush and John McCain .
SACRAMENTO , California ( CNN ) --
For more than two years , undercover cops on the Sacramento Police Department 's vice squad have been working one of the most draining beats : trying to crack down on online child prostitution .
Sacramento police have nabbed nearly 70 underage girls for child prostitution since 2005 .
Police have nabbed nearly 70 girls under the age of 18 since 2005 .
Most of the girls were released to foster or group homes .
Those are just the official figures ; investigators think there are many more child prostitutes out there .
It is no easy task .
" We 're asking these girls to do a big thing ... which is to stop what they 're doing , " said Sgt. Pam Seyffert of the Sacramento Police Department .
" Stop what 's working for them .
Surviving is basically what they 're doing . "
Sacramento police are working with the FBI as part of a nationwide campaign to combat underage prostitution called Innocence Lost .
The goal of the program , which is now in almost 30 U.S. cities , is to decriminalize the girls and concentrate on catching the pimps who control them .
" It really makes me angry , " Seyffert said .
" I think everybody on the team has different reactions to it , but I just flat out get really angry that some guy thinks he can take this girl and basically deprive her of her freedom . "
It is not uncommon for the officers on the unit to put in 30 - hour shifts .
Oftentimes , their work is heart - wrenching .
Watch how investigators work to catch pimps »
Child prostitution is even tougher on the parents of these girls .
Roslyn and Sergio 's daughter had been missing for more than two weeks .
They waited for hours at police headquarters in hopes that their daughter would be found .
Vice squad officers found her in a downtown apartment with Bruce William Carter , a 21 - year - old man who police said had posed on the Internet holding fistfuls of cash .
He pleaded not guilty to charges of statutory rape and was held in lieu of $ 35,000 bail .
The couple 's daughter , who had just turned 17 , was detained but not arrested .
" It hurt , " said Roslyn , who appeared weary and a bit shell - shocked .
" Because you do n't want to see your children involved in things like this .
You do n't realize how dangerous the Internet is .
Now , we got to keep her away from the Internet . "
Police say most of the ads appear on Craigslist , the popular and free Internet classifieds site , under a category named " Erotic Services . "
Even though Craigslist has posted a bold disclaimer warning against human trafficking and the exploitation of children , law enforcement officials said it does n't seem to deter girls from posting the ads or men who are searching for sex .
But why would a girl sell her body online ?
To help answer that question , Sacramento police made arrangements for CNN to interview a 14 - year - old girl who said she 'd started selling herself as a prostitute at the age of 11 .
" I wanted to feel loved .
... I wanted to feel important , " said the teen , who did not want to be identified .
She said she used Craigslist because it was free and she could post dozens of ads a day .
Even though she understood the seriousness of what she was doing , she said she did n't care .
" You could put stuff in your ad like ' wet and wild , ' ' fun and sassy , ' things like that to catch their attention , to make them want you , " she said .
Craigslist executives said they abhor the fact that their site is being used for child prostitution but believe that the problem could be harder to track if they removed the category .
" It would be a bigger problem if we removed that category and had those ads spread throughout the site , " said Jim Buckmaster , chief executive officer of Craigslist .
Both legal experts and police say Craigslist bears no legal responsibility .
Undercover officers said the fact that the listings can be traced helps them pinpoint the girls and sometimes leads them to pimps .
For her part , Roslyn has a strong message for the man arrested in connection with her daughter 's detention .
" I want him to stay away from my daughter , " she said .
" I 'm going to put a restraining order on him .
Every time he goes near my daughter , I 'm going to call the police and have him put in jail . "
Even though they have more work than they can handle , vice officers hold out hope that they can save more girls from a life of prostitution .
All About Human Trafficking • Child Abuse
I 'm so happy to be back .
My thanks to all those who were kind enough to be in touch to say that you missed me .
You were well served by my distinguished stand - ins , however , and thanks go to them , too , for keeping Dork Talk alive .
But let 's get straight to business : an extra-long column for openers , for this month sees another Apple launch .
Whatever one 's view of Apple as a manufacturer of digital equipment , as an author of operating systems and designer of software , as a multinational corporation , as a lifestyle statement or as a quasi- religious cult , it remains a matter of ineluctable fact that the introduction of the iPhone just over a year ago changed the smartphone market for ever .
An incredible three - quarters of all mobile web browsing is now done on the iPhone , despite its market share being far smaller than that of either Windows Mobile , BlackBerry / Java or Nokia / Symbian devices .
i Phone users report an unprecedented level of customer satisfaction ( between 82 % and 90 % , compared with the second placed BlackBerry at 50 % ) .
This is not a surprise to anyone who has lived with an iPhone for even a short while , and even less of a surprise to anyone who has also had to work with a WinMob phone .
Let 's be clear about the iPhone 's shortcomings , however : this unparalleled success has been achieved by an expensive device with only a 2 megapixel camera , EDGE rather than 3G data speeds , no video , no GPS , no contact search , no file or text manipulation , no Enterprise or MS Exchange capabilities , no third - party applications and a locked - in network operator deal .
I said at its launch that this revolutionary implement would thrill early adopters but be prohibitively expensive and under- functional for many others : " Wait for iPhone Three , " I wrote , " that 'll be the one that gets it right . "
A year of living with iPhone One has proved to me that the camera lens and its operation is good enough to produce better photos than phones with twice the resolution , that EDGE speeds allow swift email and full browsing in most areas of the country , that the Google Maps implementation and music , video and photo playback are stunningly impressive , and that other deficiencies are made up for by the sob - worthy beauty , elegance and lovability of another Jonathan Ive-designed Apple masterpiece .
Nonetheless , we want it all , and huge numbers of people have been fretfully awaiting iPhone Two : queuing began in New York a week and half before launch date ; O2 , the sole UK network provider , had its site go down hours after announcing pre-booking ; the BBC 's technology site is so afraid of looking as though it " favours " Apple in some way that it has been failing to file legitimate stories for fear of the anti-Apple community , because , believe it or not , there are people out there who think the launch of yet another Nokia or WinMob Apple - a - like should be given equal prominence .
Well , finally , here it is , the iPhone 3G , hardly different at all in look or feel from iPhone One .
The back , available in black or white , is now plastic , which offers better reception for the 10 radios hidden inside - four GSM ( your standard quad band ) , three UMTS / HSDPA ( your 3G ) plus one each for A - GPS , Wi-Fi and Bluetooth .
A standard earphone socket replaces the unpopular recessed jack and the switches are now metal .
This new phone 's greatness is not revealed in its outer lineaments , however , gorgeous as they are , software is crucial .
Simultaneous with its release comes Version 2.0 of the operating system .
Exchange and enterprise capability ( for BlackBerry - style " push email " ) has arrived , meaning that the iPhone is now a serious corporate contender : employee pester - power will see to it that it becomes the tool of choice for medium to large businesses that are n't so pompous and deluded as to think dullness and bad design are a sign of probity and business acumen .
What else is new ?
The camera is the same .
Contacts are finally searchable , a fuller range of email attachments can now be read and saved , a server - side push system for mail , events and contacts called Mobile Me has been introduced ( subscription required ) and , most importantly of all , Version 2.0 users ( including those with original iPhones ) will find an " Installer " icon on their home screen .
This will be familiar to rebellious criminals like me who " jailbroke " their original iPhones months ago .
It means that the power of the iPhone as a beautiful , smooth and function - rich handheld computer can now be realised .
Anyone may now write for the iPhone .
Existing applications ( games , utilities , ebooks , dictionaries and so forth ) already written for other platforms can be ported into Apple 's elegant and intuitive developer 's kit with astonishing ease .
All applications have to be downloaded through the iTunes store .
Believe me , in a very few weeks you will see things being done on an iPhone that will make you gasp and stretch your eyes .
The built - in accelerometer alone will inspire people to amazing new heights of ingenuity .
The accelerometer is a sensor that knows which way up the iPhone is : you can expect pedometer software , software that plays you music chosen according to how fast you are walking and where you are walking ( thanks to the GPS ) , spirit levels , pinball games with tilt , games in which the iPhone itself is the steering wheel , apps that show you on a map where friends are - we cannot even guess what is coming .
I should digress here to point out that the latest HTC Touch Diamond ( HTC is a wonderful manufacturer permanently hamstrung by its devices all being Windows Mobile ) has an accelerometer , too , and comes with a ball - manipulation game that provides tactile feedback - you can actually feel the weight and bounce of the ball as you manoeuvre it .
For the rest , it is yet another iPhone wannabe : it is too small , its multi - touch interface is too slow on the uptake and the whole experience is rather fiddly .
It does have the best browser on a pocket PC I 've yet seen , however , and for those determined not to go Apple , it is ( thanks to the market - changing influence of the iPhone ) a superior model of its kind ( RRP £ 499 , htc.com for stockists ) .
Unlike the iPhone 3G , the Diamond also has a front - facing camera ( for video calls and video IM ) .
What else is the iPhone 3G missing ?
No text manipulation ( not even basic cut and paste ) , no Flash plug-ins for the browser , no video recording , no voice memos .
Third parties will probably address these software issues , but it would have been better if Apple had solved them itself .
Perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is price .
Apple , in harness with its network providers across the globe , has slashed the cost of both the 8GB and 16GB models .
O2 in this country will offer the phone for less than £ 100 , or free , according to tariff and other criteria ( from Apple , O2 and Carphone Warehouse stores .
The iPhone 3G 8G is free on the £ 45 and £ 75 tariffs , £ 99 on the £ 30 and £ 35 tariffs ; the iPhone 3G 16GB is free on the £ 75 tariff , £ 159 on the £ 30 and £ 35 tariff , £ 59 on the £ 45 tariff .
Go to o2. co.uk / iphone / paymonthly for full details ) .
You are tied to their network , but the all - you - can - eat data package works out as excellent value , given the amount of browsing and downloading you are likely to do .
3G is of little interest to me , as it happens - by the time coverage arrives in rural Norfolk , the rest of the world will be 6G .
In conclusion : some will be disappointed by the phone itself , because they will have expected greater and more fundamental physical changes and improvements .
In fact , I still maintain that the third iPhone will be the perfect device .
But that is to take nothing away from what July 11 heralded : not evolution but revolution .
Now that the Applications store is up and running , you will soon find it a very common sight indeed to see people crowded around each other 's iPhones showing off the latest impossible , breathtaking and groundbreaking application .
" Ah , but mine can do this ! " will be heard in every cafe and bar .
Satirical sketches will be written and performed on Channel 4 mocking the trend .
Once again , Apple has changed the rules , and nothing will ever be quite the same again .

In June the Swedish parliament passed a controversial surveillance law that gives authorities a mandate to read all email and listen in on all phone calls without warrant or court order .
In response to the law , The Pirate Party organized rallies , bloggers and journalists turned into activists , and even Google decided to relocate their servers .
The aftermath of the vote on wiretapping legislation has been turbulent , to say the least .
Bloggers have not wasted a minute in their criticism , mainstream media eventually caught up and the newspapers are now running stories and editorials every day .
Various viral campaigns have flourished along with grassroots activism and The Pirate Party has hauled full sails to catch the wind that will blow them straight into European Parliament during the elections of 2009 .
That ’s not all .
Google and former public telecoms company Telia moved their servers out of Sweden .
Belgium says it will sue Sweden since Belgian citizens may be wiretapped without any apparent reason .
Anne Ramberg , secretary - general of the Swedish Bar Association , has called for challenges to the law in Swedish and European courts and similar demands have been heard from several other interest groups , like the Journalist ’s Union .
It ’s FRA hunting season this summer in Sweden !
It is now obvious that the legislation was a deal made between the leaders of the four government parties without full support , even from within their own ranks .
Active party members resigned in protest , like Fabian Norlin of the Moderate party who quit on June 24 and instead launched FRApedia , a Wiki covering everything about the law and the authorities .
Meanwhile , the people responsible have not uttered a word in defense of the legislation .
They have n’t even tried to justify it .
In fact , the few quotes that were made referred in smug terms to the nature of the debate and the debaters .
Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said “ It would be best for everyone if the debate would calm down . ”
Others have called your - rights - online - bloggers “ spirited amateurs ” , sparking even more fury .
During the time since the vote , the Members of Parliament have appeared everything from sad through to ridiculously stupid when trying to handle the turbulence .
A representative of the “ ridiculous ” faction was Liberal Party member Gunnar AndrÃ©n who wrote a very upset internal email claiming he had n’t been told by party colleague Camilla Lindberg that she was going to vote against the bill ( she was the only member of any of the four government parties that voted against the bill and received much appreciation and media by it ) .
His email was leaked to the press by another party colleague and AndrÃ©n was later heard on a recorded phone - call exclaiming that his secrecy of correspondence had been broken and that it was “ Gestapo methods ” .
Dude , you just voted for a bill that allows all emails to be read and all phone calls to be recorded .
Live with it !
The big shift in public opinion came at the time of the vote when the blogs , who had pushed on the issue for many weeks before the vote , finally found the mainstream media with them , and with that the power to reach the masses .
Some 6.6 million emails were sent to the Members of Parliament through an online petition created by daily newspaper Expressen which allowed easy protests to the members .
GÃ¶ran Petterson of the Moderate Party ( until 2006 a military officer and one of those in favor of the FRA legislation ) wrote on his blog : “ Email is a great way to communicate with my voters but then you ca n’t do like Expressen has done now . [ â€ ¦ ]
Now , normal emails from the citizens are drowning in these . ”
Clearly , he did n’t understand his voters were trying to communicate with him , sending him a clear message of what they thought of him and his party .
This Thursday , rallies were initiated in MalmÃ¶ and Stockholm by The Pirate Party which gathered more than 2000 anti-FRA protesters .
They were in fact parties rather than protests , celebrating that Sweden has become a banana republic .
As in the protests before the vote in June , the parties ’ youth organizations stood side by side fighting the FRA , all ideological differences set aside for what may be one of the most important issues in their political careers .
In MalmÃ¶ , Peter Sunde of The Pirate Bay spoke at the rally saying “ the FRA bill is unnecessary , ineffective , unwanted and last but not least , expensive .
The government should listen to the people , as they can not replace us .
However , we have the power to change the government . ”
Meanwhile , in Stockholm , Maria Wetterstrand of the Green Party promised that an abolishment of the FRA bill would be one of their demands in order to form government with The Social Democrats after the elections 2010 while Alice Ã…strÃ¶m of the Left Party promised to motion this fall to give members of the government alliance parties the possibility to break up the legislation .
The Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde at the MalmÃ¶ rally
Yesterday , the annual Swedish political gathering in Almedalen began , where ministers , parliament members , journalists , pundits , lobbyists and interest groups traditionally meet during a week on the island of Gotland .
The government thought that putting the FRA vote at the back of the spring schedule would make it go unnoticed .
Instead , it ’s the only current political hot topic as the Almedalen week is approaching with the Pirate Party in full presence on site to further push the agenda .
Civil liberties groups in the US are demanding that the Department of Justice cough details of its use of mobile phone tracking - particularly how often it 's done so without probable cause of a crime being committed .
A federal court action has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The two groups are are asking for details of all investigations involving mobile phone tracking , though they 're particularly interested in cases where courts have n't been involved .
" The information now in the public domain suggests that [ the DOJ ] may be engaging in unauthorized and potentially unconstitutional tracking of individuals through their mobile phones , " claims the complaint .
The problem seems to be that the US lacks a rigid procedure for accessing such information .
In the UK the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act sets out detailed rules for how much information the police can get , and how they get it .
One might argue that the process is still too open , or that having cost as the principle controlling force against misuse is unwise , but at least it 's a formal and open process .
In the US things are much more murky , and the ACLU claims its only aim is to clear the air .
" This is a critical opportunity to shed much - needed light on possibly unconstitutional government surveillance techniques , " said Catherine Crump , a staff attorney at the ACLU , " Signing up for cell phone services should not be synonymous with signing up to be spied on and tracked by the government . "
Computer World spoke to the DOJ on the matter , and received the usual " if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear " line , highlighting how important phone records can be in tracing children and serial murderers - but not terrorists , this time , so missing a trick there .
No one is denying that bad guys can be caught using mobile phone records .
But access to such privileged information needs to be controlled by open procedures - trust in a benevolent Department of Justice is n't really sufficient . ®

Financial Tips for New Grads
Get health care coverage immediately .
If it has n’t already , your parent ’s health care coverage will probably end with your graduation .
Get a quote for an individual health insurance plan or sign up with your new employer ’s plan .
Going without coverage could have a devastating effect on your finances if you have a severe illness or accident .
Make this the first thing you do … and do n’t put it off !
Get your own home and auto insurance .
Now that you are n’t a student , you ’ll need to get your own auto and renters insurance policies .
Start by calling your current insurer , you might be eligible for a discount based on the length of time you ’ve been with the company , but do n’t forget to shop around to save on insurance premiums .
Save money for your future self .
Join the retirement plan at work .
If you are young and your company offers it , you may want to explore the Roth 401 k at work .
In addition to your plan at work , begin saving money on your own for both retirement and other goals .
Now may be the perfect opportunity to save a lot and use the reverse savings strategy before you have lots of financial obligations ( kids , house , etc . )
Start an emergency fund .
Earmark some of your first dollars from your new job to build up a savings account to serve as an emergency fund .
You never know when an emergency will hit , but it is inevitable .
Learn about taxes .
What ?
I know , this is n’t a fun one .
However , hopefully you ’re going to go from a poor college student to an highly paid worker .
With that luxury comes higher taxes .
Educate yourself about taxes , and you ’ll be able to take advantage of incentives and deductions to cut your tax bill .
Pay particular attention to the student loan interest deduction and the savers credit for retirement savings contributions .
Begin payments on student loans .
Begin paying your student loans right away .
Your future self will thank you .
Handle credit cards wisely .
Use credit cards carefully to earn cash rewards .
Always pay your balance in full every month .

Create savings goals .
Before you commit your paycheck away , create savings goals .
As a new grad , you may want to focus on retirement or a downpayment for a house .
Spend money slowly .
It can be very tempting with a new job to buy a new car and rent a fancy apartment .
Not so fast !
Wait a few months to see how your finances work out .
My husband found this out the hard way .

Many people have written to me about Why Nerds are Unpopular , and many more seem to be posting about it on various Web sites .
Here are answers to some of the points they 've raised .
It was n't like that at my school .
Some of my friends who went to private schools or to one of the small number of really good public school systems say that things were very different for them .
What I 'm talking about in this essay is the situation in the average American public secondary school .
I feel confident that I understand that , because I went to them .
The scary thing is , the schools I went to were probably above average .
My parents chose the suburb we lived in because the schools were said to be good .
( As newly arrived immigrants from England , they had no idea how bad " good " was . )
I knew smart kids who were n't nerds .
Smart kids do n't necessarily turn into nerds .
If you 're good looking , a natural athlete , or the sibling of a popular kid , you 'll automatically be popular .
But most popular kids do n't get that kind of free ride .
They have to work at being popular .
And if you 're interested in , say , physics , you wo n't have the time to spare .
I also think girls are less likely to become nerds than boys of equal intelligence , possibly because they 're more sensitive to social pressures .
In my school , at least , girls made more of an effort to conform than boys .
Things are different now .
Now it 's cool to be an outsider .
In my school , it was cool to be a certain kind of outsider , but not a nerd .
A guy who was tall and broad shouldered who dressed weirdly as a sign of rebellion was cool .
A guy who was small with a receding chin and big glasses who dressed weirdly because his mom picked out his clothes was not .
I expect this is still true today .
Are smart kids ' brains different ?
A couple people have said that there might be something neurologically different about smart people , i.e. that the reason smart kids spend their time reading books instead of talking to friends is not so much that they like books as that they do n't like people .
In the essay I deliberately avoided taking any stand on this ; I merely said that they liked the one more than the other , without attempting to explain why .
From my experience , I 'd say that while some smart kids may be borderline autistic , this can't by itself explain the smart / nerd correlation , because there are also plenty of nerds who are very talkative .
Indeed , one of the most characteristic nerd flaws is an addiction to newsgroup posting .
Nerds deserve it .
Another thing several people have said is that nerds deserve to be unpopular because they 're so unpleasant .
This is often true .
The essay was n't about whether or not nerds deserve to be unpopular , just why they are .
Certainly , some of the social skills that nerds avoid learning are genuinely desirable ones .
Some nerds are unbearable well into adulthood .
I can think of several smart people I could n't stand talking to for more than a couple minutes .
I do n't think it 's a good thing that smart people are sometimes unpleasant .
However , I stand by my statement that the nerds are playing a game much closer to the one played in the real world .
You can be a complete asshole and still do really well in the real world .
Nerds are unpopular because they 're arrogant .
Arrogance does n't make kids unpopular .
The good athletes in my school were plenty arrogant , and it did n't harm their popularity .
Public schools are designed to be bad .
Several people have suggested I read articles by John Taylor Gatto , e.g. his Six Lesson Schoolteacher .
There is an idea floating around that public schools are deliberately designed to turn out brainless conformists .
I do n't believe this .
I think public schools are just what you get by default .
If you build a giant building out in the suburbs and lock the kids in it during weekdays in the care of a few overworked and mostly uninspired adults , you 'll get brainless conformists .
You do n't need to posit a conspiracy .
I think nearly everything that 's wrong in schools can be explained by the lack of any external force pushing them to be good .
They do n't compete with one another , except in sports ( at which they do become good ) .
Parents , though they may choose where to live based on the quality of the schools , never presume to demand more of a given school .
College admissions departments , instead of demanding more of high schools , actively compensate for their flaws ; they expect less from students from inferior schools , and this is only fair .
Standardized tests are explicitly ( though unsuccessfully ) designed to be a test of aptitude rather than preparation .
Form follows function .
Everything evolves into a shape dictated by the demands placed on it .
And no one demands more of schools than that they keep kids off the streets till they 're old enough for college .
So that 's what they do .
At my school , it was easy not to learn anything , but hard to get out of the building without getting caught .
Why is the problem worst in America ?
I 'm just guessing here , but I think it may be because American school systems are decentralized .
They 're controlled by the local school board , which consists of car dealers who were high school football players , instead of some national Ministry of Education run by PhDs .
It would not necessarily be a good thing for schools to be controlled by the federal government , though .
In the US , except for a few carefully insulated agencies like the NSA and the CDC , smart people are reluctant to work for the federal government .
The example of private schools suggests that the best plan would be to go in the other direction , away from government control .
What about home - schooling ?
Home - schooling offers an immediate solution , but it probably is n't the optimal one .
Why do n't parents home - school their kids all the way through college ?
Because college offers opportunities home - schooling can't duplicate ?
So could high school if it were done right .
Why did you write this ?
( Usually phrased as : you must be a loser if you 're still bitter about high school . )
I wrote it because my friends are now all starting to have kids , and we found ourselves wondering how we could save them from the horrors we endured in school .
So I thought about what I would do if , knowing what I know now , I had to go through high school again .
In my high school , your choice was : be popular or be picked on .
I know now exactly what one would have to do to be popular .
But I found myself thinking : what a shlep .
It would be like being a politician , putting in endless hours of face time to make oneself liked .
So I realized that even knowing exactly what to do to be popular , I would n't be able to make myself do it .
I 'd be off in the library , just as I was the first time through high school .
How can I be more popular in school ?
Are you sure you want to be ?
One of the points of Why Nerds are Unpopular is that smart kids are unpopular because they do n't waste their time on the dumb stuff you need to do to be popular .
Do you want to start doing dumb stuff ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
Get out of the way , road rage .
Here comes desk rage .
A generic picture of a woman working in an office sitting at her desk typing on a computer .

Anger in the workplace -- employees and employers who are grumpy , insulting , short - tempered or worse -- is shockingly common and likely growing as Americans cope with woes of rising costs , job uncertainty or overwhelming debt , experts say .
“ It runs the gamut from just rudeness up to pretty extreme abusive behaviors , ” said Paul Spector , professor of industrial and organizational psychology at the University of South Florida .
“ The severe cases of fatal violence get a lot of press but in some ways this is more insidious because it affects millions of people . ”
Nearly half of U.S. workers in America report yelling and verbal abuse on the job , with roughly a quarter saying it has driven them to tears , research has shown .
Other research showed one - sixth of workers reported anger at work has led to property damage , while a tenth reported physical violence and fear their workplace might not be safe .
“ It ’s a total disaster , ” said Anna Maravelas , author of “ How to Reduce Workplace Conflict and Stress . ”
“ Rudeness , impatience , people being angry -- we used to do that kind of stuff at home but at work , we were professional .
Now it ’s almost becoming trendy to do it at work .
“ It was something we did behind closed doors , ” she said .
“ Now people are losing their sense of embarrassment over it . ”
Contemporary pressures such as rising fuel costs fan the flames , said John Challenger , head of Chicago ’s Challenger , Gray & Christmas workplace consultants .
“ People are coming to work after a long commute , sitting in traffic watching their discretionary income burn up .
They ’re ready for a fight or just really upset , ” he said .
Added to that , he said , are financially strapped workers having to cut back on paying for personal pastimes that might serve as an antidote to work pressures .
LET OFF STEAM
“ That means people come into work after a weekend and they have n’t been able to let off any steam , ” he said .
Spector said his research has found 2 percent to 3 percent of people admit to pushing , slapping or hitting someone at work .
With roughly 100 million people in the U.S. work force , he said , that ’s as many as 3 million people .
Maravelas said she conducted a seminar this week in rural Iowa , where she asked participants if they thought anger was increasing at their workplace .
Everyone raised their hands , she said , which is typically the response she gets .
She cited research showing 88 percent of U.S. employees think incivility is rising at work .
“ Many of us sense we ’re losing ground economically and socially .
The safety net is unraveling .
Hence , anxiety and unease are skyrocketing , ” she said .
People reassure themselves by blaming others and “ find comfort in believing their suffering is caused by a callous , incompetent or selfish organization , leader , supplier , union or regulatory body , ” she said .
The worst offenders are overachievers , said Rachelle Canter , a workplace expert and social psychologist .
“ The usual profile is Type A , really , really smart , with impossibly high standards they set for themselves as well as for other people .
“ They are so invested , I would say maybe over - invested , in success and in everyone being every bit as driven as they are that they just lose their sense of perspective , and they can lash out at other people , ” said Canter , author of “ Make the Right Career Move . ”
But desk rage extends across industry and class lines , from top white - collar jobs to gritty blue - collar work , and companies pay dearly in terms of lost productivity , sagging morale and higher absenteeism , Spector said .
The worst cases end in violence , he said .
“ Somebody did n’t just come to work one day and shoot somebody , ” Spector said .
“ There ’s probably been a pattern of less extreme behaviors leading up to it . ”
As announced before , tab switching is getting a dramatic update for Firefox 3.1 in both visual and behavior .
Press Ctrl + Tab ( or Shift + Ctrl + Tab ) and you are presented with tab thumbnails and titles with the most recently visited ones first so you can more easily determine which tab you want to go , have the one you most probably want to go closer , and as a result get to it faster .
Hold Ctrl pressed and keep pressing Tab to see the thumbnails smoothly scroll to the left while the status bar displays the tab web address .
If you need or just prefer the old behavior , pressing Ctrl + Page Up and Ctrl +
Page Down will fit the bill .
While eye candy does n’t hurt , I am not sure black is the right background color for all platforms .
More tab thumbnails may also help find the one I ’m looking for faster , as in earlier prototypes .
As said , there ’s also a new behavior for Ctrl +
Tab .
Instead of just moving left to the next opened tab , now it switches between the current and the last viewed tab and I have to say I ’m already loving it .
I usually have to check several other pages while posting and to ease the tab switching I moved the reference tab next to the post edit tab to have it a couple of keystrokes away .
There ’s no need now : I just took the long way to the reference tab once and then it ’s already at reach .
The new Ctrl +
Tab behavior and look was originally planned for Firefox 3 but was put on hold due to time constraints .
Ctrl - Tab , a Firefox extension developed by DÃ£o Gotwald , that has served as a prototype for this change is available from Mozilla Add-ons .
The extension provides even more features including an all tabs preview with search tabs capabilities that replaces the tab list menus when pressing the List all tabs button in the tab bar edge , and an option to switch between tabs in all windows .
At least the all tabs preview option is also being considered for inclusion in Firefox 3.1 .

Israeli settlements are one of the thorniest issues between the two sides
Palestinian leaders have criticised Israeli plans to build more than 1,000 new Jewish homes on occupied land in East Jerusalem .
The units , which have been approved by municipal planners , are in direct contravention of international law and the current peace process , they say .
Israel says the plans represent the " natural growth " of existing communities .
But there is growing international pressure to stop the expansion .
At the US - sponsored Annapolis peace talks , at the end of 2007 , demands were reiterated for Israel to stop all building and settlement expansion in occupied Palestinian areas .
But since then almost 8,000 new Jewish homes have been built or approved in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem , areas internationally recognised as Palestinian .
The latest approval , for more than one thousand units to be built near the settlement of Ramat Shlomo in an occupied area of East Jerusalem , has been criticised by Palestinian leaders as illegal .
They say it proves that Israel is racing to establish more " facts on the ground " , which would be difficult to remove in the event of a future peace agreement .
The expansion of settlements in occupied land is one of the thorniest issues between the two sides and Israel is coming under increasing pressure , even from the United States , to stop the building programmes .

CASCADE TOWNSHIP , Mich . 
A gay man is suing two heavyweight Christian publishers , claiming their versions of the Bible that refer to homosexuality as a sin violate his constitutional rights and have caused him emotional pain and mental instability .
Bradley LaShawn Fowler of Canton , Mich. , is seeking $ 60 million from Zondervan , based in Cascade Township , and $ 10 million from Nashville - based Thomas Nelson Publishing .
Fowler filed the suit in federal court against Zondervan on July 7 , the same day U.S. District Judge Julian Abele Cook Jr. refused to appoint an attorney to represent him in his case against Thomas Nelson .
Fowler filed a suit against Thomas Nelson in June .
He is representing himself in both claims .
" The Court has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of these claims , " the judge wrote .
Fowler , 39 , alleges Zondervan 's Bibles referring to homosexuality as a sin have made him an outcast from his family and contributed to physical discomfort and periods of " demoralization , chaos and bewilderment . "
The intent of the publisher was to design a religious , sacred document to reflect an individual opinion or a group 's conclusion to cause " me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse , discrimination , episodes of hate , and physical violence ... including murder , " Fowler wrote .
Fowler 's suit claims Zondervan 's text revisions from a 1980s version of the Bible included , and then deleted , a reference to homosexuality in 1 Corinthians without informing the public of the changes .
The other suit , against Thomas Nelson and its New King James Bible , mirrors the allegations made against Zondervan .
Logo design in today ’s world is totally under rated .
People do not understand how important a good logo is and how valuable it is to their business and this is why I am going to outline some very important facts telling you exactly why logo design should not cost $ 5 and why your logo is not something you should take lightly .
In broad terms , I will do this by comparing “ cheap logo design ” to “ professional logo design ” and I will outline the reasons why professional logo designers do not charge such low fees and why you should invest in a professional logo design .
What Is A Logo ?
To understand what a logo is meant to do , we first must know what a logo is .
A logo ’s design is for immediate recognition , inspiring trust , admiration , loyalty and an implied superiority .
The logo is one aspect of a company ’s commercial brand , or economic entity , and its shapes , colours , fonts , and images usually are different from others in a similar market .
Logos are also used to identify organisations and other non-commercial entities .
It makes me wonder why people have no logo or why they would even bother with a cheap logo design if a logo is meant to do all of these things ?
Spec Work & Logo Design Contests
Before I get onto comparing cheap VS professional logo design I want to talk to you a bit about SPEC work .
“ Spec ” has become the short form for any work done on a speculative basis .
ie .
You design this for me , and I will pay you if I like it .
–
This is not right .
To clarify , let ’s create a scenario in another industry where SPEC work does NOT exist .
“ I went for a dental check - up yesterday .
After the dentist inspected my teeth , she suggested some work to prevent further tooth decay .
I told her to go ahead , and if the dental work was satisfactory , I ’d be more than happy to pay .
She responded that she would n’t be able to do that , because she normally provides a service when a fee is agreed upon up - front .
I said I ’d let her know after I checked in with other local dentists . ”
This scenario happens in the design industry every day and is seen as very unethical as it is ruining the design industry .
A designer should not have to invest time and resources with no guarantee of payment much alike a dentist or any other professional .
I do not want to go into this any further as much has been written about it but I would like to say please avoid design contests and spec work at all costs .
Logo Design Contests are bad for your business .
Period .
For further reading on the damage of spec work I have written an in depth article outlining the “ pros ” and cons of spec work .
There have even been comics made about the damage of Spec Work :
$ 5.00 ( Cheap Logo Design )
Now that we have taken a look at the damage of Spec Work , let us now take a look at what quality you can expect from a logo in between the $ 5 to $ 200 bracket .
The particular case I am looking at today is from a $ 35 logo design contest that was held on Digital Point Forums .
The “ brief ” for the logo design project was
“ Make a logo for the site ‘ Spela Piano ’ .
The meaning of that is Play Piano .
This is a site where our members can learn to play piano online . ”
Below you can see the responses from the contest , which one do you think won ?
You will notice that nearly all of the logos above use free standard issue fonts and do n’t assign to the rules of what makes a good logo .
Ie. describable , memorable , effective without colour and scalable .
Ask yourself these questions in regards to the logos above :
How many of the logos can you describe or remember ?
Are these logos effective without colour ?
Are they scalable ?
Do they gain immediate recognition ?
Convey the company ’s personality , character or attitude ?
Relate to your clients by conveying a feeling of familiarity and credibility ?
Have association with quality and satisfaction ?
I will leave these questions for you to decide .
Professional Logo Design
Now compare these professionally designed logos and answer the same questions as above ….
See the difference ?
Why are they so different ?
As outlined in the logo design process of top graphic designers , professional logo designers have an actual design process that involves research , sketching , conceptualising , and reflection and this is why they do not charge $ 5.00 .
The design process of a professional logo designer usually consists of :
The Design Brief :
They conduct a questionnaire or interview with the client to get the design brief .
Research :
They conduct research focused on the industry itself , on its history , and on its competitors .
Reference :
They conduct research into logo designs that have been successful and current styles and trends that are related to the design brief .
Sketching & Conceptualising : They develop the logo design concept (s ) around the brief and research .
They use creativity and know how to design a logo .
Reflection :
They take breaks throughout their design process .
This lets their ideas mature and lets them get renewed enthusiasm and receive feedback .
Presentation :
They then choose whether to present only a select few logos to the client or a whole collection .
Celebration :
They then drink beer or eat chocolate or sleep or start on next logo design .
Or a combination .
Do you believe doing all of that costs $ 5.00 ?
On that note , did you know that the software to make the logo is USD $ 700 in itself , let alone the computer that it has to be installed onto or the costs associated with the essentials … paper , ink and an internet connection .
More Reasons
Here are some more responses from other designers on reasons why logo design does not cost $ 5.00 .
Tara from Graphic Design
Blog outlines in her 6 reasons why a logo should cost more than your lunch that
A logo is the very first impression people get of your company .
A logo needs longevity .
A logo needs to be original .
A logo should look professional .
A logo should reflect the time and thought gone in to designing it .
A logo is the starting point of your whole corporate image .
Now look back at those $ 5.00 logo designs or your even own logo to see if adheres to the above points .
How much does a logo cost ?
This is the single most frequently asked question , though it is the hardest one to answer without more details of the project .
The cost of a professional logo design is a question that cannot be easily answered as every company has different needs , however , the best way to approach this question is to draw up a customised quote for each individual .
A number of factors have to be taken into consideration when designing a logo , such as how many logo concepts need to be presented , how many revisions are required , how much research is needed , the size of the business and so on .
The best way to find out how much a logo design will cost is to get a quote from the designer them self .
Time To Invest ?
Is n’t it about time you invested in a professional logo design ?

CLERMONT , Fla . —
A Central Florida war veteran faces a lawsuit for flying the American flag on a pole in his front yard .
" I do n’t understand why it would bring down the values of our homes by flying the American flag from a pole in my front yard , " homeowner Jimmie Watkins said .
Watkins and his wife , Ria , received a final notice from the Sussex homeowners ’ association in Clermont that they must remove the flag or face legal action .
The former retired U.S. Navy communications officer said he refuses to back down for the American flag .
" Our people are serving today to give us freedom to do as we like here within the law of America , " Watkins said .
" It is my right to fly my flag from my pole and until a court of law tells me to haul that down , I will not haul it down .
I think about all of the people who have served our nation and all of the lives that it ’s cost and all of the friends that I ’ve lost . "
Local 6 reported that all surrounding subdivisions in Kings Ridge allow a flag pole display in a person ’s front yard .
Jim Hart , who handles property management for 1,500 properties , including Sussex , said it is the association ’s call and not his .
" Each sub - association has its own set of documents and they can differ , " Hart said .
" The rationale for that only exists within the minds of the folks that are doing it .
I ca n’t sit here and tell you why . "
The homeowner ’s association is not commenting about their rules .
But state law said anyone can display a flag in a " respectful manner " as long as it is removable , Local 6 reported .

In a couple of weeks Beijing will turn into a party town and Sanlitun is predicted to be the epicenter of the Olympic night events .
The South China Morning
Post has however reported that the bar owners in the area were asked to refuse service to black patrons .
The article reports :
Bar owners near the Workers ’ Stadium in central Beijing say they have been forced by Public Security Bureau officials to sign pledges agreeing not to let black people enter their premises .
“ Uniformed Public Security Bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or Mongolians , ” said the co-owner of a western - style bar , who asked not to be named .
We checked twice just to make sure :
This story comes from the SCMP and not The Onion … in 2008 … as the world awaits the ultra- harmonious “ One World , One Dream ” Olympics .
Did you hear that ?
That was the sound of our jaw dropping .
But something about this report does n’t gel .
Could this possibly be true ?
Could it possibly be enforced ?
Given the strong national ties that China has built with African nations in the last two years coupled with the fact that many Olympic athletes ( and their families ) hail from African descent — not to mention that such a policy would be despicable and horrendous PR for a country looking to improve its image — it sounds like , perhaps , some racist in the Beijing government went out on his own on this one .
We hope strong denials from Beijing are in the works .

Can I access my Windows files from a Wubi installation ?
Yes , the Windows partitions will be available within the directories / host and / media .
Can I use an existing ISO / CD instead of letting Wubi download a new one ?
Yes , physical CDs will be detected automatically , pre-downloaded ISOs should be placed in the same folder as Wubi.exe .
Please note tha Wubi 8.10 requires the Desktop 8.10 CD / ISO .
The DVD and Altrenate CD / ISO will not work .
You can find the 8.10 ISO here .
If Wubi does not find an appropriate ISO / CD and / or if the ISO / CD is corrupted , it will automatically download a new ISO .
It is recommended to let Wubi download the ISO for you .
Why is the AMD64 version of Ubuntu getting downloaded and installed ?
You probably have a 64 bit machine , the 64AMD installation is appropriate for all 64 bit architectures whether AMD or Intel .
Can I force Wubi to download and install a 32 bit version of Ubuntu ?
Yes , either pre-download the appropriate 32 bit ISO manually and place it in the same folder as Wubi.exe or start Wubi with the “ –32bit ” argument .
Can I move my virtual disk file to a dedicated partition ?
You can use LVPM to transfer your installation .
A guide and support forum for LVPM is available here .
Where can I find additional information and resources about Wubi ?
Please see the Wubi Guide for additional tips and more detailed documentation and troubleshooting .
What are the system requirements ?
256 MB RAM and an 1 GHz or faster Intel / AMD processor is recommended for optimal performance , though Xubuntu might work on less .
As for disk space , the installation requires a minimum of 5 GB free .
This space is mostly used by the virtual hard disk file .
Most computers purchased within the last 3 years should be able to run Ubuntu fine , and Xubuntu is suitable for older computers .
Software raids ( aka fakeraid ) are not supported .
Encrypted disks are not supported .
What platforms are supported ?
Wubi will run on on all Windows versions from Windows 98 to Windows Vista except Windows ME .
More platforms to come soon .
Linux / * nix /*BSD are supported through Lubi ( download location and guide ) , and Mac OSX will eventually be supported through Mubi ( developers still needed ) .
What is the performance ?
The performance is identical to a standard installation , except for hard - disk access which is slightly slower than an installation to a dedicated partition .
If your hard disk is very fragmented the performance will degenerate .
Any gotcha ?
Hibernation is not supported under Wubi , moreover Wubi filesystem is more vulnerable to hard - reboots ( turning off the power ) and power outages than a normal filesystem , so try to avoid unplugging the power .
An Ubuntu installation to a dedicated partition provides a filesystem that is more robust and can better tolerate such events .
How does Wubi work ?
Wubi adds an entry to the Windows boot menu which allows you to run Linux .
Ubuntu is installed within a file in the Windows file system ( c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk ) , this file is seen by Linux as a real hard disk .
Is this running Ubuntu within a virtual environment or something similar ?
No .
This is a real installation , the only difference is that Ubuntu is installed within a file as opposed to being installed within its own partition .
Thus we spare you the trouble of creating a free partition for Ubuntu .
And we spare you the trouble to have of having to burn a CD - Rom .
What is the relationship between Linux and Ubuntu ?
Ubuntu is an operating system that includes a lot of free and open source applications and uses Linux as its core .
Linux is like this amazing solar - powered engine that can be used in a street car , in a F1 or it can be daisy chained to drive a truck or an airplane .
Ubuntu is like a car using the Linux engine , a zero emission , fully accessorised and easy to drive all - terrain , with power , acceleration and looks matching far more expensive supercars …
Imagine something like that … … for free .
Why Ubuntu ?
We think that today Ubuntu is the best Linux - based operating system for desktop use .
We also like its philosophy .
You can see some Ubuntu screenshots here , for more information visit the Ubuntu website .
Is Wubi officially supported by Ubuntu ?
Wubi was born as an independent project , as such 7.04 and 7.10 are unoffical releases .
But since 8.04 the code has been merged within Ubuntu and Wubi is now fully supported .
Wubi can also be found in the Ubuntu 8.04 Live CD .
What flavor of Ubuntu will I get ?
Most flavors , including Ubuntu ( default , with GNOME ) , Kubuntu ( with KDE ) , Xubuntu ( with XFCE for older computers ) .
Contact us if you would like your own flavor to be available for installation via Wubi .
What is the difference among the different Ubuntu flavors ?
Mostly the graphical user interface is different , and the bundled applications may change so that they better integrate with the installed interface .
More information can be found at the homepages for GNOME , KDE , and XFCE .
Can I install multiple flavors ?
You can select the desktop environment within Wubi .
But since each desktop environment is also available as an application package , it is recommended to install Ubuntu ( default option ) and from there install the other desktop environments .
When you login you can choose the desktop environment to use .
What applications come with Ubuntu ?
Ubuntu comes fully loaded with most commonly used applications , including a full office suite compatible with MS Office , image editing software , picture management software , media player , games , browser , email client , IM and video conferencing software …
On top of all of this , you can easily install additional software , from a list of over 20,000 applications .
All this is installed by Wubi ?
Yes ( well … not all of the 20,000 applications , but Ubuntu and everything that comes with it , yes ) .
All for free ?
Yes .
Wubi is free / open - source software , licensed under the GNU GPL - v2 or above .
What warranty do I get ?
None whatsoever .
This is free software , and you are free to modify it , use it and redistribute it as you see fit , provided you also allow others the same freedom .
Since we do not make any money out of it , it would not be fair for us to be liable if something goes wrong .
We think that the technology is safe , but you run it at your own risk .
See the GNU GPL license for more details .
Is there any spyware / virus ?
The software is free / open - source , which means that anybody can check the code , therefore it would be pretty difficult for someone to hide a spyware / virus within the software , but you should always run all your usual security checks .
As explained above , there is no warranty .
Tibet 's Government - in - exile says the United Nations has proved itself to be a " white elephant " by failing to act more decisively over China 's repression of protesters .
The criticism came amid reports that Chinese forces had been ordered to shoot Tibetan protesters on sight after a midnight deadline to surrender passed .
Riot police and paramilitary forces are keeping a tight grip on Tibetan communities across western China after the deadline for protesters in the Tibetan capital Lhasa to give themselves up to authorities expired .
Government - in - exile Prime Minister Sampdong Rimpoche accused the Chinese Government of " brutal behaviour " .
He said there was no international agency to prevent the shoot - to - kill orders being carried out and described the United Nations as an undemocratic body .
" The international community are also a silent onlooker .
There has been no concrete action except consoling words , " he said .
" The UN system in my view is the most undemocratic institution in this world .
It 's just a white elephant . "
The Government - in - exile now claims around 100 people have died in the Chinese crackdown .
There are no reports at this stage of demonstrators handing themselves in .
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for restraint from China after the deadline passed .
" At this time I urge restraint on the part of the authorities and call on all concerned to avoid further confrontation and violence , " he said after meeting China 's ambassador to the UN .
China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council with the power to veto any attempts to act on Tibet .
Protests continue
Protests continued overnight in the Chinese provinces of Gansu , Qinghai and Sichuan , as well as in Beijing and in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu .
In Gansu , Tibetan students have staged sit-ins , while in Sichuan there have been more bloody clashes reported between demonstrators and riot police .
Fresh protests flared near two Sichuan Tibetan schools , with hundreds of students facing police and troops and about 40 students from a high school were beaten and arrested .
Monasteries in Qinghai are all under close surveillance , but many Tibetans remain determined to seize this opportunity to be heard .
Ethnic Tibetan students have staged a candle - lit vigil in Beijing to pray for the dead .
Police kept reporters well away from the peaceful protest by dozens of students inside the Central University for Nationalities .
It was a small , rare show of defiance in the host city of this year 's Olympic Games , where Communist Party authorities are eager to prevent public shows of dissent .
The vigil was broken up by authorities just hours before Lhasa 's deadline .
The fact that Tibetans are prepared to demonstrate , despite the huge security presence is perhaps a measure of the depth of their frustration .
They know the international community is watching them , but it is becoming more difficult to get their message out .
Foreign journalists are now facing heavy restrictions .
Many have been ordered to leave China 's restive west and some have been detained for visiting monasteries where protests have taken place .
Lhasa locked down
Meanwhile , heavy security remained in place on the streets of Lhasa after the deadline passed .
The city has been quiet for the past 24 hours and there has been no repeat of the anti-Chinese riots of recent days .
The Tibetan government in exile in India says protests by Tibetans have continued elsewhere in China , some involving thousands of people .
It says house - to - house searches have been going on and a number of former political prisoners are reported to have been detained again .
Meanwhile the Chinese Government has maintained its attack on the Dalai Lama , claiming to have proof that he organised the riots in Tibet .
" Regarding this entire incident ... we have enough evidence to prove that these actions were completely organised by the Dalai Lama , " Chinese Government spokesman Liu Jianchao said .
He did not produce any of evidence but said the Chinese Government would divulge it at the appropriate time .
OPW INTERVIEW -- June 28 -- Sparkbliss is a tiny upstart startup dating site .
Here 's our interview with the Joel Blatt , the CEO and Founder .
- Mark Brooks
Listen To The Interview.mp3
What is your founding story ?
I started Sparkbliss because I had a personal need to meet eligible people myself and I also saw a growing market opportunity in terms of what I deemed the conventional online dating approach as being flawed , not providing the results that we expect in typical business models .
What makes Sparkbliss different ?
It 's a private online dating site .
We understand the the importance of protecting and controlling your personal information and not broadcasting it over the internet and not exposing it where it could compromise you .
With Sparkbliss you truly control that information .
So unlike every other social networking and online dating site , which enables you to search a database of photos and profiles , Sparkbliss does n't allow that .
The only way you can view Sparkbliss members is if you are invited by an existing member to view their bios .
You can also forward the bios to your friends who you think would be interested in that person .
So it sounds like you are encouraging people to become matchmakers .
Is that correct ?
Yes .
And I see incredible benefits to that approach .
We hear about romance scams and sweetheart swindles , so I truly wanted to provide that truly safe and private forum for dating and meeting people .
And by having the matchmaking model , people that you know , people you trust , are going to be doing your bidding and they will not make an introduction if you have outdated photos or plagiarized descriptions of your likes and dislikes .
The matchmakers not only provide the introductions but they also add a testimonial or reference .
How do you motivate and reward the matchmakers ?
For them , the motivation is the satisfaction that they 're helping people they care about .
How do you make money ?
Is it free ?
It is an advertising based model .
It 's a free online dating and matchmaking site .
How are you priming the pumps ?
I 've just been doing a lot of PR and conducting a lot of interviews .
As of today , for example , I was interviewed by ABC radio .
I 'm very confident now , especially from the reaction from the investment community .
The need for protecting private information is emerging and Sparkbliss just fits nicely in saying ' look you do need to consider your personal privacy and here 's how to do so without taking a whole lot of risk . '

In August 2007 , Mr. Hunt informed State Department officials directly of his intentions in Kurdistan , and on Sept. 5 , three days before the deal was signed , a flurry of e-mail messages among Hunt and State Department officials make clear that the department was aware of what was in the works .

In a message to a colleague with the subject line “ Hunt Oil to Sign Contract With K.R.G. , ” one State Department official gives a highly detailed summary of the agreement .
Mr. Hunt , the official wrote , “ is expecting to sign an exploration contract with the K.R.G. for a field located in the Shakkan district , an area under K.R.G. control ( inside the Green Line ) but technically in Nineveh Governorate . ”
“ Hunt would be the first U.S. company to sign such a deal , ” the official wrote , suggesting that the news should be rushed onto the State Department ’s internal distribution network as quickly as possible .
Despite those exchanges , a State Department official said Wednesday that the company had in fact been discouraged from completing its deal .
“ All companies , including Hunt Oil , which have spoken with the United States government about investing in Iraq ’s oil sector , have and will continue to be given the same advice , ” John Fleming , an Iraq press officer in the State Department ’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs , wrote Wednesday in an e-mailed response to questions .
“ We advise companies that they incur significant political and legal risk by signing any contracts with any party before a national law is passed by the Iraqi Parliament . ”
Another State Department official , who asked to remain anonymous , expressed frustration , saying that a local State Department official in Erbil , the Kurdish provincial capital , who was the head of a so - called Regional Reconstruction Team , tried to dissuade Hunt officials from making the deal .
But no notes were taken at that meeting , the official said , and Hunt representatives later gave a conflicting account of what had been said .

A legal brief has been sent to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) alleging former prime minister John Howard committed a war crime by sending troops to Iraq .
A loose alliance of peace activists , lawyers , academics and politicians is behind the brief , organised by the ICC Action group in Melbourne .
Organiser Glen Floyd says Mr Howard should be held accountable for sending troops to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations .
" We have produced a 52 - page brief of evidence which states to the chief prosecutor of the criminal court that we allege John Howard 's actions are war crimes under article 8 of the Rome Statute , " he said .
Democrats Senator Lyn Allison says the legal brief sent to the ICC is justified .
Senator Allison , who is one of several eminent people supporting the move , says accountability is important .
" This action has been taken to hold those accountable for their action , so it 's essentially our prime minister - he was the one at the time [ who ] was the executive of government , made the decision , " she said .
' It was n't put to the Parliament and as we all know , it turned out to be unjustified . "
A similar brief has been sent by a group from the United Kingdom regarding former prime minister Tony Blair .
The United States is not a signatory to the court .

" Do n't take any wooden nickels " was an admonition to be careful in your dealings because someone might try to pay you with worthless money .
Wooden coins were actually used in trade in America in certain limited circumstances on a local level .
A contemporary equivalent could be " do n't take any steel pennies . "
The United States House Of Representatives has already passed a bill , HR 5512 , authorizing the Treasury Department to substitute steel for the nickel and copper now used in American pennies and nickels .
The rationale is that , by substituting cheaper metals , the government can save many millions of dollars .
This is , in fact , a very valid point .
Another observation is equally obvious and valid .
The dollar has been devalued to such an extent that a penny — as in one hundredth of a dollar — can only buy a fraction of the metal needed to make a physical penny .
Each coin takes significantly more than one cent to produce .
This is not the first time in history that the currency of a country has been debased .
In centuries past , kings would debase gold and silver coins by reducing metal content , making smaller coins and actually replacing the original metals with cheaper alloys , while holding the legal - tender value the same .
This gave rise to Gresham 's Law , a principle in economics that bad money drives out good money .
Consumers will use the devalued currency in transactions and take the more valuable money out of circulation .
Since the establishment of the Federal Reserve , American coins have been debased numerous times , replacing more valuable metals with less valuable ones .
The dollar , which was backed by gold decades ago , is now backed by nothing but legal - tender laws .
Devaluation of the currency gives rise to a general increase in prices , inflation in the popular sense .
General price inflation is , everywhere and always , a monetary phenomenon , as stated by various economists , including central bankers .
That means that a general increase in prices cannot arise from an increase in the prices of gasoline , food or any other commodity , the mythical " cost - push inflation . "
The monetary phenomenon that the money specialists talk about is the increase in the money supply by the bankers .
Fuel prices are very high right now .
Because of that , people adjust their lives to accommodate them .
This adjustment results in a lower quantity demanded for many goods and services that rely on travel and energy consumption .
The lower quantity demanded should also lead to lower prices of nonenergy items .
With a constant supply of money , an increase in prices in one area necessarily has to result in a decrease in prices in other areas .
The only way that prices of all things can increase at the same time is if the relative supply of money increases ; more dollars chasing after the same amount of goods and services .
Congressional leaders give the appearance of being interested in saving taxpayers money , which would be a very good thing if only it were true .
In theory , the less they spend making coins , the less they would have to tax the people .
What they do n't reveal is that inflation , which gives rise to the need for devaluing the coins , is in effect a tax .
It takes wealth from your pocket and transfers it to the pockets of bankers and government agents who get the money first .
The inflation tax is just as much a burden on the population as a direct tax .
It is more insidious , however , because it is not seen as a tax .
It has become such a normal occurrence that people just factor it into their daily business .
People are told that rising prices cause inflation to divert the heat from our elected officials .
In reality , it is just the opposite .
The rising prices are the effect .
The increasing money supply is the cause .
There was another time in the past when pennies were made of steel .
I have a steel penny from the World War II era .
At that time , copper was in short supply due to military consumption during the war .
Copper was expensive because it was scarce .
Today it is not scarce .
Copper and nickel have a high dollar price because the dollar is rapidly losing its value .
With the current inflationary scheme for financing government , there will come a time when even steel will cost too much to use in coins .
We may be forced to accept wooden nickels because every metal will be priced out of the market for coinage .
The following is an edited and expanded version of an interview with George Soros , Chairman , Soros Fund Management , by Judy Woodruff on Bloomberg TV on April 4 .
Judy Woodruff :
You write in your new book , The New Paradigm for Financial Markets , 1 that “ we are in the midst of a financial crisis the likes of which we have n’t seen since the Great Depression . ”
Was this crisis avoidable ?
George Soros : I think it was , but it would have required recognition that the system , as it currently operates , is built on false premises .
Unfortunately , we have an idea of market fundamentalism , which is now the dominant ideology , holding that markets are self - correcting ; and this is false because it ’s generally the intervention of the authorities that saves the markets when they get into trouble .
Since 1980 , we have had about five or six crises : the international banking crisis in 1982 , the bankruptcy of Continental Illinois in 1984 , and the failure of Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 , to name only three .
Each time , it ’s the authorities that bail out the market , or organize companies to do so .
So the regulators have precedents they should be aware of .
But somehow this idea that markets tend to equilibrium and that deviations are random has gained acceptance and all of these fancy instruments for investment have been built on them .
There are now , for example , complex forms of investment such as credit - default swaps that make it possible for investors to bet on the possibility that companies will default on repaying loans .
Such bets on credit defaults now make up a $ 45 trillion market that is entirely unregulated .
It amounts to more than five times the total of the US government bond market .
The large potential risks of such investments are not being acknowledged .
Woodruff : How can so many smart people not realize this ?
Soros :
In my new book I put forward a general theory of reflexivity , emphasizing how important misconceptions are in shaping history .
So it ’s not really unusual ; it ’s just that we do n’t recognize the misconceptions .
Woodruff : Who could have ?
You said it would have been avoidable if people had understood what ’s wrong with the current system .
Who should have recognized that ?
Soros :
The authorities , the regulators — the Federal Reserve and the Treasury — really failed to see what was happening .
One Fed governor , Edward Gramlich , warned of a coming crisis in subprime mortgages in a speech published in 2004 and a book published in 2007 , among other statements .
So a number of people could see it coming .
And somehow , the authorities did n’t want to see it coming .
So it came as a surprise .
Woodruff : The chairman of the Fed , Mr. Bernanke ?
His predecessor , Mr. Greenspan ?
Soros :
All of the above .
But I do n’t hold them personally responsible because you have a whole establishment involved .
The economics profession has developed theories of “ random walks ” and “ rational expectations ” that are supposed to account for market movements .
That ’s what you learn in college .
Now , when you come into the market , you tend to forget it because you realize that that ’s not how the markets work .
But nevertheless , it ’s in some way the basis of your thinking .
Woodruff : How …
Tony Romo
Talks !
has apparently had it with the rumors about his relationship withand issued a statement to People magazine
" It 's all laughable , ” says the Dallas Cowboys quarterback of reports that Papa Joe Simpson has been meddling in his business affairs - and that his parents do n't approve of or get along with the Simpsons .
Romo insists that is " so far from the truth . "
Joe Simpson reportedly went to the Masters golf tournament with Romo 's father , Ramiro , earlier this year and " had a great time . "
Speculation about Tony and Jessica 's relationship , and the hand Joe Simpson has in choreographing the whole thing , has been tabloid fodder for months .
In a recent interview Papa Joe said , " Jessica is as happy as I ’ve seen her in years . ”
And what does he think of Tony Romo ?
“ He ’s a great guy .
I love Tony to death … .
He ’s just a good kid … ”

The rising demand for flat - screen televisions could have a greater impact on global warming than the world 's largest coal - fired power stations , a leading environmental scientist warned yesterday .
Manufacturers use a greenhouse gas called nitrogen trifluoride to make the televisions , and as the sets have become more popular , annual production of the gas has risen to about 4,000 tonnes .
As a driver of global warming , nitrogen trifluoride is 17,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide , yet no one knows how much of it is being released into the atmosphere by the industry , said Michael Prather , director of the environment institute at the University of California , Irvine .
Prather 's research reveals that production of the gas , which remains in the atmosphere for 550 years , is " exploding " and is expected to double by next year .
Unlike common greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) and perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) , emissions of the gas are not restricted by the Kyoto protocol or similar agreements .
Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , Prather and a colleague , Juno Hsu , state that this year 's production of the gas is equivalent to 67 m tonnes of carbon dioxide , meaning it has " a potential greenhouse impact larger than that of the industrialised nations ' emissions of PFCs or SF6 , or even that of the world 's largest coal - fired power plants " .
While concerns have led Toshiba Matsushita Display Technology to avoid using the gas , Air Products , which produces it for the electronics industry , told New Scientist that very little nitrogen trifluoride is released into the atmosphere .
But Prather argues that as the gas is not controlled in the same way as other greenhouse gases , companies may be careless with it .
What is strace ?
It can filter based on the specific system call or groups of system calls
It can profile the use of system calls by tallying up the number of times a specific system call is used , and the time taken , and the number of successes and errors .
It traces signals sent to the process .
It can attach to any running process by pid .
How to use it
1 ) Find out which config files a program reads on startup
$ strace php 2 >&1 | grep php.ini open ( " /usr/local/bin/php.ini " , O_RDONLY ) = - 1 ENOENT
( No such file or directory ) open ( " /usr/local/lib/php.ini " , O_RDONLY ) = 4 lstat64(" /usr/local/lib/php.ini " , {st_mode=S_IFLNK|0777 , st_size=27 , ...} ) = 0 readlink ( " /usr/local/lib/php.ini " , " /usr/local / Zend/etc/php.ini " , 4096 ) = 27 lstat64(" /usr/local / Zend/etc/php.ini " , {st_mode=S_IFREG|0664 , st_size=40971 , ...} ) = 0
$ strace -e open php 2 >&1 | grep php.ini open ( " /usr/local/bin/php.ini " , O_RDONLY ) = - 1 ENOENT
( No such file or directory ) open ( " /usr/local/lib/php.ini " , O_RDONLY ) = 4
2 ) Why does this program not open my file ?

I keep being surprised how few people are aware of all the things they can use strace for .
It 's always one of the first debug tools I pull out , because it 's usually available on the Linux systems I run , and it can be used to troubleshoot such a wide variety of problems .
Strace is quite simply a tool that traces the execution of system calls .
In its simplest form it can trace the execution of a binary from start to end , and output a line of text with the name of the system call , the arguments and the return value for every system call over the lifetime of the process .
But it can do a lot more :
If you 've used other Unix systems , this is similar to " truss " .
Another ( much more comprehensive ) is Sun's Dtrace
This is just scratching the surface , and in no particular order of importance :
Ever tried figuring out why some program does n't read the config file you thought it should ?
Had to wrestle with custom compiled or distro-specific binaries that read their config from what you consider the " wrong " location ?
The naive approach : So this version of PHP reads php.ini from / usr / local / lib / php.ini ( but it tries / usr / local / bin first ) .
The more sophisticated approach if I only care about a specific syscall :
The same approach work for a lot of other things .
Have multiple versions of a library installed at different paths and wonder exactly which actually gets loaded ?
etc.
Ever run into a program that silently refuse to read a file it does n't have read access to , but you only figured out after swearing for ages because you thought it did n't actually find the file ?
Well , you already know what to do : Look for an open ( ) or access ( ) syscall that failsEver had a process suddenly hog lots of CPU ?
Or had a process seem to be hanging ?
Then you find the pid , and do this :
Ah .
So in this case it 's hanging in a call to futex ( ) .
Incidentally in this case it does n't tell us all that much - hanging on a futex can be caused by a lot of things ( a futex is a locking mechanism in the Linux kernel ) .
The above is from a normally working but idle Apache child process that 's just waiting to be handed a request .
But " strace - p " is highly useful because it removes a lot of guesswork , and often removes the need for restarting an app with more extensive logging ( or even recompile it ) .
You can always recompile an app with profiling turned on , and for accurate information , especially about what parts of your own code that is taking time that is what you should do .
But often it is tremendously useful to be able to just quickly attach strace to a process to see what it 'sspending time on , especially to diagnose problems .
Is that 90 % CPU use because it 's actually doing real work , or is something spinning out of control .
Here 's what you do :
After you 've started strace with - c - p you just wait for as long as you care to , and then exit with ctrl-c .
Strace will spit out profiling data as above .
In this case , it 's an idle Postgres " postmaster " process that 's spending most of it's time quietly waiting in select ( ) .
In this case it 's calling getppid ( ) and time ( ) in between each select ( ) call , which is a fairly standard event loop .
You can also run this " start to finish " , here with " ls " : Pretty much what you 'd expect , it spents most of it's time in two calls to read the directory entries ( only two since it was run on a small directory ) .
Debugging why some process is n't connecting to a remote server can be exceedingly frustrating .
DNS can fail , connect can hang , the server might send something unexpected back etc .
You can use tcpdump to analyze a lot of that , and that too is a very nice tool , but a lot of the time strace will give you less chatter , simply because it will only ever return data related to the syscalls generated by " your " process .
If you 're trying to figure out what one of hundreds of running processes connecting to the same database server does for example ( where picking out the right connection with tcpdump is a nightmare ) , strace makes life a lot easier .
This is an example of a trace of " nc " connecting to www.news.com on port 80 without any problems :
So what happens here ?
Notice the connection attempts to / var / run / nscd / socket ?
They mean nc first tries to connect to NSCD - the Name Service Cache Daemon - which is usually used in setups that rely on NIS , YP , LDAP or similar directory protocols for name lookups .
In this case the connects fails .
It then moves on to DNS ( DNS is port 53 , hence the " sin_port=htons ( 53 ) " in the following connect .
You can see it then does a " sendto ( ) " call , sending a DNS packet that contains www.news.com.
It then reads back a packet .
For whatever reason it tries three times , the last with a slightly different request .
My best guess why in this case is that www.news.com is a CNAME ( an " alias " ) , and the multiple requests may just be an artifact of how nc deals with that .
Then in the end , it finally issues a connect ( ) to the IP it found .
Notice it returns EINPROGRESS .
That means the connect was non-blocking - nc wants to go on processing .
It then calls select ( ) , which succeeds when the connection was successful .
Try adding " read " and " write " to the list of syscalls given to strace and enter a string when connected , and you 'll get something like this :
This shows it reading " test " + linefeed from standard in , and writing it back out to the network connection , then calling poll ( ) to wait for a reply , reading the reply from the network connection and writing it to standard out .
Everything seems to be working right .
I 'd love to hear from you if you use strace in particularly creative ways .

Bolivia ’s right - wing extremists who have been doing their best to rip their own country apart for the past two years rather than accept the rule of their constitutionally elected President Evo Morales finally have showed themselves in their true colours .
These are various violent shades of an apartheid green mixed with several unappealing tones of Ku Klux Klan off - white .
For the extremists , the democratically chosen Morales labours under the crushing disadvantage of being a member of the indigenous majority .
To have a head of state like that who seeks greater fairness for the indigenes , they say , will never do .
On 24 May in the run-up to this Sunday ’s unofficial vote on “ autonomy ” rigged up by the Bolivian Klansmen in the departments of Beni and Pando they went into action in the city of Sucre .
There an aggressive horde of university students and unelected conservative city notables came together to prevent their president visiting the city .
He was to come to inaugurate a new step forward in the agrarian reform programme which most voters in this agriculturally stunted country want .
In their unelected grandeur , financed by the ample royalties that the government of the department of Santa Cruz gets for its oil and natural gas and spreads round its political satellites , they stationed thugs in the stadium where President Morales was to speak and aborted his visit .
Then they turned their attention on the government supporters who were awaiting him .
Mainly poor peasants , they had gathered to welcome the president and greet his moves towards agrarian reform in a country where there is land for all but where much of it is concentrated in the hands of the few .
A number of indigenous people who were to have received the President were seized by the mob , forcibly undressed , marched to the central plaza and made to kneel and shout anti-government slogans and to burn their ponchos , the flag of the MAS party and the wiphala , the flag favoured by indigenous peoples up and down the Andes .
They were kicked , hit and racially abused .
The right - wing mayor of Sucre , Aidée Nava , looked on and applauded .
Others present were the university chancellor and leaders of the conservative white opposition .
Some will recall the word Kristallnacht and remember how the ruling party in Germany treated people it did not like in the years before the Second World War in cities such as Nuremberg and Munich .
In other examples of violence , Deputy César Navarro and Senator Ana Rosa Velázquez were ambushed by a violent mob as they passed through Sucre airport on their way to their constituency in Potosí .
At Riberalta in the department of Pando the minister of the presidency Juan Ramón Quintana was also attacked .
The attack coincided with a visit to Riberalta by the Santa Cruz leaders Branko Marinkovich and Rubén Costas who are the paymasters of the anti-government campaign .
First reports on the privately owned television stations about the voting on Sunday 1 June suggested that a big majority favoured “ autonomy ” from Morales and the government in La Paz .
There was widespread abstention during the voting on Sunday which the government has understandably branded illegal .
Government supporters showed their anger at what they saw as an exercise in electoral farce and voting was suspended in many places .
Much violence was reported from supporters of the right and one government supporter is reported to have been killed .
The police , many of whom answer to the local authorities rather than to the national government , seemed to have done nothing on Sunday , just as they did nothing in Sucre last month .
Later this month the right wing leaders in the department of Tarija will do their own exercise in vote - rigging on “ autonomy ” which , according to the TV , they will win .
But those familiar with how the businessmen skew the media in Latin America – and how the television moguls in Venezuela in particular poisoned the wells of information to the public at the time of the putsch against President Chávez which they supported in 2002 - will be cautious about their reports of results from Bolivia .
Dirty deeds are being perpetrated in that country and it is not the government which is perpetrating them .
Registrars have reported that as many as a third of the applications cannot be entered into the system , and many of the rest require more information .
The state Republican Party called the operation “ the Dems ’ phony registration drive . ”
Democrats say the burden is on the registrars to double - check and verify application information .
“ Instead of throwing up complaints , they should be working to get as many people as possible registered , ” said Matthew Miller , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington , which paid for the drive because Senator Mary Landrieu , a Democrat , is up for re-election and her voter base in New Orleans was eroded by Hurricane Katrina .
Michael Slater , the deputy director of Project Vote , said high numbers of incomplete applications were not unusual in such drives .
He said as a rule of thumb , 35 percent of voter drive applications were new voters , 35 percent were change of address , and 30 percent were duplicates or incomplete .
In Louisiana , voting drive canvassers are required by law to submit the applications they collect , even if they are obvious pranks , like two cards in Shreveport that listed George Bush as the name of the applicant and 1600 Pennsylvania Drive as the address .
But Jacques Berry , a spokesman for the secretary of state , said canvassers should be “ educated enough to not leave the house until the card is in order . ”
John Maginnis , a political analyst in Baton Rouge , pointed out that the federal motor - voter law , which allows people to register when they get a driver ’s license , had already raised registration to near - saturation levels .
The key to winning the election , he said , will rest more on turnout than registration .
“ You ’re getting down to people that are just hard - core disengaged , ” he said .
“ If you get these voters on the rolls , the question is how many of them are likely voters . ”
The New Yorker says it ’s satire .
It certainly will be candy for cable news .
At a press availability Sunday afternoon in San Diego , Senator Obama was asked , according to the diligent Maria Gavrilovic of CBS News : “ The upcoming issue of the New Yorker , the July 21st issue , has a picture of you , depicting you and your wife on the cover .
Have you seen it ?
If not , I can show it to you on my computer .
It shows your wife Michelle with an Afro and an AK 47 and the two of you doing the fist bump with you in a sort of turban - type thing on top .
I wondered if you ’ve seen it or if you want to see it or if you have a response to it ? ”
Obama ( shrugs incredulously ) : “ I have no response to that . ”
Priceless stage direction by Maria .
The magazine explains at the start of its news release previewing the issue : “ On the cover of the July 21 , 2008 , issue of the The New Yorker , in ‘ The Politics of Fear , ’ artist Barry Blitt satirizes the use of scare tactics and misinformation in the Presidential election to derail Barack Obama ’s campaign . ”
I ’m sure Senator Obama is oh - so appreciative for The New Yorker ’s help .
UPDATE -- Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton says : “ The New Yorker may think , as one of their staff explained to us , that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama 's right - wing critics have tried to create .
But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive .
And we agree . "

If you have visited Planet Save for any length of time you will no doubt have seen me talk about the increasing amount of ‘ dead zones ’ cropping up across our planets watery surface .
In particular , the Gulf of Mexico is home to what is believed to be the largest dead zone in the world : an area larger than Rhode Island that is almost totally devoid of oxygen in the water .
This particular dead zone has formed , in part , thanks to farm runoff that has made its way down the Mississippi River , all the way from Iowa and Wisconsin .
Chemicals used on the farms are washed in to local waterways , which all eventually end in the Mississippi which thus makes its way down and out past New Orleans in to the Gulf of Mexico .
Subsequently , the increased levels of chemicals in the water have more and more robbed the water of oxygen , making it a deadly place for any creatures or plants .
A new threat has arisen however , a threat that could possibly increase an already far gone situation .
Many of you will already be aware of the great damage done by the floods through the Midwest of America ; some of you might even have been directly affected .
The tragic loss of lives , the devastating loss of crops and livestock ; at some point the negatives pile up too far to care about any more .
But , akin to the Mississippi flood in 1993 , these floods are going to cause havoc in the Gulf , with all the excess chemicals washed in to the Mississippi .
“ It ’s going to be a very interesting summer out there just because of this , ” said Steven DiMarco , a professor of oceanography at Texas A&M University .
“ The last time something like this happened , we did see a huge difference ” in the size of the dead zone from one year to the next .
So in addition to the continued rise of fertilizer use due to an increased need for ethanol produced by corn , these tragic Midwest floods have added their own weight to a continuing ecological problem .

Radiohead 's new single , House of Cards , features a promotional video that has been " filmed " without the use of a camera or conventional lighting .
Instead the band has used two advanced visualisation techniques to produce an assembly of computer renderings in real time .
Radiohead has employed a scanning system , called Geometric Informatics , that produces structured light to capture three - dimensional images in close - up .
Then , for some atmospheric location shots , an advanced Velodyne Lidar system , which uses multiple lasers to capture large environments , has been used to create scenes of suburban Los Angeles .
The system uses 64 lasers rotating in 360 degrees at a rate of 900 times per minute .
The live action promo was created entirely with visualisations of that data .
But what is most interesting is the way that Radiohead has decided to " open source " the project , allowing anyone to use the data to produce their own interpretation of the promo .
Furthermore , it has combined with Google to release the data ( although not the music ) using a Creative Commons licence , which you can download from the Google Code site .
Google has also provided a handy visualiser to help you play around with the code , although , theoretically at least , you should be able to mashup the data on a range of video editing applications , including QuickTime Pro and the open - source VirtualDub .
You should be able to use iMovie on the iPhone as well .
Once you 've messed around with it , there 's a YouTube group for you to share .
Early reports from the group , which launched on Monday , indicate that the data visualisation is tricky .
Several users reported that the visualisation failed to work or was distorted .
The less technically inclined can make do with a nifty desktop application that allows you to play around with a visualisation of Thom Yorke 's head .
The promo's director , James Frost , has said that : " In a weird way [ the project ] is a direct reflection of where we are in society .
Everything is [ computer ] data .
Everything around us is data - driven in some shape or form .
We are so reliant on it that it seems like our lives are digital . "
The end result is memorable video , full of what looks like millions of points of light that seem to move as if the data were alive .
Radiohead is not the first band to offer an open - source video .
Last year Björk allowed her fans to remix her video for her single Innocence .
Radiohead 's House of Cards is taken from the latest Radiohead album , In Rainbows , which pioneered a pay - what - you - please sales strategy in the first few weeks of its release .
As one wag on the internet has pointed out , the visualisation will be free for a couple of months .
And then you have to pay for it .

どの記事も恐らくはHowtoChangeSessionStoreを参考にされていると思われ、やり方はほぼ等しいようだが、なんで設定ファイルでコネクションをnewしないといけないのか、他に設定方法はないのかなぁと思う。
というわけでMemCacheの拡張プラグインを作ってみた。これを導入することで以下のようにmemcachedの設定をすることができる。
==[RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb]====
Rails :: Initializer.run do |config| ...
config.action_controller.session_store = :mem_cache_store end ==[RAILS_ROOT/config/memcached.yml ]==== session : expires : ' 6 h ' options : multithread : false namespace : ' rubricks ' readonly : false servers : [ ' localhost:11211 ' ]
これだけじゃ寂しいので、運用時にmemcachedの動作状況を確認するためのユーティリティもつけてみた。実際に使う際はコンソールじゃなくて、Rubyスクリプトにして適当なファイルにリダイレクトしないと大変なことになるかも。

A Swiss marine biologist and an Australian quantum physicist have found that a species of shrimp from the Great Barrier Reef , Australia , can see a world invisible to all other animals .
Dr Sonja Kleinlogel and Professor Andrew
White have shown that mantis shrimp not only have the ability to see colours from the ultraviolet through to the infrared , but have optimal polarisation vision -- a first for any animal and a capability that humanity has only achieved in the last decade using fast computer technology .
" The mantis shrimp is a delightfully weird beastie , " said Professor White , of the University of Queensland .
" They 're multi-coloured , their genus and species names mean ' mouth - feet ' and ' genital - fingers ' ; they can move each eye independently , they see the world in 11 or 12 primary colours as opposed to our humble three , and now we find that this species can see a world invisible to the rest of us . "
Dr Kleinlogel , is based at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt , and collected the shrimp from the reef .
She notes that , " ... scuba divers know them as ' thumb - splitters ' , they 've got wickedly strong claws and are very aggressive ! "
Most animals can tell how fast the electric field in a light wave is oscillating , which is perceived as colour .
( Blue light oscillates faster than green , which is faster than red ) .
The direction of the oscillation is known as polarisation : many animals , from budgerigars to ants have some form of polarisation vision .
Since the 1950s , animals have been shown to use linear polarisation vision for navigation , for finding food , for evading hunters , and for sex , or as Professor White says , " ... for the four fs : feeding , fighting , fleeing and ... flirting . "
Commonly , polarisation vision is quite restricted : in its simplest form , different directions of polarisation show up as lighter or darker patches -- you can see this yourself by looking at clear blue sky with polarising sunglasses .
But polarisation is more subtle than this : the electric field of the light can oscillate back and forth in a line or around and around in a circle , or anywhere in between .

The two scientists have shown that shrimp of the species Gonodactylus smithii have eyes that simultaneously measure four linear and two circular polarisations , enabling them to determine both the direction of the oscillation , as well as how polarised the light is .
" This is very useful because natural light can vary from strongly polarised , like the glare off snow or water , to unpolarised , like the sun , " Professor White said .
" Any changes to the amount of polarisation instantly tells the animal that something is going on . "
Colleagues at The University of Queensland have recently found a related species where the males reflect circular polarisation from their bodies , and hypothesized that circular polarisation vision is used for sexual signalling .
Professor
White smiles and says , " I think of that as the ' prawnographic ' hypothesis . "
He continues , " It ca n't be the whole story in our case , though .
We found the same structures in the eyes of both boy and girl mantis shrimps , and yet neither have circularly polarised markings on their bodies .
Each eye measures the six polarisation components that are precisely required for optimal polarisation vision .
In fact , the physics we used to understand what was going on is the same physics that we use in quantum computing for optimal storage of information . "
" It is this unique talent -- to measure linear and circular polarisation simultaneously -- which presents a completely new concept of polarisation vision , " Dr Kleinlogel continues .
" There would n't be much point in only being able to see circular polarisation as it is extremely rare in nature .
Even the polarized light reflected from some shrimp 's bodies is only weakly circular polarised and often contains more linear polarisation . "
" We doubt that circular polarisation is used exclusively as a secret shrimp sex signal !
It makes more sense that mantis shrimp evolved both circular and linear polarisation receptors to work together so they can detect tiniest changes in any polarisation . "
Prof .
White notes , " Some of the animals they like to eat are transparent , and quite hard to see in sea - water - except they 're packed full of polarising sugars - I suspect they light up like Christmas trees as far as these shrimp are concerned . "
" And of course , " Dr Kleinlogel concludes , " they can still flirt with each other using fancy polarisation cues ! "
Uranium explorers say the public could warm to the idea of nuclear power once the costs associated with carbon trading are released .
A report on the cost of climate change from economist Professor Ross Garnaut is expected to be made public today .
West Australian uranium explorers are hoping Australians will change their attitude to nuclear energy when the cost of an emissions trading scheme hits home .
The physicist and businessman who chaired the Howard Government 's nuclear task force , Ziggy Switkowski , says nuclear power would reduce emissions .
" If fossil fuels are progressively seen to be unacceptable because of their emissions then the only alternative to fossil fuel for large scale production of electricity remains nuclear power , " he said .
Mr Switkowski says other countries have made the most of reasonably priced nuclear power .
" I would assume that the recent trip that Prime Minister Rudd has made along with Minister Carr around the world would have exposed him to the changing opinions right around the world , " he said .
" Countries are now supporting and in fact accelerating their own plans to introduce more nuclear power into their mix . "

First there was going to be a status of forces agreement between the US and Iraq , which would be ratified by the Iraqi parliament and would grant the US long - term bases .
Private security guards and US troops would be immune from Iraqi law .
US commanders would launch operations at will , would decide who a terrorist was , and would arrest and imprison Iraqis at will .
Then al - Maliki went to Iran for consultations .
And Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani forbade a giveaway of Iraqi sovereignty .
And the Sadrists began demonstrating every Friday .
Then the US launched a unilateral operation in al - Maliki ’s home town and killed his cousin .
So the private contractors wo n’t have legal immunity .
And the agreement will be just for a year , not long - term .
And it wo n’t be ratified by the Iraqi parliament , so it is just a vague agreement between two executives .
It wo n’t stipulate long - term arrangements , but its interpretive context will be one in which the Iraqi leadership has expressed a desire for US troops to leave in 2010 .
It is n’t clear if US troops will have legal immunity or whether they will have full freedom of action or whether they will be able to arrest and incarcerate Iraqis at will .
And now , it wo n’t be signed by the deadline of July 31 .
You have to wonder whether the Iraqis and the Americans in the end wo n’t have to go back to the UN for a troop mandate again .
The Iraqis want out from under the UN but do n’t want to recognize that the American presence detracts from their sovereignty .
D’oh .
No provincial election law again on Monday .
Maybe Tuesday .
Maybe not .
The Iraqi legislative calendar is more like “ Waiting for Godot ” than it is like . . . a legislative calendar .
John McCain thinks that Iraq and Pakistan have a common border .
[ Hat tip to Think Progress . ]
Hey , everybody , ask McCain if he ’ll pull out US troops by 2010 if that is what the Iraqi government says it wants .
McCain keeps boasting about being “ right ” about the “ surge ” and saying Obama was “ wrong . ”
Look , it is more important that McCain was consistently wrong .
He was wrong about the desirability of going to war against Iraq .
He was wrong about it being a cakewalk .
He was wrong about there being WMD there .
He was wrong about everything .
And he was wrong about the troop escalation making things better .
The casualty figures dropped in al - Anbar , where few extra US troops were ever sent .
They dropped in Basra , from which the British withdrew .
Something happened .
Putting it all on 30,000 extra troops seems a stretch .
And what about all the ethnic cleansing and displacing of persons that took place under the nose of the “ surge ? ” McCain has been wrong about everything to do with Iraq .
And he is boasting about his wisdom on it !
Guerrillas used a tractor bomb to kill 7 persons and wound 8 others in Diyala Province near Iran , where there is a lively contest for power among Shiites , Sunni Arabs and Kurds .
Reuters reports other recent political violence in Iraq :
New TSA ID Requirement
The TSA has a new photo ID requirement :
Beginning Saturday , June 21 , 2008 passengers that willfully refuse to provide identification at security checkpoint will be denied access to the secure area of airports .
This change will apply exclusively to individuals that simply refuse to provide any identification or assist transportation security officers in ascertaining their identity .
This new procedure will not affect passengers that may have misplaced , lost or otherwise do not have ID but are cooperative with officers .
Cooperative passengers without ID may be subjected to additional screening protocols , including enhanced physical screening , enhanced carry - on and / or checked baggage screening , interviews with behavior detection or law enforcement officers and other measures .
That ’s right ; people who refuse to show ID on principle will not be allowed to fly , but people who claim to have lost their ID will .
I feel well - protected against terrorists who ca n’t lie .
I do n’t think any further proof is needed that the ID requirement has nothing to do with security , and everything to do with control .

EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- Michael Strahan had what he wanted -- a Super Bowl championship to add to a résumé featuring seven Pro Bowls and two sack records .
Now it was time to leave football and leave the New York Giants after 15 years in the NFL .
Four months after a stunning Super Bowl victory over the previously unbeaten New England Patriots , the 36 - year - old Strahan informed Giants co-owner John Mara he was done .
He will be walking away from a $ 4 million contract for the 2008 season .
" I told him he 's been a great Giant , " Mara said Monday .
" He thanked me for everything the organization has done for him .
I said , ' I think you 've done more for us than we can ever do for you . ' "
Strahan never told his coaches or his teammates of his decision .
They learned of it from reporters at practice .
" I 'm just finding out about it ; let me get organized , " coach Tom Coughlin said after a team workout .
Strahan , who has long said he wants a job in television , plans to hold a news conference Tuesday at Giants Stadium .
Tony Agnone , Strahan 's agent , said the Giants offered Strahan more money in an effort to get him to play another year .
The language of the internal party memo was stark and brutally honest .
Sent out by Republican congressman Tom Davis last week after a stunning congressional by - election loss in the Deep South , it warned colleagues of a potential disaster ahead .
The result , in which the Democratic party won a Mississippi House of Representatives seat that had voted 62 per cent for President Bush in 2004 , was a sign of a ' toxic ' political environment for Republicans , Davis wrote .
He went on to point out the loss was the Republicans ' third defeat in a row in special elections - the equivalent of a by - election in Britain - this year alone .
Davis 's memo dubbed the defeats ' canaries in the coalmine ' for the survival of the Republican party .
A Democratic win in such a solidly conservative district capped a week in which Senator Barack Obama finally turned his eyes to the coming November election and his opponent , John McCain .
Now many Democrats believe the signs are good that the tide of American public opinion is firmly swinging their way and will deliver them the White House .
Certainly , many of the key indicators are giving them strong grounds for optimism .
A recent Quinnipiac University Polling Institute survey showed that a staggering 82 per cent of Americans are unhappy with the direction that the country is heading .
At the same time the faltering economy , and especially high petrol prices , are a major concern .
' Overwhelmingly , voters think the economy is in bad shape , ' said Maurice Carroll , Quinnipiac 's polling director .
Obama is now leading McCain in recent national polls by an average of four points .
The results in Mississippi showed Republican voters were willing to vote for a Democratic candidate in areas where the party would normally assume it had no chance .
The fight was especially significant as the Republican candidate , Greg Davis , ran a campaign aggressively linking his opponent , Travis Childers , to Obama and the controversy over his former pastor , the Rev Jeremiah Wright .
If Obama was looking for reassurance that Wright 's outspoken and radical views had not damaged his chances , then Childers 's victory provided it .
It also raised the prospect that Obama - buoyed by a massive turnout among black voters - might prove competitive in the South against McCain .
Some Democrat insiders think Obama might even win states such as Virginia and North Carolina .
Many Democrats are also starting to hope that Obama is emerging from his long fight with Hillary Clinton as a more battle - tested candidate who has got his major mistakes out of the way early .
He has also honed an efficient media machine that responds rapidly to attacks , in stark contrast to the sluggish efforts of the Democratic party 's 2004 candidate , John Kerry .
But it would be unfair to say that all Republicans are predicting disaster .
Certainly the party 's chances in the congressional elections to be held in November look grim .
But many experts say that voters look at local issues in such elections and that the terrain of a presidential campaign is very different .
' The Mississippi result bodes well for the Democrats in Congress .
It does not mean anything for the national election , ' said Professor Cary Covington , a political scientist at the University of Iowa .
Indeed , there is very little in the way of despair in McCain 's camp .
Privately , McCain aides express high confidence that Obama has many weaknesses that they will be able to exploit .
Many of their attacks will likely build on the lines used by Clinton , where she has portrayed Obama as an elitist who is out of touch with many working Americans , especially blue - collar whites in crucial states such as West Virginia , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The McCain campaign is also now closely studying a dossier of tactics drawn up by Obama 's Republican opponent in a Senate election of 2004 .
That opponent , Jack Ryan , dropped out due to a sex scandal , which ensured the dossier went unused .
But now it is being dusted off by McCain staffers .
It detailed various votes and statements by Obama that could be used to portray him as being in favour of legalising marijuana , soft on crime and too tolerant of sex offenders .
The dossier 's contents and tone seem likely to ensure the coming anti-Obama assault will be dirty .
One internet advert attacking Obama 's wife , Michelle , is already being circulated by the Tennessee Republican party , featuring a four - minute video based on her remarks that she became proud of her country only after her husband decided to run for President .
The video plays Michelle Obama 's words six times , interspersed with ordinary Tennesseans explaining why they have always been proud of America .
McCain 's campaign team also believes that Obama is going to be vulnerable on a traditional Democratic weakness : national security .
Recent statements seeking to link him to Hamas , and Bush 's speech in Israel last week on appeasement were seen as the first attempts to paint Obama as weak on terrorism .
' If Obama can convince the American people he can protect them , then he can not lose .
But it is a tough job .
And if he can't convince them , then I do n't think he can win , ' said Covington .
Certainly , national security was a key issue in the Republican victory in 2004 , despite the disaster of the Iraq war .
McCain , who is hawkish abroad and is a war hero , is likely to again make it the centrepiece of his party 's campaign .
Covington is also convinced that the economy will not be the key issue in the election , just as it was not in 2004 .
Instead , Republicans will try to use McCain 's public distancing from Bush as a way of nullifying the impact of Iraq .
' McCain 's background makes him a formidable opponent and he has been forthright in his criticism of Bush in speeches , ' said Covington .
' At this moment , I would have to think McCain is the more likely to win . '
The Battlegrounds
If Barack Obama is to unify his party and make it to the White House in November he will have to improve in three key areas
Race and religion
Obama is attempting to become America 's first black President and thus race is one of the thorniest issues in the election .
Obama 's victory in overwhelmingly white Iowa in January was heralded as a new era of non-racial politics .
However , recent contests in Pennsylvania and West Virginia have shown that a significant minority of white voters still consider race as an issue .
Nor is it just white voters .
The Hispanic electorate - seen as key to whoever wins in November - has a historically complicated relationship with black candidates and will need to be won over .
The issue of religion will probably mix with race .
The controversy over Obama 's former pastor , the Rev Jeremiah Wright , above , highlighted the differences between black and white churches in America .
Thus Obama 's open and strong Christian faith , usually a huge boon to candidates , will probably be a more complex issue , with some whites fearing the mixture of black pride and conspiracy theory that Wright preached .
White working class
Hillary Clinton 's victories in Ohio , Pennsylvania and West Virginia - all three of which are vital states for the Democrats in November - showed that working - class white voters remain sceptical of Obama .
Obama has to reach out to them to unite the Democrats and also to stand a chance in November .
Without them the Clinton camp 's prediction that Obama 's alliance of liberals and black Americans will not be enough to win the White House will almost certainly come true .
National security
Weakness on national security has been an ongoing problem for the Democrats in recent decades , despite the catastrophic invasion of Iraq and the continuing violence there .
In 2004 , when the war was already unpopular , Democrat John Kerry was portrayed as soft and weak on national security , even though he was a decorated Vietnam veteran .
Obama , who has served only one term in the Senate , is likely to be seen as an even easier target by Republicans .
At the recent GUADEC event in Istanbul , the GTK + community discussed ways to improve the toolkit 's theming system .
A particularly exciting project listed among the items on the roadmap is a plan for creating an experimental GTK +
theme engine that will enable developers to customize the appearance of their themes with cascading style sheets ( CSS ) .
GNOME developer Robert Staudinger has already begun working on this task and posted a message yesterday on the GNOME themes mailing list with some additional details , a link to the source code of his prototype implementation , and some exciting screenshots .
Although the project is still at a very early stage in development , and only a small handful of CSS features are currently supported , the work done so far shows a lot of potential .
To map CSS onto GTK + , he is creating what he calls the CSS Box Drawing Library ( CBD ) .
To get a good idea of how this works , check out the border drawing implementation .
A few months ago , we looked at how CSS styling in the Qt toolkit makes it easy to bring impressive aesthetic improvements to applications .
It is n't clear yet whether the CSS - based GTK + theme engine will bring quite the same level of flexibility , but the GTK +
developers clearly think that it could simplify theme creation and make the process more accessible to artists and web developers .
It 's worth noting that this is still largely an experiment and that it does n't necessarily represent the final theming strategy for GTK +
3 . There are many other items on the roadmap that are important , too .

Operation Enduring Freedom is the official label for the US military invasion and occupation of Afghanistan .
After almost seven years of fighting , what has been gained ?
What might be gained ?
Militarily , US frustration with heavy casualties and lack of progress came to a head recently when Defense Secretary Robert Gates blamed NATO allies for US casualties .
 I know Ive been a big nag , and I know Ive been a pain , but for NATO to continue to be tied up in politics [ because of a lack of public support ] and issues between governments that are irrelevant to whether we are making progress in Afghanistan , I just dont have patience any more . . . Weve got kids dying because of the gaps . 
Freedom ?
There ’s no progress there , either , for women , journalists and Afghanis in general .
Freedom for women ?
Ann Jones , a writer who has lived in Afghanistan , writes that promises to the Afghans are repeatedly broken .
The national government , with the consent of the occupation , installed many of the very warlords who had shelled Kabul for years .
Afghan women , by far , have had it the worst , suffering for centuries in a moribund patriarchal culture , from relentless discrimination that regarded them as the lowest form of slaves .
A recent example : On May 21 , 2007 , the lower house of the Afghan parliament , the Wolesi Jirga , voted to suspend Malalai Joya , a female MP elected from Farah province .
Malalai was accused of insulting the parliament and suspended until the end of her term in 2009 .
Malalais suspension occurred after she appeared in a television interview comparing the parliament to an animal stable .
Freedom of the press ?
The fourth trial of journalist Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh , condemned to death , scheduled for Sunday , June 15 , was delayed again by the judges in the case .
Medical evidence has been submitted showing Kambakhsh was tortured during interrogations at the Balkh provincial jail .
Yakub Kambakhsh , older brother of Parwez , and a noted journalist himself said ,  Now we have found out that there is no impartial court in Afghanistan , even in the capital . "
The Committee to Protect Journalists in Afghanistan on June 11th called on President Karzai for press freedom :
Call for the release of imprisoned journalism student Parwez Kambakhsh , who was sentenced to death by a provincial court in January on blasphemy charges .
Identify and prosecute the killers of BBC journalist Abdul Samad Rohani , who was slain in Helmand province on June 7 .
Investigate reported attacks in western Herat province against two female journalists who later resigned their news media positions .
Unidentified assailants twice hurled grenades at Khadija Ahmadis house in April after she was anonymously warned to quit her post at Faryat radio station , according to news reports .
Direct prosecutors to drop criminal charges against the privately run television network Tolo TV for defying a parliamentary ban on selected Indian soap operas .
Freedom for the Afghanis ?
According to the recent Amnesty International Report 2008 : Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including Afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups .
All sides carried out indiscriminate attacks , which included aerial bombardments by the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and US - led Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) forces , as well as suicide attacks by armed groups .
According to the Afghanistan NGO Security Office , there were around 2,000 non-combatant civilian deaths , with international forces causing over a quarter of casualties and insurgent groups just under half .
Rights associated with education , health and freedom of expression were violated , particularly for women .
Human rights defenders and journalists , many of them women , were threatened , physically intimidated , detained or killed .
Reforms of key government institutions , including the police and intelligence service , made limited progress .
Government officials and local power - holders were not held accountable for reported abuses and there was little or no access to justice in many areas .
Freedom is in big trouble in Afghanistan , but let ’s think positive , prospects for a natural gas pipeline might be better .
Turkmenistan is just north of Afghanistan .
Daniel Sershen reported a year ago from Ashgabat , Turkmenistan for the Christian Science Monitor : " Blanketed by vast deserts , Turkmenistan sits atop some of the world ’s largest natural - gas reserves .
As Russia and the West look to secure new gas and oil supplies in a tightening race for energy security , this Central Asian country has landed squarely in their sights .
Last weekend , Russia secured a deal for a new pipeline to take Turkmenistan ’s gas north , delivering a serious setback to US and European hopes for one that would siphon the gas to the West  bypassing Russia ’s increasingly powerful grip on energy resources and routes . "
Setback to the West ?
Not so fast .
In response , last November Turkmenistan , Afghanistan , Pakistan and India , the four partners of a proposed $ 3.3 bn pipeline , vowed to accelerate work on the four - nation project to bring natural gas from Turkmenistan to India .
The declaration was adopted in New Delhi at a two - day regional economic cooperation forum on Afghanistan , which was attended by Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
The proposed gas pipeline project ( TAPI ) will initially provide 30 million cubic meters of gas to Pakistan and India each and 5 million cubic meters to Afghanistan on a daily basis , which can be later increased up to 90 million cubic meters in aggregate .
TAPI will run from the Dovetabat gas deposit in Turkmenistan to the Indian town of Fazilka , near the border between Pakistan and India .
Six compressor stations are to be constructed along the pipeline .
TAPI certainly would help the consumer countries , Pakistan and India , while Turkmenistan could make billions of dollars from gas exports .
But arguably it would benefit US - client Afghanistan most by providing steady transit fees to fill depleted state coffers in Kabul .
The American company Unocal has a ten - year history of interest in the Turkmenistan gas field and a pipeline through Afghanistan .
The Taliban was n’t interested , but the Hamid Karzai government is more amenable .
On April 28 Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimukhamedov met in Kabul , where they signed an agreement on extension of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan , Pakistan and India .
A key political objective of the TAPI pipeline , one that changed it from TAP to TAPI , was to involve India and keep it away from a proposed Iran - Pakistan - India ( IPI ) pipeline .
This would receive a boost from a civil nuclear energy pact with the United States .
But India has its politics also .
The future of the nuclear energy pact between New Delhi and Washington appears bleak , and last month , reports Downstream Today , Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq said that , after a visit from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iran - Pakistan - India ( IPI ) gas pipeline project is moving toward the " final stage " of its implementation .
" The direction of the project is positive , " said Sadiq at a weekly news briefing .
The US $ 7.5 - billion IPI gas pipeline project , which has been under discussions since 1994 , is to deliver natural gas from Iran to Pakistan and India .
Last month , the long - stalled talks on the gas pipeline project made a breakthrough when Ahmadinejad made whistle - stop visits to Pakistan and India .
The three countries are expected to sign agreements on the IPI project soon .
Yikes , foiled again , outflanked by Iran ?
Again , there are options .
The IPI pipeline would n’t of course pass through war - torn Afghanistan but it would pass through Balochistan , the largest of Pakistan ’s provinces and the scene of recent unrest including pipeline bombings .
( I wonder who financed the unrest ? )
In fact , Balochistan might opt to become an independent state if it is not granted provincial autonomy , Senate Deputy Chairman Jan Muhammad Jamali said recently .
 The time is running out … there is no other option left but to grant provincial autonomy to all the provinces including Balochistan ,  Jamali told the Upper House while speaking on a point of order .
He said he had been forced to raise the voice of the people of his province , as the situation was rapidly deteriorating .
 The four brothers ( provinces ) will not be able to live together if the situation remains the same ,  he added .
Is there any chance that Jamali ’s threats might come true ?
Do the Jamalis have any clout ?
Could Pakistan break up ?
It ’s possible .
The Jamali family has in the past collaborated with the CIA and the ISI ( Pakistan Intelligence ) in countering the activities of two other tribes and their Marxist influence in Balochistan .
During the course of this collaboration , Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali became friendly with Nancy Powell ( no relation to Colin ) , who was then a young member of the diplomatic corps in Pakistan and then served as US ambassador to Pakistan 2002 2004 .
She is currently the ambassador to Nepal .
An independent Balochistan would balkanize Pakistan , create a US - friendly state between Iran and India , and hurt Iran badly by stymieing the IPI pipeline .
It would also provide a side benefit by isolating the large new port that the Chinese are financing in Gwadar , on Balochistan ’s coast .
In March 2002 , Chinese vice premier Wu Bangguo laid the foundation for Gwadar port , which is intended be a key Chinese facility on the Arabian Sea , not far from the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz .
The US might consider this a threat to The Carter Doctrine , which dictates that the US shall be the big dog in the Middle East .
Operation Enduring Freedom ?
With John McCain and Barack Obama now arguing about widening the Afghanistan war and invading Pakistan , the TAPI natural gas pipeline has a better chance than freedom ever had .
It would be an American - controlled cash cow that would hurt Iran .
All the US needs to do is pacify Afghanistan with more troops ( to safeguard TAPI ) and balkanize Pakistan ( to stymie IPI ) while widening the war and antagonizing India .
Freedom be damned .
Freedom was never an option anyhow , especially when there ’s money to be made by endless war .

The Best of Don Bacon
BEIJING  If Westerners feel dazed and confused upon exiting the plane at the new international airport terminal here , it ’s understandable .
It ’s not just the grandeur of the space .
It ’s the inescapable feeling that you ’re passing through a portal to another world , one whose fierce embrace of change has left Western nations in the dust .
The sensation is comparable to the epiphany that Adolf Loos , the Viennese architect , experienced when he stepped off a steamship in New York Harbor more than a century ago .
He had crossed a threshold into the future ; Europe , he realized , was now culturally obsolete .
Designed by Norman Foster , Beijing ’s glittering air terminal is joined by a remarkable list of other new monuments here : Paul Andreu ’s egg - shaped National Theater ; Herzog & de Meuron ’s National Stadium , known as the bird ’s nest ; PTW ’s National Aquatics Center , with its pillowy translucent exterior ; and Rem Koolhaas ’s headquarters for the CCTV television authority , whose slanting , interconnected forms are among the most imaginative architectural feats in recent memory .
Critics have incessantly described these high - profile projects as bullish expressions of the nation ’s budding global primacy .
Yet these buildings are not simply blunt expressions of power .
Like the great monuments of 16th - century Rome or 19th - century Paris , China ’s new architecture exudes an aura that has as much to do with intellectual ferment as economic clout .
Our friends over at Colorado Independent have a great new analysis up on free speech zones graveyards at the upcoming DNC .
As Constitutional attorney John Whitehead explains , the Dems will be the only party this summer building a fence around open expression .
Protesters at the upcoming Democratic National Convention ( DNC ) in Denver in late August will be corralled into caged “ free speech zones ” made of chicken wire and chain link fences which are located more than two football fields from the delegates ’ entrance .
Those who attempt to exercise their First Amendment rights outside this makeshift cage , which is partially obscured by trees and sculptures , will be arrested .
( Ironically , protesters at this year ’s Republican National Convention will not face a cage or even policemen in riot gear . )
Pardonnez - moi le Francais , but this is a fucking embarrassment of the first order .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but if you ’re only free to speak in certain areas , far removed from any chance of actually being heard , then what you have is not free speech .
“ Free speech ” under these conditions is tortured into the sort of Rovian Newspeak we ’ve had to endure these past few years , an open lie so bald - faced it would have shamed Richard Nixon .
Stalin had “ free speech zones , ” too , only he called them “ prisons . ”
S&R has been credentialed to cover the DNC and we ’ll be bringing a fair - sized team to the show .
Some of us will be inside watching the official events unfold , but rest assured , others will be hunting for free speech , no matter what part of Denver officials try to hide it in .
( And since a lot of us live here , we know our way around . )
We do n’t expect to agree with everything being said – heck , we may not agree with a word of it – but I think a lot of us here feel an obligation to certain Constitutional principles that both parties seem to have abandoned .
And if we ’ve hated how the GOP has redefined “ freedom , ” you can bet your sweet ass we ’re even less enamored of Vichy Democrats bent on out - GOPping the Busheviks .
So fine , DNC – try and hide free speech as best you can .
But we ’re going to go find it and bring it back for all to hear .
Meanwhile , a question for the man who ought to be out front in making sure that free speech graveyards are a thing of the past : Sen .
Obama , why are n’t you defending the right to free speech in America ?
MIT biological engineers have developed a new imaging system that allows them to see cells that have undergone a specific mutation .
The work , which could help scientists understand how precancerous mutations arise , marks the first time researchers have been able to pinpoint the number and location of mutant cells -- cells with a particular mutation -- in intact tissue .
In this case , the researchers worked with mouse pancreatic cells .
" Understanding where mutations come from is fundamental to understanding the origins of cancer , " said Bevin Engelward , associate professor of biological engineering and member of MIT 's Center for Environmental Health Sciences , and an author of a paper on the work appearing in this week 's online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
Peter
So , professor of biological and mechanical engineering , Engelward and members of their laboratories developed technologies that made it possible to detect clusters of cells that appeared to be descended from the same progenitor cell .
Unexpectedly , more than 90 percent of the cells harboring mutations were within clusters .
That offers evidence that the majority of mutations are inherited from another cell , rather than arising spontaneously in individual cells .
Since the type of mutation being studied ( in this case a recombination event ) occurs at a rate on par with other types of mutations , " it is as if we are peering in at the very general process of mutation formation , persistence and clonal expansion , " said Engelward .

" We think this raises the possibility that mutations resulting from cell division are a tremendous factor in increasing the mutagenic load , " she said .
The higher the mutagenic load , the more likely it is that cancer will develop .
Engelward and So started working together several years ago after a faculty retreat for MIT 's newly formed Biological Engineering Division .
So was developing a new type of microscopy , known as two - photon imaging , and the researchers wondered whether it could be used to locate and image rare types of cells .
The team genetically engineered a strain of mice in which DNA would fluoresce if a mutation occurred in a particular sequence .
That allowed them to use
So 's newly developed high - resolution , high - throughput microscopy technique to detect individual cells that carry the mutation .
" The problem drove the development of a new imaging technology , which now can be used for lots of things , " said Engelward .
Lead author of the paper is Dominika Wiktor - Brown , a postdoctoral associate in biological engineering .
Other authors of the paper are Hyuk - Sang Kwon , a research affiliate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering , and Yoon Sung Nam , a graduate student in biological engineering .
The work was truly a team effort between many people with very different areas of expertise , said Engelward .
" The Department of Biological Engineering and the Center for Environmental Health Sciences are key in helping to bridge people across disciplines , " she said .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the Department of Energy and the Singapore - MIT Alliance .
The intrepid travelers at Curious Expeditions visited the Hungarian Agricultural Museum where they shot amazing photos of a veritable cathedral of antlers , the Hall of Hunting .
The museum is located in Vajdahunyad Castle inside Budapest 's City Park .
From Curious Expeditions :
Hundreds of antlers , horns , hooves , and fur .
Stuffed birds and mounted bears .
Cutlery with horn handles carved into foxes .
Antler broaches , antler chandeliers , and antler chairs .
It is known as " The Hall of Hunting . "
With beautiful vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows , along with the fact that the Agricultaral Museum is often empty , this top floor feels like the church of a long lost deer deity .
Echoed footsteps and hushed whispers lend a quiet respect to these relics of the hunt .
It 's a wonder that the Agricultural Museum of Budapest has anything at all .
The collection has been destroyed not once , but twice since its opening 100 years ago .
WWll came through , and about 10 years later , just as the collection was coming back together , the freedom fighters of the hungarian uprising of 1956 tore through the hall of antlers and taxidermy displays .
But through many donations and loving attention , this shrine of the dead animal has been restored to its former glory .
One winter night in 2000 , Danny , who was 21 at the time , went home with a guy he met at a crowded bar in San Francisco .
Random hookups were n’t out of the ordinary for Danny , but this one ended badly :
As he was buttoning up to go home , his new friend mentioned he was hiv positive .
Usually conscientious about safe sex , Danny had n’t been , and he panicked .
“ I was in shock , ” he says .
“ I just could n’t believe it . ”
He vaguely remembered reading about an emergency treatment that could prevent infection , so when he got home he called the California aids hotline .
Memory served .
A monthlong regimen known as post - exposure prophylaxis treatment ( pep ) —usually given to health care workers who have been stuck with needles — was available at local clinics and emergency rooms to people who had recently been exposed to hiv .
The side effects of debilitating nausea and fatigue were a small price to pay for its potential benefits :
A study of health care workers published in the New England Journal of Medicine linked the rapid administration of the drug to an 81 percent decrease in the risk of contracting the virus .
Danny went to a city clinic , where after a consultation , he was given a prescription for two antiretroviral drugs — the same kind that hiv - positive patients have taken since the ’ 80s .
As preventative medicine , the drugs work with a one - two punch :
The first intercepts the virus ’ initial attachment to dna , and the second stops infected cells from spreading the virus .
Danny was lucky that California is one of the few states ( along with New York , Massachusetts , New Mexico , and Rhode Island ) where policies ensure that the general public — not just hospital workers who have been exposed on the job — can access the drugs .
Elsewhere , the decision is up to individual hospitals , clinics , and doctors .
Surveying all 50 state health departments and more than 50 ERs nationwide , I encountered std clinicians and workers at aids hotlines and Planned Parenthoods who did not know pep could be prescribed to the public .
An Alabama health department official told me , “ It ’s not available . ”
A nurse at a North Dakota clinic said he all but encouraged patients to fly to San Francisco .
Since the virus must be intercepted before it attaches to cells and reaches the lymph nodes , it is crucial that pep be administered immediately — each passing hour means decreased effectiveness .
“ It needs to be treated like a gunshot wound or a stabbing , ” says Antonio Urbina , a medical director at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Center ’s hiv clinic in New York City .
Yet of the largest hospitals in each state , only a quarter offer pep in their emergency rooms .
In a 2005 - 06 cdc survey taken at gay pride parades around the country , less than 20 percent of hiv - negative respondents knew about pep .
“ When I tell people that I used it , they say they ’ve never heard of it , ” says Danny .
“ You see signs about crystal meth or syphilis , but even in the gay publications , you never see ads for pep . ”
pep is fda approved , commercially available , and even often covered by insurance ( though for the uninsured the drugs run upward of $ 1,000 ) .
In 2005 , the cdc recommended that pep be administered to all patients on a case - by - case basis within 72 hours of a high - risk exposure , followed up by testing and counseling .
But for reasons that are more political than scientific , there is no federal funding for the treatment .
Some public health officials claim that public availability of pep will encourage risky behavior — the same argument used against RU - 486 , abortions , and condom distribution .
Robert Janssen , director of the Division of hiv / aids Prevention at the cdc , explains , “ Biomedical interventions raise concerns that people would feel , ‘ Oh , I have these pills , they will keep me from getting it . ' ”
Yet 73 percent of non-hospital - worker pep recipients in a San Francisco study decreased high - risk sex over the following year .
And since pep drugs are so toxic , most doctors would be careful about overprescribing .
“ I ’m concerned with two things , ” says Urbina .
“ Is the person that exposed them either hiv positive or at high risk for hiv , and is there potential contact with infectious body fluid ?
If both are yes , in my equation , you give pep . ” Peter Leone , medical director of North Carolina ’s hiv department , who has n’t received the necessary support to institute a public pep program in his state , believes the benefits of pep outweigh the risks .
“ Nationally , there is a ‘ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ’ policy , ” he says .
“ We ’re okay to say it ’s a good idea , as long as we do n’t know about it and do n’t do anything to support it .
We do n’t deny care to smokers or people who did n’t buckle their seat belts .
It says a lot about the political climate around sexuality and homophobia . ”
For the 40,000 people infected with hiv in the United States each year , the knowledge of a lost opportunity for prevention is devastating .
In Britain , an hiv - positive couple has filed suit against the government for withholding lifesaving information .
' So unpresidential ' : Moments from a surreal debate that wo n't be forgotten
They bickered on who should appoint the next Supreme Court justice , their stances on health care and even brought each other ’s families into the fray .
QUEUES of frustrated foreigners crowd many an American consulate around the world hoping to get into the United States .
Less noticed are the heavily taxed American expatriates wanting to get out — by renouncing their citizenship .
In Hong Kong just now , they cannot .
“ Please note that this office cannot accept renunciation applications at this time , ” the consulate 's website states .
Apart from sounding like East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall , the closure is unfortunately timed .
Because of pending legislation on President Bush 's desk that is expected to become law by June 16th , any American who wants to surrender his passport has only a few days to do so before facing an enormous penalty .
That penalty is buried in an innocuous piece of legislation with the veto - proof name , Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax ( HEART ) act .
The new law means active American soldiers will benefit from tax relief .
To pay for that , Congress has turned on expats , especially those who , since new tax laws in 2006 , have become increasingly eager to give up their citizenship to escape the taxman .
Under the proposed legislation , expatriates surrendering their citizenship with a net worth of $ 2 m or more , or a high income , will have to act as if they have sold all their worldwide assets at a fair market price .
If the unrealised gains on these assets exceed $ 600,000 , capital - gains tax will apply .
A study by the Congressional Budget Office guesses that the new law will progressively net the government up to $ 286 m over five years .
It is unclear , however , why people would suffer the consequences if they did not expect to save money in the long run by escaping American taxes .
That expats want to leave at all is evidence of America 's odd tax system .
Along with citizens of North Korea and a few other countries , Americans are taxed based on their citizenship , rather than where they live .
So they usually pay twice — to their host country and the Internal Revenue Service .
As this makes citizenship less palatable , Congress has erected large barriers to stop them jumping ship .
In 1996 it forced people who renounced citizenship to continue paying income taxes for an extra ten years .
Theoretically , the new law allows for a cleaner break .
But even as the law tries to prevent people from renouncing their citizenship , it may have the opposite effect .
Under the new structure , it would make financial sense for any young American working overseas with a promising career to renounce his citizenship as early as possible , before his assets accumulate .
For everyone else , plunging stock and property prices mean now may be as good a time as any to hand back the passport , says Kurt Rademacher , a partner at Withers , a global tax - planning firm .
In Hong Kong the temptation for Americans to switch citizenship is particularly strong , because of the territory 's low taxes .
On the other hand , banks and other firms who want to hire Americans may find it harder to do so , even though greater China is one of the world 's fastest - growing regions .
It places Americans in the awkward position of weighing their patriotism against their vocation .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States should be making all of its electricity with renewable and carbon - free energy in 10 years , former Vice President Al Gore said Thursday .
America 's security , environmental and economic crises are all related , Al Gore said Thursday .
" The survival of the United States of America as we know it is at risk , " Gore said .
In a speech at Washington 's Constitution Hall , Gore touched on an array of the nation 's current woes , saying the economic , environmental and national security crises are all related .
" I do n't remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously , " Gore said .
To begin to fix all the problems , Gore said , " the answer is to end our reliance on carbon - based fuels . "
Watch more on Gore 's answer to energy crisis »
Gore called on the country to produce all of its electricity from renewable and carbon - free sources in 10 years , a goal he compared to President Kennedy 's challenge for the country to put a man on the moon in the 1960s .
Gore chastised those who have proposed opening new areas for oil drilling as a solution to U.S. energy problems .
" It is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short - term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now , " Gore said .
Watch panelists discuss
Gore 's speech »
New demand from places like China means oil supplies wo n't be able to meet increasing demand , Gore said .
" The way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of $ 1 a gallon gasoline , " the former vice president and Nobel laureate said .
Read Gore 's full speech
After losing the presidential election to then - Texas Gov. George Bush in 2000 , Gore returned to the nation 's political main stage with " An Inconvenient Truth , " a documentary film detailing global warming 's effects on the planet , in 2006 .
The widely acclaimed film went on to win an Academy Award for best documentary in 2007 .
In the movie , Gore explains how the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have grown exponentially in the last few decades and how that has led to changes in the Earth 's climate , such as shrinking polar ice caps and an increase in the number of hurricanes and other violent storms .
To counteract the effects of global warming , Gore has pushed for policies that would reduce the emission of carbon dioxide , such as greater energy conservation and the development of alternative energy sources like wind and solar energy .
Gore has also advocated for governments to tax the emission of carbon dioxide .
Gore and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for increasing awareness of the climate change issue and for advocating for policies that could potentially offset the effects of global warming .
Gore 's return to the political arena has drawn increased scrutiny , particularly of his energy use .
In 2007 , the Tennessee Center for Policy Research chastised Gore for " extravagant energy use " at his Nashville , Tennessee , mansion .
Gore subsequently has installed solar panels , a geothermal heating and cooling system , compact fluorescent light bulbs and other energy - saving technologies in his home .

[ Here is the preface to Mises : The Last Knight of Liberalism ( Mises Institute , 2007 ) . ]
In the summer of 1940 , with Hitler 's troops moving through France to encircle Switzerland , Ludwig von Mises sat beside his wife Margit on a bus filled with Jews fleeing Europe .
To avoid capture , the bus driver took back roads through the French countryside , stopping to ask locals if the Germans had been spotted ahead — reversing and finding alternative routes if they had been .
Mises was two months shy of his fifty - ninth birthday .
He had left Vienna some years earlier , escaping only days before the Nazis ransacked his apartment , confiscated his records , and froze his assets .
He had hoped to be safe in Geneva .
Now nowhere in Europe seemed safe .
Not only was he a prominent intellectual of Jewish descent ; he was widely known to be an archenemy of National Socialism and of every other form of socialism .
Some called him " The Last Knight of Liberalism . "
Failing to catch him in Vienna , the Nazis tried to snatch him in Switzerland .
Again they did not succeed .
Mises did not assume his luck would last .
He had personally steered Austria away from Bolshevism , saved his country from the level of hyperinflation that destroyed interwar Germany , and convinced a generation of young socialist intellectuals to embrace the market .
Now he was a political refugee headed for a foreign continent .
The couple arrived in the United States with barely any money and no prospects for income .
Mises 's former students and disciples had found prestigious positions in British and American universities ( often with his help ) , but Mises himself was considered an anachronism .
In an age of growing government and central planning , he was a defender of private property and an opponent of all government intervention in the economy .
Perhaps worst of all , he was a proponent of verbal logic and deductive social science in an era of empiricism , positivism , and abstract mathematical models .
No university would have him .
Margit began to train as a secretary .
Over the next decade , they would slowly rebuild and Mises would find new allies .
He would also publish his most important book , Human Action .
It would earn him a following whose admiration and devotion were beyond anything he had known in Europe .
When he died in October 1973 , he had only a small circle of admirers and disciples , but this group became the nucleus of a movement that has grown exponentially .
Today his writings inspire economists and libertarians throughout the world , and are avidly read by an increasing number of students in all the social sciences .
There is an entire school of " Misesian " economists flourishing most notably in the United States , but also in Spain , France , the Czech Republic , Argentina , Romania , and Italy .
This movement is testimony to the lasting power and impact of his ideas .
The purpose of the present book is to tell the story of how these ideas emerged in their time .
It is the story of an amazing economist , of his life and deeds .
It is the story of his personal impact on the Austrian School and the libertarian movement .
It is above all the story of a man who transformed himself in an uncompromising pursuit of the truth , of a man who adopted his ideas step - by - step , often against his initial inclinations .
Once a student of the historical method in the social sciences , he would become the dean of the opposition Austrian School and humanistic social theory .
He went from left - leaning young idealist in Vienna to grand old man of the American Right .
Dismissive of " the metallists " early in his career , he became an unwavering spokesman for a 100 % gold standard .
He even went from being the most radical free market liberal in Europe to being a libertarian leader in America whose students and followers would consider him too soft on government .
His legacy would be a movement some of whose members would take Mises 's message and his method further than Mises himself would go .
The portrait of Ludwig von Mises offered here is primarily concerned with his intellectual development in the context of his time .
Not much is known about the emotional layer of his personality .
Early on he conceived of himself as a public persona : Professor Mises .
He took great care to destroy any evidence — from receipts to love letters — anything that could have been useful to potential opponents .
We can report on some of the more intimate episodes of his life only because of the private records stolen from his Vienna apartment by the Nazis in March of 1938 .
These documents eventually fell into the hands of the Red Army , were rediscovered in a secret Moscow archive in 1991 , and have been a precious source of information for the present work .
Those who love ideas — especially those who believe that ideas shape our world — may find the following pages worthwhile reading .
If it does no more than raise further interest in Ludwig von Mises and his work , this book will have attained its goal .

Back in 2012 WhatsApp published a blog post titled “ Why we do n’t sell ads ” .
The post stated that WhatsApp will never use you data to sell ads and it appeared that the app had an admirable business philosophy .
“ These days companies know literally everything about you , your friends , your interests ; and they use it all to sell ads .
Remember , when advertising is involved you the user are the product , ” WhatsApp stated back then .
And users had a reason to be impressed .
Most apps come covered in ads tailored for every user and it can be unpleasant to use an application and you are attacked by advertisements .
However , it appears that the good days are finally over for WhatsApp .
WhatsApp announces monetization ideas
In an ironic turn of events , the app that criticized companies that use your data in order to sell you things is about to allow companies to use you data .
A recent blog post announced that WhatsApp will become available for business as well .
This means that businesses will be able to use this application in order to promote their products .
While it can be easy to judge WhatsApp , we have to remember that Facebook acquired it .
We already know that Facebook has been selling tailored ads for a while , so it comes as no surprise the fact that it tries to bring that to WhatsApp .
This decision will benefit small businesses
If we look for a silver lining , we can admit that this change may help small and medium sized business .
After paying a small fee to Facebook , they will be able to stay in touch with their customers at all times .
Verified businesses will also receive a green mark .
At first the ad model can be controlled by the user , but massive enterprise level advertising will soon follow .
Superman can shoot beams from his eyes , fly faster than a jet and survive point - blank gunshots to the head because our sun is a different color from his sun - fine , we 'll accept that .
He 's essentially a solar battery , constantly absorbing energy that turns him invincible , superhumanly fast and all that other stuff that makes him one of the hardest characters to write .
But , even though his skin is impenetrable , what about his innards ?
Would a device , properly inserted into his mouth or say , super bottom , bypass his invulnerability and destroy him , or would he shake it off like so many shitty movies ?
We must know .
Here 's the scenario : in the newly announcedMortal Kombat vs DC Universe , Superman and Cyrax are going at it .
Magical fairies or space / time anomalies ( whatever rationale they use in the game ) make Superman weak enough so Cyrax can perform a brand new rectal fatality on Supes .
In goes the bomb .
Does Superman have a colon of steel ?
Would the bomb go off with a muffled " pop ! " and then Supes coughs out a bit of smoke like a cartoon , or would he shatter into a thousand Krypto - pieces ?
We consulted a DC Comics expert ( with a collection of more than 10,000 funny books ) via text message :
So according to this particular expert , Supes can withstand a regular - sized blast , even an internal one .
The real question then becomes , can Superman survive a NUCLEAR BOMB ?
Answer :
It depends on which Superman has the bomb in his butt .
Pre -Crisis Superman ( do n't ask , it 's a really long story ) could friggin move planets , fly through stars and easily survive ten nukes implanted under each finger .
At one point his sneezes wipe out planets .
With that kind of power , detonating a nuke in his ass would do little but turn him on .
" Super Friends " Superman is considerably less powerful and would probably be effed if he woke up with an armed nuke ticking away in his ass .
Animated '90s Supes was similarly weak until the last season of Justice League Unlimited , so we imagine a similar fate would befall him .
We assumed modern Supes was a bit weaker , but our DC expert said nay :
Curse DC and its constantly rotating history !
Turns out that recently Superman flew through the goddamn sun to burn away microscopic nanomachines that were attacking his innards .
The fact they died and he did n't shows that his insides withstood the pressure and heat of a star - far beyond any mere nuke 's capabilities .
We puny humans have no hope should he decide to go rogue ... exceptBatman .
Our final tally of various supermen with myriad devices erupting from their anuses :

Scientology leader David Miscavige , in full Sea Org regalia .
Miscavige 's status as " captain " of the Sea Org was central to a court case that resulted in the largest court penalty in Scientology history .
Six years ago , when I was a reporter at New Times LA , I ’d written several stories about Scientology ( Los Angeles is one of its headquarters ) , and I was about to uncork the longest one yet — a 7,000 word piece about an embarrassing , $ 8 million defeat Scientology had just suffered , when the weekly paper suddenly folded .
That unpublished story has been sitting in storage ever since .
Fast forward to 2008 , and the world of reporting on Scientology has changed radically , thanks in part to the lunacy of Tom Cruise , but also in part to a worldwide , leaderless movement that calls itself Anonymous .
Ravenous for any information about L. Ron Hubbard ’s strange organization , Anonymous scours the world for the least tidbit about Scientology .
Well , here was a pretty meaty morsel just sitting in my hard drive .
It ’s still a substantial bit of reporting , and it fills in some gaps in the historical record of one of the most humiliating court losses Scientology has ever suffered .
Originally scheduled to be printed in October 2002 , the piece follows .
( It ’s unchanged except for updates in [ brackets ] . )
This material may come as a revelation to some readers , but even for the know - it - alls at Anonymous , there are juicy bites .

What Scientology Paid $ 8 Million To Hide
With an hour to spare , Hubbard ’s minions settle a debt they vowed never to pay
( Prepared for publication in October , 2002 )
by Tony Ortega
Even before it started , the 1986 trial of Lawrence Wollersheim v. the Church of Scientology of California caused a mob scene at L.A. ’s downtown superior court .
When a judge decided during pretrial motions that documents describing confidential Scientology beliefs should be put in a file open to the public , 1,500 Scientologists swamped the court clerk ’s office to keep anyone else from requesting them .
The next day , the judge resealed those records .
But an L.A .
Times reporter managed to get past the crush of Scientologists and copy the file .
Newspapers around the country had a field day with what the Times reported : the documents showed that high - level Scientologists are taught that each human contains the souls of alien creatures banished to Earth 75 million years ago by a galactic overlord named Xenu .
Scientology ’s process of “ dianetics , ” developed by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard over a period beginning in the late 1940s , was supposed to rid the body of those alien creatures .
But Lawrence Wollersheim , who had defected from Scientology after serving 11 years and making about $ 50,000 in payments , claimed that the organization ’s pricey rituals instead had made him insane and drove him to the brink of suicide .
He filed suit in 1980 , and six years later his trial was a sensation .
Still the most expensive civil trial in L.A. court history , [ This was true even in 2002 , post - Simpson — T.O. ] it made headlines almost daily in the spring and summer of 1986 as Scientologists jammed the courtroom and protested outside of it , complaining that their religious freedoms were being trampled on .
For many in the public , reports of the trial gave them their first detailed description of Scientology , which today counts such celebrities as John Travolta and Tom Cruise among its members .
Travolta himself made a visit to the trial that May which was widely reported .
In the lawsuit , Wollersheim claimed that after he left Scientology in 1979 the organization retaliated by destroying his business and attempting to destroy him .
In five months of testimony , Wollersheim , his psychologist , and former Scientologists described the coercion he was subjected to , sacrifices he was expected to make , and bizarre teachings he was fed , which made Hubbard ’s outfit sound more like a mind control cabal out of The Manchurian Candidate than the mainstream faith it claimed to be .
Scientology ’s attorneys countered that Wollersheim had come to the organization with a preexisting mental condition and was a drug user .
Wollersheim was seeking $ 25 million in damages .
The jury awarded him $ 30 million .
It was a stunning blow to Scientology , but probably the most lasting impression that many took from the trial was the reaction of Scientologists themselves , who continued to protest at the courthouse day after day for more than a month after the verdict .
Staging their demonstrations from a tent city set up across the street , the members wore pins made from ten cent coins and chanted over and over : “ Not one thin dime for Wollersheim ! ”
It was a vow that Scientology kept for 16 years .
In 1989 , an appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced Wollersheim ’s award to $ 2.5 million .
But even before the original trial started , and for years afterward , various Scientology entities hit Wollersheim with other lawsuits , exhausted every possible appeal , filed mountainous legal briefs , claimed that the particular entity he had sued was broke and could never pay him , and found other ways to put off paying the money .
Even after the case had twice been to the U.S. Supreme Court and the last possible appeal had been denied , Scientology seemed determined that it would never go back on its promise to deny Wollersheim even one thin dime .
And then , suddenly , Scientology threw in the towel .
On May 9 [ 2002 ] , the Church of Scientology of California , an entity which had once been considered the “ mother church ” but for a decade was supposed to have been dormant and broke , submitted a check to the superior court for $ 8,674,843 to cover the $ 2.5 million judgment and the interest it had accrued .
A Scientology spokeswoman says that the organization was simply tired of the case .
But the timing of the payment suggested another reason .
The very morning that Scientology paid to end the case , superior court judge Robert L. Hess was scheduled to begin a new hearing in the 22 - year - old case — a hearing Wollersheim ’s attorneys had been preparing for , and demanding , for years .
Wollersheim ’s attorneys were about to present evidence that they believed would not only show how Scientology had juggled assets to avoid paying Wollersheim in the past , but would also convince Hess that Scientology ’s complex corporate structure itself was an elaborate sham .
Contrary to what it had assured the IRS when it regained its tax exempt status in 1993 , the “ church ” and its affiliated organizations , Wollersheim ’s attorneys assert , was really a dictatorship with power centered in one man , Hubbard ’s successor David Miscavige , who had directed all of the litigation against Wollersheim and had ordered documents key to the case altered or destroyed .
Scientology ’s attorneys had managed to keep Miscavige out of the proceedings , but the organization ’s nominal president , Heber Jentzsch , was facing cross examination by Wollersheim ’s attorneys if the hearing came off as planned .
In the final days before the scheduled event , Scientology attorneys continued to argue for delays and outright dismissals , but Hess denied them and would not budge on the May 9 date .
After inheriting the case three years earlier , Hess , in transcripts , appeared determined to turn over his courtroom to a live hearing .
Scientology ’s $ 8.7 million check arrived just an hour before the proceeding was scheduled to begin .
In the months since , the court has gradually released the money to Wollersheim for him to dole out to numerous attorneys to pay for years of service .
Those fees will eat up much of the money , but Wollersheim expects to end up with between $ 1 to $ 2 million of it .
[ That has n’t turned out to be the case — see the update at the end of the piece . ]
He is fond of noting that that ’s a lot of dimes .
His attorneys are relieved that their client has finally received the money he had won 16 years earlier , but they admit to disappointment that the evidence they collected for so many years was never presented to the public in a live court drama .
They were happy , however , to share it with New Times .
[ And now , the Voice . ]
A central contention in Wollersheim ’s case was that even sixteen years after Hubbard ’s death , his writings provided an unalterable blueprint to how the organization of Scientology really operated .
And to understand what happened to Wollersheim and others who have defected and now regret the time and large sums they spent learning about Xenu and other dubious concepts , they say , you have to have a working knowledge of Hubbard ’s jargon and policies .
Wollersheim got his first taste of it while walking on a street in San Francisco in 1969 .
He had grown up in Milwaukee and was attending the University of Wisconsin at Madison when he took a summer trip to California .
A young woman approached him and made him a pitch , telling him that she had something he ’d like to see .
“ You ’re 18 .
You think you ’re going to get lucky , ” Wollersheim says in a telephone interview from an undisclosed location .
Today he ’s 51 , and he spends much of his time in Nevada and Utah .
But the telephone number he provided New Times suggested that he was in Colorado this day .
He claims that even after collecting his award , and more than 23 years after leaving the Church of Scientology , he still must be careful about his personal security by staying on the move .
[ Six years later , he ’s still cagey .
I spoke to him on the phone the other day — he was in Nevada . ]
That day in 1969 , Wollersheim followed the young woman to an office and she handed him over to other Scientologists , who asked him to take a “ personality test . ”
It seemed innocent enough , but later he ended up convincing many others to do the same thing .
“ No matter how you answer the test , ” he says , “ they tell you you ’re screwed up and that they can fix you . ”
He was soon hooked .
“ I decided to quit school , make a bunch of money , and pay them to get all these secret levels of ability . ”
New recruits are told that advancement in the religion can bring them all sorts of benefits — high level members are said to experience raised IQs , clairvoyance , an immunity to disease , and are able to leave their bodies .
Scientologists believe they can attain these abilities through a process called “ auditing , ” which enables them to remove “ engrams ” from their “ reactive mind , ” something akin to talking away the scars left over from life ’s traumas .
When all of those scars are removed , a Scientologist is said to be a “ clear , ” and can attain amazing powers .
Like other low - level Scientologists , Wollersheim was kept in the dark about much of Scientology ’s true core beliefs .
Only through attaining far more experience and going through increasingly expensive auditing could he hope to “ go clear . ”
He found himself making good money , however , and he gave nearly all of it to Scientology , which attracted the attention of a recruiter for the Sea Organization , an elite order of followers that originated on a ship with Hubbard in the 1960s .
Wollersheim was convinced to join the Sea Org , and he signed its standard billion - year contract , agreeing to come back , lifetime after lifetime , to serve Hubbard and Scientology .
He was told to sell his candle business and come to Los Angeles where he would be more useful .
Wollersheim continued to excel , and was eventually made a supervisor at the “ Celebrity Centre ” on 6th Street .
( Today the Centre inhabits a historic building on Franklin Street . )
Put in charge of 15 employees , Wollersheim found himself responsible for attracting new celebrities to the religion .
“ They have a belief that if they control Hollywood , they will be able to create a mass recruiting phenomena , ” he says .
Finding new celebrity recruits was a serious endeavor , and required lots of planning and research , sometimes with the use of private investigators .
“ We ’d develop a battle plan and rehearse drills of how we were going to surprise the celebrity , ” he says , often making use of actors they had already attracted to the religion .
“ If we needed them for bait for another celebrity , we ’d go with them to an event .
Karen Black , for example , would bring over someone to us , and we ’d already have rehearsed a pitch for that person . ”
Actors on the declining side of their careers made easier targets , Wollersheim says .
“ We ’d invite them to a very controlled event without the public present .
Movie premieres were our best bets . ”
Still , with all of their preparations , they failed nearly all of the time .
“ Even at that time , the mid 1970s , the word was out that Scientology was weird . ”
Wollersheim remembers his staff targeting Richard Kiel , the tall actor who played “ Jaws ” in the James Bond movies .
“ They worked on that guy 50 different ways .
I worked on him myself , trying to get him in .
Kiel suffered chronic pain , and he was promised that Scientology could make it go away .
We worked on him and worked on him , but he gave it up .
We had him in the communication course … but we never got the big win . ”
As a Sea Org member working at the Celebrity Center , Wollersheim was paid $ 18 for a six day work week , and was supplied food and meager lodgings , and all the while paid for his own auditing , which was becoming more and more expensive .
But if the organization ’s “ stats ” were down — if the numbers of new recruits or money taken in for auditing or other criteria that were measured weekly had dipped — then a Sea Org member ’s food and pay was cut , Wollersheim says .
“ You found a way to get them their cash .
You did n’t give a damn , after a while , what you told other people — or the bank — to get your money to the org .
It was a continual crisis .
And it was a calculated thing .
It was Orwellian .
You had to have a constant crisis to keep people in fear .
If it was n’t that the money was down , then it was that the inspectors were coming .
It was like living in a gulag in a free country , and the bars existed in your own head . ”
Wollersheim says the threat of retaliation kept him from bailing out .
It was known among Scientologists that defectors were hit with large bills for services they had received at discounted prices — called “ freeloader debt ” — and could also find themselves the target of aggressive private investigations and legal action , a policy Hubbard had called “ fair game . ”
Wollersheim feared leaving the religion more than he did staying in .
“ As you ’re going through it , you ’re told this is the secret of the universe .
You hear legends about results that other people are getting .
Many people are telling you about their euphorias .
After hundreds and hundreds of hours of training , you have no questioning , critical mind left at that point .
There ’s no concept in your mind that it could n’t be true .
You are so far gone by that point . ”
[
And that ’s when Wollersheim learned the secrets of OT III .
Hubbard claimed that he had nearly paid with his life learning the revelations of OT III , the third level of materials that Scientologists must master after going clear and becoming an “ operating thetan , ” or OT .
The information in OT III was so explosive , Hubbard said , he believed its secrets must have been designed to kill anyone who discovered it .
The danger those secrets posed to the uninitiated was one of the ways Scientologists justified not telling newer members about them .
( Today they are available on the Internet for perusal , if you know where to look .
This reporter suffered no ill effects from reading them . )
Former members say that today the typical Scientologist must spend several years and about $ 100,000 in auditing before they find out on OT III that they are filled with alien souls that must be removed by further , even more expensive auditing .
“ OT III totally shatters the core sense of identity .
The central concept of mind control is attacking the core personality , the threat that you are not who you think you are .
At OT III , you find out that you ’re really thousands of individual beings struggling for control of your body .
Aliens left over from space wars that are giving you cancer or making you crazy or making you impotent .
The reason for every bad thing in your life is these alien beings , ” Wollersheim says .
“ I went psychotic on OT III .
I lost a sense of who I was . ”
Years can be spent removing these aliens — called “ body thetans ” or “ BT ’s ” — by talking to and about these supposed hitchhiking entities while holding onto a device called an “ e- meter . ”
“ You ’re talking to thousands of beings .
They have histories .
And anger .
They ’re complex personalities .
I started drinking heavily to drown out the voices .
I was non-functional , irrational , filthy .
I wandered the streets of L.A. for three days .
Finally I came enough to my senses to get in touch with Scientologists I knew . ”
He was cleaned up and calmed down , but Wollersheim was told that the solution to his troubles was just more auditing .
He now sold art to businesses , and employed 132 people in seven different cities .
Nearly all of his employees were Scientologists , and so were nearly all of his clients .
Wollersheim says he paid $ 28,000 for classes in Clearwater , Florida that were supposed to help him locate alien beings that had been a part of him during past lives .
“ It induced another psychotic episode .
I went so raving nuts , I tore down a fence at the center .
I thought I was an alien warlord who could n’t be stopped .
After about a day and a half , they came and got me . ”
Eventually , however , Wollersheim graduated to a level where he believed he had finally eradicated all of the thetans from his body .
“ You think you ’ve made it .
You ’re free of all these beings .
But then Hubbard releases the second big secret [ on a level called “ New Era Dianetics for Operation Thetans , ” also called “ NED for OTs ” or “ NOTs . ” ]
He tells you there are far more of these beings than anyone ever dreamed of .
Inside those original thetans are clusters of other beings .
Beings that are eight feet from you , floating near you all the time .
Beings miles away from you that are still connected with you .
Beings in the television , and you ’re told that watching television will wake them up , so you ’re told not to watch TV .
If OT III made some people nuts , NOTs really drove them over the edge , ” he says .
While auditing NOTs , Wollersheim had his third psychotic break .
Back in Los Angeles , he remembers lying in a dark room with a .45 revolver , thinking about killing himself .
A friend discovered him and took him to a Scientology center for more auditing .
Once again , he went back to Clearwater .
But when his friend saw that it was n’t helping him , she told him to get away .
“ Those were the magic words , ” he says .
He decided to leave .
Word traveled quickly , however , that Wollersheim was going to leave Scientology after 11 years .
At a restaurant in Clearwater , he says , he was approached by a member of the Guardian ’s Office , Scientology ’s intelligence bureau .
“ He looked at me and said , ‘ Do n’t you ever tell a doctor , lawyer or priest anything that ever happened to you in Scientology . ’ ”
The organization then declared Wollersheim a “ suppressive person ” ( or “ SP ” ) — in other words , an enemy of Scientology — and commanded other Scientologists to “ disconnect ” from him , he says .
His customers stopped paying bills , and 80 percent of his employees quit their jobs within three days .
Weeks later , his business had collapsed , leaving him with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debts and no way to pay them .
For several months , Wollersheim went into hiding , worried that harm would come to him .
“ You ’re told in Scientology that if you reveal their secrets , bad things will happen to you , ” he says .
His parents , however , were thrilled that he was out , and they gave him some money to live on .
“ At some point in that six months I realized that something bad had happened to me , and I needed someone else ’s perspective . ”
He returned to Los Angeles , looking for others who had left Scientology .
On a hunch , he went to the downtown superior court and asked to see the names of people who were suing Scientology .
“ I was shocked to find a whole list of people , ” he says .
Some he recognized .
He decided to call the attorney handling their cases .
“ The church ’s conduct was manifestly outrageous , ” the California court of appeals wrote a decade later , in 1989 , after Wollersheim ’s trial had resulted in a $ 30 million award .
( Despite its affirmation of the lower court ’s ruling , however , the appeals court lowered the award to $ 2.5 million , citing Scientology ’s supposed meager financial state . )
Scientology claimed that its practices were protected by freedoms guaranteed in the First Amendment , but the court rejected that argument by pointing out that Wollersheim had been coerced to remain a Scientologist through the threat of freeloader debt , the use of “ fair game , ” and the use of confidential information in his files .
The opinion by the appellate court remains one of the most damning in a long history of court denouncements of Scientology which have occurred worldwide .
“ The Wollersheim case is among the most important decisions against Scientology in its history because it showed that the organization ’s standard practices used against a member were harmful , ” says Stephen Kent , a sociologist of religion at the University of Alberta who is one of the few academics who studies Scientology in depth .
Frank Oliver , a former Scientologist who once gathered information on perceived enemies as part of Scientology ’s current intelligence wing , the Office of Special Affairs , explains why the decision was so repugnant to the organization , and why paying even a cent of it would be considered by Scientologists a horrendous defeat : “ Scientology ’s entire premise is that the Hubbard technology is infallible , ” he says .
“ The underlying concept of the Wollersheim judgment is that the Hubbard tech is harmful .
If they pay , they validate the argument that the tech is toxic . ”
And for that reason , Oliver and other former Scientologists say , Scientology was willing to spend vast amounts of money in legal costs to avoid paying Wollersheim .
Even before the trial had started , Scientology had begun a long campaign of separate lawsuits , court motions and other tactics meant to derail the case .
In 1985 , Scientologists filed a separate lawsuit based on federal anti-racketeering laws ( a RICO action ) in U.S. district court against Wollersheim , his attorneys , and his expert witnesses .
The suit claimed that , in essence , Wollersheim ’s attempts to wrestle documents out of Scientology for his trial was akin to a criminal enterprise .
The federal court threw out the lawsuit ( dubbed Wollersheim 2 ) , calling it frivolous and “ bordering on malicious . ”
While that suit was pending , Scientology filed another RICO action , claiming that the entire L.A. superior court was prejudiced against it .
In an unprecedented move , the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals not only denied the appeal when this lawsuit , Wollersheim 3 , was rejected , but even had it stricken from the court ’s record .
Meanwhile , the particular entity Wollersheim had sued , the Church of Scientology of California ( CSC ) , was mysteriously shrinking .
In 1985 , the year before Wollersheim ’s trial , in a suit brought by another disgruntled former member in Oregon , an official for CSC claimed that it had assets of more than $ 350 million .
But during Wollersheim ’s proceedings just twelve months later , CSC officials testified that it was worth only $ 13 million .
( And one of Wollersheim ’s attorney ’s , Dan Stein , used CSC ’s own documents to show that even this amount was ephemeral .
By the time Wollersheim won his verdict , CSC was essentially broke . )
Wollersheim and his attorneys suspected where the money had gone .
In 1981 , a year after Wollersheim had originally filed his lawsuit , Scientology had gone through a major , and very complex , reorganization .
CSC had been splintered into many separate entities , including a new “ mother church , ” the Church of Scientology International ( CSI ) , and something called the Religious Technology Center ( RTC ) , a sort of ecclesiastical clearinghouse which held all of the copyrights and trademarks of Hubbard ’s religious writings and was charged with making sure other Scientology entities kept Hubbard ’s “ tech ” pure .
It was RTC and CSI that had brought the Wollersheim 2 and Wollersheim 3 actions , the frivolous lawsuits that had been aimed at derailing Wollersheim ’s original suit against CSC .
[
Wollersheim has long argued that to avoid paying him , Scientology effected its highly complex reorganization , gutted CSC , and moved its assets to other entities such as RTC and CSI , which in turn used their financial muscle to go after Wollersheim in other actions .
And in 1997 , he got proof that his theory was correct .
The supposedly dormant CSC had filed yet another lawsuit against Wollersheim ( eventually dubbed Wollersheim 4 ) , but after Wollersheim successfully defeated it with a “ SLAPP ” motion — a California legal strategy that defendants can use to have frivolous lawsuits thrown out of court and be awarded attorney ’s fees — CSI admitted that it , not CSC , was really behind the action and paid Wollersheim ’s lawyers nearly $ 500,000 .
“ My client believes that it does n’t have a leg to stand on in terms of we are responsible for this amount of money owed and we are going to pay it , ” CSI ’s attorney Samuel Abelson said in court , an admission that the new organization , CSI , was really behind a lawsuit filed by the old one , CSC .
Wollersheim ’s attorneys explain that it was nice to get the attorney ’s fees they had coming in the SLAPP action .
But more importantly , they say , the victory provided a blueprint for how Wollersheim should seek his original court judgment .
They spent the next five years — until this past May [ 2002 ] — trying to prove that the alphabet soup of CSI , RTC , and CSC was a sham , and that Scientology , under whatever name , should have to pay the $ 2.5 million plus interest that Wollersheim had won in his 1986 trial with CSC .
They gathered evidence to show that despite the confusing profusion of names and acronyms , Scientology was really a single enterprise , and its actions and litigation were directed by one man , Hubbard ’s successor David Miscavige .
Former high - ranking officials declared that they had witnessed Miscavige — who supposedly had no position or standing at the time with CSC , the corporation being sued — directing the litigation against Wollersheim and ordering the destruction of key evidence in the case .
Special intelligence operations , they declared , were formed to target not only Wollersheim and his attorneys but even the judge , witnesses , and their family and friends .
When the jury awarded Wollersheim $ 30 million , one former official testified , Miscavige vowed that it would never be paid , even if it cost more than $ 30 million to avoid it .
CSC , meanwhile , was purposely ransacked of all assets to make sure that Wollersheim could n’t reach it , two former officers declared .
One of the most damning accounts came from one of Scientology ’s own attorneys , a man named Joseph Yanny , who was hired in 1984 and left in disgust three years later .
In his court declaration , Yanny testified that the lead Scientology attorney in the Wollersheim case , Earle Cooley , had “ personally ordered the destruction of evidence relating to Cult litigation in my presence . ”
Yanny also witnessed the gathering of information from parishioners ’ confidential files for use by the legal team .
He was told that using such confidential files to prepare for court was standard practice .
And Yanny also was present when a blackmail campaign was planned against Wollersheim ’s original attorney , Charles O’Reilly .
“ The medical records of O’Reilly were to be stolen from the ‘ Betty Ford Center ’ and another location in Santa Barbara , to show that he was using cocaine , discredit him , and possibly blackmail him into easing off on his 30 million dollar verdict now on appeal .
I objected to this as illegal and an alternative plan was quickly arrived at to ‘ settle my nerves . ’ ”
These declarations and other documents , Wollersheim ’s attorney say , painted a clear picture : the jumble of organizations — CSC , RTC , CSI and many , many others — meant little when it came to defending Scientology against claims that its technology was harmful .
Miscavige , they claimed , was in firm control , which ignored corporate and legal niceties .
“ If it had been shown in court that the 350 organizations of the church of Scientology were all controlled by David Miscavige , it does n’t look like a legitimate religion but the authoritative cult that it is .
It would have been terrible public relations , and they still would have had to pay the money .
And that ’s why they paid the money when they did , to avoid the bad PR , ” says longtime Wollersheim attorney Ford Greene .
But Dan Leipold , another Wollersheim lawyer , says that Scientology had even more to worry about than bad PR from the documents and testimony they had gathered .
“ I think all of the evidence could have threatened the church of scientology ’s tax exempt status , ” he says .
Hubbard organized Scientology as a religion in 1954 .
But in 1967 , it was stripped of its tax exempt status by the IRS .
For the next 25 years , the U.S. government repeatedly turned down Scientology ’s appeals to regain its exemption on the grounds that Scientology was not so much a religion as a money - making venture benefiting one man , Hubbard .
Scientology retaliated in an extraordinary way .
With Hubbard ’s knowledge and direction , agents of his intelligence unit , the Guardian ’s Office , began infiltrating IRS and other government offices in the mid 1970s .
Dubbed Operation Snow White by Hubbard , the illegal operation netted stolen government documents by the yard , and went undiscovered until a 1977 raid of Scientology offices by the FBI .
Eleven Scientologists , including Hubbard ’s wife Mary Sue , were sentenced to prison .
Hubbard himself was named an unindicted co-conspirator .
Scientology subsequently disbanded the Guardian ’s Office , claiming that it was a rogue outfit .
But its war with the IRS did not stop .
Even after Hubbard ’s death in 1986 , the IRS continued to deny the organization tax - exempt status , and Scientology fought back by siccing personal investigators on individual IRS employees and filing more than 2,000 separate lawsuits against the agency .
Despite the harassment , however , the IRS continued to win victories against Scientology in court .
In 1992 , A United States Claims Court upheld the IRS denial , citing “ the commercial character of much of Scientology ” and its “ scripturally based hostility to taxation . ”
Tax exempt organizations , the claims court wrote , “ simply do not exhibit the financial complexity or the phenomenal preoccupation with money displayed by Scientology ’s management churches and organizers . ”
By then , however , the IRS had already , secretly , caved .
In 1991 , under the first George Bush presidency , the IRS had reversed itself and began a process that was n’t made public until 1993 , under the Clinton administration , when the IRS revealed that it was giving nearly every Scientology entity the tax exempt status it coveted .
It was a stunning turnaround and one that , [ more than ] a decade later , still has tax experts shaking their heads .
Former IRS exempt organizations specialist and tax journalist Paul Streckfus says that the IRS simply cracked from the pressure Scientology had been applying for so many years .
“ The IRS found that Scientology was more than they could handle , ” Streckfus says .
“ We think of the IRS as so powerful , but by 1991 , the commissioner of the time , Fred Goldberg , decided that the case was tying up the IRS .
Scientology seemed to have limitless money , so I think Goldberg decided he wanted to get rid of the case and to hell with it .
He directed his people to get the best deal that they could . ”
Miscavige , announcing the victory to his flock at a gathering in Los Angeles , bragged that in 1991 he had simply dropped by the IRS headquarters and , without an appointment , asked to speak to Goldberg .
( After this was first reported , Scientology took out a full - page ad in the New York Times denying that Miscavige had said it . )
Soon after the impromptu meeting , Goldberg established a special committee to examine the Scientology cases — a move that tax experts say all but assured that the exemptions would eventually be awarded .
In court testimony , IRS officials have admitted that during the process of granting the exemptions , they were instructed not to look into Scientology ’s business - like ventures .
The final agreement called for Scientology to pay $ 12.5 million .
“ To them , it was a pittance , ” Streckfus says .
Goldberg has refused to discuss the matter since he left the IRS .
A New York Times analysis of the affair estimated that Scientology saved tens of millions of dollars in taxes .
“ The war is OVER ! ” Miscavige said in his Los Angeles speech , and at one point referred to a “ billion dollar tax bill ” that Scientology would not have to pay .
“ It ’s a sad commentary , ” says Streckfus about the IRS cave - in .
“ You or I would have been sent up the river .
But if you have enough resources , you can beat off the IRS . ”
The IRS no longer describes Scientology as a money - making dictatorship headed by one man , but a religion which contains many separate , legally distinct entities , each with its own board of directors and corporate officers .
For tax reasons , in other words , it is important for Scientology that David Miscavige , Hubbard ’s successor , describe himself merely as the chairman of the board of one particular entity , RTC , and not , as Wollersheim labels him , the iron - fisted ruler of a vast empire mixing tax and non -tax exempt purposes .
“ They caved because we had the goods on these guys in direct contravention to their tax exempt status .
Miscavige has been running the church since 1986 , ” says Wollersheim attorney Dan Leipold .
And it was one declaration in particular , penned by a dying man , that Leipold believes scared Scientology the most .
Today , Vaughn Young lives in Ohio , and is dying of cancer .
But for 20 years , he was a Scientologist , worked directly with Miscavige , and at one time was Scientology ’s most senior public relations officer .
He was an insider who understood both how Scientology worked behind the scenes , and how it presented itself to the public .
He left in 1989 and has been a key figure in numerous court battles since then .
[ Young passed away in June , 2003 . ]
“ Vaughn gave a declaration that was unimpeachable , ” says Leipold .
“ He took 80 different internal documents , and various publications from L. Ron Hubbard and official Scientology texts .
He laid them out and showed how the entire organization operates outside the corporate lines of authority . ”
Using Scientology ’s own internal documents — many of which , penned by Hubbard and considered sacred , cannot be altered and must be followed to the letter — Young shows that Scientology has a rigid , paramilitary chain of command .
Even non-religious entities that market themselves to the public as having no obvious tie to Scientology fall under the strict rubric .
The Way to Happiness Foundation and Applied Scholastics , for example , are two organizations that market non-religious Hubbard writings to school districts and avoid mentioning a tie to Scientology .
Narconon and Criminon , meanwhile , try to convince prison officials that they are effective methods for turning inmates from drugs and crime .
“ To the non-Scientology world , ” Young writes , “ they will say they are not Scientology and try to appear secular . ”
But internal documents , he shows , are explicit that these organizations fall under the command of the Scientology ’s hierarchy .
Unique among all of Scientology ’s entities , however , is the Sea Organization , the naval - uniform wearing men and women who have all signed billion - year employment contracts .
“ Scientology ’s own documents show that the Sea Org is a tough , elite , tight - knit organization that has the authority to move into and take over any organization … regardless of corporate lines , ” Young writes .
According to its own publications , the highest ranking positions in Scientology entities can only be held by Sea Org members .
Numerous documents describe Hubbard ’s wish that his elite Sea Org members could be sent to any Scientology organization , secular or religious , and take over on the spot .
“ Sea Org Missions are used to cross corporate lines and to control all Scientology organizations and corporations , even into the private business sector , ” Young writes .
Numerous documents describe Sea Org members showing up at far - flung Scientology enterprises to take control , fire executives , and obtain payment for their work .
In 1987 , Miscavige signed a directive which reiterated the Sea Org ’s power to take control of any other Scientology entity .
But when he has been asked about the Sea Org ’s power , and about his rank today as the captain of the Sea Org , Miscavige plays down his role .
Miscavige has said that the Sea Org is just a fraternal religious order — something akin to the Jesuits in the Catholic religion — and that he is only one of several Sea Org “ captains . ”
The Sea Org has no legal or corporate status .
But Young argues that Scientology ’s own documents show that Miscavige , as captain of the Sea Org , wields ultimate power over every single Scientology entity .
In a sworn document submitted to the IRS in 1991 , Scientology provided a telling description of how rank works in the Sea Org , admitting that “ captain ” in the Sea Org is , for all but one person , an honorary rank .
Only David Miscavige himself , the document shows , holds the true earned rank of captain , and sits alone at the top of the Sea Org ’s pyramid of power .
“ David Miscavige is , by their own sworn document , at the top of the rankings and the only person holding a [ non- honorary ] rank of Captain .
And this list is , according to them , the highest ranking officers in the Sea Organization , ” Young writes .
Miscavige is wearing his naval Sea Org uniform in several photographs gracing the latest copy of International Scientology News , a publication mailed to advanced members .
Taken aboard the Freewinds , a cruise ship that houses Scientologists while they audit the highest levels of OT materials , Miscavige is seen handing out awards , plaques , and giving a speech “ of the past year ’s stellar accomplishments and breakthroughs . ”
[ The Freewinds is now sailing nowhere , after Caribbean officials discovered earlier this year that it was contaminated with asbestos and ordered it docked until it can be rehabilitated . ]
There ’s no mention in the magazine of the Wollersheim payment among the year ’s accomplishments or breakthroughs .
Despite Scientology ’s $ 8.7 million cave , however , Miscavige may still have plenty to beam about .
Wollersheim , Leipold and others may believe that Scientology paid the $ 8 million to prevent a court hearing that could jeopardize its standing with the IRS , but tax experts say that it ’s hard to believe that even the most damning evidence , as well as a definitive judge ’s ruling , would sway the IRS to reopen an investigation of an enemy it battled for so long .
“ The IRS wrongly , as I believe , entered into a closing agreement with this cult , ” says Donald C. Alexander , a former IRS commissioner .
“ I do n’t think the IRS is going to go back and unravel that closing agreement as much as it might be in the public ’s interest to do so . ”
Alexander was commissioner in the 1970s , when Hubbard ’s agents were breaking in and stealing from government offices .
His conference room was bugged and he was unnerved by 2 am phone calls on his unlisted home number .
But while he was commissioner , he says , he vowed never to give in to Scientology ’s harassing tactics .
“ One of my successors did n’t feel that way , ” he says .
“ Maybe [ Fred Goldberg ] actually believed this thing was a church .
Stranger things have happened , but I ca n’t think of any .
“ I ’m glad Scientology had to come up with almost $ 9 million .
I wish it had been $ 90 million , ” he says .
New Times made repeated requests to speak with Miscavige and other high - ranking members of Scientology to ask about the $ 8.7 million payment and why it was made .
All calls were returned by a local spokesperson , Linda Hight .
“ The Church of Scientology of California has been trying to end this for a very long time , ” Hight says .
“ They just raised the money somewhere and paid to be done with it . ”
Asked where the money came from , Hight says she does n’t know .
“ I do n’t know who put up the money .
But there are millions of Scientologists in the world , and I ’m sure some of them would have been happy to end the whole thing . ”
( Scientology often claims to have six million members worldwide , a number derided by critics , who put the membership much lower , usually less than 100,000 .
In a videotaped deposition , Scientology president Heber Jentszch admitted several years ago that the six million number does not represent current membership but the total amount of people who have ever , since the founding in 1954 , taken even a single Scientology course . )
David Chodos , attorney for the Church of Scientology International , says that the $ 8 million check did n’t come from either CSI , RTC or the old , dormant CSC .
“ I just handled the transaction .
I did n’t arrange for the funding .
Funding had been made available .
I do n’t know where it came from , really … I was n’t concerned where the money came from . ”
When Hight was asked about Young ’s analysis of Scientology structure , Miscavige ’s position , and honorary versus earned rank in the Sea Organization , she replied , “ I ca n’t fathom what the significance of what that would be . ”
Tory Christman , a former Scientologist who helped handle Scientology ’s PR , says that most parishioners , who avoid reading or watching the news , are probably unaware that the payment to Wollersheim has even been made .
The defeat has certainly not seemed to affect business .
In the most recent issue of Advance ! , the magazine of the Los Angeles headquarters , Scientologists are encouraged to begin their advanced training on the OT levels after “ going clear . ”
To entice them , the magazine contains stories by other Scientologists , identified only by initials , who have already attained advanced OT levels and have used their new abilities in what they call “ OT phenomena . ”
One man writes of two gravel trucks bearing down on his automobile in what would have been a sure collision and his possible death — until , using his OT abilities , he slowed down time and made beams come out of him to hold back the screeching trucks .
Another Scientologist took over the body of a man who was losing control of his car on the freeway , righted the car , and calmed the driver down .
Another man pacified a ghost that , unseen to others , was bothering workers in his office building .
Also in the magazine is a price list for Scientologists anxious to attain their own extraordinary OT powers .
A compact disc with some of L. Ron Hubbard ’s lectures lists for $ 1,623.75 .
The Super Mark VII Quantum E-meter retails for $ 5,280.00 .
The OT III materials , which tell the Xenu story and reveal the alien nature of the soul , is discounted at $ 7,040 .
And packages needed for high - level solo auditing ( done by oneself at home ) , vary from $ 24,222 to $ 63,888 .
[ More recently , Jason Beghe , an actor who announced in April that he had left Scientology after twelve years , revealed that he ’d paid about $ 160,000 for a single set of procedures called “ L Rundowns , ” and over his entire career gave Scientology about a million dollars . ]
Such lavish amounts for religious instruction , Scientology ’s critics say , is what allows it to spend so much fighting its foes .
Or offering to buy them .
Years ago , Wollersheim was offered $ 8 million to walk away from his judgment .
“ They hinted they would go as high as $ 12 million , ” he says .
But he refused the money .
He says he had seen too many other former members accept settlements and the confidentiality agreements that came with them .
Wollersheim is glad that he turned down those offers .
His judgment is the first Scientology has ever paid outright , attorneys familiar with Scientology litigation say .
And now , Wollersheim hopes , his victory will encourage others to leave Miscavige ’s fold and expose it for what it is .
“ I blazed the trail , ” he says .
“ Now others are going to come and turn it into a four - lane highway . ”
[ Six years later , Wollersheim is still fighting over the money Scientology finally paid .
A woman who worked as a paralegal on his case , Leta Schlosser , sued Wollersheim ( in a lawsuit named Wollersheim 6 ) for $ 5.3 million of the Scientology cash .
In a trial presided over by Judge Hess , a jury awarded her $ 313,000 , which Wollersheim says he immediately paid .
But Schlosser appealed , saying she was owed more , and is asking for yet another trial .
Exhausted , Wollersheim has retired from the day - to - day operation of factnet.org , an Internet clearinghouse for information about Scientology .
“ I have a good life in the sense that I ’m a minister .
I have satisfying work .
And I know that the work I ’ve done [ fighting Scientology ] will help others , ” he says .
As for getting his ‘ one thin dime , ’ he says : “ A lot of it has gone to lawyers , it ’s going to litigation , it ’s going to taxes .
I ’m working a 40 - hour job .
It was never about the money .
“ I never thought I ’d get paid .
It took 30 years , ” he adds .
But despite his own experience , Wollersheim encourages others who feel they ’ve been harmed by Scientology to pursue litigation : in almost all other cases , he says , Scientology settles .
“ Victims of Scientology should take advantage of it and get their lives back , ” he says .
Scientology , meanwhile , has much bigger headaches than Larry Wollersheim these days , now that Cruise ’s antics have helped bring a new level of media and Internet scrutiny .
Scientology continues , however , to maintain its tax - exempt status . ]
Presidential Airways , a division of the private military company Blackwater Worldwide , is being sued for wrongful death by the families of three soldiers killed in a plane crash in Afghanistan .
The company has asked the court to use Shari'a Islamic law to make a ruling on the lawsuit .
Why would a right - wing Christian company like Blackwater want to do that ?
If the judge agrees , it would essentially end the lawsuit over a botched flight supporting the U.S. military .
Shari 'a law does not hold a company responsible for the actions of employees performed within the course of their work .
Erik Prince , who owns Blackwater and Presidential Airways , briefly discussed the lawsuit in a meeting today with editors and reporters at The News & Observer .
Prince was asked to justify having a case involving an American company working for the U.S. government decided by Afghan law .
" Where did the crash occur ? " Prince said .
" Afghanistan . "
According to NPR , Blackwater has over $ 800 million in government contracts .

It seems that YouTube has one set of rules for The Church of Scientology and another set for Scientology 's critics .
Two weeks ago , YouTube vaporized a 10,000 - subscriber - strong channel run by well - known Scientology critic Mark Bunker .
His " Xenutv1 " deserved to die , the YouTubers said , because they had already axed an earlier account , " Xenutv , " where Bunker infringed a few copyrights .
Indeed , YouTube 's terms of service clearly say " A user whose account has been terminated is prohibited from accessing , possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts . "
But the world 's largest video sharer has n't applied this rule to the brand new channel launched by Scientology itself - and trumpeted with an official Scientology press release .
Like Bunker , Scientology had an earlier account erased after it violated site policy .
Are you listening Stephen Colbert ?
In March , as reported by The New York Post , Scientology launched a YouTube channel in an attempt to discredit members of Anonymous , a live - wire internet group intent on making life difficult for Tom Cruise and crew .
Dubbed the " Scientology Official Report on Anonymous Hate Crimes , " the channel identified individual members of the group , describing them as " terrorists . "
YouTube does n't allow videos that broadcast personal information .
And the account was soon destroyed .
In a conversation with The Post , a Church spokesperson confirmed the organization was behind the channel .
" We absolutely made the videos , " they said .
" We have researchers that have found these men .
When you get death threats and bomb threats directly going after the church , we do n't take it lightly . "
A similar statement was made by a church minister speaking to The Battle Creek Enquirer after an alleged Anonymous bomb threat .
And yet Scientology is back on YouTube .
This time , it 's paying for the account .
It 's also paying for ads on the site , looking to drive some traffic onto its new channel .
" Get the facts , " the ads say .
YouTube did not respond to requests for comment .
But Scientology did .
First , we received a phone call from a woman with an otherworldly French accent .
" This is the Church , " she said .
" We may be able to answer your questions .
But first we want your email address . "
A few minutes later , we received this : " The Church of Scientology has never had YouTube cancel an account , nor made any such request . "
Which does not answer our questions .
Meanwhile , Mark Bunker is annoyed .
" I hope YouTube does the right thing , " he told us .
" It certainly looks like there 's a double standard at work .
" Scientology will say the first account was n't theirs .
But you bet the order came from the top . " ®

A 10 - year - old boy was subjected to physical abuse amounting to torture for 2.5 hours by Israeli soldiers who stormed his family ’s shop on 11 June , seeking information on the location of a handgun .
The boy was repeatedly beaten , slapped and punched in the head and stomach , forced to hold a stress position for half and hour , and threatened .
He was deeply shocked and lost two molar teeth as a result of the assault .
On Wednesday 11 June 2008 , at around 10:30 am , 10 - year - old Ezzat , his brother Makkawi ( 7 ) and sister Lara ( 8 ) were in their father ’s shop selling animal feed and eggs in the village of Sanniriya , near the West Bank city of Qalqiliya .
The children were suddenly startled to see two Israeli soldiers storm in to the shop .
Interrogation and abuse in the shop
One soldier wearing a black T - shirt started shouting in a loud , menacing voice in Arabic , “ your father sent us to you to collect his gun . ”
A terrified Ezzat responded , “ My father does not own a gun . ”
The soldier responded by slapping Ezzat hard across the right cheek and his brother Makawi across his face .
The soldier then ordered Makkawi and Lara to leave the shop .
Once the younger children had left the soldier demanded once again that Ezzat hand over his father ’s gun .
Although Ezzat repeated that his father did not own a gun the soldier ordered him to search for it in the sacks containing the animal feed .
Ezzat kept insisting that there was no gun in the shop so the soldier slapped him once again , this time across his left cheek .
One of Ezzat ’s friends , realizing that something was wrong , tried to enter the shop but was kicked by the soldier standing at the door and prevented from entering .
Soon a group of local people had gathered outside the shop .
Some of the people in the group also tried to enter the shop but were prevented from doing so by the soldier at the door .
The soldier in the black T - shirt asked him once again to produce the gun .
Ezzat answered , “ We do not have anything . ”
The soldier responded by punching him hard in the stomach causing Ezzat to fall over onto empty egg boxes .
Ezzat started screaming and crying out from pain and fear .
The soldier in the black T - shirt started making fun of Ezzat and imitated him crying .
Ezzat remained in the shop alone with the soldiers for a further 15 minutes when the soldier in black abruptly grabbed him by his T - shirt and dragged him out of the shop .
Ezzat asked the soldier if he could lock up his father ’s shop but the soldier said he wanted it to remain open so that it could be robbed .
The soldier also threatened to put Ezzat in his jeep and take him away .
Once they were out of the shop , Ezzat was ordered to walk in front of the soldiers to his house , whilst a gun was pointed at his back .
The soldiers hit him several times on the nape along the way .
On approaching his house Ezzat saw many Israeli military officials surrounding the house and a number of green military vehicles parked outside .
One of the olive - colored jeeps had the word “ police ” written on it .
Interrogation and abuse in the home
After arriving at the family ’s home the soldier in the black T - shirt stood Ezzat in the yard and ordered him to search the flower basin for the gun .
Before Ezzat had a chance to respond the soldier slapped him so violently that Ezzat fell down face first into the basin .
Without giving him the chance to stand up the soldier grabbed him by his T - shirt and lifted him up roughly .
He was then instructed in Arabic by another soldier to head to the guest room .
On approaching the guest room Ezzat could see his father standing by the door .
The soldier slapped him on the neck and Ezzat fell to the ground .
As Ezzat stood up the soldier slapped him a second time making him fall to the ground once again .
All this happened in front of his father .
He then grabbed Ezzat by his T - shirt and lifted him in to the air .
The soldier told Ezzat ’s father that he was going to take his son to prison .
He also threatened to take Ezzat ’s 19 - year - old sister to prison .
Ezzat was then pushed forcibly in to the guest room where his mother and four of his other siblings , including his sisters Diana ( 19 ) , Raghda ( 18 ) , ( Aya ) 15 and brother Jihad ( 3 ) , were being held .
His mother was crying .
Ezzat was also crying and when asked by his mother why he was crying , he said it was because he had been hit by the soldiers .
His mother asked the soldiers to stop beating her son and to beat her instead .
After several minutes Ezzat was taken out of the guest room and slapped several times by the soldier in black , once so hard that he fell to the ground .
After being moved to several locations in the house Ezzat was told to stay in the boys ’ bedroom .
The same soldier then left the room but would return every five minutes to slap Ezzat and also to punch him several times in the stomach .
Each time this took place Ezzat would shout and scream out in pain and burst in to tears .
The soldier would then imitate him and make fun of him .
The soldier hit him around six times .
Destruction of property and use of stress positions
A short time later , five soldiers entered the room and proceeded to destroy the family ’s property using hammers .
In all , the soldiers destroyed wooden ventilation panels in the attic , a small refrigerator in the bedroom and it contents , damage to the kitchen , a fan and the fireplace .
Ezzat spent one hour in the bedroom alone with the soldiers .
In that hour he was ordered by the same soldier to stand on one foot for half an hour , with his back against the wall and with both his hands lifted up in the air .
Ezzat was exhausted by this but was too scared to put his foot down on the ground .
Eventually he was told by one of the other soldiers that he could put his foot down .
He was then asked to sit down in a squat position .
He managed to remain in this position for two minutes and then had to stand up .
A female soldier then walked in to the room and asked him to sit on the refrigerator box .
Shortly after the soldier in the black T - shirt returned accompanied by Ezzat ’s older sister Diana .
He proceeded to ask Ezzat whether he cared for his sister to which Ezzat responded , “ Yes I do . ”
The soldier then asked him to tell him where the gun was hidden and that if he told him where it was hidden that he would not tell Ezzat ’s father .
The soldier left the room with Ezzat ’s sister .
He then returned to the room on his own and hit Ezzat all over his body .
He left the room once again and after a while came back offering Ezzat 10 Shekels in return for telling him where the gun was .
Ezzat responded that he did not care about money .
This made the soldier extremely angry and he took off his helmet and started throwing it at Ezzat from two meters away .
Ezzat was in extreme pain .
The soldier continued to hit him with the helmet and then left the room once again returning to slap him across his face and on his stomach .
This continued for some time with the soldier leaving the room and returning to hit Ezzat and to question him over the gun .
Interrogation of family
Ezzat then witnessed the soldier in the black T - shirt and the female soldier leading his sisters and mother to one of the rooms close to the boys ’ bedroom .
They closed the door of the room but Ezzat could hear the soldiers shouting at them .
He overheard the soldier telling the female soldier to hit his mother because she was refusing to take her clothes off to be searched .
After the incident was over Ezzat ’s sister informed him that they were all strip searched by the female soldier , while the male soldier waited outside .
Meanwhile , a soldier wearing black sunglasses entered the bedroom in which Ezzat was being held .
He walked in pointing a rifle , a few centimeters away from Ezzat ’s head .
Ezzat was so terrified that he began to shiver .
The soldier laughed and made fun of him .
He asked Ezzat to tell him where the gun was and threatened to shoot him if he did n’t .
Ezzat continued to maintain that there was no weapon hidden away .
The soldier , getting agitated shouted at Ezzat , “ for the last time , tell me where the gun is before I shoot you . ”
Ezzat repeated that he did not have a gun .
Hearing this , the soldier lowered his rifle and left the room .
After about five minutes the soldier in the black T - shirt entered the room along with four other soldiers and said that they were leaving but would return .
The soldiers spent two and one half hours in the house in total .
After the incident Ezzat spent the night at his uncle ’s house because he was too scared to sleep in his home .
As a result of the physical assault Ezzat lost two of his molar teeth and is deeply shocked by the incident .
DCI / PS statement
DCI / PS is appalled that Israeli authorities would subject a 10 - year - old child to beatings , position abuse and threats over the course of several hours .
The treatment of Ezzat falls within the definition of torture and other acts of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as defined in the UN Convention Against Torture , to which Israel is a State Party .
The treatment of Ezzat also infringes numerous other international conventions to which Israel is bound , as well as Israeli military and domestic law .
DCI / PS again calls on Israel to immediately ensure its compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture and to thoroughly and impartially investigate the allegations of torture and abuse of Ezzat and bring those found responsible for such abuse to justice .
DCI / PS also calls on the EU to make the upgrade of EU - Israel bilateral relations conditional upon measurable and confirmed progress by Israel to uphold the EU human rights standards in the Occupied Palestinian Territory .

Parasitic Bankers Achieve the End of Capitalism and the Sacking of America
Communism was a public relations gift to the bankers .
By diverting the dialogue to “ controlled versus free markets ” it obscured the bankers ' real intent — to insert debt into every aspect of free markets .
The bankers ' overwhelming success however would destroy both the bankers and the free markets on which they preyed .
Parasitoidism is the relationship between a host and parasite where the host is ultimately killed by the parasite .
This is what is happening to the US .
Once the most powerful and productive economy in the world , the US , indebted by bankers and government spending beyond its ability to repay , is headed towards sovereign bankruptcy .
The recent request by US Treasury Secretary — and more importantly former Chairman and CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs — Henry Paulson to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac with US taxpayer dollars is but another indication of this destructive and parasitic relationship between bankers , government and the economy .
That a private banker from a large Wall Street investment bank is also Secretary of the US Treasury is no coincidence .
It is also no coincidence that once again , public monies from the US Treasury are being used to rescue private bankers and to indemnify their losses .
THE FOX IS IN THE HENHOUSE
GOLDMAN'S SACHING OF AMERICA
Receiving taxpayer dollars from the US Treasury for their private benefit is not new to Goldman Sachs .
In 1990s , when the Mexican government defaulted on its bonds , investors at Goldman Sachs ' stood to lose billions of dollars .
They did n't .
Buried deep in the subsequent $ 40 billion US bailout of Mexico was a $ 4 billion payment to Goldman Sachs , gratis of the US Treasury indemnifying Goldman Sachs against any losses on their investment in Mexican bonds .
The fact that current US Treasury Secretary and former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson also recently used US funds to underwrite JP Morgan Chase 's private buyout of investment bank Bear Stearns and is now proposing to do the same with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to be expected .
For investment bankers , using public money to privately profit is business as usual .
They 're ruining what has been one of the greatest economies in the world , [ Bernanke and Paulson ] are bailing out their friends on Wall Street but there are 300 million Americans that are going to have to pay for this .
Jim Rogers , Chairman of Rogers Holdings , July 14 , 2008
THE TUMESCENCE OF CREDIT
THE DETUMESENCE OF DEBT
It often happens that only in retrospect does the truth become apparent — at least to most .
Seduced by the vain hope of eternal profits , investors blindly followed Alan Greenspan 's prognostications when he was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987 ; in the beginning , it appeared that Greenspan was right .
Now , two decades later Greenspan 's errors are apparent .
A former director at investment bank JP Morgan , Greenspan clearly understood the role of credit in today 's economy .
What he did n't understand were its limitations .
Greenspan 's reputation as a maestro of the markets was built on his continual feeding of cheap credit into the US economy thereby bolstering asset prices and the profits of investors .
Greenspan 's reputation at the time was well deserved , much as BALCO the illegal steroid provider deserves credit for Barry Bond 's astonishing achievements in baseball late in his career .
Credit has the same affect on markets as does steroids on athletic performance .
That is why both are so popular .
Greenspan 's continual feeding of credit into America 's economy fueled the greatest expansion of capital markets in history .
This directly led to America 's fatal misperception of credit as the cause of its wealth .
It is now beginning to dawn on America that credit , in actuality , is the cause of its problems .
Credit is but debt in disguise and the American economy is now collapsing under the weight of that debt — the bankers ' effluence , extraordinary and compounding levels of public , private and business debt that in only decades has completely drained America of its once immense productivity and wealth .
FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC - WHO'S NEXT
US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee $ 5.2 trillion of US mortgages or nearly half of US mortgage debt .
As of March 31 st , however , the combined capital of the two insurers was only $ 81 billion , 1.6 % of the total owned or guaranteed .
With US housing prices continuing to fall , it was evident , contrary to government assurances , that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not have the requisite capital needed to meet future obligations .
The sudden decline in the value of their shares forced US authorities to come to their rescue ; but , it will not be the last time the US will be forced to act in such a manner .
The systemic distress set in motion by last August 's credit contraction is still continuing and the recent collapse of Bear Stearns and now Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are witness to that fact .
We are only one year into the contraction and although the liquidity provided by central banks has gone beyond all previous levels , financial institutions are continuing to falter and collapse .
It is possible that the FDIC , the insurer of America 's savings deposits , may be next .
The capital of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equaled 1.6 % of the sums they guaranteed .
Prior to last week , the FDIC had only 1.2 % of the funds necessary to cover the accounts they insure .
It is now estimated the bank failure of IndyMac last week cost the FDIC 10 % of its capital , leaving the FDIC with even less than its previous 1.2 % to cover additional bank defaults .
As it is , $ 1 billion approximately 5 % of IndyMac 's deposits were not covered by the FDIC and it is estimated 37 % or $ 7.07 trillion of US deposits are also similarly exposed to bank failures .
As financial institutions continue to fail , bank failures will increase .
As usual , government regulators at the FDIC maintain there is no problem .
Believe them and you might soon have problems of you own .
PARASITE HOST COLLAPSE
When central banking was introduced in England in 1694 and in the US in 1913 , it could not have been foreseen that the spread of credit based money would lead to such levels of indebtedness that systemic collapse would be a possibility , let alone occur .
Only time would make that fact apparent and it now appears that sufficient time has passed .
The economist Hyman Minsky described the three sequential steps of debt in capital markets in his Financial Instability Hypothesis .
Three distinct income - debt relations for economic units , which are labeled as hedge , speculative , and Ponzi finance , can be identified .
Hedge financing units are those which can fulfill all of their contractual payment obligations by their cash flows : the greater the weight of equity financing in the liability structure , the greater the likelihood that the unit is a hedge financing unit .
Speculative finance units are units that can meet their payment commitments on ‘ income account ' on their liabilities , even as they cannot repay the principal out of income cash flows .
Such units need to ‘ roll over ' their liabilities – issue new debt to meet commitments on maturing debt .
For Ponzi units , the cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fill either the repayment of principal or the interest on outstanding debts by their cash flows from operations .
Such units can sell assets or borrow .
Borrowing to pay interest or selling assets to pay interest ( and even dividends ) on common stocks lowers the equity of a unit , even as it increases liabilities and the prior commitment of future incomes .
It can be shown that if hedge financing dominates , then the economy may well be an equilibrium - seeking and containing system .
In contrast , the greater the weight of speculative and Ponzi finance , the greater the likelihood that the economy is a deviation - amplifying system .
The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy has financing regimes under which it is stable , and financing regimes in which it is unstable .
The second theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that over periods of prolonged prosperity , the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system .
In particular , over a protracted period of good times , capitalist economies tend to move to a financial structure in which there is a large weight to units engaged in speculative and Ponzi finance .
Furthermore , if an economy is in an inflationary state , and the authorities attempt to exorcise inflation by monetary constraint , then speculative units will become Ponzi units and the net worth of previously Ponzi units will quickly evaporate .
Consequently , units with cash flow shortfalls will be forced to try to make positions by selling out positions .
This is likely to lead to a collapse of asset values .
As the US is now increasingly meeting its debt obligations by rolling over present debt and / or by borrowing , it is now according to Minsky 's model , clearly in the Ponzi finance mode which can precede a collapse of asset values .
According to Minsky , capital markets over time become increasingly unstable .
Asset values in real estate are now collapsing , equities will be next , bonds will follow .
Almost one hundred years after the Federal Reserve introduced debt - based money to America in 1913 , both host and parasite are now approaching the same end , parcus nex , sic economic death .
Not only is the host , the US economy , in imminent danger , so too are the parasites , the banks .
Bridgewater Associates , the giant US hedge fund , has warned its clients that current bank losses may reach $ 1.6 trillion , four times previous estimates .
The implications are discussed by financial journalist Ambrose Evans - Pritchard in The Telegraph.co.uk , July 8 , 2008
Bank losses from credit crisis may run to $ 1,600bn , warns Bridgewater
By Ambrose Evans - Pritchard
Bridgewater Associates has issued an apocalyptic warning to clients that bank losses from the worldwide credit crisis may reach $ 1,600bn ( £ 800 bn ) , four times official estimates and enough to pose a grave risk to the financial system .
The giant US hedge fund said that it doubted whether lenders would be able to shoulder the full losses , disguised until now by " mark - to - model " methods of valuing structured credit .
" We are facing an avalanche of bad assets .
We have big doubts as to whether financial institutions will be able to obtain enough new capital to cover their losses .
The credit crisis is going to get worse , " said the group in a confidential report , leaked to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung .
Bank losses on this scale would have far - reaching effects .
Lenders would have to curtail loans by roughly 10 - to - one to preserve their capital ratios .
This would imply a further contraction of credit by up to $ 12,000bn worldwide unless banks could raise fresh capital .
It would be almost impossible to attract or even find such sums from investors .
While sovereign wealth funds command roughly $ 3,000bn in funds , this money is mostly committed already .
The funds have grown extremely wary of Western banks with sub - prime exposure after burning their fingers so many times already .
Bridgewater said true losses would mushroom if the banks were compelled to use " mark - to - market " , which foretells a much crueler haircut for investors in the outstanding pool of structured debt from mortgages , credit cards , car loans and such like , together worth $ 26.6bn .
The International Monetary Fund has estimated bank losses of roughly $ 400 bn .
A chunk has already been covered by fresh infusions of capital , allowing the lenders to continue lubricating the global financial system without having to squeeze credit too hard .
The great unknown is whether this is the end of the debacle .
A number of hedge funds believe the alleged losses - typically measured by the ABX index - may overstate the likely level of defaults .
They are buying the spurned securities for as little as eight cents on the dollar .
If Bridgewater is anywhere near correct , governments alone have the wherewithal to rescue the system .
This would mean the de facto nationalization of the banking systems in the US , Britain and Europe .
We are at the end of an era .
Capitalism , itself , is a misnomer .
It should instead be called creditism or referred to by its subsequent state , debtism , for capital de facto is credit , not money .
This does not mean credit is not important .
Credit is an integral part of functioning economies but its use should be constrained within gold and silver based monetary systems in order to prevent its abuse .
But in its present form where credit - based money ( fiat money ) completely replaced gold and silver based currencies ( savings - based money ) , central bank originated credit has led to today 's unsustainable levels of debt .
Trillions of dollars of that debt are now beginning to default and , as a consequence , credit is being withdrawn by banks , the intermediaries of credit in today 's system .
It will soon begin to appear that money is becoming scarce .
But that 's an illusion .
The money was never there in the first place .
It was only credit .
Real money , gold and silver currencies , were the first victims of central banking in the US .
The latest victims are those who are about to be affected by the collapse of the US and global economy .
Central banking and its spawn , credit and debt , are now everywhere and , unfortunately , so are the consequences .
GOLD SILVER & FIAT MONEY
The truth about money has been pushed out of public discussion by the powerful forces closest to the spigots of credit and the trough of government largesse .
Now , because the edifice of paper money is crumbling , the truth about money and gold and silver is finally being discussed — at least on the internet .
Gold and silver are money is because gold and silver have intrinsic value and function as storehouses of value as well as mediums of exchange .
Fiat money , paper money , has no intrinsic value .
What fiat money does possess is the ability to masquerade as money .
This ability , however , is temporary for governments and bankers cannot resist the considerable temptation that paper money presents to them — for governments , to spend what they do not have and for bankers , to extend credit and debt beyond the limits gold and silver would otherwise present .
Money is a most interesting topic and because of its current abuse , we are only now once again beginning to understand the monetary roles of gold and silver .
Recently , at Session IV of Gold Standard University Live , in Hungary , I was fortunate to hear Professor Antal Fekete expound on the historic role of gold in monetary systems .
It is self - evident that gold and silver possess monetary qualities that fiat monies do not .
What are less well - known are the virtues that such metals bring to economies that understand their correct usage and role .
It is a world quite unlike ours , a world where producers and savers , not speculators , are protected and rewarded , where the value of bonds are constant , where interest rates are stable because of market forces , not subject to the whims of politicians and bankers .
Such were the considerable thoughts and insights Professor Fekete provided on these critical matters .
On our return from Hungary , Martha and I again stopped at the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street in London , the fountainhead of central bank credit - based money .
Over the Christmas holidays , I had worn my bespoke pin-striped suit made of fine English gabardine complete with vest and gold chain when I had my photo taken .
This time , however , due to the accelerating decline in the fortunes of central bankers everywhere , I decided a more casual attire would be more appropriate .
Regarding fiat money , I cannot more highly recommend Ralph T. Foster 's Fiat Paper Money — The History And Evolution of our Currency , a well researched and fascinating account of fiat currencies throughout history .
Once read , you will never again believe that governments and bankers can resist the temptation to gain by the debasement of currencies .
Our present circumstances are a case in point .

About Darryl Robert Schoon
In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .
During its first two months , www.survivethecrisis.com was accessed by over 10,000 viewers from 93 countries .
Clearly , we had struck a chord and www.drschoon.com , has been created to address this interest .

23 Jul 08 , 19:54 American Mixed Market Economy
Capitalism ?
Has there been some * capitalism * going on around here ?
If so , I completely missed it .
What America has is a mixed economy that is largely socialist .
The goverment bails out these large companies on the premise that they are preventing harm to the proletariat who would otherwise lose their savings , homes , or whatever .
This post is a bit of a departure from my recent norm .
It contains no category theory whatsoever .
None .
I promise .
Now that I 've bored away the math folks , I 'll point out that this also is n't a guide to better horticulture .
Great , there goes the rest of you .
Instead , I want to talk about Bloom filters , Bloom joins for distributed databases and some novel extensions to them that let you trade in resources that we have in abundance for ones that are scarce , which I 've been using for the last few months and which I have never before seen before in print .
Primarily because I guess they have little to do with the strengths of Bloom filters .
For practical purposes you will need to use a counted or spectral Bloom filter for the purposes of the structure mentioned below .
However , as these introduce nothing novel , and simply muddle the exposition , I 'll ignore counting and spectral Blooms for now .
Bloom Filters
Ok , so what is a Bloom filter ?
Bloom filters date back to 1970 .
A simple Bloom filter is a novel data structure for approximating membership in a set , yielding only false positives .
A filter consists of an m-bit array and k distinct hash functions .
To add an element to the filter you run it through each of the k hash functions and setting the appropriate bits .
A value is considered to be a member of the set if you hash it through each of the k functions and each of the target bits is set .
It is easy to see that this can only result in a false positive , but its also easy to see that you need to set the size of the array before you start adding elements to it , and that you need to balance the number of hash functions to the overall desired precision of your filter .
In general you want to have about half of the bits set in the resulting array to maximize your information density -- a fact which can be derived with elementary calculus .
From which you can figure out that you get optimal results when .
We can readily approximate k distinct hashing functions by using a single one - way hashing function and carving it up into a number of hashing functions that consist of the right number of bits each .
A simpler approach due to Kirsch and Mitzenmacher is to sacrifice the independence of the hash functions without particularly adversely affecting the properties of the filter .
The nice thing about a Bloom filter is that the parameters m and k can be varied to tune space requirements and precision .
Improving Locality
One common way to improve the locality of reference for excessively large Bloom filters is to break up the structure into two tiers .
You have an upper tier in which you use a single hash function to bin the data , then within the bin you placed the data you run the remaining k- 1 hash functions .
This can result in a ' lumpier ' distribution of data , but generally improves performance because if you exceed working memory , this model can typically page in a single page from disk to handle the k - 1 writes .
When you figure that it is common to use between several hashing functions with a bloom filter this can result in a several - fold performance improvement as the data set grows and you become IO bound .
As a result of being primarily to optimize IO you typically want to have a bin size that corresponds with your block or page size .
As an admittedly completely unintelligible aside , I am particularly fond of 8 k bins for a simple Bloom filter , because they nicely consume 16 bits of hash evenly , and 4 k bins , when used with 4 bit counting Blooms , page in and out efficiently and compress nicely with an arithmetic / exponentiated Huffman encoding into near even multiples of the ethernet packet MTU when you tune the ratio of set bits carefully , I 've found this to be beneficial for tweaking real world performance .
Bloom Joins
Given a pair of bloom filters that share a given size m and which use the same k hash functions .
You can take their intersection ( or union ) quite efficiently with bitwise and ( or or ) .
This is a well known technique for dealing with distributed database joins when you have data distributed across multiple servers joining against data distributed across other servers .
In general , you are only interested in transmitting the data that exists on both sides of the join .
( You can technically free yourself from the requirement that both sides agree on the number of hash functions if you are willing to accept more false positives and you test for membership in the result set using just the hash functions contained in both Blooms .
The easiest way to do this is to just agree on an order in which hash functions will be used , which comes for free from the Kirsch / Mitzenmacher approach mentioned above . )
The good
The nice thing about a standard Bloom join is that you can send the Bloom filter over the network quite cheaply in comparison to the data , and with the addition of counting Bloom filter tricks it can be used to calculate approximately the size of the result set .
This allows you to use it to load level MapReduce style workloads effectively by estimating the size of intermediate results quite accurately before you send everything over the network to be aggregated .
The bad
One problem with this model is that you have to know the size of your data set up front in order to calculate an ideal m for a desired precision level .
Moreover both sides of the join have to agree on this figure m before calculating the join .
Now , the main goal of a Bloom join is to conserve an scarce resource ( network bandwith ) by exchanging cheaper , more plentiful resources ( local CPU utilization , and disk IO ) .
In that respect it serves adequately , but we can do better if our goal is more or less purely to optimize network bandwidth .
Lets carry that a bit further .
Linear Hash Tables
To address the limitation that you have to know the size of the bloom a priori , we 'll turn to another data structure , the linear hash table .
Linear hash tables were designed by Witold Litwin back in 1980 to provide an expandable hash table without a huge stairstep in the cost function whenever you hit a power of two in size .
The basic idea of a linear hash table is that you grow the table gradually , by splitting one bucket at a time and using the least significant bits of your hash function .
For sake of variety , I 've included a C# 3.5 implementation here :
[ SortedLinearHashTable.cs ]
[ SinglyLinkedList.cs ]
[ PreparedEqualityComparer.cs ]
[ PreparedEqualityComparerTypeProxyAttribute.cs ]
For my regular audience , an implementation in Haskell using STM — incidentally was the first piece of Haskell I ever wrote — designed for read - mostly use can be found here :
[ haddock ]
[ darcs ]
A Linear Bloom Filter
Now , we can look at the bi-level structure we introduced above for dealing with improved cache locality and note that we could go in a different direction and treat the upper level as a linear hash table , instead of a simple hash function !
This requires that we keep not only the Bloom but also the member list ( or at least their hashes ) .
We can optimize this slightly by computing the Bloom of the member list for each page lazily .
This costs us quite a bit of storage relative to a traditional Bloom filter , but we can transmit the Bloom of the resulting set over the network more cheaply than we can transmit a linear hash table and it is n't appreciably more expensive locally than a linear hash table due to only lazily constructing the Blooms .
This mechanism gives rise to an actual tree of pages based on the unfolding of the linear hash table in the resulting hierarchical bloom if you choose to represent the interior of the tree .
Again , this is n't a win for all scenarios , but if you are intending to transmit the resulting set over the network , and do n't know its size a priori , the combination of properties from the linear hash table and the bloomed pages leads to some interesting options .
Linear Bloom Origami
Now that we have an expandable hash in our top level , we finally have the machinery to deal with how to perform a join between two linear bloom filters of different size .
The model is actually quite simple .
We can fold the larger bloom up by oring together the leaves that were split by the linear hash table in the larger bloom until we have the same number of pages and then perform a standard Bloom join .
This frees us from the tyranny of having to have both sides of the join guess in advance a shared number of buckets to use to perform the join .
As an aside , an interesting thought experiment is to go one step further and use a full - fledged sorted linear hash table for the extra cost of sorting the chains , but this does n't seem to be useful in practice .
Mipmapping Blooms
If we are willing to pay an cost in terms of the data set size cost in terms of CPU utilization and memory bandwidth we can gain some further performance in terms of network utilization through encoding a set of " mipmaps " for our filters .
Basically the idea is to fold up the tree by oring together the pages into an admissible Bloom of the dataset .
Then you encode the splitting of each bit that was set in the Bloom using conditional probabilities .
This can be transmitted near optimally using arithmetic encoding or exponentiated Huffman .
If a bit is set in the parent Bloom , then at least one of the two bits will be set in the child Blooms ; if no bit is set in the parent Bloom , then no bit can be set in the child Blooms .
The probability of each bit being set in each child is for all practical intents and purposes independent and can reasonably be modeled as a function of the expected number of set bits .
( This is ever - so - slightly suboptimal if the overall number of values is known ) .
You can determine exact values for the weights of each of the three cases using conditional probabilities and then use an arithmetic compressor , or exponentiate the alphabet for a Huffman compressor — this is otherwise near worst - case for Huffman , since you have two possibilities both just shy of 50 % and one much smaller probability .
Nicely the regular structure of the exponentiated alphabet is very regular and can be represented efficiently .
With careful choice of page size ( or bit density within a page ) you can transmit the initial page cheaply , and then pack multiple pages into subsequent packets .
Since we can determine the relevance of portions of the tree based on partial information this may allow you to avoid transmitting some branches of the tree .
More interestingly we can use it to figure out approximately the size of the join set from the first few pages transmitted and to gain gradual refinements as both sides of the join supply more information .
If you wanted to optimize strictly for network bandwidth and were willing to accept additional latency you could prune branches of the tree after it was clear that the intersection was empty and so no further resolution was required , but in my experience this optimization does n't seem to be worth the effort .
Incremental Update
Interestingly if you have already shared a Linear Bloom and need to update your copy it admits a cheap network representation using the same arithmetic / exponentiated Huffman encoding trick mentioned earlier .
You lose the ability to ignore all unset bits in the dataset because extending the set of known values will in all likelihood set new bits , but as you add members you can transmit splits using the same mechanism used above , and you have the actual member set needed to populate the child pages accurately .
Interestingly it is the ability to mipmap the intermediate results that sometimes makes it worth dealing with a suboptimal choice of density for the overall Bloom filter , because it only affects the cost on either end of the network , it does n't affect the network transmission costs all that adversely and more sparse population early in the tree can allow you to have a less oversaturated tree near the root , allowing earlier pruning of branches - I have yet to take this from an art to a science .
Conclusion
I had intended to explain things in more detail and delve into the asymptotic behavior of hierarchical and linear Blooms , but various people have been hammering me to just post this already , so here it is .
So to recap , we took a normal ( or counted or spectral ) Bloom filter , crossbred it with Litwin 's linear hash table and found that the mutant offspring is an approximation of a set that is better suited to sharing over the network than either structure alone , with a memory usage profile similar to that of a linear hash table .
Interestingly as a side effect you can go one step further and allow for transmission of a requested subset of the exact hashes present in which case we 've really only used the Blooms to provide partial information about the underlying linear hash table , which can aid in the subsequent join process .
And yes , they are probably better named something like Bloomed linear hash tables , but that does n't roll off the tongue .
If there is enough interest and I do n't get dragged into other things , I might see about packaging up and genericizing some code that I had lying around intended for production use into a more general purpose library for Linear Bloom Filters .

The Rush to cross over ...
Refuse to 'rig '
Recently , Rush Limbaugh put out a call to Republican Texas voters to cross over and vote in the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton .
His reasoning behind this was to " rig " the election so as to have the weakest candidate run against the Republican machine in the general election this fall .
The saddest part is that caller after caller to his show has called to say they 've done exactly that — voted early for Clinton in the Texas primary so as to rig the election .
The actions by Limbaugh and his listeners are simply appalling .
The Founding Fathers of Texas and America would be disgusted by this behavior and rhetoric .
Limbaugh has the right to say whatever he pleases on air , but we do not have to condone or participate in his immoral and un-American sentiments .
I , for one , will be voting the way our system intends me to — for the candidate I feel will best lead the nation 's economy , foreign policy and domestic agenda .
I encourage all Texans to do the right thing with their vote as well .

His deciding vote
Barack Obama 's fate will probably be decided today in the Texas primary by Republicans like me .
It is my intention to vote for Hillary Clinton , hoping she will win Texas and Ohio .
If this happens , she could still be the nominee for her party , and John McCain would beat her like a drum come November .
If Obama wins , McCain is probably not going to win in November , therefore we get stuck with a president who has no foreign policy experience and very little experience in matters dealing with the economy .
Remember , " change " can be good or bad .

Why sacrifice races ?
Rush Limbaugh is nuts to urge Texas Republicans to vote for Hillary Clinton in the primary .
There are many critical contested races in the Republican primary .
In Harris County alone , those races are for U.S. House District 22 , the Harris County district attorney , Precinct 4 constable , county judges , courts and state representation , among others .
Does Limbaugh expect Texas Republicans to drop the ball on the Republican primary so he can throw his little snit ?
Limbaugh should stick to his Florida politics and leave Texas politics to those of us who live here .

Our fantasy election
I live in The Woodlands , population 85,000 and about 80 percent Republican .
I , along with others I know , voted early and noticed that the room was divided between Republican booths and Democratic booths .
You can choose to declare or not declare , and have your voter registration card stamped or not stamped Republican , Democrat or independent .
I chose Republican and was directed to a specific row of Republican machines .
I was the only one in that row , while the Democratic row was full .
Many of my friends voted in the Democratic primary , saying it would be more fun watching the results on TV and having the pundits try to figure it out .
Now , instead of fantasy football , we have fantasy election .
This is kind of fun .

Mortified by muskrat skinning
I would like to mention how totally disgusted , mortified and horrified I was reading the article in regards to the muskrat skinning at the 2008 Miss Outdoors beauty pageant .
( Please see " Love for muskrat skinning evident at beauty pageant / Girls hope to cast light on a talent that some say is in decline , " Page A10 , Sunday . )
To think this practice is going on and accepted in the United States was nothing short of shocking .
Are these people some kind of sick or what ?
Is this practice just as bad , if not worse , then dog fighting ?
Thank you for printing this article in the Chronicle .
Hopefully , we can begin a public outcry and put a stop to this brutal act .

A challenge to a ' dumb ' debate
I laughed at Jim Borgman 's Sunday Outlook cartoon regarding a Barack Obama speech to Texas voters so much that I would like to challenge him to a debate .
I 'll take either side on any subject and verbally reduce him to a quivering mass of protoplasm .
I will even " dumb it down " a little , so he can understand the degree of his humiliation .

Let 's be heroes in opium trade
Our troops will die in Afghanistan with our public never understanding that many of the deaths could easily be prevented if we would change our policy on heroin .
In the process we would strike a cost - free blow to the terrorists .
Repeated stories describe the huge role of opium poppies , by far the most important crop to millions of starving farmers , in economically ravaged Afghanistan .
( Please see " Thriving drug operation fuels Taliban resurgence / Bloodshed rises in an insurgency largely funded by Afghan opium , " Page A3 , Saturday . )
The illegal profits help fund independent war lords , al - Qaida and the Taliban .
They fuel the growing insurgency and threaten the glimmer of democracy there .
Our allies are already pulling their troops out of danger , and we will have to put more of ours in .
We apparently would rather kill our troops and fund terrorists than let a few registered heroin addicts get their drugs from a licensed clinic instead of from drug dealers .
The system has begun in Europe and has worked well in our own history .
Based on that record , the system would also reduce use , slash crime and keep heroin out of our schools .
The opium poppies can be bought dirt cheap by the Afghan central government .
( We would guarantee to and purchase the crop from them . )
This would make them and us heroes to the Afghan people , undercut the terrorist insurgency and save our troops .
But prepare for the bodies ; no politician has had the guts to even publicly mention the alternative .

Spectrum has what appears to be the final interview with Arthur C. Clarke , conducted in January of this year ( while Clarke was in the hospital ) .
Clarke discusses geo-stationary communications satellites , space elevators , and his thoughts on private - sector space travel .
It 's an interesting dialog with a futurist and visionary who lived to see some of his predictions come true , most notably the satellites ( space elevators are still a ways off ) .
Clarke gave few interviews in his later years , so the Spectrum interview is well worth a listen .

A Los Angeles judge sentenced two elderly women to life in prison without the possibility of parole Tuesday , saying greed was at the heart of their coldblooded , years - long scheme to murder homeless men for $ 2.8 million in life insurance money .
“ These unfortunate men were sacrificed on your altars of greed , ” L.A. County Superior Court Judge David S. Wesley told Helen Golay , 77 , and Olga Rutterschmidt , 75 , who were convicted of murder in April .
Prosecutors said the women lured the men off the street , housed and cared for them for two years , and ran them over to collect on life insurance policies the women had bought for the men .
The women were abusing a law that says insurers cannot contest life policies after two years , prosecutors said .
Wesley said criminal avarice was at the crux of the case , which made headlines internationally and was compared to Hollywood movie plots for the elaborate scheme and the twilight age of the defendants .
Advertisement
“ During this trial , Ms. Rutterschmidt , you recognized something in Ms. Golay that you had not recognized of yourself when you pointed your finger at her and said , ‘ You ’re greedy , ’ ” Wesley said , referring to a secretly videotaped conversation between the two women in which Rutterschmidt repeatedly said Golay ’s greed was the reason they had been arrested .
The video was played for jurors at trial .
Golay and Rutterschmidt , who appeared in court wearing bright orange prison garb with wrists chained to their waists , appeared defiant until the end , even as the victims ’ families gave tearful statements .
“ I want to appeal , yes , ” Rutterschmidt said after Wesley advised her of her right to appeal .
Golay ’s attorney , Roger Diamond , said his client was “ upset ” and maintained that she was innocent .
Notices of appeal have been filed on behalf of both women .
The septuagenarian women were each convicted of two counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder for financial gain .
Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty , citing the women ’s ages .
Advertisement
Probation officers for the women , in reports released Tuesday , concluded that neither woman has a conscience and that both pose a serious threat to the community .
When they met in the 1970s , Golay and Rutterschmidt found that they had a common interest in “ fleecing people , ” the report states .
Both were “ obsessed with identity frauds , ” the report found , and Rutterschmidt even had a rubber signature stamp in the name of her deceased husband .
The report suggests she used her dead husband ’s name to cash checks and vote .
Sandra Salman , Kenneth McDavid ’s sister , choked up in court as she described how devastated her family was by her brother ’s death .
“ It makes me very sad to see how low these women have sunk , where human life is equated with personal profit , ” Salman said , reading from a prepared statement .
“ These women have killed two men that we know of and their only regret is that they were caught . ”
Advertisement
Also Tuesday , Wesley denied a motion for a new trial filed by Diamond , who alleged , among other things , misconduct by Rutterschmidt ’s attorney , Deputy Public Defender Michael Sklar .
In closing arguments , Sklar blamed the murders on Golay , saying the evidence clearly showed that she was the mastermind and kept Rutterschmidt in the dark about her intention to kill the men .
Diamond also shifted his defense , laying the blame on Rutterschmidt .
In the end , the women were left accusing each other .
Paul Vados , the first victim , was found dead in 1999 in a Hollywood alley in an apparent hit - and - run .
The women collected about $ 600,000 in insurance claims .
Authorities became suspicious when the same two women claimed the body and profited from the 2005 death of McDavid , whose mangled body showed the same upper - body injuries as Vados .
The women received $ 2.2 million after McDavid ’s death and were in legal battles to collect more from insurers who refused to pay at the time of their arrest .
The men were covered by more than two dozen insurance policies .

Authorities found McDavid ’s DNA in the undercarriage of a 1999 Mercury Sable station wagon , which someone using Golay ’s Auto Club membership had towed on the night of McDavid ’s death in Westwood .
Golay , a Texas native who owns real estate in Santa Monica , and Rutterschmidt , a Hungarian immigrant who once owned a coffee shop with her husband , were arrested in 2006 .

NASA Satellite Captures Image of Cyclone Nargis Flooding in Burma
Rebecca Lindsey
The first cyclone of the 2008 season in the northern Indian Ocean was a devastating one for Burma .
According to reports from Accuweather.com , Cyclone Nargis made landfall with sustained winds of 130 mph and gusts of 150 - 160 mph , which is the equivalent of a strong Category 3 or minimal Category 4 hurricane .
News reports stated that several thousand people have been killed , and thousands more were missing as of May 5 .
Flood water can be difficult to see in photo - like satellite images , particularly when the water is muddy .
This pair of images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite use a combination of visible and infrared light to make floodwaters obvious .
Water is blue or nearly black , vegetation is bright green , bare ground is tan , and clouds are white or light blue .
On April 15 , rivers and lakes are sharply defined against a backdrop of vegetation and fallow agricultural land .
The Irrawaddy River flows south through the left - hand side of the image , splitting into numerous distributaries known as the Mouths of the Irrawaddy .
The wetlands near the shore are a deep blue green .
Cyclone Nargis came ashore across the Mouths of the Irrawaddy and followed the coastline northeast .
The entire coastal plain is flooded in the May 5 image .
The fallow agricultural areas appear to have been especially hard hit .
For example , Yangôn ( population over 4 million ) is almost completely surrounded by floods .
Several large cities ( population 100,000 – 500,000 ) are in the affected area .
Muddy runoff colors the Gulf of Martaban turquoise .
The high - resolution image provided above is at MODIS ’ maximum spatial resolution ( level of detail ) of 250 meters per pixel .

Tell Your Congressman – " Do n't Earmark Money for Lawyers .
Oppose HR 6088 . " vol·un·teer1 ( noun ) " a person who performs a service willingly and without pay "
Here 's a riddle :
When do volunteers get paid $ 55 million dollars ?
Answer :
When the " volunteers " are lawyers paid by Congress with your money .
Under the guise of combating domestic violence , House bill HR 6088 , the misleadingly - named " National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act " would funnel your tax dollars to lawyers .
It would be bad enough if the intent of this bill were merely Congressional pork for lawyers .
But the intent of this bill is to place Congress ' thumb firmly on the scales of justice to guarantee the conviction of the innocent along with the guilty .
Over and over again , researchers not bound by preconceived beliefs have concluded that domestic violence is a human problem , not a gender problem .
2,3
If the recipient of the lion 's share of the funding under HR 6088 were an organization that subscribed to honest research , the bill might have a legitimate premise .
But the $ 55 million the bill authorizes is specifically allocated to : the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence , organizations that are to be created by the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence , or organizations that are required to collaborate with the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence .
One would expect the American Bar Association to respect basic concepts of American jurisprudence , like " innocent until proven guilty " .
But the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence ( ABA - CODV ) has demonstrated nothing but disdain for that most fundamental principle of American liberty .
The overriding theme in their publication 10 Myths about Custody and Domestic Violence and How to Counter Them4 is the presumption of guilt of the accused .
The document is so larded with falsehoods that , of its 19 claims , only 2 are actually true .5,6

A spoof advertising campaign promoting an Australian invasion of New Zealand has prompted mirth and outrage on both sides of " the ditch " , as the Tasman Sea separating the two countries is known .
The idea was dreamt up by the producers of an Australian television show , The Gruen Transfer , which focuses on the advertising world .
In one segment , " The Pitch " , ad agencies compete to fulfil an impossible brief .
Last week , they were asked to devise a campaign selling a military takeover by Australia of its closest neighbour and most bitter sporting rival .
One came up with the slogan , " The New Zealand invasion .
There 's a day off in it for you " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A voiceover , accompanied by scenes of beer - swilling men , women in tight T - shirts and steaks grilling on a barbecue , bemoans the dearth of public holidays at this time of year .
" So this Saturday we 're going to war with New Zealand .
It 'll be over by lunchtime , and to celebrate , the whole country gets Monday off .
And then , every year , we can crack a beer to mark the day we smashed the Kiwis . "
Another agency came up with an advertisement based on a tourism campaign that markets the land of rugby and sheep as " 100 per cent pure New Zealand " .
Against a backdrop of rolling green hills and pristine beaches , it states , " 0 per cent Air Force , 0 per cent Navy , 0 per cent Infantry .
100 per cent there for the taking , 100 per cent too easy , 100 per cent ours " .
Fighter jets then roar over the idyllic scenery , and tanks move in .
Some observers wryly noted that a reverse invasion had already been mounted , with 500,000 New Zealanders living in Australia .
Phil Goff , the New Zealand Defence Minister , told reporters : " We created a beachhead [ on Bondi Beach ] years ago , and they have yet to recapture it . "
The New Zealand Herald invited readers to retaliate with suggestions of ways to promote a Kiwi invasion of Australia .
One blogger suggested the slogan , " Our Country Sucks , Can We Come Live With You Guys ? " .
Another proposed : " Australia .
A country of well - balanced people , because they have a chip on both shoulders . "

Late this afternoon Barack Obama picked up his 303.5 and 304.5 superdelegates as Cindy Spanyers and Blake Johnson endorsed Barack Obama .
Spanyers and Johnson stressed Obama ’s commitment to Alaska issues , “ Senator Obama is committed to Alaskans and establishing important ties to the state .
He recognizes Alaska ’s role in our future in energy and is sensitive to the challenges we face due to high - energy costs across the state , from Juneau to Fairbanks and across rural Alaska . ”
The superdelegates stressed their state ’s response to Obama ’s change message , “ Alaskans responded overwhelmingly to his campaign in February , coming out in droves in sub-zero weather .
His candidacy captured the imagination of thousands of new voters , including Republicans and non-partisans who responded to his message of change .
Senator Obama will work to end the war in Iraq ; provide affordable health care to all Americans ; and strengthen our economy by creating good paying jobs . ”
This endorsement lays out what many view as the top three priorities of a potential Obama presidency .
The easiest to accomplish will be ending the war in Iraq , but unless the Democrats come up with a larger majority in both the House and the Senate , healthcare will be the hardest priority to achieve .

There is a great deal of nervousness about the economy , and that will be relieved with a change in leadership .
If he wins Obama has quite a mess to clean up , but he seems to be more than up to the task .
Obama is now 109 delegates short of clinching the nomination .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Aliens from outer space have been visiting Britain for years and UFO sightings doubled after the film Close Encounters was released in 1977 , according to secret files collating reports by members of the public .
New Mexico's float , depicting aliens on a spaceship , takes part in the 119th annual Rose Parade in Pasadena , California January 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mark Avery
The alien craft come in all shapes , sizes and colors but their occupants are uniformly green , the Ministry of Defence files show .
The archives ( at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos) are the first batch of a four - year release programme of all the ministry ’s UFO files from 1978 to the present day .
The ministry dismisses 90 percent of the reports as having mundane explanations and leave 10 percent with a question mark and the assurance they are no defence threat .
A 1983 report from a 78 - year - old out fishing at midnight tells of following aliens in green overalls on to a spaceship and then being told to go away because he was too old and decrepit for their purposes .
Two years later , a typewritten letter to the ministry tells of an alien spaceship being shot down in the river Mersey in northern England by another spacecraft and of the author developing a warm friendship with an alien called Algar .
Just as Algar was about to reveal himself to the government he was killed by other aliens , the author of the letter writes .
He was still in telepathic contact with an alien called Malcben from the planet Platone in the Milky Way , the author added .
Written at the top of the letter is the terse comment “ No reply . ”
The ministry has files on 11,000 sightings dating back to the 1950s .
A few of the sightings made it into the national press and all were checked out in case they were Soviet aircraft probing Britain ’s defences during the Cold War .
“ Clearly some reports remain unexplained but we have found no evidence that these phenomena represent a threat to national security and therefore cannot justify devoting Defence resources to their investigation , ” said an official letter in 1985 .
WORKING PARTY
The term Unidentified Flying Object was coined in a U.S. Air Force report three years after the description ‘ flying saucer ’ was applied to a sighting in Washington State in June 1947 .
In Britain , so worrying was the spate of reports that a secret Flying Saucer Working Party was formed to check them out .
Like the U.S. Air Force , it concluded flying saucers did not exist .
But its final report in 1951 was still classified “ secret / discreet ” and given very limited circulation .
Not all sightings can be easily dismissed as the working of overwrought or intoxicated minds , or triggered by watching Steven Spielberg ’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
Royal Air Force personnel , civil aviation pilots and air traffic controllers have also reported sightings and radar tracks that remain unexplained despite high - level investigation .
Among the most famous was the sighting on two occasions of unexplained bright lights landing near a U.S. airbase in Rendlesham Forest in southern England .
Even the deputy commander of the base put his name to that 1980 report .

Another example of humor that is deadly accurate .
I worked on Wall Street for a few years , elbow to elbow with " top " investment bankers .
It was one big casino with the saps in pensions funds and savings and loans ( and us ) being used to finance the game and cover the losses .
Amazingly , this was recorded in 2007 .

TimeGate Editor 's note : Geek Out ! posts feature the latest and most interesting in nerd - culture news .

Nothing like a long weekend to kick off the convention season !
I started my annual journey to conventions with TimeGate .
TimeGate is an intimate , up and coming science fiction convention that focuses on two distinct fandoms : Doctor Who and Stargate .
Walking into the convention fans were greeted by a “ Gate ” in addition to tables filled with collectibles from Stargate and Doctor Who - but also Steampunk , " Battlestar Galactica , " and several other space - faring genres .
Among the guests at TimeGate this year was Carmen Argenziano , a fantastic actor who portrayed Jacob Carter / Selmak in SG - 1 .
One of the things we discussed was what he drew upon to get the emotions flowing for the character .
Argenziano mentioned his uncle , who was in the military and lost a brother in the war , as a mentor and influenced on how he played the role of Jacob .
He also mentioned the small steel mill town in Pennsylvania where he grew up as a place where he learned about honor and sense of national identity .
When asked what his favorite SG - 1 tech was he said with a smile that he loved “ being in the cockpit of the spaceships pretending to modulate dials and drive the ship . ”
One of the biggest parts of any good sci - fi show is the music and there are few more notable theme songs than that of Doctor Who .
One of the people who shaped the iconic theme is Dominic Glynn , composer and musician .
When asked what his favorite Doctor Who gadget is he responded that it he loved the TARDIS and that if given the chance to take the TARDIS anywhere he would like to see the end of the world .
He promised , however , that he would help the Doctor save the world - as long as he was able to “ write a really good piece of music to accompany it . ”
In talking with several other people at the convention about what their favorite piece of tech from either Stargate or Doctor Who would be , the answers ranged from the Doctor 's sonic screwdriver to the Stargate itself .
The driving force behind those answers seemed to be the ability to explore new places and see new things .
Alan Silers , one of the co-founders of TimeGate even mentioned the Daleks as a great piece of tech - well written and with an important purpose in the world of Doctor Who .
When I asked him if he thought something like the TARDIS would be possible in our lifetime , he did n't seem too sure , saying with a laugh that “ even with as much as technology changes and grows at a rapid pace in our life , gaining some sort of mastery over time … that ’s a huge one . ”
So , although we might not be chosen as a companion to the next Doctor or get the chance to travel to another universe , we can read about them , dress up as our favorite characters from the shows and even buy our own small piece of the fandom at not only TimeGate , but the other conventions that are getting ready to start .
After all , summer is just starting and so is con season .

The Hollywood Reporter has a list of potential actors to take over the role of Spider - Man in the new incarnation on the big screen .
They include Jamie Bell , Alden Ehrenreich and Josh Hutcherson ( " Zathura " ) .
The good news ?
Zac Efron , one name that was floated , is not among them .
The bad news ?
The names that are here do n't exactly fill me with confidence , either .
My reaction , in a word ?
Meh .
The reason Tobey Maguire worked so well as Spider - Man is because he worked so well as Peter Parker .
He was so good in the role it will be hard to live up to that ( I wo n't quite compare him to Christopher Reeve as Superman , but he was close ) .
What I fear is that the studio is looking for the next Taylor Lautner to guarantee that teen girls will show up on opening night alongside the Spidey faithful .
Marc
Webb , the director of the new movie , as well as " 500 Days of Summer , " is looking for unknowns for this role and I respect that .
Of all of the people here , I think that Bell ( " Billy Elliott " ) might fit the bill best .
I just hope they remember that they 're ultimately casting Peter Parker , not Spider - Man .
What do you think ?
Are you more impressed with the list of potential actors than I am ?
What qualities are you looking for in the new Spidey ?

Classic Controller
Pro looks vaguely familiar
At a time when other gaming - console manufacturers are ready to unveil their motion - sensitive controllers , Nintendo has released a new device that feels more old - school .
The new Classic Controller Pro looks and feels like a traditional game controller , with two joysticks , X - Y - A - B buttons , a directional pad and bumper buttons on the front .
It was released in a package deal with the new " Monster Hunter Tri " game for the Wii .
Officials from Nintendo and Capcom said the bundle was done to appeal to the widest audience possible by giving them a controller that was designed for the game .
" Fans of the [ " Monster Hunter " ] series are used to this type of controller , " said Eric Monacelli , product marketing manager for Capcom .
" This is old - school .
It will appeal to the hard - core player . "
" It goes very well with ' Monster Hunter Tri ' , " added Nintendo representative Kumiko Hidaka .
" Never has an accessory been so specifically designed for a game . "
" Monster Hunter Tri " lets gamers become a prehistoric hunter who tries to defend his village from rampaging monsters while collecting supplies to help him with his quest .
Oh , and there are constant earthquakes that need to be dealt with as well .
Creatures of all sizes live in the surrounding countryside , and the hunter 's job is to clear them out , get better weapons and take on even larger monsters .
The new controller allows the player to accomplish the major fighting action while offering ways to complete minor tasks ( like cooking food to eat ) .
" Players will love this controller , " Monacelli said .
" It feels good for the game without taking away from any gameplay . " " Monster Hunter Tri " also allows for multiple players to band together online take down a really big monster .
The game lets players use Wii Speak to communicate with each other and plan strategy , which gives the game a party feel .
According to game director Kaname Fujioka , this is a big change .
" Everyone goes online and enters the same world , but not everyone has to do the same thing , " Fujioka said in an " Ask Iwata " interview .
" Each person can do his or her own thing , but when the group achieves the goal , everyone benefits . "
The Classic Controller Pro will be compatible with nearly 400 Wii titles , Hikada said .

Thanks to a box of colored pencils and a whole lot of creativity , Makenzie Melton now has a $ 15,000 college scholarship , a netbook computer and a $ 25,000 technology grant for a new computer lab at her school .
How did a third - grader from El Dorado Springs , Missouri , score the prizes ?
By winning Google ’s 2010 Doodle 4 Google contest .
Melton ’s doodle , titled “ Rainforest Habitat , " will appear on the Google homepage Thursday .
The doodle , which expresses Melton ’s “ concern that the rainforest is in danger , ” was chosen over more than 33,000 submissions by students - ranging from kindergarten to twelfth grade , according to a post on the Official Google Blog .
Melton and the rest of the applicants were asked to develop a doodle for the site ’s home page based on the theme , “ If I could do anything , I would … ” A panel of “ well - known illustrators , cartoonists and animators ” helped choose the winning doodle , according to the blog .
The regional and state finalists ’ doodles can be found on the official Google Blog .

Do you know Lisbeth Salandar ?
The tattooed , bisexual , computer hacker is one of the most popular characters in fiction since Harry Potter .
She ’s also the unlikely heroine of Stieg Larsson ’s bestselling Millennium trilogy .
The third and perhaps final book of the series set in Sweden , “ The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet ’s Nest ” hit store shelves on Tuesday but it ’s been a bestseller for the past several months , ranking among the top pre-orders online .
The book has generated huge anticipation among U.S. readers .
It was released in Europe last fall but hardcore fans who could n’t wait have been paying $ 50 or more to buy the book from overseas , a practice the book ’s publisher calls illegal .
Nevertheless , the millions who read the “ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ” and its sequel “ The Girl Who Played with Fire , ” are about to be rewarded in the Nordic Noir finale .
The new novel picks up right where the last book ended .
Salander is in intensive care at a Swedish hospital , with several gunshot wounds , including a bullet in her brain .
She ’s fighting for her life and facing murder charges .

Wow ... did a BP representative really say that ?
Well , no .
But a satirical Twitter feed , which at first glance looks like an official BP account , is serving up a scathing daily parody of the company 's efforts to clean up the Gulf Coast oil spill .
A quick read of @bpglobalpr , a Twitter account created last week , should reveal to most users that this is no BP - sanctioned public relations campaign .
" Please help us with rebranding .
We 're not calling it an ' oil spill ' anymore , now it 's a ' Southern Fun Party ' # bpcares , " read a post from late Tuesday .
" Funny , no one has thanked us for seasons 3 - 15 of Treme yet .
# bpcares , " read another , referencing the HBO series set in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
The feed definitely requires an appreciation of gallows humor .
Written in the voice of a clueless oil - company spokesperson , it often makes light of the spill .
From Monday : " The ocean looks just a bit slimmer today .
Dressing it in black really did the trick ! # bpcares . "
And from last week : " Please do NOT take or clean any oil you find on the beach .
That is the property of British Petroleum and we WILL sue you . "
The feed 's popularity is steadily climbing , with more than 38,000 followers as of Wedneday morning .
By contrast , the actual BP America Twitter feed had about 5,600 .
Aside from tweaking the company whose offshore oil rig exploded , dumping millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , there may be an altruistic motive behind the Twitter account .
The feed repeatedly links to a site selling anti-BP T - shirts and claiming the proceeds will be donated to the Gulf Restoration Network , a group that works to protect and restore the Gulf region .
Whoever is behind the Twitter account did not respond to a message requesting comment for this post .
A spokesman for BP said the company is aware of the Twitter feed , saying that anyone who sees it almost surely will know it 's a spoof .

Romulans , puppeteers , hobbits - lend me your ears !
Today , we geeks can gather today and celebrate all that makes us unique .
Worldwide , May 25 is known as Geek Pride Day , Towel Day ( for " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " fans like our own No. 42 above ) and Glorious 25th of May , for Discworld fans .
See how some are celebrating Geek Pride Day on iReport .
Although Geek Pride Day is a relatively new holiday ; founded in Spain in 2006 , the Inalienable Rights of Geekdom ( at least as we see them ) that it celebrates are not : 1 . The right to strive to be even geekier .
2 . The right to not leave your house when there 's plenty to entertain you there .
3 . The right to not like football or any other sport .
4 . The right to freely associate with other nerds .
5 . The right to have a few select ( inevitably awesome ) friends .
6 . The right to have a ton of friends - each geekier than the last .
7 . The right to not be “ in - style . ”
8 . The right to be overweight / underweight / have poor eyesight and the like .
9 . The right to show off your geekiness at all times .
10 .
The right to take over the world .
Not all geeks will agree with or adhere to all - or in some cases even most - of these rules .
Everybody geeks out in their own way ; that 's the beauty of it .
But we can all agree that being a geek can be a good thing .
Why is that ?
Well , let ’s take a look at a couple of the great things about being a geek : 1 . We can always find a game to play no matter what .
We are like the MacGyver of games .
Give us a pen and paper and we ’ll entertain ourselves and others .
2 . We look good in glasses .
Seriously , we do .
3 . We are clever .
Who was the one who everyone turned to on " Lost ? "
The doctor .
4. Speaking of doctors , we have Doctor Who .
He ’s smart , funny , has a time machine and is one of the biggest geeks in the universe .
5 . We can balance a checkbook .
Whether we use a computer program , our raw brain power or a good old - fashioned abacus , we will not be overdrawn .
Geek Pride
Day is all about looking at the best parts of being a geek , so grab your towel , stick out your thumb and tell us what your plans are - or what you 've already done - for Geek Pride Day .

Championship Pac - Man
A productivity blog figured out that we wasted ( some would say , enjoyed ) over 4.8 million hours of time on Friday playing the Pac - Man game on Google .
The game was the search site 's featured logo over the weekend to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the popular arcade game .
The logo was actually playable and would continue for 256 levels of chomping .
The RescueTime blog did the math to figure out how much extra time people spent on Google on Friday , and how much did that time cost .
Typically , users spend an average of 11 seconds per each Google page view .
RescueTime found the average user spent 36 second more on Pac - Man Friday .
With 504.7 million unique visitors on May 23 , that totals up to an additional 4,819,352 hours spent on Google .
Armed with that number , the blog then wanted to figure out how much productivity was lost .
Assuming the average Google user has a salary of $ 25 per hour , the total bill comes to $ 120,483,800 .
The game would start if the user hit the " Insert Coin " button or if the site sat idle on the Google home page for about 10 seconds .
Google left it up on their homepage throughout the weekend , but gave it a permanent home to be enjoyed whenever you like .

More and more , we 're agreed - this country is going to hell in a hand basket .
Since we are n't there yet , I feel the good fight is still worth fighting .
I was encouraged Monday night when , while channel hopping , I found Representative Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) on C - Span , reading his formidable Articles of Impeachment ( ... all thirty - five of them !.. ) against George W. Bush .
I settled in and watched his workmanlike delivery of painstakingly gathered facts more intently than football fans watch the Super - Bowl , and I was genuinely uplifted to know there is at least one American hero left on the hill .
For his hard work , indomitable spirit and unquestionable courage , we greatly owe Dennis Kucinich .
At every opportunity , I hope you 'll join me in sharing with him your sincere gratitude and stalwart support .
Now , no matter how much we sound off in our local newspapers , or how much we lean on our own representatives to join Kucinich , ( and we should already have been doing both by now ) , I 'm afraid the priceless seeds Dennis planted might quietly wither because we have n't yet gotten rid of certain congressional poisons .
Nancy Pelosi for instance , is an outrageous congressional poison .
Whether she 's criminally collusive or just unfathomably ignorant , her disregards for democracy , the American people and the U.S. Constitution were laid bare the moment she took impeachment " off the table . "
She 's obstructed justice long enough , and should not only be removed , but also indicted , tried and very possibly jailed alongside the Bush administration !
A few days ago , I learned of and signed Scott Creighton 's online petition demanding the removal of Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives , to replace her with someone who WILL pursue the constitutionally required impeachment and lawful removal of the Bush / Cheney administration .
What 's more , I 'm enthusiastically urging you to do the same .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
With the media and international affairs observers focused on the Bush administration ’s decision to send a US envoy to international nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva this weekend , this detail in a wire report out of the Turkish capital Ankara today is interesting .
From the AP , who ’s in Turkey today ?
White House national security advisor Stephen Hadley .
What ’s he doing there ?
According to the AP report , talking about Iran .
And who is coming to Turkey tomorrow ?
Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki .
Now , Turkey has been playing the role of mediator – for a long time secretly , and recently openly – in indirect proximity talks between long time adversaries Israel and Syria .
One wonders , is Turkey hosting some sort of pre pre-negotiations now between the US and Iran ?
One former State Department official tells me that is unlikely .
“ It seems highly improbable …
If only because it would undercut ( or worse ) the prospective Jalili - Burns meeting on Saturday .
Mottaki is far less influential , so why would you have a more senior [ US government ] official do a sit - down with him ? ”
But Abdullah Akyuz , Washington president of the Tusiad Turkish business association , tells me Turkey and its ruling Ak party has been playing a growing role as mediator between Iran , Syria , and the West .
A former White House official tells me it strikes him as plausible .
“ I believe anything is plausible at this point , ” he said .
“ While Hadley would be a level higher and bring the prestige of the White House into play , a huge step was already taken in sending [ Undersecretary of State for political affairs ] Bill Burns to Geneva .
Moreover , [ Secretary of State ] Condi [ Rice ] may want the prestige of the White House invested so that she is not the focal point of conservative wrath .
“ [ Rice ] often employs the ‘ are you betraying the president ? ’ argument stopper whenever she is contradicted or challenged , ” the former White House official continued .
“ So she would be eager to ensure Bill Burns ’ mission does n’t leave her standing alone as the target in the crosshairs of conservatives , and to get the investment of the Oval Office into her policy . ”
For his part , another former State Department official says he does n’t think Hadley ’s visit to Turkey has to do with Iran .
“ Nor would he use the Turks as an intermediary with Iran . ”
Turkish daily Sabah reports : “ Hadley was in Ankara yesterday and gave messages on the meeting with Iran : ‘ There will not be any negotiations unless Teheran quits their uranium program . ’ …
Hadley sent messages to Iran before the meeting in Geneva and held a confidential summit with the security consultants of nine countries , members of NATO .
Hadley said : ‘ We did not sign a confidential agreement with Iran .
The US minister of foreign affairs assistant William Burns will go to Geneva for showing our diplomatic efforts and the gravity of our suggestion to Geneva . ' ”

Bad Engineering Properties
of Object - Oriented Languages
Digital Equipment Corporation , Systems Research Center
Abstract .
Object - oriented languages dominate procedural languages in certain software - engineering categories , but not in others .
Further progress may involve adapting and reintroducing principles that are already well understood and widely exploited in procedural languages .
The object - oriented paradigm emerged in the 60's , roughly during the time that important notions such as data abstraction , polymorphism , and modularization were applied to the procedural paradigm .
Eventually , object - oriented languages also acquired notions of data abstraction , polymorphism , and modularization , but not quite in the same way , and not quite as effectively .
In the last decade , object - oriented languages have been widely adopted as engineering tools because of their superiority with respect to software extensibility , which is a critical engineering property [ 4 ] .
A large and growing fraction of software engineering is now carried out in object - oriented languages , taking over the domain traditionally covered by procedural languages .
However , object - oriented languages have not incorporated all the engineering insights that have been successfully deployed in procedural languages .
For example , they have emphasized code reuse at the expense of modularization , and dynamic inspection at the expense of static detection .
Therefore , opportunities remain for applying important ideas that hopefully will result in even stronger engineering advantages for object - oriented languages .
I will begin by considering some obvious engineering metrics .
For comparison purposes , I will first recall how advances in language design have resulted in the past in engineering improvements , according to these metrics .
Next , I will review how object - oriented languages have yet to show similar improvements in some of these areas .
Finally , I will discuss what remains to be done to integrate certain good engineering principles into object - oriented languages .
Consider the following ( informal ) metrics :
Economy of execution .
How fast does a program run ?

Economy of language features .
How hard is it to learn or use a programming language ?
Let us consider first procedural languages .
Over the course of many years , these languages acquired features that ( more often than not ) resulted in considerable improvements in engineering .
This is of course not an accident : most language features were directly inspired or corroborated by engineering considerations .
These engineering - friendly features include the notions of static typing , data abstraction , modularization , and parameterization , which resulted in the following improvements :
Economy of execution .
Type information was first introduced in programming to improve code generation and run-time efficiency for numerical computations , for example in FORTRAN .
In ML , accurate type information eliminates the need for nil - checking on pointer dereferencing .
In general , accurate type information at compile time leads to the application of the appropriate operations at run-time without the need of expensive tests .

In general , accurate type information at compile time leads to the application of the appropriate operations at run-time without the need of expensive tests .
Economy of compilation .
Type information can be organized into interfaces for program modules , for example as in Modula - 2 and Ada .
Modules can then be compiled independently of each other , with each module depending only on the interfaces of the others .
Compilation of large systems is made more efficient because , at least when interfaces are stable , changes to a module do not cause other modules to be recompiled .
The messy aspects of system integration are thus eliminated .

Economy of small - scale development .
When a type system is well designed , typechecking can capture a large fraction of routine programming errors , eliminating lengthy testing and debugging sessions .
The errors that do occur are easier to debug , simply because large classes of other errors have been ruled out .
Moreover , experienced programmers adopt a coding style that causes some logical errors to show up as typechecking errors : they use the typechecker as a development tool .
( For example , by changing the name of a type when its invariants change even though the type structure remains the same , so as to get error reports on all its old uses . )

Economy of large - scale development .
Data abstraction and modularization have methodological advantages for code development .
Large teams of programmers can negotiate the interfaces to be implemented , and then proceed separately to implement the corresponding pieces of code .
Dependencies between pieces of code are minimized , and code can be locally rearranged without fear of global effects .
Polymorphism is important for reusing code modularly .

Polymorphism is important for reusing code modularly .
Economy of language features .
Some well - designed constructions can be naturally composed in orthogonal ways .
For example , in Pascal an array of arrays models two - dimensional arrays ; in ML , a procedure with a single argument that is a tuple of n parameters models a procedure of n arguments .
Orthogonality of language features reduces the complexity of programming languages .
The learning curve for programmers is thus reduced , and the re-learning effort that is constantly necessary in using complex languages is minimized as well .
Let us now consider object - oriented languages , and see how they compare on these metrics .
Economy of execution .
Object - oriented style is intrinsically less efficient that procedural style .
In pure object - oriented style , every routine is supposed to be a ( virtual ) method .
This introduces additional indirections through method tables and prevents optimizations such as inlining .
The traditional solution to this problem ( analyzing and compiling whole programs ) violates modularity and is not applicable to libraries .

Economy of compilation .
Often there is no distinction between the code of a class and the interface of a class .
Some object - oriented languages are not sufficiently modular and require recompilation of superclasses when compiling subclasses .
Therefore , the time spent in compilation may grow disproportionally with the size of the system .

Therefore , the time spent in compilation may grow disproportionally with the size of the system .
Economy of small - scale development .
This is a big win of object - orientation : individual programmers can take good advantage of class libraries and frameworks , drastically reducing their work load .
When the level of ambition grows , however , programmers must be able to understand the details of those class libraries , and this turns out to be more difficult than understanding module libraries ( see also the next point ) .
The type systems of most object - oriented languages are not expressive enough ; programmers must often resort to dynamic checking or to unsafe features , damaging the robustness of their programs .

Economy of large - scale development .
Teams of programmers are often involved in developing class libraries and specializing existing class libraries .
Although reuse is a big win of object - oriented languages , it is also the case that these languages have extremely poor modularity properties with respect to class extension and modification .
For example , it is easy to override a method that should not be overridden , or to reimplement a class in a way that causes problems in subclasses .
Other large - scale development problems include the confusion between classes and object types , which limits the construction of abstractions , and the fact that subtype polymorphism is not good enough for expressing container classes .

Other large - scale development problems include the confusion between classes and object types , which limits the construction of abstractions , and the fact that subtype polymorphism is not good enough for expressing container classes .
Economy of language features .
Smalltalk was originally intended as a language that would be easy to learn [ 2 ] .
C++ is based on a fairly simple model , inherited from Simula , but is otherwise daunting in the complexity of its many features [ 6 ] .
Somewhere along the line something went wrong ; what started as economical and uniform ( " everything is an object " ) ended up as a baroque collection of class varieties .
Java represents a healthy reaction to the complexity trend , but is more complex than many people realize [ 3 ] .
These problems form obstacles to the further development of object - oriented software engineering , and in some situations are beginning to cause its outright rejection .
Such problems can be solved either by a variety of ad hoc tools and methodologies , or by progress in language technology ( both design and implementation ) .
Here are some things that could or should be done in the various areas .
Economy of execution .
Much can be done to improve the efficiency of method invocation by clever program analysis , as well as by language features ( e.g. by " final " methods and classes ) ; this is the topic of a large and promising body of current work .
We also need to design type systems that can statically check many of the conditions that now require dynamic subclass checks .

Economy of compilation .
We need to adopt languages and type systems that allow the separate compilation of ( sub ) classes , without resorting to recompilation of superclasses and without relying on " private " information in interfaces .

Economy of small - scale development .
Improvements in type systems for object - oriented languages will improve error detection and the expressiveness of interfaces .
Much promising work has been done already and needs to be applied or further deployed [ 1 ] [ 5 ] .

Economy of large - scale development .
Major progress should be achieved by formulating and enforcing inheritance interfaces : the contract between a class and its subclasses ( as opposed to the instantiation interface which is essentially an object type ) .
This recommendation requires the development of adequate language support .
Parametric polymorphism is beginning to appear in many object - oriented languages , and its interactions with object - oriented features need to be better understood .
Subtyping and subclassing must be separated .
Similarly , classes and interfaces must be separated .

Economy of language features .
Prototype - based languages have already tried to reduce the complexity of class - based languages by providing simpler , more composable features .
Even within class - based languages , we now have a better understanding of how to achieve simplicity and orthogonality , but much remains to be done .
How can we design an object - oriented language that is powerful and simple ; one that allows powerful engineering but also simple and reliable engineering ?
In conclusion , object - oriented languages still have to learn some engineering lessons from procedural languages .
In fairness , designers of object - oriented languages did not simply " forget " to include properties such as good type systems and good modularity : the issues are intrinsically more complex than in procedural languages .
Therefore , we have to work harder to produce object - oriented language designs that entail good engineering properties .
We have to work even harder to produce good language designs .

Despite worldwide food shortages and falling farm production in the United States , little attention has been paid to a critical piece of the agricultural production web : Fertilizer .
Industrially produced fertilizer accounts for a huge increase in agricultural productivity over the last 30 years – the so - called " green revolution " – but its production consumes about 1.5 percent of all the energy used worldwide and produces a huge amount of planet - warming carbon dioxide along the way .
You'd think that would mean scientists would have an easy time getting funding for research into less energy - and carbon - intensive ways of fertilizing crops .
You 'd be wrong .
" The fact that I have a Nobel Prize does n't keep me from losing my funding , " said Richard Schrock , an MIT professor who won science 's most prestigious prize in 2005 .
" The amount of money that is required is not available at this point . "
More money could lead to a world - changing breakthrough .
Schrock and David Tyler , of the University of Oregon , have been closing in , slowly but steadily , on new ways to get the air 's nitrogen to react and transform into the ammonia that powers the global food system .
Schrock was able to use a molybdenum catalyst to take protons and electrons – which would normally stick together to form hydrogen – and instead produce ammonia .
Now he 's working on revisions of his process that include different forms of hydrogen .
Tyler , meanwhile , published a major paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in which he reduced nitrogen using hydrogen and an iron catalyst .
Tyler said his team " had almost " created the right catalyst for converting hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia .
Some members of his team anticipate a major breakthrough as early as this year .
" There 's an enzyme called nitrogenase , found in bacteria , that will make ammonia , " Tyler said .
" If nature can do it , you 'd think scientists ought to be able to reproduce it . "
So far , no dice .
If there was ever a field crying out for innovation , fertilizer is it .
Most fertilizer production depends on a 99 - year - old industrial method known as the Haber - Bosch process , which produces ammonia , the chemical precursor to nitrogen fertilizers .
By one scientist 's count , the 87 million tons of ammonia that are produced each year by this process feed 40 percent of the world 's population ( .pdf ) .
However , the energy - intensive Haber - Bosch process depends on using lots of natural gas , both as a source of hydrogen and for the power needed to cook the chemicals .
Given all the demand , natural gas prices have doubled since the mid-90s , and the price of ammonia has tripled .
That 's bad news for farmers , especially those in the developing world who already have limited ability to purchase fertilizers .
" Why are the Chinese using so much energy ? "
Tyler asks .
" It 's making ammonia plants . "
Some environmental and organic farming groups contend that just " greening " the process of making ammonia is n't enough .
They point to the problems that nitrogen - based fertilizers cause .
Nitrogen gets into rivers , which carry the fertilizer to the coasts of developed countries .
There , algae feast on the stuff and use all the available oxygen in the water .
The result : dead zones off the coasts of countries that use the fertilizers .
Other groups argue that heavy input of fertilizers encourages monoculture : planting huge tracts of single , high - yield plant species , a practice they say is bound to be environmentally destructive .
But given rising populations and rising food prices , the world might not be in an either / or situation :
We could need new farming methods and new ways of making ammonia .
In a twist worthy of an Arthur C. Clarke novel , the global scale of the problem all comes down to the way that electrons arrange themselves around the nucleus of nitrogen atoms .
A nitrogen atom has five electrons in its outer shell , so it has a tendency to share three electrons with another nitrogen atom to create a triple covalent bond , one of the strongest in nature .
Learning how to break that bond was a tremendous breakthrough for human technology – all the more remarkable given that bacteria can do it with relative ease .
But all of the world 's nitrogen - fixing bacteria only produce about as much nitrogen as humans do now .
With world population estimates continuing to grow , any process that aims to replace Haber - Bosch would need to be able to replace existing nitrogen production and then some , in order to meet the world 's growing demands .
So while billions of dollars in venture capital are flowing in to cleantech companies that would only make small differences in the world 's energy balance , research into new fertilizer tech is inexplicably underfunded .
" Something like this , the big guys would jump all over it , " Tyler said , " assuming we could do it . "

So this day  Friday , April 11 , 2008  is the last day , closing a deal struck over a year ago when the owner of the stockyards , the Central Livestock Association , sold off the last 27 acres of what was once 166 acres of mooing , bleating , undulating commerce .
The new owners will soon bulldoze everything to make room for more buildings of light industry  pens for people .
Stockyard denizens in blue blazers and in Carhartt overalls , in fine cowboy hats and in cheap baseball caps , pause in the gray morning cold to talk memories and to sell memorabilia .
They assure one another that they ’ll soon be catching up at Minnesota auctions in Albany and Zumbrota .
But mostly they just wait to buy and sell and ship and talk and do the business of livestock .
Here is John Barber , big and strong and 69 , the yard ’s main auctioneer for nearly four decades .
What a voice he has , so deep and soothing that you want to bid on something , anything : Would there be room for a heifer in the apartment ?
He lubricates his throat with apple juice and Halls cough drops and says he does n’t use a lot of filler words when singing his auction song because he does n’t want to confuse people .
But that voice breaks a bit when he talks about this day .
His wife , Toots , works here as a clerk , and so did his three daughters , and so did his father , Bob , hauling livestock .
When Mr. Barber was a boy , he would ride in the cab of his father ’s Mack truck for those 150 - mile night rides from Milroy  and then they were here , father and son , in the roiling , toiling , raucous yards .
His father died not long ago at 93 , he says .
“ You have to think about him ” on this day , he says .
And the slightest drop in that mellifluous voice tells you it ’s time to talk about something else .
American Presidential elections are about the future , and not the past .
It 's for that reason that the contrast between the junior senator from Illinois and the senior senator from Arizona is so fascinating .
The Republican National Committee is planning a $ 19.5 million advertising campaign to portray Mr. Obama , 46 , as out of touch with the country and too inexperienced to be commander in chief , seeking to put him on the defensive before he can use his financial advantage against Mr. McCain , 71 , party officials said .
" In 1984 , Ronald Reagan said , ‘ I ’m not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent ’s youth and inexperience , ’ " said Frank Donatelli , the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee .
" Well , we are going to exploit Obama ’s youth and inexperience . "
On the Democratic side , Mr. Obama ’s aides this week put finishing touches on advertisements intended to tether Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush and chip away at his image as a maverick , an identity that the aides said they found remained strong with voters .
" By November , every voter will know that McCain is offering a third Bush term , " said Mr. Obama ’s campaign manager , David Plouffe .
It is n't the age stuff ( McCain at 72 would be the oldest President ever inaugurated , and as he put it himself , he 's a man of " the twentieth century , my century " ; Obama would be a year older than Bill Clinton was when Clinton took office . )
It is n't character ( McCain made it to the top the Republican way : he cheated on his first wife and married a Sugar Momma , who still finances his political ambitions ; see McCain campaign violates own travel policy and the issue of Cindy McCain 's tax returns . )
No , it 's none of that .
It 's the important stuff , issues in the real world that affect all of us .
As David Gergen put it :
" The next president will inherit the most difficult agenda since the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt , " he warned .
Gergen stressed that a continuation of current policies would likely result in the decline of America while Japan , China and India may become superpowers within the next few decades .
Whether the U.S. will remain one is questionable , he said , especially if our policies remain static .
According to Gergen , America not only needs to change its policies , but revolutionize them .
In addition , problems including two extensive wars , the education system and job growth require solving , not " sugar - coating . "
It is in this regard that the contrast is so striking .
So , let 's look at the three issues Americans have identified as " most important " to them .
Iraq ( statements from Foreign Affairs ) :
Obama :
To renew American leadership in the world , we must first bring the Iraq war to a responsible end and refocus our attention on the broader Middle East .
Iraq was a diversion from the fight against the terrorists who struck us on 9/11 , and incompetent prosecution of the war by America 's civilian leaders compounded the strategic blunder of choosing to wage it in the first place .
We have now lost over 3,300 American lives , and thousands more suffer wounds both seen and unseen .
McCain :
Whether success grows closer or more distant over the coming months , it is clear that Iraq will be a central issue for the next U.S. president .
Democratic candidates have promised to withdraw U.S. troops and " end the war " by fiat , regardless of the consequences .
To make such decisions based on the political winds at home , rather than on the realities in the theater , is to court disaster .
The war in Iraq cannot be wished away , and it is a miscalculation of historic magnitude to believe that the consequences of failure will be limited to one administration or one party .
This is an American war , and its outcome will touch every one of our citizens for years to come .
That is why I support our continuing efforts to win in Iraq .
It is also why I oppose a preemptive withdrawal strategy that has no Plan B for the aftermath of its inevitable failure and the greater problems that would ensue .
So who 's right ?
Hint : not John McCain .
Writing this month in Foreign Affairs , Steven Simon notes in The Price of the Surge ( bolded mine ) :
Unfortunately , such claims misconstrue the causes of the recent fall in violence and , more important , ignore a fatal flaw in the strategy .
The surge has changed the situation not by itself but only in conjunction with several other developments : the grim successes of ethnic cleansing , the tactical quiescence of the Shiite militias , and a series of deals between U.S. forces and Sunni tribes that constitute a new bottom - up approach to pacifying Iraq .
The problem is that this strategy to reduce violence is not linked to any sustainable plan for building a viable Iraqi state .
If anything , it has made such an outcome less likely , by stoking the revanchist fantasies of Sunni Arab tribes and pitting them against the central government and against one another .
In other words , the recent short - term gains have come at the expense of the long - term goal of a stable , unitary Iraq .
Despite the current lull in violence , Washington needs to shift from a unilateral bottom - up surge strategy to a policy that promotes , rather than undermines , Iraq 's cohesion .
That means establishing an effective multilateral process to spur top - down political reconciliation among the major Iraqi factions .
And that , in turn , means stating firmly and clearly that most U.S. forces will be withdrawn from Iraq within two or three years .
Otherwise , a strategy adopted for near - term advantage by a frustrated administration will only increase the likelihood of long - term debacle .
Of course , McCain ( the so - called military expert ) has n't been pinned down for a response about this , which qualifies as an example of Gergen 's " sugar coating " :
" So the Pentagon would maintain a team of ' military analysts ' who reliably ' carry their water ' -- yet who were presented as independent analysts by the television and cable networks .
By feeding only those pro-Government sources key information and giving them access -- even before responding to the press -- only those handpicked analysts would be valuable to the networks , and that , in turn , would ensure that only pro-Government sources were heard from .
Hmmm ... well , let 's turn to another topic of import : health reform .

Advertisement A Palestinian in a mechanical digger has rammed traffic in west Jerusalem , injuring at least 10 people before being shot dead .
A bus and a number of cars were hit during the incident .
Some cars were crushed and one was turned on its roof .
Witnesses say an armed civilian first shot at the driver , before he was killed by border police .
Three weeks ago a Palestinian man went on a deadly rampage in a heavy vehicle in Jerusalem , killing three Israelis .
The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says it is thought the 2 July attacker was simply a disturbed man without political motivation - but Israelis will worry Tuesday 's incident was a copycat attack and that this could now be a new tactic .
Police identified the perpetrator as 22 - year - old East Jerusalem resident Ghassan Abu Tir .
It is not known if he was connected to any militant group .
Gunshots
The latest attack took place in a busy part of central West Jerusalem , close to the King David Hotel - just hours before US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama visited the city .
I saw the tractor going into a bus four or five times .
All the windows of the bus exploded
Yohanan Levine
' I saw into digger driver 's eyes '
As the incident was unfolding , Israeli President Shimon Peres was for the first time receiving Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at his official residence in Jerusalem , which is also nearby .
" I was going home when I saw the tractor going into a bus four or five times .
All the windows of the bus exploded , " said a 16 - year - old Israeli at the scene .
" Then I saw the tractor going down the street pushing cars .
I saw more people running and after two minutes I heard two or three gunshots , " Yohanan Levine added .
A driver interviewed by Israeli TV said his car was rammed twice by the front shovel of the digger and he only just managed to swerve to avoid a third charge aimed at his head .
Photographs of the immediate aftermath show the driver 's body slumped in the cab and at least eight bullet holes in the glass next to him .
Ten people , including a baby , were injured in the incident .
A number of people were treated for shock .
Official visit Israeli police called it a " terror attack " , although there was no immediate claim of responsibility by any Palestinian militant organisation .
Police said the driver was from a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank , which Israel has designated part of the enlarged Jerusalem municipality .
Mr Abbas told reporters he " condemned and rejected " the attack and said such incidents " hurt our reputation and peace in general " .
It was the first time a Palestinian Authority president had visited the Israeli presidential residence , known as Beit Hanasi .
Mr Abbas was welcomed in a formal ceremony with Palestinian flags flying at the reception point .
Such trappings are normally absent when Mr Abbas meets Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at his official residence .
In his remarks , Mr Peres said : " Israelis have a burning desire to reach peace with the Palestinians . "
Mr Abbas has been meeting Israeli leaders regularly since attempts were made to give the peace process fresh impetus at an international conference in the United States last November .

BETHESDA , Md. ( May 31 , 2005 ) --
You just can't tell where you might find love these days .
A team led by a neuroscientist , an anthropologist and a social psychologist found love - related neurophysiological systems inside a magnetic resonance imaging machine .
They detected quantifiable love responses in the brains of 17 young men and women who each described themselves as being newly and madly in love .
The multidisciplinary team found that early , intense romantic love may have more to do with motivation , reward and " drive " aspects of human behavior than with the emotions or sex drive .
Brain systems were activated that humans share with other mammals .
So the researchers think " early - stage romantic love is possibly a developed form of a mammalian drive to pursue preferred mates , and that it has an important influence on social behaviors that have reproductive and genetic consequences . "
Diverse emotions occur , but reward response primary
" It 's a stark reminder that the mind truly is in the brain , " noted Lucy L. Brown of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine .
" We humans are built to experience magical feelings like love , but our findings do n't diminish the magic in any way .
In fact , for some , it enhances the experience .
Our research also helps to explain why a person in love feels ' driven ' to win their beloved , amidst a whole constellation of other feelings . "
The study , entitled " Reward , motivation and emotion systems associated with early - stage intense romantic love , " is available online and will be in the July issue of the Journal of Neurophysiology , published by the American Physiological Society .
The research was conducted by Arthur Aron , Helen E. Fisher , Debra J. Mashek , Greg Strong , Hai -Fang Li and Lucy L. Brown .
Aron , Fisher and Brown contributed equally .
" Most of the participants in our study clearly showed emotional responses , " noted Arthur Aron of the State University of New York - Stony Brook , " but we found no consistent emotional pattern .
Instead , all of our subjects showed activity in reward and motivation regions .
To emotion researchers like me , this is pretty exciting because it's the first physiological data to confirm a connection between romantic love and motivation networks in the brain .
" As it turns out , romantic love is probably best characterized as a motivation or goal - oriented state that leads to various specific emotions , such as euphoria or anxiety , " Aron noted .
" With this view , it becomes clearer why the lover expresses such an imperative to pursue his or her beloved and protect the relationship . "

Sexual arousal ' very different ' ; confirmation of questionnaire methods
Aron added : " Our participants who measured very high on a self report questionnaire of romantic love also showed strong activity in a particular brain region -- results that dramatically increase our confidence that self - report questionnaires can actually measure brain activity . "
Aron also noted that the research answered the " historic question of whether love and sex are the same , or different , or whether romantic passion is just warmed over sexual arousal . "
He said , " Our findings show that the brain areas activated when someone looks at a photo of their beloved only partially overlap with the brain regions associated with sexual arousal .
Sex and romantic love involve quite different brain systems . "
fMRI confirms major predictions , yields " remarkable implications " ; autism link
Aron reported that , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and other measurements , he and his colleagues found support for their two major predictions : ( 1 ) early stage , intense romantic love is associated with subcortical reward regions rich with dopamine ; and ( 2 ) romantic love engages brain systems associated with motivation to acquire a reward .
Brown explains some of these findings , commenting that " when our participants looked at a photo of his / her beloved , specific activation occurred in the right ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) and dorsal caudate body .
These regions were significant compared to two control conditions , providing strong evidence that these brain areas , which are associated with the motivation to win rewards , are central to the experience of being in love . "

Brown noted that " an important concept is that the caudate probably integrates huge amounts of information , everything from early personal memories to one 's personal notions of beauty .
Then , this brain region ( and related regions of the basal ganglia ) helps to direct one 's actions toward attaining one 's goals .
For neuroscientists , " she said , " these findings about the diverse regional functions of the basal ganglia in humans have remarkable implications . "
" Our data even may be relevant to some forms of autism , " Brown added .
" Some people with autism do n't understand or experience any sort of emotional attachment or romantic love .
I would speculate that autism involves an atypical development of the midbrain and basal ganglia reward systems .
This makes sense , too , because other symptoms of autism include repetitive thoughts and movements , characteristics of basal ganglia function . "
Surprise discovery : romance is on the right , ' attractiveness ' to the left
Another important discovery , Brown said , was that " to our surprise , the activation regions associated with intense romantic love were mostly on the right side of the brain , while the activation regions associated with facial attractiveness were mostly on the left .
" We did n't predict such a striking lateralization , " Brown reported .
" It is well known that speech is largely a left - sided cortical function .
But our data indicate that lateralization also occurs in lower parts of the brain .
Moreover , different kinds of rewards ( in this case , the " rush " of romantic love , compared with the pleasing experience of looking at a pretty or handsome face ) is also lateralized .
These results give us a lot to think about how the normal human brain learns and remembers and functions in general , " Brown added .
Love physiology changes over time ; ' Romantic love more powerful than sex '
Another breakthrough , Brown noted , was that " we found several brain areas where the strength of neural activity changed with the length of the romance .
Everyone knows that relationships are dynamic over time , but we are beginning to track what happens in the brain as a love relationship matures . "
Helen E. Fisher , a research anthropologist at Rutgers University , New Jersey , noted that not only did the brain change as romantic love endured , but that some of these changes were in regions associated with pair - bonding in prairie voles .
The fMRI images showed more activity in the ventral pallidum portion of the basal ganglia in people with longer romantic relationships .
It 's in this region where receptors for the hormone vasopressin are critical for vole pair - bonding , or attachment .
" Humans have evolved three distinct but interrelated brain systems for mating and reproduction -- the sex drive , romantic love , and attachment to a long term partner , " Fisher said , " and our results suggest how feelings of romantic love might change into feelings of attachment .
Our results support what people have always assumed -- that romantic love is one of the most powerful of all human experiences .
It is definitely more powerful than the sex drive . "
Depression , murder / suicide , demonstrate strength of romantic drive
For instance , Fisher point out , " If someone rejects your sexual overtures , you do n't harm yourself or the other person .
But rejected men and women in societies around the world sometimes kill themselves or someone else .
In fact , studies indicate that some 40 % of people who are rejected in love slip into clinical depression .
Our study may also suggest some of the underlying physiology of stalking behavior , " she added .
Fisher noted that their study , which took barely an hour for each participant but many years for the researchers to process and interpret the data , also found a " fascinating continuity between human romantic love and the physiological expressions of attraction in other animals .
Other scientists , " she said , " have reported that expressions of attraction in a female prairie vole are associated with a 50 % increase in dopamine activity in a brain region related to regions where we found activity .
These and other data indicate that all mammals may feel attraction to specific partners , and that some of the same brain systems are involved . "
Study explains second half of Darwin 's puzzle , sexual selection & 'eyes of the beholder '
" Darwin and many of his intellectual descendants have studied the myriad physiological ornaments that one sex of a species have evolved to attract members of the opposite sex , like the peacock 's fancy tail feathers that attract the peahen , " Fisher noted .
" But no one has studied what happened in the brain of the viewer , the individual that becomes attracted to these traits .
Our study indicates what happens in the brain of the viewer as he or she becomes physiologically attracted to these traits . "
She added , " This brain system probably evolved for an important reason -- to drive our forebears to focus their courtship energy on specific individuals , thereby conserving precious mating time and energy .
Perhaps , " she hypothesized , " even love - at - first - sight is a basic mammalian response that developed in other animals and our ancestors inherited in order to speed up the mating process . "
Einstein's Brown concluded , " Our results suggest that romantic love does not use a functionally specialized brain system .
It may be produced , instead , by a constellation of neural systems that converge onto widespread regions of the caudate where there is a flexible combinatorial map representing and integrating many motivating stimuli .
" This passion may be an excellent example of how a complex human behavioral state is processed .
Moreover , taken together , our results and those of Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki , who studied men and women in longer love relationships , show similar cortical , VTA and caudate activation patterns , suggesting that these regions are consistently and critically involved in this aspect of human reproduction and social behavior , romantic love .

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - U.S. cities that have long promoted bicycle use by commuters are now seeing a steady rise in the popularity of pedal power as gasoline prices soar .

Campaigns originally designed to cut down on traffic and pollution are now paying off for people looking for an option to driving with national gas prices averaging a record $ 4 per gallon .
People in cities such as Chicago , Washington and Portland , Oregon , can take advantage of bicycle lanes , bike - friendly transit systems and bike - parking locations built in recent years .
“ Twelve years ago , I would bike down to City Hall and often it was a lonely ride , ” said Ben Gomberg , Chicago ’s bicycle program coordinator .
“ Today , there are often 17 or 18 riders stopped at the intersections . ”
Unlike Europeans , Americans use bikes for transport sparingly , even though 40 percent of personal trips in the United States are two miles or less , according to bicycle advocates .
In a country famous for its love of cars and driving , less than 1 percent of personal trips are by bike compared with up to 30 percent in some parts of Europe , campaigners say .
But rates of bike use in some U.S. cities are significantly higher thanks to recognition by urban planners of the environmental , economic and health benefits .
In Portland , widely regarded as America ’s most bike - friendly city , 5.4 percent of people said in a 2006 survey that the bicycle was their primary means of getting to work .
“ In the last three years , we reached another acceleration point , ” said Scott Bricker , executive director of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance , an advocacy group .
“ Ridership is increasing exponentially . ”

GETTING INTO GEAR
The relative popularity of bicycling in Portland may be linked to bike lanes , locking facilities and programs that encourage public bicycling and safety education for children .
The city has 171 miles of bike lanes along its 2,568 miles of roadways and plans to increase that to 434 miles .
Portland has 71 miles of bike trails and a third of its arterial roads have bike lanes or paved shoulders .
Portland ’s network includes 114 miles of “ bicycle boulevards ” -- quiet streets where bikes have priority over cars and where traffic speed is restricted .
Those boulevards may be a better way of encouraging riding than traditional bike lanes where riders are still close to speeding cars , Bricker said .
In Chicago , pro-bike policies have resulted in 115 miles
of bike lanes , more than 11,000 bike racks and 50 miles of dedicated bike paths along Lake Michigan , Gomberg said .
Around 1.5 percent of personal trips in Chicago are made by bike and the city aims to boost that to 5 percent by 2015 .
In Washington , the proportion of people biking to work rose from 1.2 percent in 2000 to an estimated 2 percent in 2006 , said Jim Sebastian , who heads the U.S. capital ’s bicycle and pedestrian program .
Bike lanes in Washington now stretch to 33 miles -- 11 times longer than in 2001 -- and more than half of the city ’s subway stops now have bike racks .
Later this summer , Washington plans to launch the first U.S. bike - sharing program in which users will pay $ 40 a year for a swipe card enabling them to pick up a bike from racks around the city and then return them to any other rack .
Lisa Rinna is Fit and Fabulous ( Photos )
is one of the most cooperative celebrities in Hollywood .
The paparazzi seem to get very little push back from the talented actress and professional dancer .
At 44 years old she is fit and fabulous and seems to enjoy posing .
We 've got photos of Rinna leaving Winsor Pilates in West Hollywood yesterday .
We do n't know how she does it but she looks amazing with her hair and makeup in perfect shape .
We 've all seen photos of Madge leaving her London gym looking bedraggled and sweat stained .
Definitely not the case with Lisa .

Bilderberg meeting attracts prominent politicians , businessmen Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday June 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The 56th Bilderberg Meeting , an annual conference of influential politicians and businessmen , began Thursday in Chantilly , Virgina , according to a press release from the organization .
The Conference will end Sunday and deals mainly with a nuclear free world , cyber terrorism , Africa , Russia , finance , protectionism , US - EU relations , Afghanistan and Pakistan , Islam and Iran .
According to the press release , the meeting is private in order to encourage frank and open discussion .
About 140 participants will attend , of whom about two - thirds come from Europe and the balance from North America .
About one - third is from government and politics , and two - thirds are from finance , industry , labor , education and communications .
An official list of the attendees can be found at Alex Jones ' Infowars .
Although it is an international forum , many prominent American officials and politicians attend the conference , including Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice , Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke and Paul Wolfowitz .
James Johnson , the man tasked with selecting Barack Obama 's running mate , is also on the list to attend the conference .
InfoWars also reported that Senator Barack Obamas office has refused to deny that the Democratic nominee attended Bilderberg last night following reports that he and Hillary Clinton were present at " an event in Northern Virginia . "
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs would not say where the former rivals met , except that it was not at Clinton 's home in Washington , reported the Associated Press .
" Reporters traveling with Obama sensed something might be happening between the pair when they arrived at Dulles International Airport after an event in Northern Virginia and Obama was not aboard the airplane , " the Associated Press reported .
Bilderberg takes its name from the hotel in Holland , pictured above , where the first meeting took place in May 1954 .
That meeting grew out of the concern expressed by leading citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together as closely as they should on common problems of critical importance , according to the group 's press release .
The organization has sometimes drawn speculation that it forms a " shadowy global government , " the BBC reported .
Coverage of the Bilberberg conference can be found at Infowars .
Excerpts from Bilderberg 's press release , available in full here , follow ... # The Cold War has now ended .
But in practically all respects , there are more , not fewer , common problems - from trade to jobs , from monetary policy to investment , from ecological challenges to the task of promoting international security .
It is hard to think of any major issue in either Europe or North America whose unilateral solution would not have repercussions for the other .
Thus the concept of a European - American forum has not been overtaken by time .
The dialogue between these two regions is still - even increasingly - critical .
What is unique about Bilderberg as a forum , is the broad cross-section of leading citizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and off - the - record discussion about topics of current concern especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international economy ; the strong feeling among participants that in view of the differing attitudes and experiences of the Western nations , there remains a clear need to further develop an understanding in which these concerns can be accommodated ; the privacy of the meetings , which has no purpose other than to allow participants to speak their minds openly and freely .
In short , Bilderberg is a small , flexible , informal and off - the - record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced .
Bilderberg 's only activity is its annual Conference .
At the meetings , no resolutions are proposed , no votes taken , and no policy statements issued .
Since 1954 , fifty - five conferences have been held .
The names of the participants are made available to the press .
Participants are chosen for their experience , their knowledge , and their standing ; all participants attend Bilderberg in a private and not an official capacity . #
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki raised the prospect on Monday of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as part of negotiations over a new security agreement with Washington .
It was the first time the U.S. - backed Shi’ite - led government has floated the idea of a timetable for the removal of American forces from Iraq .
The Bush administration has always opposed such a move , saying it would give militant groups an advantage .
The security deal under negotiation will replace a U.N. mandate for the presence of U.S. troops that expires on December 31 .
“ Today , we are looking at the necessity of terminating the foreign presence on Iraqi lands and restoring full sovereignty , ” Maliki told Arab ambassadors in blunt remarks during an official visit to Abu Dhabi , capital of the United Arab Emirates .
“ One of the two basic topics is either to have a memorandum of understanding for the departure of forces or a memorandum of understanding to set a timetable for the presence of the forces , so that we know ( their presence ) will end in a specific time . ”
Maliki was responding to questions from the ambassadors about the security negotiations with the United States .
The exchange was shown on Iraqiya state television .
U.S. officials in Baghdad had no immediate comment .
Last month Maliki caught Washington off guard when he said talks on the security deal were at a “ dead end ” after he complained Iraq ’s sovereignty was being infringed by U.S. demands .
Both sides later said progress was being made .
Maliki said the Iraqi and U.S. positions had gotten closer , but added “ we cannot talk about reaching an agreement yet ” .
He said foreign forces would need Iraqi permission for many of their activities once the U.N. mandate ended .
“ This means the phenomena of unilateral detention will be over , as well as unilateral operations and immunity , ” he said .
Maliki did not clarify who the immunity referred to .
Officials have said contractors working for the U.S. government would lose immunity from Iraqi law , but Washington is highly unlikely to let the same thing happen to U.S. solders .

MALIKI WOOS ARAB STATES
Maliki , dismissed as weak and ineffective for most of his tenure since taking over as prime minister in May 2006 , has been increasingly assertive in recent months .
He has launched crackdowns on Shi’ite militias and also al Qaeda , with U.S. forces playing a mainly supporting role .
He has also called on Arab states to re-engage with Iraq .
Sunni Arab countries have long been reluctant to extend full legitimacy to the Iraqi government because of the U.S. presence , as well as Baghdad ’s close ties to non-Arab , Shi’ite Iran .
But Arab ties have begun to improve .
The United Arab Emirates has cancelled almost $ 7 billion of debt owed by Baghdad , officials said on Sunday .
And Jordan ’s King Abdullah is expected to visit Baghdad this week , the first Arab leader to do so since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Maliki did not specifically refer to the 150,000 American troops in Iraq , but they comprise the vast bulk of foreign forces in the country .
He indicated the memorandum of understanding would be used instead of the formal Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) being negotiated .
The MoU could be a stop - gap measure given some of the difficulties getting a full SOFA deal in place .
Iraqi officials had said they would submit any SOFA to parliament , where it might be subject to long and bitter debate .
Maliki has long come under pressure from the movement of powerful Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr to set a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces .
Sadr ’s movement quit Maliki ’s government last year when the prime minister refused to do so .
Luwaa Sumaisem , head of the Sadr bloc ’s political committee , welcomed Maliki ’s comments on possibly setting a timetable .
“ This is a step in the right direction and we are ready to support him in this objective .
We hope Maliki will show seriousness about it , ” Sumaisem said , without saying if the movement might then consider rejoining the government .
Washington and Baghdad are also negotiating a separate long - term agreement on political , economic and security ties .
After five years in Iraq , the Bush administration had set an end - July target for wrapping up the negotiations .
Some Iraqi officials had questioned whether the deadline could be met .

I want to report on a study I recently did to examine how our genetic make up might influence whether or not we become entrepreneurs .
We surveyed 3,454 twins , comprising 870 pairs of identical and 857 pairs of same sex fraternal twin pairs from the Twins UK registry — the national volunteer twin register in the U.K .
We examined whether genetic factors influenced :
( 1 ) starting a new business ;
( 2 ) being an owner - operator of a company ;
( 3 ) engaging in the firm start - up process ; and
( 4 ) self - employment .
We found that between 37 and 42 percent of the difference in the tendency of the people in the sample to engage in entrepreneurship is accounted for by genetic factors .
This much replicated previous work we had done .
But we also looked at a psychological trait of sensation seeking .
People high in sensation seeking have a need for novel experiences , seek out change and approach new situations more positively than other people .
We replicated previous studies that show that a significant part of the difference between people in sensation seeking is influenced by our genetic make - up .
More importantly , we found that between 31 and 46 percent of the portion of the difference in the tendency to engage in entrepreneurship among people in the sample that is influenced by our genes is mediated by sensation seeking .
Although this is just one study and would need to be replicated , the results suggest that one way that genes affect the tendency of people to engage in entrepreneurship is by affecting the distribution of the personality trait of sensation seeking across people .

At press conference on economy , Bush takes chance to blame Democrats Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Asked about $ 4 gas , Bush says , ' I 've heard of it now ' President Bush urged lawmakers on Tuesday to move quickly in putting into force legislation designed to help prop up mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while declaring the nation 's financial system to be " basically sound , " but blaming Democrats in Congress for failing to " follow his example " to allow oil companies to drill off American shores .
" I readily concede it wo n't produce a barrel of oil tomorrow , but it will reverse the psychology , " Bush told a White House news conference .
On Saturday , President Bush tried to pin the blame on Congress for soaring energy prices and said lawmakers need to lift long - standing restrictions on drilling for oil in pristine lands and offshore tracts believed to hold huge reserves of fuel .
" It 's time for members of Congress to address the pain that high gas prices are causing our citizens , " the president said .
" Every extra dollar that American families spend because of high gas prices is one less dollar they can use to put food on the table or send a child to college .
The American people deserve better . "
Bush acknowledged it could take years before opening the Continental Shelf to oil drilling would result in increased U.S. production .
But , he said , at least it would put the nation on the right track toward reducing its reliance on imported oil .
" There is no short term solution , " Bush said .
" The president does n't have a magic wand .
You ca n't just say , ' Low gas . "
Bush said the two troubled mortgage companies play a central role in the nation 's housing - finance system and that government action to help them were not bailouts , since the two would remain shareholder - owned companies .
" I do n't think the government ought to be involved in bailing out companies , " Bush said .
Amid soaring gas prices , the toughest real estate market in decades , falling home prices and financing that 's harder to come by , Bush said : " It 's been a difficult time for many American families . "
But he also said that the nation 's economy continues to grow , if slowly .
Bush said that despite the woes of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the recent government takeover of California bank IndyMac , U.S. depositors should not worry because their deposits are insured by the government up to $ 100,000 " If you 're a depositor , you 're protected by the federal government , " Bush said .
The Bush administration and the Federal Reserve announced an emergency rescue plan Sunday to bolster Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which hold or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion in mortgages - almost half of the nation 's total .
The plan would temporarily increase a long - standing Treasury line of credit that could be provided to either company .
Treasury also said it would , if necessary , buy stock in the companies to make sure they have enough money to operate .
The Fed also announced that it would allow Fannie and Freddie to get loans directly from the Fed - a privilege previously granted only to commercial banks until this March , when the Fed extended the borrowing to investment banks to deal with the collapse of Bear Stearns .
At the same time , a housing package was heading toward final congressional passage .
It would modernize the Federal Housing Administration and create a new regulator and tighter controls for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It 's this legislation that Bush urged Congress to pass as soon as possible .
" I think the system basically is sound , I truly do , " Bush said .
" I understand there 's a lot of nervousness .
The economy is growing .
Productivity is high .
Trade 's up .
People are working - it's not as good as we 'd like .
And to the extent that we 'll find weakness , we 'll move . "
Asked about his comment earlier this year that he had n't heard of $ 4 gasoline , Bush said : " I 've heard of it now . "
It was Bush 's first full - blown exchange with reporters at the White House since April 29 .
It came amid troubling developments in Afghanistan , where U.S. deaths have exceeded casualties in Iraq over the last two months .
There also is turmoil in the financial markets , and the government has been forced to throw a lifeline to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Bush opened with a statement about steps to help stabilize the housing and financial markets and his lifting of the executive ban on offshore oil drilling .
He 'll also call on lawmakers to pass long - stalled spending bills .

As current figures state , legal teams are now spending between $ 8,000 and $ 11,000 per lawyer on tech costs .
Knowing what kind of legal tech your team needs to amplify your efforts is essential to staying on budget .
Here are five major tech developments that have completely changed the way that firms work cases .
1. Legal Startups Are Growing
While most people think of tech startups and think of Facebook and Google , where people in hoodies play ping pong , that ’s not the only kind of startup .
Legal startups have propagated thanks to the creativity and variety of services that can be offered with technology .
These startups drive innovation in the legal industry and participate in tech shows .
Startups can gather and manage data in new ways .
They ’re able to handle client responses and communication remotely no matter where the lawyers they work with are located .
This opens up accessibility for clients as well .
The number of clients that can be served by these kinds of startups is growing thanks to the affordability and ease that come with these tech startups .
These startups offer discovery , data management , cybersecurity , and investigative services to keep offices abreast of information as it comes in .
Several great legal IT services have made it easier than ever for legal teams to stay productive .
2. Analytics That is Faster and Smarter
One of the biggest developments in the legal field that ’s changing the way law is practiced comes down to analytics .
Lawyers practicing intellectual property and securities law find that analyzing data quickly and easily is vital to their practices .
Antitrust companies can tap into models and insights never before accessible .
Litigation analytics are now also available to offer information about federal judges and law firms .
It ’s also possible to get judge analytics so that lawyers have an idea of how the entire court system operates to help predict outcomes before heading down the long path of a lawsuit .
We ’re seeing a perspective that ’s never been seen before .
Teams can work with litigation documents , e-discovery collection , and transactional documents , analyzing large volumes of data quickly .
This helps everyone to strategize more and waste less time learning .
3 . The Introduction of IoT
One of the best predictors of what ’s happening in law is often just looking at what ’s happening in large firms .
If they ’re starting to pursue a new practice , it ’s probably worth looking at .
So many firms are now pursuing cases related to IoT .
As more people use objects that collect data , communications and technology issues come together via a legal and regulatory framework .
While groups of practice that were once spread apart at a firm are now huddling together to strategize .
There ’s a whole vast frontier of knowledge yet to be seen .
IoT is a direct consideration of legal matters since IoT is now developing “ intelligent contracts ” .
These contracts are enabled to perform on their own .
Transactions using blockchain technology , smart contracts , and IoT have the potential for breaching all kinds of barriers while teaching firms something along the way .
These tools bring up issues around evidence and discovery in litigation .
IoT devices have already ended up in litigation and we ’re sure to see more examples in the coming years .
4. Case Law Digitized
While it ’s been a slow and manual process , there ’s now finally a majority of case laws that have been made digital .
By surveying this information online , it ’s easier to find court opinions and precedents .
Now that appellate courts across the country now have their information online , better decisions can be made .
Although it ’s been slow going , initiatives have achieved the ability to display this information for free .
With tens of millions of pages of decisions from across all 40 states , Harvard now offers this for free .
The Case Law Access Project has made it easier to research and build a case than ever before .
Scanning is still a challenging and manual process , but over time , whole volumes will be able to be easily searched .
It ’s taken several decades , but soon enough , most case law will be accessible online for free .
5. Avvo Provides Amazing Services
Avvo sent shockwaves throughout the legal profession just a few years ago .
Fixed - fee and limited - scope legal services networked online was only a pipe dream .
However , it ’s now been launched in every state .
With the help of DIY legal forms , individuals no longer need to hire lawyers by the hour to handle many standard domestic and family issues .
Business , real estate , estate planning , and family - related formes are now accessible and easy to fill out .
By leaning on their ability to provide these services via the first amendment , they offer an innovative approach that leverages technology .
New models are certainly needed for delivering legal services and many feel they must deliver that .
With the average client now empowered to handle parts of their legal cases , people may feel more comfortable in the world of law and justice .
This can only yield positive results .
While some lawyers will stand in the way to innovation , these private sector companies are sure to put pressure on more archaic ways of doing things .
Legal Tech Should be a Benefit , Not a Cost
Utilizing legal tech for the overall benefit of your firm requires not only understanding what ’s out there but also understanding your needs .
Make sure to assess your needs and talk to your lawyers and teams before spending your budget on the hottest tech trends .
Be sure to bookmark our page to stay on top of what trends are available as soon as they hit the market .
Munkcy sez , " A dad took his boys to a park and was photographing them as then slid down a slide .
An attendee at the slide asked him to stop , he protested , other parents also started telling him to stop , with one even accusing him of taking pictures of children to put on the internet .
And here 's the truly fun part : he , the accused , got two cops who backed up his claim that he was doing nothing wrong . "
He said : ' The children wanted to go on an inflatable slide and I started taking photos of them having a good time .
Moments later the woman running the slide told me to stop .
' When I asked why , she told me I could not take pictures of other people 's children .
I explained I was only interested in taking photos of my own children and pointed out that this was taking place in a public park .
' I showed her the photos I had taken to prove my point .
Then another woman joined in and said her child was also on the slide and did not want me taking pictures of the youngster .
Google quietly released their new charts API late last year .
It was originally an internal project used by their Video and Finance services until they decided to make it public .
Google consistently provides such elegant and effective solutions to common problems .
Their charts API is no exception .
It comes about as close to the Shangri - La of software - as - a - service as we can get right now .
Ruby developers have enjoyed many different charting libraries over the past few years .
Projects like Sparklines , Gruff , and SVG :: Graph definitely got the job done , but many of them also relied on RMagick , thus dooming us to a sleepless , frustrating night spent attempting to install the medieval monster which is ImageMagick .
No longer are we doomed to such futile efforts , however .
What if generating a chart were as easy as constructing a URL ?
No state to track and no nasty XML to pass around .
In the immortal words of a certain Starfleet captain , Google has " made it so " and given us a way to construct charts on the fly through the simplicity of the HTTP protocol :
No additional software to install
Cross - browser compatible
Works on any platform that supports HTTP
Google can serve our charts OR we can download and serve them ourselves
Generous usage policy
Not only is the API a delight to use , but the charts look fantastic too .
For example , a pie chart :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:65,35&chs=150x100
Bar charts are just as easy :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bvg&chs=
200x125&chd=t:80,50,70%7C100,90,50&chco=cc0000,00aa00
A linear chart with a background gradient just means the URL will be a tad longer :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&chd=
s:pqokeYONOMEBAKPOQVTXZdecaZcglprqxuux393ztpoonkegg
jp&chco=FF0000&chls=4.0,3.0,0.0&chxt=x , y&chxl=

x125&chf=c,lg,45 , ffffff,0,76A4FB,0.75%7Cbg, s, EFEFEF
We can even generate color - coded maps :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chco=f5f5f5,ed
f0d4,6c9642,365e24,13390a&chd=s:fSGBDQBQBBAGABCBDAKLCD
GFCLBBEBBEPASDKJBDD9BHHEAACAC&chf=bg,s,eaf7fe&chtm=usa&

HIAIDCTWYUTINILAKTXCOMDMAALMOMNCAOKMIGAAZMTMSSCRIAR&chs=44
0x220&cht=t
The charts can get pretty complex , but the URL is still manageable :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=r&chs=200x200&chd=
s:voJATd9v, MW9BA9&chco=FF0000 , FF9900 &chls=2.0,4.0,0.0|
2.0,4.0,0.0&chxt=x&chxl=0:|0|45|90|135|180|225|270|315&chxr
=0,0.0,360.0&chg=25.0,25.0,4.0,4.0&chm=B,
FF000080,0,1.0,5.0|
B , FF990080,1,1.0,5.0|h,0000FF,0,1.0,4.0|h,3366CC80,0,0.5,5.0|
V,00FF0080,0,1.0,5.0| V,008000,0,5.5,5.0|v,00A000,0,6.5,4
Pretty stuff , is n't it ?
The URL parameters can be hard to decipher without reading the docs , but load time is very snappy and the interface could n't be simpler .
Think of the possibilities here .
Embed the chart in an existing HTML page :
<img src= " http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:65,35&chs=500x200 " />
Use the chart in RHTML or HAML markup :
<%= image_tag " http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:65,35&chs=500x200 " %>
Download the chart as a PNG file :
wget - O chart.png " http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:65,35&chs=500x200
"
If we do n't like the idea of relying on Google 's servers to render our chart , it 's easy enough to transfer the image to our own server .
For example , here 's a simple Capistrano task that grabs the chart and uploads it to the deploy server :
set : chart_url , " http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:65,35&chs=500x200
"
task :update_chart do
`wget - O chart.png #{chart_url}`
put File.read ( " chart.png " ) , " #{deploy_to}/chart.png "
`rm -f chart.png`
end
Basic Parameters
The simplicity of sending a URL to generate a chart is a good thing , but what parameters make up the URL ?
A full API reference is available on Google 's site , but we can build a surprising number of charts using only a few simple parameters .
The base URL for generating a chart is always :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?
There are only three parameters required by Google to construct a chart : the type of chart , the size of the chart , and the data for the chart .
Chart type is specified with the " cht " parameter .
There are literally dozens of different chart types , but the most common are line charts ( " lc " ) , horizontal bar charts ( " bhs " ) and vertical bar charts ( " bvs " ) .
To generate a line chart , our URL would be :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc
We have two parameters missing here : chart size and chart data .
Let 's add those next .
Chart size ( " chs " ) takes the width and height of the chart in integer values .
For example , to make our chart 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&chs=100x50
Finally , let 's add our chart data ( " chd " ) .
There are four different ways of encoding data for Google , but the simplest is text encoding .
To tell Google that we want to use text encoding , we add " t : " as the prefix for our data :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&chs=100x50&chd=t:
Text encoding uses one or more floating point numbers in the range from zero to one hundred .
The closer the number is to one hundred , the higher the value on the chart .
If the values being charted exceed one hundred , we 're responsible for scaling them down to the correct range .
To plot three points on our chart , the URL would be :
The resulting chart looks like this :
With these three parameters in hand , we can generate nearly any chart we would ever need .
What if we want to get fancier , though ?
The API allows for colors , gradients , legends , etc .
There are too many additional options to cover here , but check out the well - written API reference to learn more .
Easy Chart Generation with gchartrb
We 've seen that constructing the URL with basic parameters is straightforward enough , but the code to generate a single chart of moderate complexity is going to violate the DRY principle ( Do n't Repeat Yourself ) .
When we want to generate multiple charts on the same page , the duplicate code will become nightmarish as we copy and paste .
To mitigate this , we start extracting bits and pieces of our code into classes and methods .
Perhaps we 'll have a single method that takes our chart data and parameterizes it for the URL .
A second method could handle picking the right color for the chart based on a pre-defined name .
A third could generate a legend .
What we 're talking about here is a wrapper for Google 's API that gives us a friendly interface .
Fortunately , we do n't have to reinvent the wheel .
Deepak Jois has written just such a wrapper for the API .
His gem , called gchartrb , provides a clean , concise way to generate chart URLs .
The first step to using the gem is installing it :
gem install gchartrb
Now we get to open up our favorite editor and start coding .
This is how we would generate a simple bar chart :
require ' rubygems '
require ' google_chart '
GoogleChart::BarChart.new ( ' 800x200 ' , ' My Chart ' , : vertical ) do |bc|
bc.data ' Trend 1 ' , [ 5,4,3,1,3,5 ] , ' 0000 ff '
bc.data ' Trend 2 ' , [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] , ' ff0000 '
bc.data ' Trend 3 ' , [ 6,5,4,4,5,6 ] , '00ff00 '
puts bc.to_url
end
Executing this code would result in :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chtt=Bar+Chart&cht=
bvg&chs=800x200&chco=0000ff , ff0000,00ff00&chd=s : yoeKey , KU
eoy9,9yooy9&chdl=Trend +1|Trend +2|Trend+3
Note that calls to the data method take a name ( for use in an optional legend ) , an array of data , and a color expressed in hex .
We do n't have to worry about the correct format for these parameters : the library handles that complexity for us .
The size , name , and orientation of the chart ( vertical vs. horizontal ) is given when the BarChart class is instantiated :
BarChart.new ( ' 800x200 ' , ' Bar Chart ' , : vertical )
Again , the correct parameters are generated by the library , saving us the trouble .
Calling to_url gives us the URL for our chart , ready to be embedded in a page .
For a relatively young gem , gchartrb is surprisingly complete .
It supports generation of basic line , pie , and bar charts of course , but also Venn diagrams and scatter plots .
Any of the charts it generates can also be prettified with gradients , backgrounds , fills , stripes , multi-color legends , and more .
Check out the web site for further documentation on what can be done .
Conclusion
Google 's charts API is an amazing tool , and gchartrb makes it even better by providing a clean wrapper around it .
We can now generate charts in our Rails applications without having to natively compile a shred of additional software .
Now that 's cool .
The soldiers and ruling party militiamen herded the people of Rusape to an open field at the back of the local sports club and made their point crystal clear .
" Your vote is your bullet , " a soldier told the terrified crowd .
Everyone knew what he meant .
" They are saying we will die if we do n't vote for Robert Mugabe , that there will be war if we do n't vote for Robert Mugabe , " said a wary young woman holding a small child .
Mugabe says it too in speeches across the land ahead of next week 's run-off presidential election against the man who beat him in the first round , Morgan Tsvangirai .
But the woman was not waiting around to discuss that .
Darkness had fallen in Rusape , a small town in bloodied Manicaland , and she grew alarmed as she realised she might not make it home before the unofficial curfew put in place by the ruling party militia .
Already the Mitsubishi pick - up trucks filled with young men carrying sticks , spears and knives were out on the streets preparing to move door - to - door , beating , and sometimes killing , anyone associated with the opposition .
" They hunt the opposition .
They said they ate human liver and drank urine during the war and so they were prepared for war again , " said the young woman .
The militiamen found Farai Gamba , a ward organiser for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , at the weekend and shot him dead .
The Rusape chairman of a group of Zimbabwean independent election monitors disappeared on Saturday night and his whereabouts are not known .
Many others have been tortured at the local militia base .
The de facto curfew is in place because the ruling Zanu - PF does not want witnesses to the terror that engulfs Zimbabwe at night , and increasingly during the day , as the party seeks to avoid a repeat of three months ago , when Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe , albeit without an outright majority to secure an outright win .
A campaign that began with the tested tactic of beatings has evolved into a full - blown military strategy of abductions and murders of opposition MDC activists and supporters .
More than 100 have been killed and 200 have disappeared .
Thousands more have been beaten so badly they will bear the scars for life .
A number of rapes have also been reported , including of three women who had wooden poles thrust into their vaginas .
But it is not clear at this stage if the attacks are a deliberate part of the terror strategy .
Often the corpses are hidden , but occasionally the killers like to display their handiwork as a warning .
Chokuse Muphango was murdered in Buhera South last week .
His killers put his body on the back of a truck and drove it through town announcing : " We have killed the dog . "
MDC members of parliament , mayors and councillors have been burned out of their homes and terrorised into fleeing .
Hundreds of opposition activists are in jail on trumped up charges of inciting violence after being tortured and dumped at police stations .
Tens of thousands of known opposition supporters have been forced from their homes or had their identity cards destroyed so they can not vote .
The government is also laying the ground for extensive rigging by purging the election process of independent officials , such as teachers , and putting state workers and soldiers in their place .
Anyone who might stand in the way is pursued .
Independent Zimbabwean groups that monitor the polls , campaign for human rights or assist the injured have been driven underground after their offices were raided and leaders arrested .
Foreign aid workers have been banned from rural areas so they cannot witness the violence and intimidation .
Mugabe has said time and again he regards the upcoming vote not as an election but as a continuation of the liberation struggle against western imperialism and its " puppet " , Tsvangirai .
" This country shall not again come under the rule and control of the white man , direct or indirect .
We are masters of our destiny .
Equally , anyone who seeks to undermine our land reform programme , itself the bedrock of our politics from time immemorial , seeks and gets war .
On these two interrelated matters we are very clear .
We are prepared to go to war , " Mugabe told an election rally at the weekend .
The strategy to fight back with violence was agreed by Mugabe 's security cabinet , the Joint Operations Command , of senior military and party officials shortly after Zanu - PF was shocked to lose the first round of elections .
The campaign targeted provinces such as Manicaland , Mashonaland and the Midlands where support for the ruling party was traditionally strong but swung significantly to the opposition as the economy continued to implode under the weight of hyperinflation , mass unemployment and widespread food shortages .
Zanu - PF realised it had no prospect of reversing the economic decline .
Since the first election , inflation has surged to 1.6 m % and the Zimbabwe dollar has fallen from Z$ 50 m to the pound to Z$ 8 bn to the pound .
A teacher typically earns Z$ 40bn a month .
A litre of cooking oil costs Z$ 20bn .
So the ruling party is quashing the opposition 's ability to organise on the ground by driving out local MDC activists and then terrorising ordinary voters .
The MDC fears that it may be working .
The young woman clutching her child in Rusape certainly got the message .
" We are scared .
We are not going to vote .
We just want to live .
Some people are saying they will vote Zanu - PF , " she said .
The MDC 's national election director , Ian Makone , was forced into hiding more than a month ago .
He will meet only after dark - " I work at night .
I never go out during the day " - and at an empty house .
Since Makone went underground his campaign manager , Ken Nyeve , and security guard , Godfrey Kauzani , have been abducted and murdered along with Better Chokururama , the driver for Makone 's wife , Theresa , who is an opposition MP .
" Better 's body was found first .
They found the other two four days later .
They were stabbed with knives and screwdrivers .
Their eyes were gouged out and their faces burned ...
There 's a pattern .
They torture you .
They make you really , really feel the pain before you die , " said Makone .
" They were looking for me .
We had n't told anyone where I went in to hiding , not even our staff .
Maybe if we had told them they could have survived after telling . "
Chokururama had already spent several weeks in hospital after a severe beating after the first election .
" After the election it was clear their strategy was one of retribution .
They made up their minds they were giving in to this violence and started to position themselves in key constituencies , " said Makone .
" Every day there are things that happen that I say , ' what the hell are we doing ? '
I meet people who say , ' people are dying , people are suffering , is it worth doing this ? ' "
In Manicaland , where the vote swung substantially away from Zanu - PF to deliver an MDC victory , the strategy is overseen by the air force chief , Perence Shiri , who strikes terror into the population as the man who led the Fifth Brigade as it killed about 20,000 people during the Matabeleland massacres in the 1980s .
Among those who have fled rural areas of the province to the main town of Mutare are five MDC members of parliament who dare not move around their constituencies or even sleep in their homes .
They include Lynette Karenyi , the MP for Chimanimani West .
" They have put Zanu - PF bases in each and every ward of my constituencies where they are taking people and beating them , " she said .
Karenyi said the pro-Mugabe rallies in her constituency are being led by Shiri and the Matabeleland governor , Tinaye Chigudu .
" Shiri and Chigudu held a meeting where they ordered people to beat MDC supporters .
Afterwards the mob went to beat people and loot houses , " she said .
" They also told the voters to say they do n't know how to read and write when they vote and they need help to vote for Robert Mugabe .
People are now afraid that if they do n't ask for help Zanu - PF will know they voted for the opposition . "
Another of the opposition MPs who fled to Mutare is Prosper Mutseyami .
" They came to my rural home looking for me in the middle of the night three times , " he said .
" They 're picking off all my party workers .
There 's 28 in police custody charged with inciting violence .
They include the ward chairperson , three councillors , the organising secretary . "
He said they were targeting election agents so polling stations would not be monitored and to discourage political activity .
" I 'm being denied permission to hold rallies on the grounds that there 's no police manpower .
The funny part is Zanu - PF are holding rallies daily in my constituency . "
Mutseyami says the forced Zanu - PF meetings are often led by a Major General Bandama .
" He threatens people .
They say the last time you voted you voted wrongly .
If you do n't vote Robert Mugabe we will bring a war , " he said .
An MDC district organiser in Makoni , who did not wish to be named , said that militiamen beat her children to force her to unlock her bedroom door during a late - night raid on her home .
The activist , clearly still shocked by the ordeal , said she was forced into a vehicle , ordered to strip and repeatedly assaulted over the following hours .
" They beat me and shouted : You are a bitch .
They left me at a police station .
They took a bullet and threw it at me .
They said : kiss that bullet .
They meant I was going to die , " she said .
The police threw the woman into a cell after charging her with public violence .
Zanu - PF has also targeted human rights lawyers , forcing them in to hiding or exile .
Chris Ndlovu has defied the threats to represent opposition supporters hauled before the courts in Mutare .
" The numbers are staggering .
In some small places there are more than 100 people in prison .
They are even arresting schoolchildren under 14 .
I have one case of a man of 94 years accused of public violence .
In 16 years as a lawyer I have never witnessed this .
It 's unprecedented , " he said .
" We have the military in rural areas and they target MDC supporters .
They abduct them at night and take them to their bases where they claim to be ' reorienting ' them but where they are just torturing people .
When they are done they dump them at the police station where the police have no choice but to find an excuse to charge them .
So the victim is accused of being the perpetrator of the violence . "
The militia has made a particular point of targeting teachers , who have traditionally acted as neutral election officials .
Some schools have been left so denuded of staff they now barely function .
Felistance Sithole lives in Rusape but dares not return to teach at a school in nearby Makoni South after she was threatened because she was a polling officer in the first election .
" I wo n't do it again .
I 'm afraid .
Most of us are afraid , " she said .
That is what Zanu - PF intended .
In place of teachers and other unreliable elements , next week 's election will be overseen by party functionaries , soldiers and civil servants who owe their jobs to Zanu - PF .
Makone says the violence will have an impact .
" We 're going to lose some of the rural votes .
My estimate is we can afford to lose 200,000 votes in rural areas but we need to make it up in urban votes .
We are going door to door in urban areas and begging for votes .
We are holding secret meetings at night in people 's houses , telling people this is their chance . "
Makone calculates that at least half a million potential MDC supporters did not vote in Zimbabwe 's two main cities , Harare and Bulawayo , in the first round of elections and that they could tip the balance firmly in Tsvangirai 's favour .
Zanu - PF seems to have recognised the same thing and is now targeting Harare 's townships .
In recent days , the ruling party 's militia has hit Epworth , a township on Harare 's eastern flank where Zanu - PF has established five bases and what is euphemistically called an " information centre " where MDC supporters are persuaded to see the error of their ways .
In Hatfield township , the militia burned down an MDC councillor 's house .
He was n't at home .
His wife and seven - year - old son died in the fire .

The New York Times
The legislation is the latest in a series of extraordinary interventions this year by the Bush administration , Congress and the Federal Reserve as they seek to limit shockwaves in the housing sector from rippling across the American economy and the world financial system .
In the process , the central bank and taxpayers have taken on what critics warn are incalculable liabilities and risk .
The bill grants the Treasury Department broad authority to safeguard the nation ’s two mortgage finance giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , potentially by spending tens of billions of dollars in federal money to prevent the collapse of the companies , which own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgages .
To accommodate the rescue plan for the mortgage companies , the bill raises the national debt ceiling to $ 10.6 trillion , an increase of $ 800 billion and the first time that the limit on the government ’s credit card has grown to 14 digits .
This is what the credit crisis is about .
A very large hole in America ’s heart .
The alternative is to allow crashes , and hope the system can survive .
That would be extremely risky , and impossible to control if major crashes snowballed .
The bill includes some unspecified superglue in the form of Treasury authority to spend to fix the torn arteries : ... Analysts , including the Congressional Budget Office , expect less than $ 100 billion of that authority to be used .
The risk to taxpayers is minimal , analysts say , given higher insurance fees that will be charged to recipients of the refinanced loans .
And yet , even that $ 100 billion could seem small compared with the Treasury Department ’s authority to spend unspecified amounts of tax dollars to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if they are in peril of collapse .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , an architect of the rescue plan , said he expected never to use the new authority .
And the Congressional Budget Office predicted that any bailout between now and Dec. 31 , 2009 , when the authority sunsets , would most likely cost $ 25 billion or less , and that there was a better - than - even chance of no cost at all .
To be fair to Congressional critics , there ’s some definite lack of naiveté in their reservations about the package .
The most obvious is the concern that having bankrolled this situation , people will take advantage of it .
Given the dazzling standard of administration of the Iraq contracts , that 's not a totally unfounded bit of skepticism .
“ This bill has moral hazard written all over it , ” Representative Jeff Flake , Republican of Arizona , said during the debate in the House on Wednesday .
“ We are pretending to chain a monster here , and we are , instead , letting that monster loose . ”
Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , voted against the bill even though he had worked on many of its tax provisions .
“ This bill has fallen prey to the special interests on Wall Street and K Street at an unjustifiable expense to taxpayers and homeowners on Main Street , ” he said in a statement .
The legislation , which is 694 pages of pure fun and frolics , has a definite look of being a very large overhaul of existing legislation , and some new backup mechanisms for institutional failures .
Fannie and Freddie have scored a new independent regulator , too .
That ’s an administrative measure which has more than a few hallmarks of someone watching the till .
The earmark approach apparently has n’t gone away , either .
There are quite a few local provisions , including one which is believed to relate to Chrysler .
The choice was to try and walk on water , or get a life boat .
Let ’s hope the life boat does n’t spring any leaks .
People do n’t seem to realize that if companies who are guaranteeing $ 12 trillion worth of mortgages go under , that means the banks and either go under or take massive losses .
Which , of course , means the consumer will take huge hits from all directions .
The credit crunch is no myth .
It ’s there because lenders are scared of a real crash , and with this kind of money involved , it ’d be a huge crash .
Critics have been saying , with justification , and a lot of support from the lucky souls trying to find somewhere to live , that nothing responsible for this unbelievable mess should get a cent of taxpayers money .

In past posts , we ’ve covered how to write a business plan and even how to pitch a professional investor such as a venture capitalist .
However , there is a missing step between those two activities , which an Ecopreneurist reader wrote in to ask about , and that is :
How do you even get an investor to return your call ( or email ) ?
Although this answer is an over - simplification , I ’ll recommend to you : Personal Contact .
A few days ago , a venture capitalist told me that he , with the other three partners in his firm , look at 1100 companies a year .
These people have a lot of other things to do as well , such as attending board meetings of portfolio companies , conducting detailed due diligence for the few firms they choose to seriously consider for investment , speaking on panels at conferences , etc .
If you send an email to someone who gets hundreds of emails a day , you really need to stand out .
Ideally , your subject line would say , “ Referral from X . ”
Making it Personal
Keep in mind that investors in early - staged companies are investing in people .
Before it is really up and running , a Company does n’t have much value .
Ideas are a dime a dozen .
The value is built by executing on a vision and creating a brand , a customer base , a strong team , revenue streams , etc .
It is as important to be seen as a trustworthy , capable person as it is to have your business idea be judged as sound .
You ’ll have a higher rate of responses from potential investors , if you make use of introductions .
Go After “ the Right ” Investors
Keep in mind that many investors focus on companies in their geographic area , particularly if they are investing in very early - stage companies .
You might have better luck getting meetings with wealthy individuals in your area that in getting a response from a venture capital firm in Boston or Silicon Valley , if you do n’t live in those areas .
Investors like to specialize in industries and invest in a business area they understand very well .
Be sure to research an investment firm ’s or individual ’s past investments to be sure there is a good fit with your business .
Build Your Network
What if you do n’t know investors ( or people who know investors ) in your area ?
Get out there and network .
Go to events sponsored by entrepreneurs clubs , investors or your chamber of commerce .
If you live near a university , there are likely to be numerous potential networking events on campus .
And if you do not find enough events , start your own .
Find a speaker , such as a successful local entrepreneur , perhaps paired with his or her early investors .
You are likely to attract just the type of network you need to meet .
Even easier–use LinkedIn and other social networking websites .
See who knows whom you ’d like to meet and ask for an introduction .
Any introduction–no matter how loose the connection — can help .
As long as you have a compelling reason why the connection is a potentially great fit and are prepared to graciously accept a “ no ” , you should ask almost anyone you are acquainted with to make an introduction .
Good news , a study coming out of the Stanford Graduate School of Business says , “ Ask and You are Likely to Get Help ” .
Powerful One Paragraph
Some investment groups provide submission forms on their website for entrepreneurs who are seeking funding to submit a request for review , and they do look at all of the submissions .
In a situation like this , an introduction is not as important , and you can move right to a focus on WHAT to say about your company or idea in just a few words .
And , regardless of whether you are using a formal review process or are introduced to a potential investor , you do need a very powerful and succinct description of your business .
However , that will have to wait for a post next week .

He was the most plodding , the most robotic , and – until this week – apparently the most loyal of presidential spokesmen .
But now Scott McClellan , White House press secretary for George Bush between 2003 and 2006 , has delivered the most wounding critique yet of this unhappy administration by one of its erstwhile senior officials .
What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception is no falsely touted insider memoir , jazzed up with a few titillating anecdotes to boost sales .
It is a 341 - page disquisition on Mr Bush , on his misbegotten war in Iraq , and on his entire conduct of the presidency , which Mr McClellan says was built on the use of propaganda , and on the technique of government as permanent campaign .
" History appears poised to confirm , " he writes in arguably the most damning paragraph of a book full of them , " that the decision to invade Iraq was a serious strategic blunder .
No one , including me , can know with absolute certainty how the war will be viewed decades from now ...
What I do know is that war should only be waged when necessary , and the Iraq war was not necessary . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And those are not the words of a disgruntled outsider , summoned to the colours and then casually tossed aside .
Mr McClellan largely owes his career to Mr Bush .
He was spokesman for Mr Bush and part of the " Texas Mafia " along with the likes of Karl Rove and Karen Hughes .
A man with deep political connections in the Texan capital , Austin , Mr McClellan first worked for then governor Bush in early 1999 .
He was travelling press secretary for the Bush - Cheney campaign in 2000 before becoming chief deputy White House spokesman in the first Bush term .
In July 2003 , he took over from Ari Fleischer , and served as press secretary for almost three years .
It was a wretched period .
True , his boss did win a narrow re-election in 2004 but , thereafter , it was downhill all the way .
The draining CIA leak affair ( in which Mr McClellan claims he was misled by both Mr Rove , Mr Bush 's closest adviser , and by Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice - President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff who was ultimately convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice ) was followed by Hurricane Katrina and the administration 's disastrously botched response , and by ever growing public disenchantment with the war .
By the time Mr McClellan was eased out in April 2006 , Mr Bush had become one of the most unpopular US presidents of recent times , and has remained so ever since .
In its own words , What Happened is a chronicle of " how the presidency of George W Bush veered terribly off course " .
Its longer term impact may be limited , by dint of the fact that the Bush presidency has sunk so low that it can hardly fall further .
Mr McClellan's " revelations " moreover merely confirm what all but the most blinkered supporters of the 43rd President have long since realised .
But the immediate reaction of the Bush camp has been predictably bitter .
Officially , the White House brushes off the book .
Unofficially however , the President 's men are vitriolic , claiming he did not know what was going on but has turned upon his former boss to boost his book royalties .
" It shows how out of the loop he was , " Mr Rove , the man once known as " Bush 's Brain " , said on Fox News where he is now a commentator .
" This does n't sound like Scott , it sounds like a left - wing blogger .
I do n't remember him speaking up [ about the concerns laid out in the book ] at the time . "
In fact , Mr McClellan 's portrait of the President – a man he says he still respects and admires – is far more nuanced .
Which of course only makes it more telling .
Mr Bush comes across in now familiar guise , as a skilled politician , possessed of charm and an engaging wit , who is , " plenty smart enough to be President " .
On the other hand , he is utterly incurious and uninquisitive on policy matters , preferring to rely on gut instinct than a detailed sifting of the arguments .
For the 43rd President , a decision once taken is always right .
The approach reflects not only Mr Bush 's ingrained stubbornness but his ability to deceive not only others , but also himself .
Mr McClellan offers as illustration a moment on the campaign trail in 1999 , when he heard the governor / candidate talking on the phone to a friend about reports that he had used cocaine in his youth .
Apparently , Mr Bush remarked that ... " the media wo n't let go of these ridiculous cocaine rumours .
The truth is I honestly do n't remember whether I tried it or not .
We had some pretty wild parties back then , and I just do n't remember . "

In 2000 voters – battle - hardened by having to confront Bill Clinton 's marijuana use ( " I did not inhale " ) and explain to their curious children the finer points of the Monica Lewinsky affair – did not seem greatly bothered .
They assumed Mr Bush might indeed have indulged in cocaine , just as he had indulged in the bottle which he had emphatically given up .
But Mr McClellan drew a different lesson from the episode .
" I remember thinking to myself , how can that be ? " he writes .
" How can someone simply not remember whether or not they used an illegal substance like cocaine ?
It did n't make a lot of sense . "
On the other hand , Mr Bush was n't , " the kind of person to flat - out lie . "
So , Mc McClellan concludes , " I think he meant what he said in that conversation about cocaine ...
I felt I was witnessing Bush convincing himself to believe something that was not true , and that , deep down , he knew was not true .
And his reason for doing so is fairly obvious – political convenience . "
And thus , by implication at least , it was with Iraq and Saddam Hussein 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction .
What Happened may throw new light on the enduring mystery of the war : why exactly did Mr Bush decide to invade a country that even he knew had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks that triggered his " war on terror ? "
In a 2003 interview with Vanity Fair , Paul Wolfowitz , then Deputy Secretary of Defence and intellectual architect of the war , gave a hint when he suggested that WMD were only one reason for the invasion – " something everyone could agree on " .
Mr McClellan goes significantly further .
The administration 's real motive for war , he declares , was the neoconservative dream of creating a democratic Iraq that would pave the way for an enduring peace in the region .
But the White House had to sell the war as necessary because of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
They accordingly took a different tack , not of " out - and - out deception " , but of " shading the truth " .
This was achieved by " innuendo and implication " , and by " intentionally ignoring intelligence to the contrary " .
But , one might ask , what else is new ?
An identical conclusion after all was reached as early as the summer of 2002 , in the celebrated Downing Street memo in which British officials just back from a visit to Washington said US intelligence was being shaped to fit a decision to go to war .
It is , however , astounding to hear this critique from the man who spent the best part of three years doggedly defending the war and its consequences from a press corps that ( as he writes in the book ) had given the administration far too easy a ride in the run-up to the war – and was bent on making up for that omission when Mr McClellan succeeded Ari Fleischer as press secretary in summer 2003 , when no WMD had been found , and it was all but certain none would be .
Even more astounding is his assertion that , contrary to everything the President continues to insist ( aided no doubt by that talent for self - deception )
Mr Bush would take his war back if he could .
" I know the President pretty well , " Mr McClellan writes .
" If he had been given a crystal ball in which he could have foreseen the cost of war , more than 4,000 American troops killed , 30,000 injured , and tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis dead , he would never have made the decision to invade , whatever he says or feels he has to say publicly today . "
Blame does not belong with Mr Bush alone .
What Happened delivers tough criticism of the President 's once vaunted national security team .
One member of it of course was Dick Cheney , referred to by Mr McClellan as " the magic man " who somehow " always seemed to get his way " on every issue that mattered to him , be it the war , boosting the executive power of the presidency , or the harsh treatment of detainees .
Even more damning is his verdict on Condoleezza Rice , national security adviser in the run-up to the invasion .
Her main talent , Mr McClellan suggests , was a Teflon quality .
Whatever went wrong , " she was somehow able to keep her hands clean , " even when the problems related to areas for which she was responsible , such as the WMD rationale for war ( including the infamous " 16 words " in the 2003 State of the Union address about Saddam seeking uranium in Africa , that led to the CIA / Valerie Plame affair ) and the planning for post - war occupation .
History , he predicts , will not be kind to Ms Rice .
But " she knew well how to adapt to potential trouble , dismiss brooding problems and always come out looking like a star " .
That is more than could be said for Mr McClellan himself , with his consistently gloomy demeanour and lack of the eloquence or sense of humour required to extricate himself from tight corners in the press room .
Rarely did he come out looking like a star .
Equally rarely however did he look like a man secretly thirsting for revenge , even when he was replaced in spring 2006 by the conservative broadcaster Tony Snow ( who , whatever else , was never lost for words ) .
Today Mr McClellan has found his words , in print .
He professes still to like and admire his old boss .
To which Mr Bush can only conclude , with friends like this , who needs enemies ?
