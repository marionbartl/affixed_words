Sony has announced that a new firmware upgrade for the PlayStation 3 , to be released on April 1st , will remove the " Install Other OS " option from all versions of the console .
The announcement in the company blog cites " security concerns " as the reason for the removal .
The " Install Other OS " option allows users to install Linux on the Sony console , a capability which Sony did not support on the new " Slim " version of the PS3 , released in August 2009 .
At the time Sony explained that adding the feature to the " Slim " PS3 would have added to development and support costs , but assured developers that the feature would not be removed from previous models of the PlayStation 3 .
The ability to install Linux had allowed some groups to sell clusters of the games console and run software which made use of the Cell processor for computation .
PS3 clusters have been used , for example , for cracking cryptography .
Linux and other operating systems on the PlayStation 3 run within a managed hypervisor which limits access to the physical hardware to prevent hackers from tampering with the console 's content protection features .
Although Sony do not specify the precise reasons for the removal of the other OS feature
It is possible that the company has found , or been made aware of , vulnerabilities in the hypervisor implementation that allow the content protection to be compromised .

Anti-abortion billboards that say ' Black children are an endangered species ' are causing controversy in the American state of Georgia .
' Georgia Right to Life ' launched the campaign to try and persuade black women not to have abortions .
The organisation says nearly 40 % of all black women 's pregnancies end in abortion , more than three times the rate of white women .
Some black activists are making historical comparisons between abortion and slavery , and talking of ethnic cleansing and " womb - lynching . "
They also accuse the pro-choice Planned Parenthood organisation of supporting selective breeding to control black people .
Supporters of a woman 's right to abortion say the real issue is not racism but poverty and poor education among black women .
The BBC's Lawrence Pollard heard from Loretta Ross , of the pro-choice SisterSong Collective , and Dr Alveda King , anti-abortion campaigner and niece of Dr Martin Luther King .

America ’s first intelligence operation known as the Culper Ring was established by George Washington during the Revolutionary War and its most famous member Nathan Hale was one of four graduates of Yale University in the Culper Ring beginning a long standing relationship between Yale and the Intelligence Community that continues on to this day .
A statue of Nathan Hale stands outside of the CIA Headquarters at Langley Virginia .
Samuel Russell founded Russell and Company in 1823 principally to smuggle Turkish Opium into China to feed that nations growing addiction .
In 1830 Russell and Company merged with the Perkins syndicate in Boston and began to smuggle opium into America as well .
Many of the wealthiest European and American families including the Rothschild Family and the English Monarchs made fortunes in the Opium trade and many of America ’s most influential families have their original wealth rooted in the trade .
Warren Delano , Jr. , grandfather of Franklin Roosevelt was Chief of Operations inside China for Russell and Company .
To give you an idea how much influence the Opium Trade and the wealth it generated had on America through other Russell and Company partners consider that Abiel Low financed the construction of Columbia University while John Cleve Green financed the founding of Princeton University .
Joseph Coolidge ’s son would organize the United Fruit Company that would come to practically rule entire nations throughout Latin America , and his grandson Archibald C. Coolidge was a co-founder along with Rockefeller of the infamous Council on Foreign Relations whose plans and members have been a heavy part of every U.S. Presidential Administration since the 1920’s .
Even the Forbes family of Forbes Magazine fame owes it original fortune to Russell and Company .
Samuel Russell ’s cousin William went to Germany to study from 1831 - 1832 where he picked up some very radical ideas from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel whose philosophies espoused the notion that the state is absolute reason and a citizen is only free by worshipping the state and absolute obedience to the state .
Hegel believed that the State has supreme right against the individual and the individuals primary duty is to be a member of the state and worship it and give their obedience to it .
When William Russell got back to the United States he was shocked to find that an anti-Masonic backlash had been sweeping the land and that Masons were leaving their lodges in droves after a high profile murder case of a Mason by other Masons for betraying Masonic Secrets led to a whole examination of Secret Societies and the role the Masons had played in the nation ’s founding .
Many Americans were unhappy with some of the financial settlements and obligations concluded with England and Europe after the War of 1812 as well as many from the Revolution of 1776 .
Popular opinion was that the Masonic Founders of the nation had made deals with European Powers that were good for them and their posterity but bad for the nation and the citizens who had to pay for them .
The notion of secret societies suddenly became repugnant to Americans and this went beyond the Masons and extended to the fraternities at America ’s universities .
So William Russell cofounded with Alphonso
Taft the only other Chapter of The Order of Scull and Bones besides the original chapter in Germany , later the name was changed to The Order of Skull and Bones 322 .
Each year 15 juniors are ‘ tapped ’ at Yale by senior members of Skull and Bones .
Unlike most fraternities known for their wild keg parties the Skull and Bones is geared towards ensuring success for its members throughout life .
Many end up in high Government positions with several having become President of the United States , several others have been Defense Secretaries and other top Cabinet level positions with others taking key positions in Media and Banking .
Sworn to secrecy no ‘ bones man ’ has ever divulged the order ’s secrets to an outsider .
One of those secrets is of course the meaning of 322 .
Many believe it revolves around pagan rituals but I for one believe it has a far more secret meeting .
Julius Gaius Caesar who legend says was assassinated on the floor of the Roman Senate did not in fact die .
His nephew Octavian later known as Augustus Caesar and Lepidus secreted him out of Rome while Mark Anthony held a mock funeral using another man ’s shrouded body , to fool the assassins and whip up public fervor and backlash against them .
Caesar lay near death unconscious for 7 days following the attack and reopened his eyes for the first time on March 22 .
322 .
Anthony , Octavian and Lepidus would go on to rule Rome through the Second Triumvirate for the next 13 years with Caesar guiding them behind the scenes while writing out his plans to conquer the entire world and install a one world government .
A plan that is still much being followed today with the Vatican as a front and secret societies like the Skull & Bones playing a role in making sure that world events mimic the biblical prophecy that Christians believe will usher in a one world government .
This is the dark secret of the Skull & Bones tasked with gaining influential leadership positions in our society and compromising the foundations of the nation to subvert it ’s will towards a globalist one world government agenda where the State rules supreme as Hegel envisioned .
Here are but a sampling of names from the Skull and Bones roster , Harriman , Whitney , Taft , Jay , Bundy , Rockefeller , Goodyear , Pillsbury , Kellogg , Vanderbilt and Bush and many , many more .
The power wealth and influence of Skull & Bones members is indisputable and practically legendary .
William Russell ’s grandson was William Howard Taft the only man to ever be President of the United States and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
Yet as deep and dark and potentially sinister as this ultra secret , secret society full of the nation ’s most powerful and richest families is , let us get back to Healthcare .
The Russell ’s and many of these families partnered in Russell and Company owed their fortunes and their continued fortunes to Opium smuggling .
Now while we think of Opium Dens , and people smoking Opium , and Heroin and Junkies the Russell ’s and other Bones Men saw a new way to develop a market for their narcotics that went well beyond just addiction .
Enter Daniel Gilman from the Yale class of 49 .
Gilman like Russell went to Germany to study philosophy and upon his return he incorporated the Skull and Bones 322 as the Russell Trust in 1856 where he served as Treasurer and William Russell as President .
They would spend the better part of the next two decades consolidating the order and getting it off the ground and then they set their eyes on a new venture .
Expanding the opium market in America by developing a medical industry in America that would use their drugs for the alleviation of pain and suffering !
Gilman then went on to help found and become the first President of John Hopkins Hospital and Medical University the first of it ’s kind in the United States and still the preeminent Medical institution in America today .
All to expand the market for narcotics , in fact through other Bones Men and the Universities they would found and endow the literally created the Medical Industry to be an outlet for narcotics .
Big Pharmaceuticals is big for a reason and that ’s because these men began thinking hundreds of years ago how to create a market , and grow a market and sustain a market for one of the most lucrative cash cows ever made … narcotics .
Yet the Skull and Bones 322 is n’t just about getting its members into powerful positions and generating wealth .
It is about Hegel ’s philosophy of the State becoming all powerful and citizens worshiping it and serving it as their primary duty .
The Chairman of the Board of Russell Trust also sits on the Board ’s today of John Hopkins , Citi Group , Chase and JP Morgan all companies who have received combined hundreds of billions of TARP bailout money .
The Government and the biggest corporations are becoming one , one of the last lucrative areas of the economy where Americans are still finding work and decent economic opportunities is Healthcare .
Healthcare being now taken over by the state but still enriching big pharmaceuticals !
The State that the Skull and Bones 322 would like you to worship and give your every allegiance to .
The State that was celebrating this Monday on 3/22 the passage of the Healthcare Bill making it mandatory for every American to have and pay for insurance so they can always afford to pay for Big Pharmaceuticals .
Think these powerful and super wealthy and influential families and Bones Men having nothing to do with it ?
Do you think that they are doing it for your benefit or that it will work out to be to anyone ’s benefit but theirs and the State ?
Guess again …322 !

The current moral authority for all Catholics personally put the interests of the hierarchy above the welfare of vulnerable children .
He heard a case of a priest forcing an eleven - year - old to perform oral sex on him , and he did not take that priest to the police , as he should have , or removed him from his duties immediately .
He sent him to therapy and allowed him to continue molesting children in future parishes , and never informed the parents of the priest 's past .
Would you have done that ?
Would anyone you know have done that ?
Would anyone you know who had done that be able to sleep at night ?
I do n't know of many things I find as repugnant as knowingly putting the interests of an institution 's public relations before children 's protection from molestation .
Yet this is the Pope we have .
This is the moral judgment he made .
How can anyone retain confidence in that figurehead ?
How can any orthodox Catholic not find this repugnant ?
And what has the Pope done since this has been revealed ?
He has said nothing , and put out a p.r. campaign to accuse critics in Germany of being anti-Catholic .
In Mexico and beyond .
the last Pope and this allowed a serial molester and cult - leader , Marcial Maciel , continue his predatory habits for decades , and postponed any serious investigation until it was too late .
His theoconservative allies in America defended Maciel for years .
Late theocon - in- chief , Richard John Neuhaus , attacked those investigating the abuse allegations and declared that it was " a moral certainty " that Maciel was innocent of all charges .
Now , in Brazil , another dam is breaking .
This new story beggars belief :
Brazilian authorities are investigating three priests accused of sexually abusing altar boys after a video allegedly showing one case of abuse was broadcast on television , police and church officials said Tuesday .
The case came to light after the SBT network aired a video purportedly showing an 82 - year - old priest having sex with a 19 - year - old altar boy who worked for him for four years .
Other young men appeared on the report saying that they , too , had been abused by Monsignor Luiz Marques Barbosa .
Also under investigation are Monsignor Raimundo Gomes , 52 , and Father Edilson Duarte , 43 , for allegedly having sexual relations with boys and young men ...
In its report last week , SBT showed footage of a man who looks like Barbosa having sex with the 19 - year - old .
It said the footage was secretly filmed in January 2009 by a 21 - year - old man who charges Barbosa had abused him since age 12 .
But here 's what remains staggering :
An SBT reporter visited Barbosa 's house to conduct an interview and confront him with the allegations .
Before raising the allegations of sexual abuse , the reporter asks if the priest had ever sinned .
" Who has never committed a sin ? " Barbosa responds .
The priest is then asked if the region has problems with pedophilia .
" I think it is more ( a problem ) of homosexuality than pedophilia , " Barbosa says .
Asked directly if he ever abused boys , Barbosa says he could only answer such a question " in confession . "
How much more do we have to see , how much more damage has to be done to human beings , before the hierarchy cones to terms with its denial about homosexuality , its warped psyche on sexuality , the brutal consequences of its celibacy requirements ... and the total iniquity of allowing children and teens in your care , entrusted to men of God , to be raped and abused and molested with impunity for years ?
When will this Pope step down ?

OBESITY kills , everyone knows that .
But is it possible that we ’ve been looking at the problem in the wrong way ?
It seems getting fatter may be part of your body ’s defence against the worst effects of unhealthy eating , rather than their direct cause .
This curious insight comes at the same time as several studies distancing obesity itself from a host of diseases it has long been blamed for , including heart disease and diabetes .
Instead , these studies point the finger at excess fat in …
It 's easy to forget what a snow - starved winter we also had in New England two years ago ... until this happened .
The end of February , 2010 saw as much as five feet of snow blanket New England , and with snow for northern New England in the forecast for this weekend , it 's hard not to dream that a similar fortune could happen again in the coming weeks .
Remember , March is historically the snowiest month in New England .
Take a look back at what was popularly termed , " Snowmageddon " and keep hope alive for 2012 .
I 'm at a meeting for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species , where government delegates are voting on whether to protect endangered species from excessive international trade .
These happen every two or three years .
In the good old days , delegates ' votes were collected on little pieces of paper and counted .
It was time - consuming , as delegates might be called upon to vote on many issues a day for a two - week meeting .
Technology , thankfully , has intervened , in the form of a nifty electronic voting system .
Each member country inserts its voting card into the machine and presses " 2 " for yes , " 3 " for no and " 4 " to abstain .
In thirty seconds the job is done .
What could be simpler ?
A lot , it seems .
This year , about 137 countries are represented .
Yesterday , during a vote on protection for a shark called the porbeagle ( Lamna nasus ) the electronic voting system seized up , and two nations complained the voting machine had just " flashed red " .
So the chair ordered the technicians to reset the system .
Before a new vote on the porbeagle , a test was ordered .
" Could everyone please vote ' Yes ' now ? " he said .
After thirty seconds the chair said he had received votes from everyone in the room , and that the system was working .
He then observed dryly that of the 137 nations that had been supposed to vote ' Yes ' , seven had voted ' No ' and two had voted to abstain .
The technology may work perfectly .
Humans , it appears , do not .
But the imperfect " Yes " vote gave us some idea of the error level with the voting system at these meetings .
When a species such as the hammerhead shark ( Sphyrna lewini ) fails to by a handful of votes to reach protection from trade , might this be down to fumble fingers ?
Today another test was conducted and this time the delegates did a little better .
They were asked to answer a question .
" Is Doha the capital of Qatar ? " asked the chair .
All nations except Cameroon , Croatia and China managed to vote " Yes " .
One voted " No " , and two abstained .
The slightly frustrated chair decided a third test was necessary , and everyone was just ordered to vote " Yes " .
This time Nigeria and Azerbaijan managed to abstain .
After some kerfuffle a technician confirmed that both countries had simply pressed the wrong button .
The lesson from all this is that electronic voting systems can only be as accurate as the humans that operate them .
Often , at two - week international conferences , these humans are bored , full or hung over .
That means it is important to have a good idea of the voting error , which may need to be tested on several occasions .
If one cannot design an idiot - proof system , then counting the number of idiots using the system is surely the next best thing .
( The photograph of a rather unprotected porbeagle is from pfig on Flickr . )
Someone has uploaded a PDF to a Google Group that is claimed to be the proposal for Internet copyright enforcement that the USA has put forward for ACTA , the secret copyright treaty whose seventh round of negotiations just concluded in Guadalajara , Mexico .
This reads like it probably is genuine treaty language , and if it is the real US proposal , it is the first time that this material has ever been visible to the public .
According to my source , the US proposal is the current version of the treaty as of the conclusion of the Mexico round .
I 've read it through a few times and it reads a lot like DMCA - plus .
It contains , for example , a duty to technology firms to shut down infringement where they have " actual knowledge " that such is taking place .
This argument was put forward in the Grokster case , and as Fred von Lohmann argued then , this is a potentially deadly burden to place on technology companies : in the offline world Xerox has " actual knowledge " that its technology is routinely used to infringe copyright at Kinko 's outlets around the world — should that create a duty to stop providing sales and service to Kinko's ?
This also includes takedown procedures for trademark infringement , as well as the existing procedures against copyright infringement .
Since trademark infringement is a lot harder for a service provider to adjudicate ( and since things that might be trademark infringement take place every time you do something as innocuous as taking a photo of a street - scene that contains hundreds or thousands of trademarks ) , this sounds like a potential disaster to me .
This calls on all parties to ensure that " third party liability " ( the idea that ISPs , web - hosts , application developers , mobile carriers , universities , apartment buildings , and other " third parties " to infringement are sometimes liable for their users ' copyright infringements ) is on the books in their countries .
It does n't spell out what that liability should be , beyond " knowingly and materially aiding " an infringement — see the Kinko 's point above for why this is potentially deadly .
And , of course , this contains the DMCA 's injunction against breaking digital locks ( that is , circumventing DRM ) , even though this provision has been in international treaties since 1996 and has done nothing to reduce infringement , has never shown itself to be effective in shoring up the power of these technologies to prevent copies , and has introduced enormous anti-competitive effects into the market .
Also buried in a footnote is a provision for forcing ISPs to terminate customers who 've been accused — but not convicted — of copyright infringement ( along with their families and anyone else who happens to share their net connection ) .
There 's plenty more here — and we do n't know what the rest of the treaty reads like , or what the competing drafts said — and I 'm sure that more astute legal scholars than I will be along shortly with their commentary .
Update :
Here 's an IDG report on the leak , with more analysis .

The share of new high - school graduates enrolled in college reached a record high last year , likely reflecting the weak job market they faced .
Some 70.1 % of the 2.9 million new graduates between the ages of 16 and 24 headed to colleges and universities , the Labor Department said Tuesday , based on data from January through October 2009 .
That percentage was a historical high for the data series , which began in 1959 .

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said several Democrats have received threats of violence in their home districts and he wants leaders within the Republican Party to do something about it .
Hoyer said more than 10 Democrats in the House have reported threats or harassment about their support of health care reform .
He did n’t know for sure how many threats there have been , but the FBI informed party leaders that agents are investigating .

He added that some posters depict a lawmaker ’s face in the crosshairs of a target .
“ I would hope that we would join together jointly and make it very clear that none of us condone this kind of activity , ” Hoyer said .
“ And when we see it , we speak out strongly in opposition to it .
And I would hope that we would do that going forward . ”
He suggested Republicans should do more to ensure threats do n’t occur in the first place by altering their rhetoric .
“ Democracy ca n’t survive unless we can have a civil society in which debate is open and free and unfettered , ” Hoyer said .
He called on Republican leaders to join in condemnation of the threats .
“ Any show of appreciation for such actions encourages such actions and ought not to be done , ” he said .
Democrats will receive extra security following the threats .

House Democrat Tom Perrielo Virginia said in a statement that the FBI is investigating “ a severed gas line ” at his brother ’s home .
A person familiar with the investigation , who asked to remain anonymous , said the line connected a propane - gas tank to an outdoor grill .
House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio , in a Wednesday interview on Fox News , condemned the threats , urging people to vent their anger at Washington by registering voters and volunteering on political campaigns .
“ There are a lot of angry Americans and they ’re angry over this health - care bill , ” Boehner said .
However , he added that “ violence and threats are unacceptable .
It is not the American way . ”

During the weekend debate over health care before its passage Monday , several Democrats received harsh treatment from Tea Party protesters in D.C. , who shouted abusive language like “ ni** er ” and “ fa ** ot ” at prominent leaders , some of whom were famous civil rights leaders .
The Civilization series is probably one of the best that PC Gaming has ever known .
Ask any strategy gamer about it and the odds are that he has played at least one of the Civilization titles during his gaming life time , or at least a Sid Meier ’s title ( Railroad Tycoon , Alpha Centauri , Colonization , Pirates and many more ) .
And really it is no big surprise because Civilization is really what strategy gaming is all about .
Since the game starts till it finishes it is all about making decisions , some minor , others of tremendous importance , these last will dictate if your civilization will thrive or be left dead forever forgotten in the ages .
And why am I writing a Civilization preview in SpaceSector.com you may ask .
Well for starters these are my favorite games ever as for many strategy gamers also .
The game is not Sci - Fi but it does contain a late chapter where Sci -Fi elements do take place .
You see , one of the possible victory conditions of Civilization is to build the “ Spaceship ” that will takes us from this planet and sends us to the stars , more specifically to settle a new home in the Alpha Centauri system ( Sid Meier ’s Alpha Centauri is the continuation of the Civilization series for this reason ) .
Another reason why I ’m writing about it is because the game type is strategy and because it is 4 x ( well in fact one of the fathers of the 4x genre ) .
When I read the Firaxis announcement that they were developing Civilization 5 my heart started to beat faster and my emotions started to rise just to think how wonderful it will be to explore the Civilization world once again .
Evolution of the Civilization series in four pictures
Its remarkable how a game that in concept remained the same over and over , title after title is able to maintain a legion of fanatic fans after all this time .
But what do you do of so extraordinary in Civilization games that people just love so much ?
At game start you pick a nation and begin your humble beginnings with a single city .
Then you start to explore the vicinity .
The next step is to settle new cities and claim resources found nearby .
You construct buildings and train armies .
You conduct research and negotiate deals with your neighbours .
And after dozens and dozens of decisions and many more actions you dazzle of how big your empire has grown and how the simple beginning has turned out to be a strong and vigorous empire ready to rival with all the other empires in the map .
This process makes people feel powerful and important and ultimately if you win you ca n’t help to feel a sense of validation for being able to have taken so many good decisions during the journey .
Playing Civilization is pure problem solving , pure strategy and pure fun and that is why so many people like it so much .
These next 4 pictures illustrate the Civilization series evolution ( click on them to enlarge ) .
Note that although the graphics have been always improving the game remained basically the same .
You have your map , cities , resources and armies and a user interface to help you administer your empire .
But now its time to talk about Civilization 5 .
First an introduction .
The Official Trailer
Or click here if you can not see the trailer above .
So but what ’s new in Civilization 5 ?
Judging from the official Civ 5 website the new Civ installment will provide better graphics , bigger battles , improved diplomacy and improved modability features , among other features .
Better Graphics
One of the things were Civilization has always become better and better is on its presentation .
Civilization 5 will continue this legacy providing us with better looking graphics and a promised even better user interface .
In the picture above we can see the most detailed terrain Civilization has ever offered with diverse vegetation , different water colors for rivers and seas .
It looks promising .
No more squares , the map is now in hexagons
The units now move around the map through hex tiles instead of squares .
This is a nice improvement since the map will look better and cleaner , since now its easier to spot what is effectively connected and what is not .
Besides that there are now 6 movement options instead of previous 8 ( 4 nominal directions + 4 diagonals ) .
Modified combat system and bigger battles
This is probably one of the aspects of Civilization that now will be much different .
In the past the player attacked in stacks of troops , one at a turn .
Remember the famous SoDs ( Stacks of Doom ? ) where you massed up a gigantic army in a single square .
This is no more .
In Civ5 there can not be two units in the same terrain spot so now tactical combat gains a new level since you have to spread your units across the map or battlefield with care .
Melee and Cavalry units should be put upfront in the battle while archers and catapults are probably better placed behind the lines .
Other important features
Among others these are the improvements and features added ( and removed ) by the 5th installment of Civilization that I could gather ( from civfanatics.com ) :
City states added ( sort of like NPCs these are neutral factions that follow their independent agenda )
Civ5 will be more moddable than before
Religion and Espionage were removed ( at least as we know it )
Technology trade removed
Distant troops like archers can attack from distance
Units are no longer destroyed when they loose a battle , more emphasis is put in maintaining them than on creating new ones
Release Date
Civilization 5 is scheduled for release in Fall 2010 .
I do n’t know about you but I know of at least one game I ’ll be playing by the end of this year .
If it comes out this year I mean :)
I wonder if Leonard Nimoy is returning for this one ..
For more information check the official Civilization 5 site , the Firaxis website , 2 K Games or the Civ Fanatics website , the place where Civ fanatics ( like me ) hang out to discuss about Civ .

“ I do n’t care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them , ” General Jabiri said .
“ I know more about this issue than the Americans do .
In fact , I know more about bombs than anyone in the world . ”
He attributed the decrease in bombings in Baghdad since 2007 to the use of the wands at checkpoints .
American military officials credit the surge in American forces , as well as the Awakening movement , in which Iraqi insurgents turned against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , for the decrease .

The sensor device , known as the ADE 651 , from $ 16,500 to $ 60,000 each .
Iraq has bought more than 1,500 of the devices .
Credit ... Johan Spanner for The New York Times
Aqeel al - Turaihi , the inspector general for the Ministry of the Interior , reported that the ministry bought 800 of the devices from a company called ATSC ( UK ) Ltd. for $ 32 million in 2008 , and an unspecified larger quantity for $ 53 million .
Mr. Turaihi said Iraqi officials paid up to $ 60,000 apiece , when the wands could be purchased for as little as $ 18,500 .
He said he had begun an investigation into the no-bid contracts with ATSC .
Jim McCormick , the head of ATSC , based in London , did not return calls for comment .
The Baghdad Operations Command announced Tuesday that it had purchased an additional 100 detection devices , but General Rowe said five to eight bomb - sniffing dogs could be purchased for $ 60,000 , with provable results .
Checking cars with dogs , however , is a slow process , whereas the wands take only a few seconds per vehicle .
“ Can you imagine dogs at all 400 checkpoints in Baghdad ? ” General Jabiri said .
“ The city would be a zoo . ”
Speed is not the only issue .
Colonel Bidlack said , “ When they say they are selling you something that will save your son or daughter on a patrol , they ’ve crossed an insupportable line into moral depravity . ”

Having already made one gigantic miscalculation , the Republicans now seem poised to make another .
Miscalculation No. 1 was to turn the health - care debate into a total zero - sum game , an all - or - nothing battle — the kind of fight that the Bible calls Armageddon , Marxist glee clubs call the Final Conflict , Zapatistas call “ ¡Victoria o muerte ! , ” and Senator Jim DeMint , Republican of South Carolina , calls “ Waterloo . ”
The approach succeeded , but in ironic fashion .
David Frum , a conservative Republican who ca n’t seem to break his atavistic attachment to empirical reality , recalls how it all began :
At the beginning of this process we made a strategic decision : unlike , say , Democrats in 2001 when President Bush proposed his first tax cut , we would make no deal with the administration .
No negotiations , no compromise , nothing .
We were going for all the marbles .
This would be Obama ’s Waterloo — just as healthcare was Clinton ’s in 1994 .
The Republicans stuck to the strategy .
They put on their big sideways hat , tucked their hand into their tunic , puffed out their chest , and marched into battle .
It was Waterloo on the Potomac , all right — only Obama was the one who got to be the Duke of Wellington .
Here ’s Frum , embedded with Napoleon ’s retreating army :
We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat .
Senior military analyst Matt Yglesias points his swagger stick at one of the less - noticed reasons for the rout :
Credit for not buckling goes to Nancy Pelosi and other gutsy leaders .
But it also goes to the GOP .
They would n’t take “ yes ” for an answer when lots of people wanted to surrender and settle for something much smaller .
Instead , whipped up into a frenzy of ideological fanaticism and overconfidence , they decided to take no prisoners .
So nobody surrendered !
And that ’s how Mitch McConnell brought universal health care to America .
Miscalculation No. 2 : the Republicans appear to have decided on a slogan for this fall ’s midterm election .
“ Kill The Bill ! ” having fizzled , they ’re saying they ’ll go with “ Repeal It ! ”
By the end of the day after Waterloo , Senator DeMint had introduced a measure to repeal the bill .
Michael Steele , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , had announced , on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” that the party ’s message for the midterms is “ absolutely ” about repealing the bill .
And Mitt “ Romneycare ” Romney had posted a fatwa denouncing the bill ( “ an unconscionable abuse of power ” ) and its most prominent supporter ( “ President Obama has betrayed his oath to the nation ” ) and concluding with this battle cry :
For these reasons and more , the act should be repealed .
That campaign begins today .
That Frum post explains why this may not be such a hot idea :
No illusions please :
This bill will not be repealed .
Even if Republicans scored a 1994 - style landslide in November , how many votes could we muster to re-open the “ doughnut hole ” and charge seniors more for prescription drugs ?
How many votes to re-allow insurers to rescind policies when they discover a pre-existing condition ?
How many votes to banish 25 - year - olds from their parents ’ insurance coverage ?
And even if the votes were there — would President Obama sign such a repeal ?
Not very likely — about as likely as the Republicans winning a sixty - seven - vote majority in the Senate , which is what they ’d need to override a Presidential veto , and which ( as Yglesias notes ) they are n’t going to have even if , come November , they win every single Senate race in the country .
Of course , that wo n’t matter to them if they ’re convinced that running against health - care reform will win them seats they otherwise would n’t get .
But responsible Washington observers have been responsibly observing for months that it was obviously a terrible mistake for Obama to “ focus ” on health care at a time when “ the American people ” obviously wanted the “ focus ” to be on “ jobs . ”
As we now know , responsible Washington observers were wrong .
But it is probably true that “ jobs ” are the main concern of a great many Americans , especially now that the health - care logjam has been broken .
So for the next seven months the Republicans are going to “ focus ” not on jobs but on … health - care reform ?
And not on doing it but on getting rid of it ?
I do n’t think so .
P.S. One more quote from Frum , where he ’s lamenting the fact that the talk radio , Fox News , and Tea Party crazies have persuaded and bullied Congressional Republican politicians into following them off the cliff :
As anyone who has been following the discussion of EDP will be aware , I am interested in programming , but have until very recently favoured an extremely high - level language called BLOG .
The principle of this language is that you describe in English in a blog post or comment what you want an algorithm to do , after which a probabilistic process operates .
At the end of this process , if you are lucky , your description gets translated into a language that a computer can understand and the algorithm is implemented .
The amazing thing is that one often is lucky .
I believe that BLOG is closely related to a language called GRADSTUDENT that various mathematicians have used in the past .
( My attention was drawn to the latter language on some blog or other , possibly even this one , but I can no longer find the reference . )
[ It has now been supplied to me . ]
However , BLOG and GRADSTUDENT have certain disadvantages .
One is that one does not have complete control over what one is doing .
Another is that one feels slightly guilty using it .
I have recently decided that it is high time I learnt to program in a more traditional language , and last week I went to a short course put on by the Cambridge computer science faculty called “ C for absolute beginners ” .
I ’m sure a significant percentage of people reading that last sentence will react by thinking that C was not the right language to choose , so let me defend the choice .
One reason for it was that that happened to be the course that I could get to .
Another is that C is a very standard language .
And yet another is that I am not necessarily looking at this stage for the perfect language for my needs .
In fact , I do n’t even know quite what my needs are .
Rather , I just want to learn some language , after which it should be easy to adapt to another one ( though I have heard the view expressed that if you learn C then it gets you into bad habits that you have to get out of if you want to get good at an object - oriented language such as C++ ) .
It ’s not quite true to say that I am an absolute beginner , because about thirty years ago I used to be able to write simple programs in BASIC .
In a funny way , that experience has made it harder to get to grips with C and similar languages , because in BASIC you did n’t have to do weird things at the beginning of a program such as writing # include < stdio.h > at the beginning of a program , or defining a function called “ main ” that had nothing to do with what you were trying to do .
( OK , you could argue that main is precisely what you are trying to do , but the fact remains that in BASIC you can just get down to the program without these preliminaries . )
I finally lost my fear of the #include < stdio.h > line when the course instructor said that the “ h ” stands for “ header ” .
I then thought to myself of how I do n’t understand the beginnings of the LaTeX files I write ( because at some stage in the past I copied them from someone else ) and it does n’t matter .
So now I think of that first line as putting some useful stuff at the beginning of the file that I do n’t actually have to think about .
And from what I understand , that is the right way to think of it , at least for a beginner .
In a way , what I most wanted to do was learn how to write , compile and run any program at all .
It seemed to be a big barrier to get the computer to do anything .
And the main thing I ’ve got out of the course is to lose my fear of that barrier .
( Needless to say , it does n’t seem quite such a barrier now that I ’m the other side of it . )
I got back to my office and as a quick test I wrote , without referring to the booklet we were given , a program to input two numbers and output their sum .
And it worked !
Annoyingly , I ca n’t seem to get C to work on my laptop ( a Mac ) .
From the internet I worked out that I needed to download something called Xcode , which I did , but then it would n’t instal because I have OS 5 point something rather than OS 6 point something .
But surely one does n’t need the most up - to - date Mac operating system just to run C. ( Incidentally , before that I tried just tying the commands cc and gcc into a unix terminal , but they were not recognised . )
Another problem I have on a Mac is that it does n’t like me creating files with the extension .c .
None of this is a problem in my office , where I have Linux installed in a straightforward way .
( I know I ’ve got Linux on my Mac too , but as I say , it does n’t seem to come with C as standard . )
I should perhaps add that I ’ve attempted to understand C and C++ in the past , and although I did n’t manage , it was a big help this time round that I had seen at least some of it before .
Here ’s another example of something that seems weirdly complicated to someone brought up on BASIC .
In BASIC , I seem to remember there was a command called “ input ” .
If you were writing a program to add two numbers , it would be something like this ( but I ca n’t remember exactly what it would be ) : print “ What is X ? ” ; input X ; print “ What is Y ? ” ; input Y ; Z := X+Y ; print “ The sum is ” ; print Z . But with C and scanf it feels more complicated somehow .
Perhaps it ’s just the declaration of all the variables and their types that feels complicated , though I think I could get to like heavily typed languages .
I do n’t know where this is going to lead .
It already felt pretty complicated when we learnt about file handling ( things like processing the data from one file and copying it into another ) , and we did n’t get on to how one might plot graphs — so I probably ca n’t yet do anything useful for EDP .
But it ’s a little start , and something I should have done years ago .

' Speedway ' from Vauxhall And I ( 1994 )
The opening lines of ' Speedway ' ( " And when you slam down the hammer , can you see it in your heart ? " ) cannot help but call to mind the Smiths royalties suit , which led to Morrissey being described as " devious , truculent and unreliable " by a high - court judge , narrative ambiguity and personal mythos being apparently somewhat less adorable in a courtroom setting .
' Speedway ' constructs a robust defence , both musical and lyrical , against this heresy - particularly impressive when one considers that the album it comes from , 1994's Vauxhall
And I , actually predates the court case by a good couple of years .
In 1994 , though the singer 's character was not yet officially sub judice , public appreciation of Morrissey 's world - view had recently waned .
Taken to task by biographer Johnny Rogan , whose book , Morrissey and Marr : The Severed Alliance the singer considered outrageously hurtful ( largely , as he later admitted , because it was carefully researched ) , Morrissey responded that he hoped its author " [ met ] his end very soon in an M3 pile - up . "
The glam stomp of Your Arsenal , and its gauche lyrical provocateurism , had won Morrissey a new and unfamiliar audience .
A flag - waving performance of ' National Front Disco ' at Madstock 1992 resulted in unexpectedly close scrutiny from the UK music press , with the NME dedicating pages of editorial to debating Morrissey 's relationship with the far right .
That ' Speedway ' finds Morrissey in defiant form is unsurprising .
What is more interesting is the tack he takes .
He steps away from his habit of denial to construct a more elaborate ruse : confession .
" All of the rumours keeping me grounded - I never said , I never said that they were completely unfounded , " he sings over and over , in a tone increasingly triumphant , punctuated nevertheless by accusations of cruelty against his aggressors .
The growing elation of the lyric is met by glorious performances from Alain White ( whose guitar part here is oddly reminiscent of Bernard Butler 's work with David McAlmont on ' Yes ' ) , and Woodie Taylor on drums , both benefiting from strong treatment by Steve Lillywhite in the producer 's seat .
" And all those lies , written lies , twisted lies : well , they were n't lies , they were n't lies , they were n't lies , " Morrissey exults .
There 's a sense of redemption here that makes it tempting to read this as his long - awaited coming - out song , and it would not be unusual for Morrissey to sidestep censure by equating public denunciation with the politics of the closet ( " I could have dragged you in , guilt by implication , by association , " he argues here ) ; but the tone is too gleefully reminiscent of earlier character work , in particular ' The Last Of The Famous International Playboys ' , to read this as a simple first - person narrative .
Even under pressure , the truth of his intention is unclear .
Trenchantly , syllable by shifting syllable , Morrissey refuses once again to abandon his ambiguity , his own strange way .
Petra Davis
' Hairdresser On Fire ' B - Side to ' Suedehead ( 1988 ) Arguably the finest B - Side of Morrissey ’s career and purportedly penned one grey , bleak afternoon around Moz ' ex-stomping ground in Knightsbridge when he could n't get an appointment at his ‘ preferred salon ’ of choice , so his venting for the rest of the week turned towards ‘ Jason ’ the hairdresser .
It ’s clear that Morrissey once felt he had genuine understanding for his lifeline as one of the only few that understood his “ power ” , whereas now he sits shunned like a jilted and unrequited lover , and the only thing he can possibly entertain is setting him on fire as revenge .
The track 's opening strings paint a picture of decadent London , of Bentleys and Rolls Royce ’s , an opportunistic London …
“ Oh , if only one could get an appointment !
Do these people not realise who I am ... or more precisely how important it is I get this appointment ? ”
The trademark ‘ bells ’ are as instantly recognisable as the Bunnymen - like low - slung bassline found on Viva Hate number ' Everyday Is Like Sunday ' and “ Hairdresser … ” remains one of the best solo Morrissey numbers in history .
Tom Milway
' The Never - Played Symphonies ' B- side to ' Irish Blood , English Heart ' ( 2004 )
With a title like that , it 's rather fitting that ' The Never - Played Symphonies ' did n't land a place on 2004's You Are The Quarry .
Although the lyrics express the dying protagonist 's regret - filled reflections , Moz sounds more alive than ever , his vocals rich as a chocolate gateau made by Scott Walker , and there 's such confidence to his timing , it 's like he 's hung a " do not cover this song " sign on the front gate .
Despite the building sense of resignation – " Black sky in the daytime / And I do n't much mind dying /
When there is nothing left /
To care for / Any more " – it 's a wonderfully triumphant three minutes .
Will Parkhouse
' A Song From Under The Floorboards ' B - Side to ' The Youngest Was The Most Loved ' ( 2006 )
Sometimes a cover selection can say as much as any self - composition about a writer .
Here Morrissey unearths what for many observers was the aesthetic high watermark of Manchester post - punk .
In doing so he was acutely aware of the song ’s primacy but also its legacy ; the culmination of an ethos founded by Richard Boon , Howard Devoto , Linder and the City Fun troublemakers at New Hormones ’ offices in Newton Street .
The aspirant music journalist ( back when he did n’t hold the species in contempt ) would haunt the premises as , in his own words , a ‘ limbless teenager ’ .
" They watched BBC2 , for instance , " he professed , citing them as " much more my type " .
The pillars of the Manchester post - punk scene that New Hormones helped birth had congregated in or around Magazine by late 1979 .
John McGeoch was the finest guitarist of the post - punk generation , Barry Adamson a sublime bass player and Martin Hannett at the height of his powers as a producer .
Much of ‘ Floorboard ’s individual charm was founded on Dave Formula ’s atmospheric , scaffolded keyboard passages dovetailing with McGeoch ’s brittle , skeletal indentures .
Devoto ’s anxious but conversely resigned tone , especially around issues of emotional congress , is hugely anticipatory of much of Morrissey ’s subsequent catalogue .
For once , ‘ most observers ’ had it about right .
So how did Morrissey choose to approach Devoto ’s Dostoevksy - inspired magnum opus ?
Rather faithfully , as it happens .
The change of tense and one particularly arch line - change ( " I know beauty and I know a good thing when I see it " becomes " when I speak it " ) mirror the playful self - consciousness of Devoto ’s original lyric .
Is it as good ?
Well , no frankly .
As a dues - paying homage however , it ’s winningly heartfelt .
Alex Ogg
' The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores ' from You Are The Quarry ( 2004 )
After a seven year self - imposed exile , Morrissey had stored up plenty of bile for the You Are The Quarry album ; his critics were an obvious target , the United States as a country less obvious , and the tirade ( on ' America You Are Not The World ' ) was unfocused and uncharacteristically toothless thanks to the mixed feelings he had about his home .
He got it just right though with ' The World Is Full of Crashing Bores ' , which starts out attacking policemen , taxmen , " uniformed whores " .
Once he 's warmed up by hitting the little man he turns his focus to celebrity , and it's here he really sinks his teeth in .
" More lockjaw pop stars , thicker than pig shit , nothing to convey , " he sneers .
" They 're so scared to show intelligence , it might smear their lovely career . "
Lesser mortals grumble about celebrity culture all the time , but few have the capability of Morrissey , which is kind of what he 's singing about .
Indeed , with a gloriously hooky , anthemic chorus , and with truth on his side , Steven could hardly fail .
Jeremy Allen
' The Lazy Sunbathers ' from Vauxhall And I ( 1994 )
Timelessly topical and aimed at those who choose to live in denial and remain blissfully unaware of the realities of life , ' Lazy Sunbathers ' opulent musical backing and contrasting vivid lyrical matter build towards a gentle climax of falling shells , war fight and eerie delays as if the monolithic apocalypse will flatten us all softly from the skies as the world reclines on its continental First Choice package - deal sun lounger .
In fact the source for the title reportedly stems from a George Formby quote where he once accused contemporary performers of being " lazy sunbathers " for not being more active in their protest and involvements in the war efforts .
A well - documented view shared by Morrissey but also yet another example of his incredulity towards those who carry out any form of ghastly ‘ normal ’ activities , such as “ Thomas Cook- ing it ” .
Tom Milway
' Mexico ' B- side to 12 " of ' The First Of The Gang To Die ' ( 2004 )
On the cool , dark night of September 17 , 2002 , the night our long - lost , much - loved pop hero rose from the dead after five years in exile , this was the song that stood - out from the Royal Albert Hall stage .
' Mexico ' reminded us of the bruised heart of Morrissey ’s best album , 1994 ’s Vauxhall and I , and massaged its pastoral swing and strangely selfless melancholy – not qualities his music is generally known for , but qualities which suit him when he tends to them keenly – slowly back to life .
' Mexico ' is proudly mournful ; gloriously stately ; swirling into being on waves of ghostly guitars .
It tells the story of a fiercely passionate country full of outsiders – a perfect home - from - home for our disaffected boy – then unfurls into a homage to a nation that has always clasped our Northern boy to its bosom .
America is the enemy nearby , simmering with “ rich white men ” who always “ think you ’re so right ” , while the whiff of “ chemical waste ” , and the “ hate of the Lone Star state ” breathes over the borders .
Somehow this does n’t detract from the “ tranquil , cool , lover ’s air ” and the grass we lay our bodies on , crying our hearts out for want of love .
As a song that hurts and hungers , heavy with romance and the weight of loss , it ’s somehow strangely suitable that it is hidden away on the 12 " of a single that bristles and blusters .
Jude Rogers
‘ I Know Very Well How I Got My Name ' B-side to ‘ Suedehead ’ ( 1988 )
The Smiths always stuck some of their best songs on b-sides , perhaps knowing that their fans were the kind who would treasure the buried flip tracks over the “ hits ” anyway , and Morrissey continued this trend with his debut solo release .
‘ Suedehead ’ was great , but this plaintive , confessional ballad , lasting precisely two minutes , is more than its equal .
Music - writing credits go to Stephen Street , but it ’s guitarist Vini Reilly ’s haunting , reverb - drenched playing that enchants , anticipating a partnership that may have laid Marr ’s memory to rest if it had n’t been cut suddenly short after just one album .
A fluffed alternate take , titled ‘ I Know Very Well How I Got My Note Wrong , ’ and credited to Vincent Gerard and Stephen Patrick , was issued as a limited single with Durutti Column ’s 1989 Vini Reilly album ; if anything , up until Vini ’s slip - up , it ’s actually the superior recording , laying bare the gorgeous guitar arpeggios which mix echoes of Davy Graham with The Smiths ’ own ‘ Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want . ’
Mystifyingly , the original was left off the following year ’s Bona Drag round - up of singles and b-sides , and has been overlooked by compilers ever since .
Ben Graham
' The Teachers Are Afraid Of The Pupils ' from Southpaw Grammar ( 1995 )
Dismissed as a " churning , bloated extravagance " in Q Magazine 's round up of 1995 's Albums Of The Year , the 11 - minute - plus ' The Teachers Are Afraid Of The Pupils ' is one of two lengthy songs bookending Morrissey 's fifth album Southpaw Grammar , the other being the less remarkable ' Southpaw ' .
' Teachers ' is remarkable for reasons aside from its length , however ; for starters , a looped sample from Shostakovich 's Fifth Symphony dominates proceedings , a shrill omen of impending doom which perfectly complements the song 's terrifying lyric regarding the chickens - coming - home - to - roost scenario of a schoolteacher who finds his position of privilege and authority under attack from all sides : " Say the wrong word to our children / We 'll have you / Oh yes , we 'll have you . "
The feeling of nausea created between the see- sawing string sample and the paranoid isolation of the lyric is compounded by the somewhat incongruous use of Asian - sounding percussion – perhaps added in sardonic reference to the controversy surrounding ' Bengali In Platforms ' , ' Asian Rut ' and ' National Front Disco ' – while the track 's pattern of elongation and repetition is grimly appropriate , forcing the listener to follow the ill - starred anti-hero all the way down the spiral , to the bitter end .
' Teachers ' is an unforgiving listen , then , made even more so by Morrissey 's refusal to make his position clear .
He seems to be gloating as he intones “ Mucus on your collar / A nail up through the staff chair / A blade in your soap /
And you cry into your pillow , ” but when he moans , “ To be finished would be a relief ” we can detect a hint of empathy for the tormentor - turned - victim .
It 's probable that our narrator finds it impossible to throw his lot in with either side , for as much as ' Teachers ' relates a tragic downfall , it also highlights Morrissey 's ongoing fascination with the powers of terror .
" Nothing shifts or stirs people like a slight underhand threat , " he told Simon Reynolds in 1988 .
Listening to this song , you know exactly - exactly - what he means .
Joseph Stannard
' It ’s Not Your Birthday Anymore ' from Years Of Refusal ( 2009 )
The title may smack of prime Steven Patrick petulance , and the Casio drum machine beat on which its verses rest could easily sound lazy , but something in the peculiar electronic crackle at the start of this song – like a Radiophonic Workshop machine blinking itself back into existence – suggests other things might happen as this track takes us by the hand , and clasps our sweaty palm .
And it does .
This track shows how great Morrissey can be when he departs from the cribsheet of laddish guitars and thuggish drums that have defined so many of his 21st century songs .
A song that talks about the unsentimentality of sex , it is also an exercise in sustained suspense .
In the first verse , gongs fizz at the end of bars , in the second , strings flicker like fireflies , while the guitar fuzz and snares that take us into each chorus itch with anger and lust .
Then come the dirty purrs of woodwind in the middle - eight , giving a regal edge to its narrator ’s unwholesome desires – “ to the love I am now giving to you /
Right here , right now /
On the floor ” – before the song climaxes , rather fittingly .
with one of Morrissey ’s most powerful vocal performances for years .
As it whirls away on a sea of electronic sounds , you wipe your brow and catch your breath .
This , you want to tell Morrissey , my man , is how braggadocio should be done .
Jude Rogers
' Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself ' from Vauxhall And I ( 1994 )
Luxuriant Steve Lillywhite production typifying the overtly blissful Vauxhall And I sound , sees Morrissey performing this cautionary tale of a beleaguered pop star who has been “ stabbed in the back so many , many times ” by everyone from businessmen to journalists .
Who “ JUST SIT THERE ” stating the bleeding obvious .
Nothing new here then !
However , the track was reportedly laid down to tape initially with a much heavier , distorted backing , yet Lillywhite ’s influence in helping to discard this abrasive clatter in favour of subtle multi-layers atop a basic acoustic guitar and upright bass backing , whilst still utilising Moz ’ understated yet silky original vocal performance , make this track a masterful and frequently under - appreciated gem .
Tom Milway
‘ National Front Disco ’ from Your Arsenal ( 1992 )
Supposedly the song that precipitated Moz ’s critical fall from grace , this Mick Ronson - produced glam rush continues to fascinate precisely because of its unsettling ambiguities .
Obviously anachronistic - the title ‘ National Front Disco ’ suggests the seventies , and as far as I know there were no equivalent BNP - sponsored rave parties to be had in 1992 , when the song was released - it never suggests that attending an NF Disco might be a good thing .
Instead , questions are constantly raised in the mind of the alert listener ; not least , did the National Front ever really host discos ?
And if so what dreadful records could they have played , that would uphold their twisted notions of racial purity ?
‘ Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep ’ , perhaps ?
Meanwhile , the tension - release crash and clang of Boorer and Whyte ’s guitars is thrillingly , worryingly anthemic .
Just try not to sing along in public .
Ben Graham
' Asian Rut ' from Kill Uncle ( 1991 )
When I was a kid , Smiths fans were a movement .
The Smiths were the first indie band I ever loved , or even trusted , perhaps most significantly because they had such a diverse fan base .
Smiths fans were not just the uniform , speccy outsiders that now populate the pages of fashion magazines ; we were , in our thousands , working class , queer , Black and Asian kids , young people whose experience of social exclusion was worth more than a gesture , and who found in this band a form of resistance to monoculture .
Just how unusual this was only became clear as indie progressed , as the Britishness it loved to discuss narrowed during the 90s , first constricting and then expelling us .
To one previously immersed in the multiculture of Smiths fandom , tracks such as ' Asian Rut ' , Morrissey 's depiction of a racist attack and its aftermath , came as a shock .
Though the portrayal of the lead character - the ' tooled - up Asian boy ' who seeks to avenge the murder of his friend by a crew of schoolboy fascists - is plausibly sympathetic , the song pays little attention to him , preferring to muse instead on the cruelty of his enemies and the suffering he will experience ( " Oh , they may just impale you on railings " ) .
Some read into the shuddery vocal the beginnings of Morrissey 's fascination with boot - boy culture , later explored to disastrous effect in ' National Front Disco ' ; others pointed out the place of the boot - boy in queer iconography , the ambivalence of desire and the pain of empathy across cultures .
I did n't know what it meant , and for the first time , I did n't care .
The croon Morrissey used to describe this murder , the way the accordion woozed , left me cold , left me behind .
" I 'm just passing through here " , Morrissey sang , " on my way to somewhere civilised , and maybe I 'll even arrive . "
Petra Davis
' Lifeguard Sleeping , Girl Drowning ' from Vauxhall and I ( 1994 )
The World of Morrissey is a strange place to the uninitiated , and few of his songs are stranger than ' Lifeguard Sleeping , Girl Drowning ' , a refreshing departure for an artist who , while inconceivably influential , has often coasted on his standing , regurgitating ideas as if to affirm his status as the Pope of Mope .
He eschews his standard introspective shtick to deliver a narrative , even if it's one which you can probably figure out from the title .
What 's so interesting is the way the track attempts to recreate the sensation of actually drowning .
Not having drowned myself , I am lead to believe that it can be an ethereal , almost womb - like experience , and the bittersweet melancholy is beautifully realised thanks to the production ingenuity of Steve Lillywhite , right down to the claustrophobic , underwater effect on Morrissey 's voice .
It 's a rare and overlooked moment in the canon of the great man , a gorgeous and understated four - minute masterpiece .
Jeremy Allen
' Girl Least Likely To' B-side to ' November Spawned A Monster ' ( 1990 )
One of the most intriguing and significant ‘ lost ’ songs of Morrissey 's solo work , the backing track came courtesy of ex-Smiths bass player Andy Rourke and bears more than a passing similarity to Morrissey and Marr favourites 60 ’s American R&B girl group The Cookies ' and their track , ' Only To Other People ' .
Furthermore , Morrissey sings in a clearly autobiographical nature about himself – although via a female protagonist - about his early days as an aspiring writer grappling with doubt , yearning for vindication and showing the well - documented signs of nearly giving up before Johnny came a - knockin’ .
He sings of living " for the written word [ where ] people come second , or possibly third " and questions “ somebody 's got to make it !...
So why , why can't it be me ? " clearly so heavily reminiscent of early Smiths material that it seems such a shame that he and Rourke were n’t able to expand their collaboration past just a few songs ( one of which was also the fabulous ' Yes I Am Blind ' ) .
Tom Milway
' I ’ve Changed My Plea To Guilty ' B- side ' My Love Life ' ( 1991 )
Sometimes all our boy ’s voice needs is room to breathe and to be .
It was never the greatest technical instrument , even in its glorious youth – as all those wavering notes , and that fabulously out - of - tune coda to Shoplifters Of The World Unite , proved ‘ til kingdom come .
But at its best , left alone , it carries torch songs with perfect vulnerability , and a very special power .
With only a piano bearing its rhythms along , ' I ’ve Changed My Plea To Guilty ' is one of Morrissey ’s finest examples .
Its conceit , like others in so many of his songs , is brutally simple .
Here is a man at the dock , “ standing in the dark / With my innocent hand on my heart ” , but he does n’t want liberty .
He wants confinement .
The outer world is too much ; he wants this inside life instead .
The sentiments come cleanly and clearly , almost wet with tears , and when Morrissey hits the higher notes beautifully – “ this freedom is wasted , on me ” – a sadness glowers and glows , and cleaves the emotions to the bone .
Better technicians could n’t match these effects .
At his very best , as he is here , his “ rules spoil their game ” .
Jude Rogers
‘ Lost ’ B- side to ‘ Roy ’s Keen ’ ( 1997 )
Co-written by drummer Spencer Cobrin , this string - soaked beauty is so vastly superior to its featherweight flop of an A - side it ’s positively embarrassing .
Fans politely turned a blind eye to ‘ Roy ’s Keen ’ , and the resulting surge of indifference carried the single to the lofty heights of number 47 in the nation ’s hit parade .
Only a lucky few discovered the gem beneath the turd , and so the B - side ’s title seemed increasingly , unfortunately appropriate .
Relish , if you get the chance , the multiple ironies of a swaying , scarf - waving anthem to universal dislocation , alienation and pointlessness , going largely unheard ; anomie triumphs as the orchestra surges .
It obviously occurred to someone eventually that a mistake had been made , as on the 2009 re-master of parent album Maladjusted , ‘ Roy ’s Keen ’ mysteriously disappeared from the track listing , while ‘ Lost ’ was added on as a bonus extra , having already featured on Rhino ’s 2001 US Best of .
If only they ’d realised sooner .
Ben Graham
' Late Night , Maudlin Street ' from Viva Hate ( 1988 )
The sense of a secret world , available only to those able to decipher its clues , engenders faith in its faithful just as it engenders doubt in the skeptic .
At the time of Viva Hate 's release , I counted myself very much one of the faithful .
Like its contemporary , Twin Peaks , Viva Hate - Morrissey 's first solo album , and his most tricksy , arcane record by far - made the metaphysical world more real than the physical , and for a dreamy , queer , Catholic adolescent , this was an irresistible tactic .
Now that almost two decades separate me from that embarrassing kid , it 's fitting that my favourite Morrissey song remains one that ostensibly deals with nostalgia .
' Late Night , Maudlin Street ' , Morrissey 's aching seven and a half minute paean to his adolescence in suburban Manchester - " I was born here and I was raised here , and I took some stick here " - begins with the narrator packing up his childhood house alone , haunted by memories of his childhood sweetheart .
If this sounds like uncharacteristically saccharine territory , it probably is .
Morrissey 's habit of constructing his lyrics around a set of allusory Easter eggs is once again in play , casting contradictory and compelling shadows over character , voice and narrative .
Familiarity with queer semiotics , 50s and 60s playwrights , the output of Ealing Studios , and above all Morrissey 's autobiographical mythos , can complicate even the simplest - seeming of his lyrics .
In fact , ' Late Night , Maudlin Street ' is named partly for Bill Naughton 's book of acerbic character studies , Late Night , Watling Street , and partly for the school in Carry On Teacher - hardly the gesture of one bent on sincerity .
For all its chimerical beauty ( due in part to arrangement by Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column , whose glazed guitars are all over this album ) , for all its appeal to lost love and urban decay , ' Late Night , Maudlin Street ' relates the tale of relationship breakup - referring now to the Smiths , now to the separation of Morrissey 's parents , now to Naughton 's characters , now to the loss of Morrissey 's own , never - named sweetheart - in a narrative as fragmentary and impressionistic as Reilly 's guitars , as remote and washed - out as Stephen Street 's treated drums , yet located always in a place so vividly recollected , it hurts .
It 's testament to Morrissey 's talent as a vocalist that the emotion of the song never wavers ; this is one of his finest performances on any record ; but it is his unique ability to construct a believably moving narrative out of disparate cultural signifiers that kept me dreaming then , keeps me dreaming now .
Petra Davis
' Jack The Ripper ( live ) ' from Beethoven Was Deaf ( 1993 ) **
Devilishly delicious live favourite , sounding as big as ' How Soon Is Now ? ' when echoing across auditoria , ' Jack The Ripper ' is yet another enthusiast ’s gem .
Its minor verse fiddles the listener to quick climax by contrasting danger , seedy darkness and the collision with “ my heart ” .
Yet another example of Morrissey ’s continuing fascination for celebrity murderers , the air of ' Jack The Ripper ' - whom is never directly referenced within the lyrical content – is thick with homoerotic risk and fantasy , yet its suavely subtle nature plays to the calculated gentleman traits ‘ Jack ’ was infamous for .
Recorded at haste in the studio , the later live version found on Beethoven Was Deaf recorded at Paris ’ Zenith captures the songs very essence so much better than the former that was released as the B - Side to ' Certain People I Know ' .
Tom Milway
Dmitriy T.M. , Christina W. , Kelly V. , and George asked us to comment on Vajazzling .
Dmitriy , who sent in the video link , said he was too frightened to press play , but I am very brave and now I know what vajazzling really is !
It ’s hard to know because the term “ vajayjay ” is , um , who knows what that word means … and the term “ vagina ” ( which actually refers to what is otherwise known as the birth canal ) is now used to mean the vulva and , apparently , anything within 12 inches of it .
In any case , the video below , in which a woman documents the vajazzling of her “ vagina , ” reveals that the term refers to the placing of a field of tiny crystals where your public hair would be .
So , you essentially replace your pubic hair with shiny objects .
So , brave souls who pressed play , sociologically analyze away .
We must not let corporations stamp out creativity on the net
Copyright is not the only thing that matters online , says Bill Thompson
John
Young is a brave and tenacious man , an architect based in New York whose website , cryptome.org , has been a safe online repository for documents that someone , somewhere does not want published .
Since 1996 he has resisted pressure from governments , companies and individuals , using the strong protection against prior restraint provided by the US Bill of Rights to publish information about secret surveillance , spying , war crimes and many other topics .
Thanks to a robust policy on the part of his current internet service provider , his site has remained online despite the best efforts of those who are embarrassed by its contents .
Until last month , that is , when cryptome.org disappeared from the internet after Network Solutions disabled access to the site 's domain .
Mr Young had not revealed military secrets that put the lives of soldiers at risk , or published the finer details of Britain 's nuclear deterrent capability .
The document that got the site kicked offline was not a detailed map of the presidential escape route from the White House , or a list of the lobbyists who have visited Downing Street in the last year , but a 22 - page document written by Microsoft .
It details how US government agencies can request access to customer data stored on Microsoft servers , like your Hotmail messages , and Microsoft used copyright law to achieve what the US government could not .
The company has since withdrawn its complaint , noting that it only wanted one document removed and was not attempting to restrict access to the whole of Cryptome .
Network Solutions has put it back online - with the offending file still present .
But the fact that laws passed to protect the commercial interests of creators of original content can evidently have more force than national security concerns should make us all pause .
Comic capers Mark Kobayashi-Hillary has fallen foul of copyright rules on YouTube .
John
Young is not the only one in trouble at the moment .
My friend Mark Kobayashi-Hillary had uploaded more than 900 videos to YouTube over the years , most of them related to his specialist area of globalisation and outsourcing , but his account has been removed because of claims that he is infringing copyright .
After some investigation Mark has been told that since he has had three videos removed at the request of rights holders he is a " repeat offender " .
His account was terminated to comply with Federal law after comedian Jimmy Carr 's management company complained of a video he had taken at a recent Carr performance .
YouTube is a US company , so applying US rules seems reasonable , but there has been no legal process and his account was closed without any notice being given to him , so he had no opportunity to question it in advance .
And what tips this particular case over from mere irritation into something worthy of Kafka is that the camera phone clip that got Mark 's account removed showed the audience waiting for Jimmy Carr to appear on stage , and not a second of the comic 's performance .
Yet Chambers Management claims that it holds the copyright in any material filmed inside the venue and so his video is infringing .
I have n't seen Mark 's ticket and it may well be that he has assigned copyright to the company by agreeing to the terms and conditions printed in one - point on the back , but even if this is so the absurdity remains .
Right is might
It seems that copyright , a legal framework developed over 300 years to ensure a balance between the interests of the wider community and those of the creative artist has become so tipped towards those of the " rights holder " that few of us can go through a day without breaking the law in one way or another .
The current debate over the Digital Economy Bill in the UK Parliament has revealed that provisions intended to protect the interests of rights - holders by forcing service providers whose networks are used to download unlicensed content to take preventive measures and face prosecution themselves could well force small businesses , universities and even public libraries to severely limit or even abandon their provision of free net access .
And people around the UK are still receiving letters from the legal firm ACS : Law accusing them of downloading material and asking for money to " settle " any claim without recourse to legal process , causing deep concern to many who feel that they are being unjustly accused and coerced into making payments through fear of a legal process they do not understand .
Elsewhere representatives of many governments , including the UK , are currently discussing the detailed provisions of ACTA , the " Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement " , although the exact details are being kept secret and we have only occasional leaks to go by .
ACTA began as an attempt to control the trade in counterfeit goods , which is laudable when applied to prescription medicines and less defensible when applied to cheap handbags .
Unfortunately it has expanded in scope to cover digital counterfeiting , and intellectual property rights are apparently now central , offering the prospect that the sort of protections embodied in the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act , the provisions that obliged YouTube to pull a video when infringement is merely alleged , would apply worldwide .
We have to say ' enough is enough ' to those who hold copyrights in songs and images and words and videos .
Bill Thompson
This has got to stop .
We have to say " enough is enough " to those who hold copyrights in songs and images and words and videos .
We must refuse to remake the digital world in order to serve only their interests .
There is so much more to online life than watching ripped - off copies of big - budget movies or looking at low - resolution cameraphone videos of bands .
We are on the verge of building so many restrictions into online activity that the creativity , inventiveness and sheer joy of life on the net will be squeezed out just to ensure that over - hyped comedians are able to censor videos of their fans waiting for the show to begin .
This is not the way forward , but if we do not act now then it will shape the internet that we offer to the billions waiting to get online and change the world .
It would be a tragedy if the network the people of East Africa found , now that they have fast fibre links to the rest of the internet , was locked - down , limited and restricted by laws passed to placate fearful Western rights holders and they decided , as a result , that it was n't worth joining .

ATLAS Event Display : A Jet Event at 2.36 TeV
Click on the image to enlarge it
A , B , C : This event display shows three different views of the same collision .
View A shows the ATLAS detector from the side ; view B shows a beams - eye view ; and view C shows the energy deposited in calorimeters .
1. Collision point —
The point at which two protons collided in this event .
2. Direction of the particle beams —
In view A , the proton beams travel horizontally .
In view B , the beams travel into and out of the display through the collision point .
3. Trackers —
Colored lines radiating from the collision point show the passage of a particle that registered in all three tracking detectors , which measure the momentum of charged particles .
Directly above and below the collision point are the pixel detectors ; slightly farther away is the Semiconductor Tracker system ; in purple is the Transition Radiation Tracker .
4. Central Solenoid Magnet —
The Central Solenoid magnet curves the tracks of particles as they pass through the tracking detectors .
5. Liquid argon calorimeter —
This detector measures the energies of particles such as electrons and photons .
6 . Tile calorimeter —
This detector measures the energies of hadrons such as protons and neutrons .
In both calorimeters , yellow dots in views A and B indicate that a particle has left an energy deposit .
In view C , the energy deposits are shown as red ( hadronic ) and green ( electromagnetic ) bars .
Yellow circles in view C indicate the energy deposited by jets .
7. Muon spectrometer —
Yellow dots show deposits of energy by muons in the muon spectrometer .
This detector system is only partially shown in this event display .
8. Jet —
The white circles show how the same jet appears in views A , B and C .
This ATLAS event display shows the production of jets in a proton - proton collision .
Jets — sprays of particles — are an indication of a head - on proton collision .

CMS Event Display : A Candidate Dimuon Event at 2.36 TeV
Click on the image to enlarge it
A , B , C : The event display is divided into different screens to give you different views of the split second when the proton - proton collision occurred .
1. Collision point —
The collision point , or what particle physicists call the interaction point , is where the protons collided in this event .
Collisions occur along the beam line at the center of the detector .
2. Beam line —
The beam line is the path that protons travel along in opposite directions and into collision .
3. Silicon tracker —
The innermost portion of the detector is the silicon tracker , which includes the pixel and silicon strip detectors .
The tracker follows the movement of charged particles point by point ; these are represented by yellow dots .
When we connect the dots we can see the particle track , tracing a particle ’s movement .
4. Calorimeters — Just outside of the tracker are the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters .
When particles strike one or both , they leave an energy deposit .
These deposits are represented by the bars just outside of the tracker data .
The height of the bar corresponds to the amount of energy deposited .
5. Muon chambers —
The third and outermost component of the detector are muon chambers .
The chambers are visible as red and blue blocks on screen B , and the chambers through which a particle has passed have been highlighted .
Screen C shows only those chambers through which a muon has passed .
6. Muons —
The path of the muons can be followed in red from the point of the collision through the tracker and calorimeters to the muon chambers .
A detailed explanation can be found here :
http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2010/03/16/cms-event-display-decoded/
This event display illustrates the production of two muons in a proton - proton collision .
The paths of the muons are shown by the thin red lines on each screen .
The muons left signals that were reconstructed into tracks in the silicon tracker , deposited a little energy in the calorimeters , and passed through the muon chambers .

History of Vedic Astrology and KP Astrology
Vedic Astrology or Jyotish is the traditional Hindu system of astrology , also known as Indian Astrology or Hindu Astrology , originating 5000 years ago in India .
The true meaning of Vedic Astrology is the “ Message from the Stars ” .
The planetary positions at the time of our birth can give us clues about the strengths and weaknesses in our personality , character and temperament .
By applying the principles of Vedic Astrology , one can forecast important events in our lives .
A chart is made out for the moment of birth and for the particular place of birth ( Latitude and Longitude being taken for calculation ) .
From such a chart , one can read all important events about the native , their character , temperament , and peculiarities , longevity , condition of health , accident , proneness , finances , fortune , marriage / love relationships , birth of children and also his prosperity or adversity .
Moreover the actual date of any occurrence in their life can be calculated .
The major difference between Traditional Vedic Astrology and Western Astrology is that the Traditional Vedic Astrology uses sidereal zodiac .
Western Astrology in contrast , uses what is called the tropical zodiac .
Most Vedic Astrologers in the West practice the Traditional Vedic Astrology .
The Traditional Vedic Astrology was developed 5000 years ago , so most of the rules and techniques in Traditional Vedic Astrology are obsolete , outdated , and fail when put to an application in our daily practical life .
Traditional Vedic Astrology is vast and detailed , needs you to memorize like a parrot , a number of so called Raj Yogas in the astrology chart , uses various divisional charts , tables other than the birth chart , thus making it more confusing .
Traditional Vedic Astrology also fails in estimating the exact timing of the events .
Vedic Astrology ( KP Astrology ) is an improvement over the predictive wing of Vedic Astrology .
KP Astrology was developed in the last century by famous Indian Astrologer Master Late Prof KS Krishnamurti .
KP System ( Indian Astrology ) is known for the best and most accurate predictions .
KP System ( Hindu Astrology ) is excellent in predicting the timing of the events precisely .
KP
Astrology is simple , straightforward and easy to understand .
KP
Astrology gives importance to the Constellations / Stars / Nakshatras divisions of the Zodiac which is obviously desired for more precision .
Further it divides each Constellation / Star / Nakshatra division into further 9 subdivisions called ' SUBS ' .
These sub divisions are not equal divisions , but are as per the Vimshottari Dashas Divisions System .
The Zodiac is divided into 249 subs .
Mr. Gurmeet Singh is a disciple of famous Indian Astrologer Master Late Prof KS Krishnamurti , the inventor of KP System branch of Vedic Astrology .
Mr. Singh is one of the very few Vedic Astrologers in the West who specialize in the KP System branch of Vedic Astrology based on nakshatras and subs , which is far more precise and accurate compared to the other available astrology systems .
So understand your astrology chart and destiny by scheduling a KP Astrology & Vedic Astrology reading with Mr. Singh .
Top Twenty Two Accurate Predictions by Mr. Singh
Bill Cosby sentenced to 3 to 10 years prison
Donald Trump loss in 2016 Republican IOWA Caucus
Oscar Pistorius sentenced to 5 years prison

Photographers have been stopped while taking pictures of landmarks Professional and amateur photographers have gathered in London 's Trafalgar Square to protest against terror stop and searches .
The photographers say police are intimidating people with cameras in tactics to target possible terrorists .
Last week the European Court of Human Rights ruled the power to stop people without suspicion was indiscriminate .
The government is appealing , saying it is vital to make cities a hostile place for any possible attacker .
Rising tensions Freelance photographer and writer Marc Vallee , who helped organise the protest , said : " It 's quite surreal today but we are pleased with the support .
" It 's quite obvious that professional photographers across the country are being searched because they are photographers not because they are suspicious .
" It 's a common law right to take pictures in public places and we are here to show that . "
The demonstration comes after a year of rising tensions between professional photographers and police over the exact scope of Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
Stories of photographers being stopped for taking pictures have become a regular feature
Phil Coomes
BBC News website picture editor
BBC photojournalism blog
Your pictures of the protest
This special stop and search power allows police in specifically designated areas to stop people without suspicion of wrongdoing in an attempt to make it difficult for potential attackers to move around .
It is used in some key areas of London and other cities or airports where counter - terrorism officers suspect that violent extremists may be looking for targets .
According to the latest available figures , some 36,000 people were stopped under the power between April and June last year .
But photographers say the practical effect has been that increasing numbers of people with cameras are being left intimidated , angry and afraid after being asked to account for their actions .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , said it had warned of the dangers of blanket stop and search for a decade .
She said : " We have been completely vindicated by the Court of Human Rights and in the coming weeks MPs will have the chance to change this law .
Let 's hope they step up to their responsibilities . "
A series of controversial incidents over the past year have included photographers being stopped while taking pictures of landmarks and public buildings .
A separate counter - terrorism law , which in theory restricts the rights to photograph police officers , has added to the tensions .
Advice to officers Shortly before Christmas , Assistant Commissioner John Yates , the head of counter - terrorism at the Metropolitan Police , warned officers they risked losing public confidence if they did not use the Section 44 powers sensibly .
In my view , section 44 is being used far too often on a random basis without any reasoning behind its use
Lord Carlile
Government independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation
Stop - and - search use ruled illegal
But last week the European Court of Human Rights ruled the entire law was illegal because it was indiscriminate rather than properly targeted at the threat .
The government is appealing against that ruling and the power remains in force in the meantime .
Chief Constable Craig Mackey , the Association of Chief Police Officers ' ( Acpo ) spokesman on stop and search , said : " Acpo has stated previously that everyone - photographers , members of the media and the general public - has a right to take photographs and film in public places .
That has not changed .
" It is the job of police officers out on the beat to be vigilant , to keep an eye out for any suspicious behaviour and to act accordingly .
" And there is no doubt that every day their vigilance stops crime .
Used correctly , stop and search is a powerful tool that can help protect all our communities from terrorism .
Protecting the public remains our priority . "

Just improved : wind statistics !
When you are visiting Windfinder , it is very likely that wind is one of the most important aspects in your life - either for outdoor sports , hobbys or for professional use .
Chances are that you are looking for wind for your vacation planning too - and starting today , we can offer you a new and improved tool for this : meet our completely redesigned wind statistics !
First of all an introduction : our wind statistics are based on real measurements of weather stations , they are not based on forecasts .
Especially on places with complex terrain or local influences like thermals , this is much more accurate than relying on forecasts only .
With our weather data archive going back until 1999 , this makes a great resource for your planning .
In our redesign , we have greatly improved the visual layout .
Now it is much easier to check the average wind speed and direction as well as the maximum gust speed .
But we do not only feature wind speed , we also have statistics for air temperature and wave height and direction .
A much - requested feature is also to see the average wind speed in contrast to the long - term averages .
A great new addition is our polar chart for checking the dominant wind direction .
We separated the chart into different segments depending on the wind speed .
This may answer the question if strong wind always comes from one direction for example .
Right besides the polar chart you can see our area chart for wind strength distribution .
Divided into the same segments as the polar chart , you can see the distribution of wind strength over the year here - you can clearly see when windy season starts .
We are extremely happy to present you this update - head over to our wind statistics page for Tarifa for example and let us know what you think !
Young infertile men are ' 50 % more likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer '
Men who struggle to father a child while young are more than twice as likely to develop the most deadly form of prostate cancer when they age , research shows .
A study of more than 20,000 men revealed those classed as infertile by IVF doctors were up to 2.6 times more likely to go on to be diagnosed with the fast growing and spreading , hard - to - treat form of the disease as other men .
The finding suggests that the cancer and flaws in sperm production have a common origin - and that infertile men might want to consider being screened for the disease .
Men who are infertile when they are young are more likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer later in life , a study has found
Fleshing out the link could shed fresh light on the causes of the cancer and pave the way for new and better treatments .
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men and the second highest killer , after lung cancer .
Some 35,000 people a year are diagnosed with it - and 10,000 die .
Two thirds of victims have a non-aggressive variety and can often lead a healthy life .
But the aggressive version can rapidly be fatal .
The U.S. researchers compared the health records of 22,000 men who had been on the books of Californian IVF clinics , with those of men of a similar age from the general population .
Those diagnosed as infertile were no more likely to develop easy - to - treat , non-aggressive prostate tumours in later years than other men .
However , their odds of hard - to - treat cancers were 2.6 times higher , the journal Cancer reports .
Some previous studies concluded that the more children a man has , the lower his chances of the disease , but others have come to the opposite conclusion .
By studying men who were unable to have children , rather than those who chose not to , the researchers hoped to settle the argument .
The University of Washington team said it was unlikely their result could be explained away by infertile men simply being more conscientious about going for health checks .
Instead , the aggressive form of the disease and infertility may share a biological cause , such a flaws in the sex chromosomes , or faults in the way damaged DNA heals itself .
A previous study found that fathers of girls are more likely to develop prostate cancer , chiming with the idea that the chromosomes that determine a baby 's gender have a role to play .
Dr Thomas
Walsh , the author of the latest study , concluded : ' These results , if confirmed , also suggest that men identified with infertility earlier in life may be considered for prostate cancer screening , given the elevated risk specifically for high - grade disease . '
British experts stressed that more research was needed before recommending that infertile men be tested for signs of the disease .
Ed Yong , head of health evidence and information at Cancer Research UK , added : ' Research like this will eventually tell us more about the causes of prostate cancer , which are still largely unknown .
' It 's unlikely that being infertile directly leads to prostate cancer .
Instead , both infertility and a higher risk of prostate cancer might stem from a common genetic fault , or some aspect of our lifestyle or environment . '
Although it is known that men with a family history of the disease are at greater risk of developing it themselves , researchers have struggled to pinpoint the key genetic changes .
Age and diet also play a role , with the cancer being most common in older men and those who eat a fatty diet low in fruit and vegetables .
Exercise may be protective , with a recent study finding those who spend most of their working lives sitting down are almost 30 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than those with very active jobs .
Dr Helen Rippon , of The Prostate Cancer Charity , said : ' Being able to identify early and with confidence men who are at risk from a high grade , potentially life threatening prostate tumour from those who are likely to develop a slow growing form of the disease is one of the most important questions facing prostate cancer research today .
' This new study is one of the first to investigate if there is a possible link between male infertility and the risk of developing an aggressive prostate cancer . '
But she cautioned that the low number of men taking part in the study diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer meant it was ' difficult to draw any firm conclusions about whether the suggested link does exist ' .
In what is being hailed as something of a victory for reality - based education , Texas Board of Education member and young earth creationist Don McLeroy lost his Republican primary battle Tuesday to a critic of his attempts to insert religious dogma into the state education system .
Thomas Ratliff , a legislative consultant and son of a former lieutenant governor , had received support from mainstream public education groups fed up with McLeroy and other board members orchestrated attempt to inject their far - right conservative Christian views into both state science and social study education standards .
Since Ratliff has no Democratic challenger , he is expected to win the fall general election .
Details of the primary results can be found here and here .

In addition , the Texas Freedom Network reports that two other members of TBOE ’s social conservative voting bloc also lost election contests and a third was forced into a runoff .
According to TFN , Randy Rives and Joan Muenzler , who were backed by groups such as WallBuilders and the Texas Pastor Council , also lost their primary races .
In addition , Austin attorney Brian Russell , who Cynthia Dunbar recruited to run for her seat , was forced into a Republican runoff against a moderate Republican .
Dunbar , who is retiring , is a dominionist and has said public education is evil .
Incumbent Ken Mercer , who has said , “ If evolution were true , how come we ’ve never seen a dog - cat ? ” was the only candidate backed by religious - right groups who won his primary .
In his campaign , Ratliff decried the board ’s politicization of public education , which included members attacking the teaching of evolution in science class and trying to rewrite the social studies textbook requirements to defend the U.S. as a Christian nation and one that is blessed with exceptionalism by God .
“ Our kids do n’t go to red schools .
They do n’t go to blue schools .
They go to local schools , ” Ratliff said during his campaign .
McLeroy is probably best known for a remark he made during TBOE science curriculum hearings last year in which he tried to insert language to make them more creationist friendly .
Before a group of scientists and educators who decried his attempts , McLeroy said , “ Somebody has to stand up to the experts . ”
It ’s rare that anything we review has the longevity that Intel ’s Core i7 Bloomfield platform has enjoyed .
If you were one of the fortunate few to buy a Core i7 920 , 940 or 965 back in November 2008 , you ’d still have one of the fastest desktop CPUs today in March 2010 .
Lynnfield was introduced in 2009 , but still could n't dethrone Bloomfield .
In fact , other than a few minor speed bumps , Intel has n’t done much with its LGA - 1366 platform in the past 15 months .
Last year Intel introduced Nehalem for the rest of us with its LGA - 1156 socket and in January we got the first dual - core derivatives .
Now it ’s finally time to take care of the folks who invested in Nehalem and Core i7 early on .
In the coming weeks Intel will be shipping its first 6 - core desktop processor , built using the same 32nm process used in the Clarkdale Core i3 / i5 CPUs .
It ’s codenamed Gulftown but today we can call it the Core i7 980X .
Did I mention that with a BIOS update it ’s fully compatible with all X58 motherboards ?
That ’s right , even if you bought a board in November 2008 - you can upgrade directly to Gulftown .

The Entire 2010 Nehalem / Westmere lineup
In fact , that ’s exactly what I did for today ’s review .
This is Intel ’s DX58SO motherboard I used in my original Core i7 review in November 2008 :
It ’s the same exact board , but updated to the 5020 BIOS that ’s currently available on Intel ’s site .
Intel was sneaky and actually enabled Gulftown support in its motherboards a few weeks ago .
And here we have the result :
Intel ’s Core i7 980X , running at 3.33GHz with 6 cores , 12 threads and a massive 12MB L3 cache all running on a motherboard that shipped a year and a half ago .
The old board works mostly fine with the 980X but with some odd bugs and quirks that I ran into .
I found that my older DDR3 - 1066 memory would n't overclock to 1333MHz with Gulftown , although it did just fine with Bloomfield for some reason .
It ’s not just Intel enabling support either .
All motherboard manufacturers either have or are expected to have BIOSes with Gulftown support by the time this chip ships in the coming weeks .
ASRock sent over its X58 Extreme , which worked perfectly with the new chip :
It ’s Extreme
The coolest part of Gulftown is that by building it on Intel ’s 32nm process it ’s actually smaller than both Bloomfield and Lynnfield , despite having 50 % more cores and L3 cache :
CPU Codename Manufacturing Process Cores Transistor Count Die Size Westmere 6C Gulftown 32nm 6 1.17B 240mm2 Nehalem 4C Bloomfield 45nm 4 731 M 263mm2 Nehalem 4C Lynnfield 45nm 4 774M 296mm2 Westmere 2C Clarkdale 32nm 2 384M 81mm2 AM
D
Phenom II X4 Deneb 45 nm 4 758 M 258mm2
At 1.17 billion transistors , it ’s a beefy chip but the monolithic die only measures 240 m m ^ 2 .
It ’s even smaller than an AMD Phenom II X4 .
Not only does it have a smaller die than all quad - core Nehalem processors , but it also has the same TDP .
The 130W chip runs at 3.33GHz , but because of the high TDP it can only turbo up to 3.46GHz with more than two cores active .
If only one or two cores are active , the chip can turbo up to 3.60GHz .
With up to 6 cores running at 3.46GHz , Gulftown is not only the fastest CPU in Intel ’s lineup , it ’s also the fastest quad - core Intel makes .
Only the Core i5 670 can run at a higher frequency with a single core active ( 3.73GHz vs 3.60 GHz ) .
The downside to all of this is the price tag .
The Core i7 980X is an Extreme Edition processor , meaning it ’s introduced at the $ 999 price point .
And currently it ’s the only way to get 6 - cores in a Core i7 .
Currently Intel does n't have any plans to introduce 4 - core versions of Gulftown on the desktop , although we will see some 32nm quad - core Xeons later this year .
Bloomfield ( left ) vs. Gulftown ( right )
This is n’t the first time that the $ 999 price tag comes with some exclusive features .
The first Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the very first to wear the EE brand .
While all regular Pentium 4s at the time had a 512KB L2 , the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition added a 2MB L3 cache - a feature that never trickled down to the mainstream P4s .
Since then , most Extreme Edition parts have just been higher clocked CPUs .
Despite that , they do sell well enough for Intel to continue the practice .
Given that this time around , the Core i7 980X will not only give you clock speed but more cores and cache , Intel will probably end up selling more of these than they ever have .
Yep .
Much cooler .

Members of the Australian police force , visiting Israel in order to question three Israelis whose forged Australian passports were used in the assassination of Hamas strongman Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai , were allegedly involved in a hit - and - run accident with a cyclist in Tel Aviv just hours after landing in the country , according to a report Wednesday in Australian ABC .
According to the report , the officers did not stop to offer help to the woman on the bike .
' It Was n't Me ' ' Assassin ' from Tel Aviv : I 'm shocked Yoav Zitun New list of suspects in Dubai killing catches Adam Marcus Korman , who carries an Australian passport , off guard .
' It 's a violation of human rights to do such a thing ; I am shocked since receiving news , ' he says ' Assassin ' from Tel Aviv : I 'm shocked
The network reported that the three police officers arrived in Israel in order to investigate the use of three Israelis ' passports : Adam Marcus Korman , Joshua Daniel Bruce , and Nicole Sandra McCabe .
They spent the day in the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv , where they were slated to interview the three Israelis , all of whom hold dual citizenship .
When they left the embassy building , their vehicle , with a diplomatic license plate , hit a bicyclist .
The Australian police , however , kept on driving without stopping .
While the cyclist was not hurt , she would like a apology from the Australian Embassy over the issue , and a new wheel for her bike .
According to her , she already contacted a lawyer on the matter .
The Australian Embassy said that it is investigating the incident , but that the woman has yet to file a formal complaint , and , as such , it cannot confirm that the accident indeed took place .
No comment has yet to be received from the Australian police .
The Australian news report stated that the three officers were traveling in a Toyota .
An Australian Embassy spokeswoman told The Australian newspaper that the issue at hand is a serious one .
When asked what the driver said about the incident , she said she did not find it fitting to discuss the investigation before it has been completed .
Not over yet
Oshra Bar , 22 from Jaffa , confirmed the event in a conversation with Ynet .
She said that second within being hit , she was surrounded by Australian reporters covering the police officers ' visit .
" They told me that the car that hit was the car belonging to the Australian police who came to investigate .
I only saw the diplomatic plates . "
Later , an Australian reporter came to her house to interview her .
When she refused to have her picture taken , Bar says the reporter attacked her .
" He was outside my apartment , and he took out his camera sort of charmingly in an attempt to convince me .
I tried to close the door when he stuck out his foot to try to keep the door open forcefully .
I tried to slam the door and I screamed at him to get lost and that I do n't want to be photographed .
Then he grabbed the door and tried to push his way in , " Bar said .
She said that the reporter then proceeded to grab her hand so he could get his hand in the door and take a few pictures .
Bar said that she ultimately succeeded in pushing him out .
The Australian reporter stridently denied young woman 's allegations .
In a conversation with Ynet , he claimed that nothing of the sort took place .
Australia 's government called in Israel 's ambassador after three people travelling on Australian passports were named as suspects in the assassination .
According to The Australian website , Ambassador Yuval Rotem was called in by Foreign Minister Stephen Smith .
" Any state that has been complicit in use or abuse of the Australian passport system , let alone for the conduct of an assassination , is treating Australia with contempt and there will therefore be action by the Australian government in response , " said Smith .

A lonely cave on a cliff in the rugged Pinnacles National Monument is the setting for a story of two love birds who found one another despite unimaginable hardship and decided to bring new life into a world that almost destroyed them .
They are , of course , giant corpse - munching vultures , but wildlife biologists could not be more thrilled if they were Romeo and Juliet .
The lovers in this case are California condors and together they have built the first condor nest in the Pinnacles in more than 100 years , a pivotal moment in the effort to bring back the majestic birds from the brink of extinction .
" Condors historically called the Pinnacles home , but because of the declining population the birds have not nested in the park in 100 years , " said Carl Brenner , the chief of interpretation and education for the national monument , which is in the Gabilan Mountains about 30 miles south of Salinas .
" Forty years ago there were no condors in the park .
This is a milestone for the park recovery program . "
A nest with a single egg was found recently in a cave on top of a cliff known to rock climbers as Resurrection Wall , on the west side of the park .
The egg is the product of a romance between 7 - year - old condors with the decidedly unpoetic names 317 and 318 .
The lower - numbered female , released in the park in 2004 , is one of 26 condors who now reside in and around the Pinnacles .
Her mate is from a flock that hangs out along the Big Sur coast , Brenner said .
The pair was first spotted in February displaying feathers , flashing their brightly colored heads and necks and performing other shamelessly flirtatious rituals associated with condor courtship .
Biologists tracked the pair to their nest using radio telemetry and global positioning technology and confirmed the egg .
With a wingspan of 10 feet , the California condor is the largest North American land bird and a symbol of a time when the far West was an untamed wilderness .
The massive black vulture is one of the world 's longest - living birds , with a lifespan in the wild of 35 to 40 years .
Once widespread across North America , the condor has declined precipitously since the 19th century when they were hunted and poisoned with the lead shot that was often left in meat they scavenged .
Despite being listed on the federal endangered species list in 1967 , only 22 remained in the world in 1987 , prompting conservationists to capture the remaining birds and start a breeding program at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo .
Since then , millions of dollars and countless man-hours have been spent trying to bring the species back .
The birds were reintroduced in California , Arizona and Baja California starting in 1991 , and there are now 348 condors in the wild and another 161 in captive breeding centers .
The goal is to eventually have 150 free - flying birds and 15 breeding pairs in both California and Arizona , but there are still many hurdles .
Just last year , two California condors were found in the Pinnacles area suffering from gunshot wounds , prompting a statewide manhunt for the poachers .
Another obstacle to recovery is the fact that condors typically do not begin breeding until they are 7 years old .
Brenner said the egg is not expected to hatch for almost three months .
The nesting area will be closed to the public until the chick takes flight sometime in October .
The birds will retain their numerical names , Brenner said , unless the Chumash Indians , from the Santa Barbara area , decide to give them proper names .
The tribe has naming rights because they consider condors sacred , but so far they have only named one condor for its skill teaching younger birds how to live in the wild , naming it Hohi .
In their bliss , 317 and 318 probably could n't care less .
" It is anticipated that they will mate for life now , " Brenner said .
Apple on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against rival handset maker HTC over the alleged infringement of 20 patents related to the iPhone 's user interface , underlying architecture and hardware [ updated with specific patents ] .
The suit was officially filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission and in a U.S. District Court in Delaware .
Apple announced the lawsuit in a press release .
" We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it .
We 've decided to do something about it , " said Apple co-founder Steve Jobs .
" We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours . "
Update : Revealed in the lawsuit are the patents in question .
They are entitled :
While HTC primarily makes handsets running Windows Mobile , the company has also made a number of high - profile phones based on the Google Android mobile operating system .
In addition to the first Android phone , the G1 , HTC was also behind the recently released Nexus One , which features multi- touch technology .
The lawsuit is yet another filed with the ITC with Apple 's name featured prominently on it .
In recent months the iPhone maker has sued Nokia , and is also being sued by the Finnish handset maker .
The ITC has agreed to look into both companies ' complaints of patent infringement .
New York ( CNN ) --
It was the last day of classes , and Brandon Swanson , a 19 - year - old freshman at Minnesota West Community and Technical College , was celebrating with his friends .
Swanson called home shortly after midnight May 14 , 2008 , telling his parents he needed a ride because he had driven into a ditch in the neighboring town of Lynd , Minnesota .
Annette and Brian Swanson immediately set out in their pickup to look for their son and his green Chevy Lumina sedan .
" We got in the pickup to go to this spot where he felt he was , " Brian Swanson recalled .
He thought he knew exactly where his son was , about 10 minutes from their home in Marshall .
" He was absolutely positive he knew where he was , " Brian Swanson said .
The parents stayed on the phone , talking to their son as they headed to pick him up .
But when they arrived , there was no car and no Brandon .
They turned around and flashed the lights on their truck .
" We were saying , ' We 're flashing our lights ! ' " Annette Swanson said .
Over the phone , they could hear their son working the light switch in his car .
Click - click , click - click .
" Do n't you see me ? " he asked .
" There was nothing , " his father said , " absolutely nothing . "
Everyone grew frustrated .
" At one point , he hung up on me , so I called him back and apologized , " his mother said .
Swanson told his parents he would walk back to his friend 's house in Lynd .
His father drove home to drop Annette off and then headed back to look for the teen .
They exchanged calls just before 2 a.m. and eventually carried on a long conversation while the younger Swanson was walking , trying to direct his father to where he was .
He told his father to look for him at a nightclub parking lot that was a popular meeting spot in Lynd .
But at the 47 - minute mark , the call ended abruptly .
The teen shouted an expletive , and the phone went dead .
It was the last time anyone heard from him .
" We called at least five or six more times , " his father said .
" He never picked up the phone again . "
The Swansons turned to their son's friends for help .
They searched all night , driving down dirt roads and through farmland .
There was no sign of him .
At 6:30 a.m. , Annette Swanson called the Lynd Police Department to report Brandon missing , and officers eventually joined the search .
They , too , came up with nothing , and a countywide request was dispatched to expand the search .
The response was delayed because , officers pointed out , it was not that unusual for a 19 - year - old to stay out all night after finishing college classes , Annette Swanson said .
One remark stayed with her :
An officer said that at his age , her son " had a right to be missing . "
Phone records later showed that the teen was nowhere near Lynd , where he told his parents he was .
His cell phone calls were traced to a tower 20 miles away in Minnesota .
That afternoon , Lyon County police found Swanson 's vehicle in Porter , approximately 25 miles from Lynd .
" It was off the side of a field approach , and the vehicle was hung up , " Lincoln County Sheriff Jack Vizecky said .
" It 's sort of a sharp incline , nothing major but enough that the car would get hung up so the wheels are too high off the ground to get any traction . "
Nothing else unusual was found at the site , and officers could not determine which direction the teen had headed after he left the vehicle .
" There 's grass in the ditch and gravel on the road , so it 's possible to leave that vehicle and not leave any tracks , " Vizecky said .
Investigators brought in search dogs , and they led investigators to woods by the bank of the Yellow Medicine River .
The river 's depth ranges from knee high in certain areas to 15 feet in others .
At the time Swanson went missing , it was flowing high and fast .
" There are two miles of the river in that area , and it took six hours to walk it , " Vizecky said .
He said he personally walked the river every day for 30 days .
" At the time , the dogs indicated , and it was believed , that he must have fallen in the river in that area , " he added .
" So we searched that area , on the premise that he'd be washed downstream . "
But investigators are not convinced that the teen fell into the river .
Vizecky said Swanson should have been found in the river or downstream , had he fallen in .
Annette Swanson said she is not convinced her son drowned , either .
" There really is nothing to indicate that he's in the river , " she said .
According to her , one bloodhound followed a scent from the stranded car down a gravel road to an abandoned farm .
" It was a long trail ... about three miles , " she added .
The new trail path also led to the Yellow Medicine River .
" The dog actually jumped in the river , jumped back out , worked the trail up to another gravel road and then lost the scent , " she said .
Vizecky leaves open the possibility of foul play .
" The only thing would have been if someone was in the shadows , and they got him that way , " he said .
" I can't say there was n't someone else there , but I can't find any evidence of it . "
Cadaver dogs and searchers , he explained , should have found a body or some evidence if Swanson had succumbed to the elements .
" I can't explain why clothing , belongings would n't surface , " Vizecky said .
" I can't explain why after searching for three weeks , [ the dogs ] could not smell anything . "
The Swansons want to know what happened to their son .
" You know people do n't vanish into thin air , but it sure seems like he did , " Annette Swanson said .
The couple is responsible for the enactment of Brandon 's Law , which became effective in Minnesota on July 1 , 2009 .
The law requires authorities to conduct a preliminary investigation without delay when a missing persons report is received .
Brandon Swanson has brown hair and blue eyes , stands 5 ' 6 " and weighs 125 pounds .
When last seen , he was wearing blue jeans , a white or black hat twisted to the side , and a white short - sleeved shirt
Anyone with information that could lead to the whereabouts of Brandon Swanson is asked to call the Lincoln County sheriff at ( 507 ) 694-1664 .
All those pundits who declared the current recession dead and buried , obviously have n’t been talking to small business owners .
Chapman University economists are the latest to announce the official end of the recession – with the codicil that the recovery will be more tortoise than hare .
In stark contrast to that report is the latest National Federation of Independent Business survey that shows small business confidence is locked in a downward spiral , that is worse than at any time during the last big recession in 1981 - 82 .
The NFIB index showed a drop of 0.8 points in November – to 88.3 – from where it was in October and it represented the sixth time the index was below 90 since the current recession officially began 24 months ago .
According to the NFIB , the index never fell below 90 at any point during the 1981 - 82 downturn and experienced a sharp rise at the beginning of 1983 .
NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg said the index ’s current level was directly related to a lack of consumer spending .
It seems not even a modest increase in Black Friday sales volume was enough to boost morale among small business owners .
“ The biggest problem continues to be a shortage of customers , ” Dunkelberg said in a statement .
Among the 825 respondents to the NFIB survey , just 16 percent said they planned to make any capital expenditures over the next few months – the lowest total in 35 years .
“ Consumer spending is very weak , and there is nothing on the table in Washington to make owners more optimistic about the future . ”
Dunkelberg said a continued lack of access to credit was further handcuffing small businesses and slowing job growth .
In November small businesses reported a decline in average employment per firm of 0.58 workers during the prior three months , according to the NFIB .
That represented a vast improvement over May ’s record loss of 1.26 workers per firm , but not something that could lead someone to confidently proclaim the recession dead .
Despite Obama ’s recent small business and job forums and yesterday ’s announcement that he will meet yet again with banks to try to get credit lines flowing to small businesses as a way to stimulate job growth , Dunkelberg said more needs to be done to restore small businesses confidence .
“ The economy may be turning , but small firms are not convinced things will improve anytime in the near future , ” said Dunkelberg .
A woman in California has won a partial victory in a lawsuit against a record company that forced her to remove a video she posted on YouTube .
The woman posted a video of her young child dancing to the Prince song Let 's Go Crazy .
Universal Music , which owns the copyright , demanded YouTube remove the video - which it did .
With help from a group of free speech activists she filed a suit saying her video constituted a fair use of the song .
A California judge has ruled in her favour , saying she is entitled to at least recover her legal fees .
Observers say this is an important case in copyright infringement law .
It was n’t long ago that Marco Rubio and Tim Pawlenty -- two rising Republican stars -- supported legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
But in recent weeks , both have begun to express doubts about whether cars , factories and power plants have anything to do with global warming .
The shift by Rubio and Pawlenty -- as well as other prominent Republicans -- reflects the rising power of climate change skeptics in the GOP , where global warming is becoming a litmus test for conservatives .
Rubio , former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives , is running for the U.S. Senate .
Pawlenty , Minnesota ’s governor , is eyeing a 2012 presidential bid .
For Republicans , “ the new political expediency is to be a global warming skeptic , ” said Marc Morano , executive editor of the skeptic clearinghouse website ClimateDepot.com and a former aide to outspoken skeptic Sen. James M. Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) .
Fuel for the resurgence of attacks on global warming came in December , when leaked e-mails from a British university showed top climate scientists from around the world apparently discussing skirting public information laws and other practices of questionable ethics -- an incident that has become known as Climategate .
Then came revelations of flaws in a key United Nations report , including a claim -- not supported by scientific evidence -- that Himalayan glaciers could disappear because of warming by 2035 .
“ It ’s given opponents of climate action leverage to attack what was widely considered to be unimpeachable , which is the science , ” said John R. Russell IV , a former Republican congressional staffer who now lobbies for renewable energy interests with Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal .
Fearing that the public is losing confidence in the science , researchers are fighting back by engaging their critics more directly , acknowledging errors and perception problems and encouraging the release of more raw data .
And while the issue has made for fiery campaign rhetoric , it has n’t appeared to sway the close to a dozen Republicans in the Senate who still appear open to emissions restrictions , largely because of the prospect of new jobs and reduced dependence on foreign oil that could come from the development of alternative energy sources .
But polls suggest the scandals have shaken some voters ’ belief in climate change , particularly conservative activists who widely regard emissions limits as a United Nations - fueled intrusion on personal freedom .
A recent online survey by climate change researchers at Yale and George Mason universities showed the percentage of Americans who are “ dismissive ” of climate science has more than doubled since 2008 , from 7 % to 16 % .
A core group of dissenters has long challenged the prevailing scientific belief that fossil fuel combustion and deforestation are warming Earth and probably setting the stage for rising seas , increased drought and other dangerous effects of a changing climate .
But the academic arguments began to transform into political action after former Vice President Al Gore and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to raise public awareness of global warming .
The skeptics had taken a body blow in the scientific debate , but that seemed to galvanize a grass - roots political effort to fight against the ensuing threat of emissions legislation .
President Obama mounted an aggressive push for a climate bill that passed the House in June , feeding a growing conservative backlash against initiatives , such as the healthcare overhaul and automaker bailouts , that activists called impingements on personal freedom .
If Climategate had n’t broken when Obama was pushing emissions limits and world leaders were trying to reach a climate accord in Copenhagen last year , “ it would not have had the impact that it had , ” said Christopher Horner , a longtime climate science dissenter with the free - market Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington , which has taken money from oil companies .
“ At this time and place , it resonated . ”
That ’s particularly true among Republican candidates .
Rubio has pummeled his primary opponent , Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , over Crist ’s support for emissions limits .
Pawlenty , who once joined with Democrats in backing emissions limits in a radio campaign , recently said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” that there are questions of how much climate change is man-made .
Even 2008 GOP presidential candidate John McCain , who argued often with climate skeptics on the primary campaign trail , recently played along with a Fox News interviewer who mocked global warming .
In the face of a stiff primary challenge for his Senate reelection , McCain has backed away from his support for emissions limits .
One leading Republican , Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , warned his party last week that embracing skeptics could pose long - term problems for the party by alienating young voters concerned about climate change .
Graham has been trying to hammer out a compromise climate and energy bill with Sens. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) .
White House officials and environmentalists lobbying for a bipartisan climate bill say the science scandals have not cost them any potential swing votes , Republican or Democrat .
Many of the same polls that show some Americans doubting climate science also show support for emissions limits to boost energy independence and create “ clean energy ” jobs -- the arguments supporters have used to sell the climate bill for more than a year .
“ The vast majority of people support the bill because of the benefits , ” said Tony Kreindler , a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund , “ and not because of the science . ”

British voters must not be intimidated by an unholy alliance of currency traders and the Daily Mail .
The pound is plummeting , we are told , because markets fear a hung parliament .
Amplifying the Conservative party line , the Mail warns that either a Labour victory or a hung parliament " threaten a run on the pound " and could " trigger turmoil " .
So it 's the Tories or national disaster .
Stuff and nonsense .
If proper preparations are made , there is no reason at all why a parliament with no overall majority should produce a weak government , incapable of fiscal consolidation .
According to a House of Commons study , seven of the 10 largest fiscal consolidations in OECD member countries since 1970 have happened under coalition governments .
Germany always has coalition governments – and it has the strongest economy in Europe .
Greece has descended to fiscal hell under one - party governments .
Britain won the second world war with a coalition government .
In fact , this country has had coalition or minority governments for 34 of the last 100 years .
It 's only since 1945 that we 've got out of the habit , except for two brief interludes in the 1970s .
But now , with the British weakness for the invention of tradition , we are asked to believe that single party governments representing a minority of the popular vote are as English as roast beef and country lanes .
( And I say English advisedly , since Scotland and Wales , not to mention London and our European parliament elections , all have more proportional systems . )
To be sure , the transition to a minority or coalition government would be tested by the markets .
Because we have got out of the habit , and because markets move faster than Olympic ski cross finalists , careful constitutional and political planning needs to be done – and is being done .
One tricky possibility derives precisely from the fact that our parliament is so unrepresentative .
Due to a combination of the first past the post electoral system and the way constituencies are drawn , Labour at present has far more seats than its share of the popular vote would entitle it to ( 36.4 % of the vote but 57 % of the seats after the 2005 election ) while the Liberal Democrats have far fewer ( 23 % of votes , 10 % of seats in 2005 ) , and the Conservatives are more or less even stevens .
If , for instance , the election went the way predicted by a recent ComRes poll , with the Tories getting 37 % of the vote and Labour 32 % , that could , perversely , give Labour some 294 seats and the Conservatives only 277 .
Initially , Gordon Brown would remain as prime minister .
We may assume that his instinct would be to hang on to power like a terrier to a thief 's pants .
Politically , however , much would depend on the Liberal Democrats .
Nick Clegg has indicated that the Lib Dems do not want to enter a coalition ; we are therefore talking about a Labour or Conservative minority government .
Although the Lib Dems are ideologically closer to Labour , the only principled , consistent and politically prudent thing for Clegg to do in this eventuality would be to go straight into talks with the party with the largest popular mandate – that is , barring an enormous reversal , the Conservatives .
How could you spend decades criticising the electoral system for being unrepresentative of the popular vote and then embrace a Labour minority government made possible only by that unrepresentativeness ?
What would be the reaction of all those voters who with their ballot papers had wanted to say " time for a change " ?
Two things would then have to happen very quickly .
First , the Lib Dems would need to agree not to kibosh Conservative tax and spending plans which would need to be clear enough to reassure the markets .
In yesterday 's Financial Times , Nick Clegg signalled to the markets his readiness to do this .
In return , the Lib Dems would seek acceptance of one or two of their hallmark policies .
Second , the Tories would have to make some explicit commitment on a way forward to electoral reform .
If the present government 's proposal to mandate a referendum on introducing the alternative vote system had become law before the election , the simplest thing would be to get the Tories to commit to holding that referendum within a period of months ( and in any case before a snap second election ) .
The AV system is far short of the proportionality that Lib Dems want and Britain deserves , but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
If the AV amendment had not gone through , then a firm timetable for putting a proposal on electoral reform to the British people would have to be agreed in incredibly short order .
Tories would fiercely resist this , but if their claim to govern lay in the mismatch between their share of the popular vote and their share of seats in the Commons – that is , in the unrepresentativeness of the electoral system – they would not have an intellectual or moral leg to stand on .
( Yes , I know politicians learn to walk legless almost before learning to crawl , but our job is to point to those missing legs . )
The very term " hung parliament " is calculated to deter .
Like " hung jury " , it suggests crippling indecision .
But a hung parliament is actually a stronger parliament , since the executive is more dependent on the goodwill of the legislature .
Properly arranged , this produces not weak government but limited government , something Conservatives have traditionally favoured .
The last 13 years have shown us the dangers of insufficiently constrained government .
Labour has actually introduced a great many constitutional reforms , including devolution and the Human Rights Act .
Yet at the heart of the system there remains this raging bull of an overmighty executive , trampling over a subservient lower house of parliament in which the ruling party 's " clear " majority consists mainly of people who are either members of the executive or want to be .
It is this system which has , for instance , produced an avalanche of Home Office legislation ( more , by one estimate , than in the whole earlier history of that department ) which is burying our civil liberties .
If that 's the roast beef of British strong government , I 'd rather do without it .
( Meanwhile , MPs can do something right away to strengthen parliament by voting for the Wright committee amendments – to give backbenchers more power – which come before the Commons today . )
The ultimate goal should be a written constitution .
I 've just read a fascinating attempt by the lawyer Richard Gordon to spell out in legal and political detail what a modern British constitution might look like ( Repairing British Politics : A Blueprint for Constitutional Change ) .
This being Britain , we know that it is most unlikely to happen like that , with a whole new document being triumphantly adopted by a constituent assembly , French or American style , and cocked hats flying in the air .
" The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road " , and the British road to constitutional reform , which New Labour has somewhat drunkenly begun , is likely to continue that way .
The apparently indecisive zigzag of a so - called hung parliament may yet prove to be a step forward – a cutting through the Cotswolds , so to speak – on this meandering British road to a better country .

DETROIT / FORT HOOD , Texas ( Reuters ) -
Three times a week , Mike Lackomar climbs into his truck and drives the same delivery route through the suburbs of Detroit .
Lackomar is an independent contractor for a private parcel company .
If you live northwest of this battered city and you recently purchased something from a home shopping network , there ’s a good chance the 36 - year - old handled your package .
But there is one small item that never leaves his truck : a green nylon satchel Lackomar jokingly calls “ the football , ” a reference to the briefcase with codes for a nuclear strike kept close to the U.S. president .
Inside , along with a pocket knife and a small first aid kit , is a sealed envelope containing codes , rallying points and detailed plans that Lackomar would use to mobilize his squad of armed citizen - soldiers in an emergency .
Lackomar is a team leader in the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia ( SMVM ) , the largest and most visible of this state ’s many small private armies .
He is a husband , a father and a musician .
But his favorite picture on his Facebook page shows him standing in front of a snowmobile trailer packed with rifles , clips and ammunition boxes , a picture he laughingly admits looks “ like an evidence photo from the 6 O’clock News . ”
The SMVM is one of 200 armed militias in the United States , a number that has quadrupled since 2008 , according to the Anti-Defamation League , a civil rights watchdog , which says they may have 6,000 members and many other adherents .
MILITIAS : HARMLESS UNTIL THEY ARE NOT
The United States is one of the few Western democratic countries that permit independent militias .
Their rapid growth coincides with a sharp rise in partisan rhetoric as the November U.S. congressional elections draw nearer .
Depending on your perspective , they are either patriots or paranoid .
Experts in law enforcement and academia are divided as to how big an actual threat they may pose .
But they all agree on one thing : the groups are very well armed .
“ Most ( militia groups ) are merely in the rhetorical and defensive stage , ” said Brian Levin , professor of criminal justice at California State University and an expert on militias and domestic terrorism .
“ But we do n’t know which groups are going to be benign and which are going to be small incubators for radicalism . ”
His point was underscored by the arrest in late March of nine members of anti-government extremist group called the Hutaree , whose website says its name means “ Christian Warrior . ”
They were charged with planning a cop-killing spree intended to spark a broad insurrection .
And in February , a computer engineer angry with the government crashed a small aircraft into an office building in Austin , Texas , housing the federal Internal Revenue Service .
In a rambling six - page statement , the man said he hoped his act would help make “ American zombies wake up and revolt . ”
Until their arrest , the Hutaree were considered brothers - in - arms by other Michigan militia groups , including the SMVM .
At least two of the men indicted by the government in the case briefly trained with Lackomar ’s group .
Before the group hatched its plot , the only rap against it in militia circles was that its training practices -- like run-and - gun target shooting -- were not the safest .
“ I knew a couple of the guys that are sitting in jail right now .
They were nice people , ” said Lackomar .
That is not to say he condoned the group ’s plan .
One Hutaree member who evaded the police dragnet asked a member of Lackomar ’s group for help retrieving weapons and other supplies he had hidden at the group ’s safe house .
Instead , he got some unexpected advice : Turn yourself in .
The suspect ignored the SMVM member , who went to the police .
Far from joining a rebellion , Lackomar ’s group and other militia members denounced the alleged plot and applauded the way the FBI and state police handled the raids .
“ Nobody got hurt , ” Lackomar said .
“ There were n’t any shots fired .
They got everyone needed .
They stopped the plan . ”
For that stance , Lackomar and other group members took some heat from what he calls “ ultra - right ideologues ” who consider the Hutaree victims of political persecution .
“ TOYS ”
Lackomar ’s group claims to have about 150 regular members and another 150 informal affiliates .
At its annual field day and picnic recently , held not far from where the Hutaree are alleged to have hatched their plot , fewer than 100 people showed up .
All self - respecting militias pack what they call “ toys ” and the SMVM is no exception .
Lackomar , who never served in the armed forces , favors an AK - 74 assault rifle , an updated version of the iconic Soviet AK - 47 .
Others in the group with army or marine experience prefer the AR - 15 , a copy of the M16 they used in their military days .
One member , a vice president of a financial services firm who prefers to be identified only by his radio call name , uses a Spanish version of the Heckler & Koch G3 , a gun with a terrific report that Lackomar says “ will rattle your fillings . ”
Hence the man ’s call name : Thumper .
“ When he ’s laying on the ground firing , the muzzle blast will dig trenches in front of him , ” Lackomar says with a hint of envy .
The lack of standardized weapons reflects both the ad hoc , volunteer nature of the SMVM and its egalitarianism .
There are no ranks , only positions like team leader and unit coordinator -- all decided by the group on a democratic basis .
To become a voting member of the SMVM requires only two things , Lackomar says : possession of basic gear and a demonstrated competency with a weapon at 100 yards -- a hurdle that Lackomar says took him six months to clear .
Those two requirements aside , the SMVM insists it ’s open to anyone , regardless of race , color , religion or national origin .
Lackomar nonetheless acknowledges the group ’s actual makeup is overwhelmingly white .
“ We ’re probably a little lopsided into the white end of the spectrum , ” he said .
THE MAD HATTER’S FOOTBALL
The SMVM trains once a month in a state park about 45 minutes outside of Detroit .
The training , which includes a winter survival course , is designed to keep the unit in a state of readiness for an emergency .
For Lackomar , whose radio call name is “ Mad Hatter , ” the emergency that triggers a militia response and tearing into “ the football ” might be a replay of a massive power outage in 2003 that paralyzed parts of the United States .
He ticks off other “ tripwires ” that might “ drive our unit into action , ” including the imposition of martial law , a possibility many in the militia movement deem an imminent threat .
“ The longtime discussion between militias has always been , ‘ What is the final straw ? ’ ” Lackomar said .
“ Freedom of speech has to be the final line .
If we find ourselves in a situation ... where our freedom of assembly is suspended , demonstrations are outlawed or restricted , that ’s going to be the tripwire that sets everything off . ”
An assault on another militia group , like the Hutaree , could be a tripwire , too , Lackomar and others say .
All it would have taken were for a few facts to be different .
“ If what happened ... was a true crackdown on militias by a government run amok , ” he said , “ not only would you have had the other units in Michigan say , ‘ Stop , ’ but it would have gone on all over the nation . ”
Lackomar provided two instances where he said the Michigan militia had activated -- at least on a small scale .
Both involved standoffs between the police and a property owner who Lackomar said was being “ crapped upon . ”
The militia showed up , cradling but not pointing their weapons , as a show of solidarity with the property owner .
In one case , Lackomar said the cops backed down .
In another the property owner relented .
No shots were fired or verbal threats exchanged .
Mike Vanderboegh , a militia veteran in Alabama who runs the influential blog called Sipsey Street Irregulars , adopts a more provocative tone in discussing what might trigger armed conflict .
“ I ca n’t see this ( tension between federal authorities and the people ) ending in any other way other than conflict , ” he said in an interview .
“ They ( the government ) truly believe that when they issue an order they think it will be obeyed .
I do n’t see how that can end other than civil war . ”
PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTION
The militia movement has no single national leader and it contains wildly divergent strains of thought , according to militia members and experts .
These include white supremacists and neo -Nazis ; “ Millenarians , ” who say major social transformation is imminent ; and believers in “ Christian Identity , ” a pro-white version of Christianity .
But the vast majority seem to be “ constitutional ” militias , fans of low taxes and small government -- values similar to those of many conservatives and the Tea Party movement .
They also see the possession of firearms as not only a right protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution but a patriotic duty , a symbol of the citizen ’s equal standing with the government .
At the heart of the movement is a fierce allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and a belief that its rights and freedoms are threatened by the government .
One leading light is Robert Schulz , founder and chairman of We The People Foundation , a non-profit that organized two national gatherings last year .
The meetings popularized a check list of alleged constitutional violations cited by elements of the conservative Tea Party movement and militias , according to “ Midwifing the Militias ” , a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center , a non-profit which tracks hate groups .
Such violations included undeclared foreign wars , gifting and lending money and credit to private corporations , unconstitutional tax levying and unenforced immigration laws .
“ What we have is government ignoring the Constitution , ” Schulz told Reuters in interview .
“ TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY ”
Militia members like Lackomar , who is rare in his willingness to talk to the media , say that the movement is a healthy , democratic phenomenon with a real public benefit : providing an armed civilian alternative to the police and military .
Although they do n’t quote Alexis de Tocqueville , the 19th century French observer of the United States , the militia members definitely see themselves as a deterrent to the “ tyranny of the majority ” that Tocqueville and others warned was a risk to the republic .
But the recent 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing served as a chilling reminder of the danger posed by so - called lone wolves : individuals fired - up by the movement ’s rhetoric -- and trained in militia warcraft -- who go on to stage attacks without the wider group ’s blessing .
Timothy McVeigh , the man convicted of the bombing , briefly associated with militia in Michigan in the 1990s before breaking away .
When he resurfaced , in 1995 , he murdered 168 people .
Private armies have a long history in America .
In the 1850s , in the run-up to the American Civil War , anti-slavery and pro-slavery militias clashed in Kansas and Missouri , for example .
The modern militia movement was stirred into action in large part by George H.W. Bush ’s “ New World Order ” speech in 1990 .
The president ’s rhetoric fed into longstanding fears among far right groups like the John Birch Society about internationalism and the United Nations .
The resurgence then was also boosted by deadly sieges involving federal law enforcement officers in Ruby Ridge , Idaho and Waco , Texas -- events militia members viewed as examples of oppressive government force used against citizens .
Today , militia members and experts say a number of factors are driving the new surge :
* The 9/11 attacks , which revived the notion that citizens should defend the United States against threats .
* The 2001 Patriot Act , passed in the wake of 9/11 , which stirred fears that the government would use enhanced powers against ordinary citizens .
* Anger at government failure to stop mass illegal immigration from Latin America .
* The recent recession , the worst since the 1930s .
Slideshow ( 21 images )
* The election in 2008 of President Barack Obama .
Many see Obama as a Socialist bent on growing government , raising taxes and confiscating guns ; his status as the country ’s first African American president exacerbated fears about him , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
* Healthcare reform , seen as exemplifying oppressive government power and intrusion -- the contemporary version of a 1994 ban on assault weapons that enraged the right wing .
The extent to which healthcare reform is galvanizing the militia movement cannot be overstated .
In more than a dozen conversations with militia members in recent weeks , the topic came up over and over again without prompting .
Even Lackomar , who has no insurance and admits “ I ’m one paycheck away from disaster -- and I have been for years , ” says : “ I hate the reform . ”
What infuriates him , he says , is that it was enacted despite widespread opposition .
The Anti-Defamation League , which monitors militia websites , said anti-government extremists were widely citing healthcare reform as a justification for violence .
“ Many militia members and other extremists believe that the recently passed health care legislation will be followed by the mass legalization of illegal immigrants , postponement or elimination of democratic elections , martial law and gun confiscation , ” it said .
CONSPIRACY THEORIES
Allegations of infringed liberties are amplified in some sections of the media and online where false stories flagging government plans to build internment camps to detain U.S. citizens in the event of unrest or to install a New World Order can find a willing audience .
“ The Internet has really facilitated a lot of communications between the militias , ” Lackomar said .
“ It ’s also given a voice to a lot of the wacko element .
So you have got to take the good with the bad . ”
Most law enforcement agencies see the bulk of militia members as law abiding citizens exercising their rights to associate , bear arms and speak freely .
But one factor separates the mainstream “ anti- government right ” from those on the fringe , said Mark Pitcavage , ADL director of investigative research -- conspiracy theories .
“ If your conspiracy theories are pretty limited and mild , like Obama is not really a citizen , or if they ’re generic , like Obama is a Socialist and he wants to turn this into a Socialist country , that ’s one thing , ” he said .
“ But if you have specific conspiracy theories about the New World Order , the unholy trinity , FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) concentration camps , martial law or door - to - door gun confiscation , then you have crossed the line , ” he said .
Some say the partisan polarization of the country ’s news media , typified by Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox News and MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , has also contributed to the militia ’s resurgence .

Robert Churchill , author of “ To Shake Their Guns in the Tyrant ’s Face ” , a book about militias in U.S. politics , credits popular Fox News presenter Glenn Beck with bringing some ideas espoused by militias to a wider audience .
“ You are beginning to get a spillover from far right discourse into main stream Republican discourse , ” he said .
SEND MONEY , GUNS AND TEA
In the early 1990s the militias were politically isolated .
Today , they appear to be an armed point along a much bigger popular continuum that includes the Tea Party and the Oath Keepers , both gaining momentum fast .
Lackomar and other militia members , while certainly sympathetic to the Tea Party ’s goals , insist the two groups are unconnected -- even informally .
“ What we ’ve tried to do is to make it so our group does not take political positions , except for constitutional versus unconstitutional , and the necessary focus on the Second Amendment , ” Lackomar said .
Still , in conversations with Reuters , SMVM members expressed admiration for the Tea Party ’s rapid growth in the past year and its ability to draw big crowds and mainstream politicians like Sarah Palin .
The online invitation to the SMVM ’s picnic this year encouraged guests to “ show , shoot , shout then sip some tea with us . ”
Lackomar says the reference was designed to appeal “ to people who might be put off by the pure militia aspect . ”
The picnic culminated with a shooting competition .
Among the promised targets : Copies of the U.S. tax form known as the 1040 .
The Tea Party movement has sought to distance itself from the militia phenomenon , but the Oath Keeper movement seems closer to it in many ways while also sharing some common ground with the Tea Party .
Founded just a year ago by a Yale - educated lawyer and former paratrooper named Stewart Rhodes , it actively recruits serving and former military personal and law enforcement and asks them to pledge to defend the constitution -- even if it means disobeying orders .
One of their slogans is " Not on Our Watch .
At the top of its home page -- oathkeepers.org -- is a painting showing a rag - tag group of colonial militia men fighting British regulars .
On a recent warm , windy evening , a new central Texas branch of the Oath Keepers had its first official meeting at a community center annex in a residential housing complex at Fort Hood military base -- site of last November ’s mass shooting by a Muslim officer who killed 13 people .
Children rode bikes in the parking lot while Erik McKinster , a 39 - year - old sergeant in the 1st Cavalry Division , introduced the Oath Keepers and their mission to four acting and former soldiers aged from their mid-20s to around 40 .
“ We do n’t care if an unlawful order comes from a Republican or a Democrat or is bipartisan , ” he said .
“ We do n’t need to follow orders from the president if they are unlawful , the oath is to the constitution . ”
The Oath Keepers are not a militia , but they share some Constitutional militia values and echo their call to action under certain circumstances .
Among orders they pledge to ignore are “ any order to blockade American cities , thus turning them into giant concentration camps ” and any order to “ support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people . ”
The Anti-Defamation League sees them as prey to far right conspiracies .
“ They are not any orders that anyone ( in government ) would actually give , ” said Pitcavage .
“ They ’re only orders that you think someone might give if you believe in incredibly elaborate conspiracy theories . ”
McKinster , who was raised Catholic and is now an evangelical Christian and father of four , said he does n’t “ believe for a second that there are currently secret plans to impose martial law ... but there are cases from the recent past where this has happened . ”
The central Texas group has over 30 members , he said , but none among law enforcement yet .
LONE WOLF
Few people have spent as much time tracking militia groups and domestic terrorism as James Cavanaugh , who spent 36 years as a lead investigator with the U.S. bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Cavanaugh was a senior commander on investigations into the “ Unabomber ” case , the bombing by Eric Rudolph of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games , the 2002 Washington , D.C. sniper case and a rash of racially - motivated church fires in Alabama .
To cap it all , he led negotiations during the 1993 Waco siege at which around 80 people died .
He talked by telephone with Branch Davidian leader David Koresh throughout the group ’s gun battle with federal agents in an attempt to secure the release and rescue of wounded agents and children .
He is concerned that even if most militia members are law - abiding , web - fueled paranoia and wild theories can tip an individual or a splinter group toward criminality .
“ They ( militias ) all sit around the campfires , rattling sabers and looking into the woods believing that somebody ’s coming .
To make sure they come , they plan an attack , ” he said .
“ The reason they are dangerous is they live on the edge of the abyss , ” he said .
“ Sure , there are groups who dress in camouflage , stockpile guns legally , talk incessantly about crackpot conspiracy theories , that do n’t fall into the abyss .
“ The problem is there is always ... ( someone ) who attaches themselves , and if the group does n’t go over the rails the individual does , ” he said .
While security authorities say the majority of militia groups operate within the law , law enforcement is watching .
Quietly .
Lackomar says that on the eve of the 2008 presidential election , four SMVM leaders were simultaneously visited by the FBI agents , who wanted to know if the group had heard any chatter about possible violence if Obama was elected .
And the swiftness with which the Hutaree were infiltrated and brought down shows the Feds are not asleep at the wheel .
That is in part because digital tools work both ways , allowing authorities to infiltrate the groups more easily .
IT ’S A FAMILY AFFAIR
Back at the Michigan picnic near Detroit , Lee Miracle would do anything for a taste of baklava .
To the extent that the SMVM has a leader , it is Miracle , a 43 - year - old , pony - tailed postal worker who has been a member of the movement for two decades .
For Miracle , as for a handful of other SMVM members , the militia is a family affair and all eight of his children , who are aged 6 to 18 , have either trained with it or received weapons instruction .
At the picnic in early April , Miracle ’s wife Katrina , a gracious Greek - American , came too , bearing not a weapon , but an enormous tray of baklava .
One of the group ’s more ominous looking pamphlets features Lee Miracle on the cover , standing on the front steps of a house , decked out in camouflage battle gear with a machine pistol resting on his hip .
In the bottom left , a small child looks up at the armed , defiant figure in awe .
“ Defending your home is homeland defense , ” it reads .
In person , Miracle turns out to be a self - deprecating man with a fondness for jokes .
What he seemed most frustrated about at the picnic was Katrina ’s refusal to give him any baklava .
“ He has diabetes , ” she explained to a reporter .
Lackomar is also a family man .
His sun visor has a kid ’s playing card attached depicting Loudred , a Rumplestiltskin - like Pokemon character , who spends much of his time stamping his feet on the ground and shouting .
“ My daughter says it fits me because I ’m always yelling at other drivers , ” Lackomar said with a chuckle .
Yet he turns serious as he imagines scenarios under which the militia might mobilize , such as the day “ it comes crashing down and the world ends ” or the day “ the communist Chinese or the Venezuelans or whoever come marching across the border . ”
His unit has been busy learning survival skills , such as making a bow from a sapling or fashioning a rock into a razor sharp knife .
“ I carry , as part of my battle gear , a rifle and 290 rounds of ammo , ” Lackomar said .
“ If I can use a knife , and fashion a bow , and use that to feed my family , I can save the ammo for dropping bad guys . ”
The history of public sector unions goes back to 1962 when President John F. Kennedy signed executive order 10988 allowing unionization of the federal workforce .
This changed everything in the American political system .
President Kennedy ’s order swung open the door for the unrelenting rise of the unionized public workforce in many states and cities .
_ Mish
In 1962 , Kennedy signed Executive Order 10988 , which allowed collective bargaining and gave unions other powers .
The same year Kennedy also gave public - sector unions a tool to justify higher wages by signing the Salary Reform Act of 1962 , which established that there be " comparability " of public - sector pay to pay in the private sector .
One senses that even Kennedy was n't sure he was right .
The executive order , for example , excluded the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Central Intelligence Agency , and any other office performing security functions should its head deem that collective bargaining would endanger national security .
One of the slowest federal agencies to obey the order and extend recognition to unions was the Justice Department , headed by President Kennedy 's brother Robert .
Observers understood what Kennedy had done .
Later presidents might move against public unions – as Reagan did against PATCO , the air traffic controllers ' union .
But they could n't
This reluctance to allow union bargaining in sensitive areas is germane now because the American Federation of Government Employees is petitioning for the right to organize the 40,000 airport security workers across the country .
The public - sector unions recently surpassed private - sector unions in membership .
And the lengths to which Americans have gone to accommodate public - sector unions is extensive and artful .
_OCRegister
A recent poll revealed that 87 percent of Americans are aware of and concerned about runaway public debt .
This is pretty amazing , since it's hard to believe that 87 percent of Americans would be aware of any single thing no matter how important .
[ Public employees ] are n't to blame for the system in which they work .
This is not an attack on them .
But when the school board in Fairfax County , Va. , urges supervisors to raise taxes by $ 81.9 million , as reported by the Washington Examiner , and admits under questioning that the need for that is mostly because of exploding pension and medical benefit costs -- well , what Reason Magazine 's Nick Gillespie calls " the coming war over public - sector pensions " is getting close , very close .

So what 's done is done , and there is not much that we can do about it — except work until we are 80 to help fund cruises for folks that retired at 55 .
But rest assured that when this train finally arrives , it really will run us over — just like Greece , but much closer to home .
Because standing behind all of this mess is biggest black hole of them all : your Uncle Sam , sort of like a half - assed zombie king ...
But that 's a hair - raising tale I 'll save for another day .
Until then what you need to realize is this :
The status quo can not possibly be maintained .
_ SeekingAlpha
US states have fallen into an inescapable financial quagmire , owing largely to their growing debt obligations to public employee unions .
This problem is devastatingly unsolvable as long as public sector unions are allowed the same collective bargaining rights as private sector unions .
As long as public sector unions can get friendly legislators and executives elected , the exploding Ponzi scheme will continue to the bitter end .
The problem in the US goes back to the early 1960s , under green rookie president John Kennedy .
Mr. Kennedy thought he was doing the right thing , but he was never completely sure .
And although Mr. Kennedy is long gone , his legacy of union - instigated exploding debt has just begun .
There is only one governor in the entire US who seems to have the cojones to try to turn back the killing tide of public unions : Chris Christie of New Jersey .
Christie 's courage is rare among public officials , and public sector unions will do everything they can to destroy his effort to save New Jersey .
What 's to be done ?
Here is one person 's idea :
" The status quo can not be maintained . "
That qualifies as the understatement of the year .
The question is , " how badly will things fall apart when they do indeed fall ? "
It is possible that the longer we put off the reckoning , the more catastrophic will be the fallout .

The FDA has begun an investigation into whether atypical antipsychotic drugs such as Zyprexa and Seroquel are more likely to produce abnormal weight gain and diabetes in children than in adults .
The announcement came after the agency approved both drugs for use in adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 for the treatment of severe conditions such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and autism .
Atypical antipsychotics , also known as " second generation antipsychotics , " are known to cause weight gain and metabolic changes that can lead to diabetes .
Research suggests that children may be even more vulnerable to this effect .
A recent study published in thefound that children and adolescents taking atypical antipsychotics added between 8 and 15 percent to their body mass in only 11 weeks , which was sufficient for many of them to become overweight or obese .
The greatest weight gain -- an average of 19 pounds -- was seen with Zyprexa .
Zyprexa 's label already carries a warning that teenagers are more prone to weight gain , and will soon include new language encouraging doctors to try other treatments first .
Because the labels of other antipsychotics do not carry such warnings , however , the FDA is also investigating the other three drugs approved for use in children -- Seroquel , Ablify and Risperdal -- as well as Geodon , which is only approved for adults .
Because U.S. law allows doctors to prescribe drugs for unapproved uses at their own discretion , many teenagers are being treated with antipsychotic drugs for behavioral conditions such as attention deficit disorder .
No research has been conducted into whether the drugs are effective for these uses , however .
Antipsychotics are the best - selling drug class in the United States , with annual sales of $ 14.6 billion .
Zyprexa is the top seller for maker Eli Lilly , with $ 2.2 billion a year in U.S. sales and $ 4.7 billion worldwide .
Seroquel makes $ 2.9 billion for AstraZeneca each year in U.S. sales alone , and a total of $ 4.7 billion globally .

The following statement was released today by leaders of Physicians for a National Health Program , www.pnhp.org.
Their signatures appear below .
As much as we would like to join the celebration of the House ’s passage of the health bill last night , in good conscience we cannot .
We take no comfort in seeing aspirin dispensed for the treatment of cancer .
Instead of eliminating the root of the problem – the profit - driven , private health insurance industry – this costly new legislation will enrich and further entrench these firms .
The bill would require millions of Americans to buy private insurers ’ defective products , and turn over to them vast amounts of public money .
The hype surrounding the new health bill is belied by the facts :
About 23 million people will remain uninsured nine years out .
That figure translates into an estimated 23,000 unnecessary deaths annually and an incalculable toll of suffering .
Millions of middle - income people will be pressured to buy commercial health insurance policies costing up to 9.5 percent of their income but covering an average of only 70 percent of their medical expenses , potentially leaving them vulnerable to financial ruin if they become seriously ill .
Many will find such policies too expensive to afford or , if they do buy them , too expensive to use because of the high co-pays and deductibles .
Insurance firms will be handed at least $ 447 billion in taxpayer money to subsidize the purchase of their shoddy products .
This money will enhance their financial and political power , and with it their ability to block future reform .
The bill will drain about $ 40 billion from Medicare payments to safety - net hospitals , threatening the care of the tens of millions who will remain uninsured .
People with employer - based coverage will be locked into their plan ’s limited network of providers , face ever - rising costs and erosion of their health benefits .
Many , even most , will eventually face steep taxes on their benefits as the cost of insurance grows .
Health care costs will continue to skyrocket , as the experience with the Massachusetts plan ( after which this bill is patterned ) amply demonstrates .
The much - vaunted insurance regulations – e.g. ending denials on the basis of pre-existing conditions – are riddled with loopholes , thanks to the central role that insurers played in crafting the legislation .
Older people can be charged up to three times more than their younger counterparts , and large companies with a predominantly female workforce can be charged higher gender - based rates at least until 2017 .
Women ’s reproductive rights will be further eroded , thanks to the burdensome segregation of insurance funds for abortion and for all other medical services .
It did n’t have to be like this .
Whatever salutary measures are contained in this bill , e.g. additional funding for community health centers , could have been enacted on a stand - alone basis .
Similarly , the expansion of Medicaid – a woefully underfunded program that provides substandard care for the poor – could have been done separately , along with an increase in federal appropriations to upgrade its quality .
But instead the Congress and the Obama administration have saddled Americans with an expensive package of onerous individual mandates , new taxes on workers ’ health plans , countless sweetheart deals with the insurers and Big Pharma , and a perpetuation of the fragmented , dysfunctional , and unsustainable system that is taking such a heavy toll on our health and economy today .
This bill ’s passage reflects political considerations , not sound health policy .
As physicians , we cannot accept this inversion of priorities .
We seek evidence - based remedies that will truly help our patients , not placebos .
A genuine remedy is in plain sight .
Sooner rather than later , our nation will have to adopt a single - payer national health insurance program , an improved Medicare for all .
Only a single - payer plan can assure truly universal , comprehensive and affordable care to all .
By replacing the private insurers with a streamlined system of public financing , our nation could save $ 400 billion annually in unnecessary , wasteful administrative costs .
That ’s enough to cover all the uninsured and to upgrade everyone else ’s coverage without having to increase overall U.S. health spending by one penny .
Moreover , only a single - payer system offers effective tools for cost control like bulk purchasing , negotiated fees , global hospital budgeting and capital planning .
Polls show nearly two - thirds of the public supports such an approach , and a recent survey shows 59 percent of U.S. physicians support government action to establish national health insurance .
All that is required to achieve it is the political will .
The major provisions of the present bill do not go into effect until 2014 .
Although we will be counseled to “ wait and see ” how this reform plays out , we cannot wait , nor can our patients .
The stakes are too high .
We pledge to continue our work for the only equitable , financially responsible and humane remedy for our health care mess : single - payer national health insurance , an expanded and improved Medicare for All .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Liberal Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced on Friday he would resign , and President Barack Obama promised to name a successor quickly , setting the stage for an expected partisan election - year Senate confirmation battle .
Stevens , one of the oldest and longest - serving justices in history , sent a letter notifying Obama of his retirement this summer .
Stevens , who turns 90 in 11 days , joined the court in 1975 after being appointed by President Gerald Ford .
An administration official said Obama was considering about 10 potential nominees to replace Stevens .
At the White House , Obama paid tribute to Stevens and said his nominee , like Stevens , would know that powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens .
“ I will seek someone in the coming weeks with similar qualities -- an independent mind , a record of excellence and integrity , a fierce dedication to the rule of law , and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people , ” Obama said .
A bruising confirmation battle could sidetrack Democratic plans to focus on the economy and job creation ahead of November ’s congressional elections in which Republicans hope to regain control of Congress .
In the Senate , which will vote on the nomination , Democrats praised Stevens and urged Obama to name someone who can continue his legacy while Republicans promised thorough scrutiny of any nominee .
Obama is expected to choose someone who will follow the same basic judicial philosophy as Stevens and is unlikely to change the court ’s overall ideological balance , which has been closely divided with five conservatives and four liberals .
Stevens has supported abortion and gay rights and gun restrictions and opposed the death penalty .
In recent major business cases , he wrote rulings allowing lawsuits against tobacco and pharmaceutical companies .
Obama said he would move swiftly to name a nominee to ensure the new justice was seated for the court ’s new term in October .
Stevens is retiring at the end of the current term , which lasts through June .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made clear his party would be heard in the confirmation process .
“ Americans can expect Senate Republicans to make a sustained and vigorous case for judicial restraint and the fundamental importance of an even - handed reading of the law , ” he said .
TWO - EDGED SWORD
The opportunity to make a second appointment to the high court in just two years is a double - edged sword for Obama .
It gives him a chance to put his stamp on the court but also is likely to stall his agenda in Congress amid partisan bickering .
Obama has made a series of centrist decisions that have angered both Republicans and liberal base .
Last year , he named Sonia Sotomayor as the court ’s first Hispanic , replacing Justice David Souter .
She was confirmed on a largely party - line vote of 68 - 31 .
Among the leading candidates for the opening are Solicitor General Elena Kagan and U.S. appeals court judges Diane Wood and Merrick Garland .

Wood is one of the nation ’s top experts on international competition law while Garland and Kagan do not have much of a record in business cases .
All are considered moderate liberals and could face varying degrees of Republican opposition .
But even conservative activists said each probably would win a simple majority vote in the Senate , where Democrats hold 59 of 100 seats .
The confirmation battle could dominate Congress for some time and make it tougher for Obama ’s fellow Democrats to focus on reducing the U.S. unemployment rate , expected to be a key issue in congressional elections .
It also could complicate last - ditch efforts by some Democrats and Republicans to win Senate passage of compromise legislation to combat global climate change .
POLITICAL BATTLE
U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , who will chair the confirmation hearing for Obama ’s nominee , said he expected the president to consult members of both political parties before making his pick .
“ I hope that senators on both sides of the aisle will make this process a thoughtful and civil discourse , ” Leahy said .
There was no immediate indication on when the confirmation hearings would be held but it likely will be before Congress departs for its August recess in advance of the November congressional elections .
Supreme Court appointments have become major political battles in Congress .
The high court decides contentious social issues such as abortion and the death penalty and high - stakes business disputes .
It is too early to say what major issues the court will confront in the future .
Among the handful of cases to be decided next term , the justices will consider whether vaccine manufacturers can be sued for damages and a free - speech case about anti-gay protests at funerals for U.S. military members killed in Iraq .
AMSTERDAM , The Netherlands —
In the back street cannabis den , a French - speaking Arab youth with a pierced lower lip and a rhinestone encrusted baseball cap leans across the bar to order his fix of choice .
" Hot chocolate , please , " he intones in heavily accentuated English .
" With whipped cream ? " asks the fresh - faced young barrista in the 420 Cafe .
" Yes , please . ”
A group of teenage English boys , their polite manners contrasting with the hair - raising heavy metal designs on their T - shirts , is also drinking the warm , frothy brew .
Above them a large flat screen TV is showing a documentary about Antarctic bird life .
A penguin protects her chicks from a hungry gull as two Spanish girls debate whether to get high on " White Widow , " “ Blueberry ” — brands from the marijuana menu — or to take a slice of the peanut butter and white chocolate weed - laced " space cake . "
From inside this cozy , 100 - year - old - bar - turned - hash - house it appears the Amsterdam drug scene has mellowed since the Dutch government began to " decriminalize " cannabis in the late 1970s .
" Some specimens of my tribe , and I think I can include myself , are considered to be respectable citizens , " said Michael Veling , owner of the 420 Cafe .
“ We even have a working relationship with the tax office , ” added Veling , a spokesman for the Cannabis Retailers Association which represents many of the more than 700 “ coffee shops ” that openly serve the drug in the Netherlands .
After 30 years of high times , Amsterdam continues to attract waves of youthful tourists eager to smoke a reefer or two without having to look over their shoulder for the cops .
However Dutch attitudes are changing .
Successive conservative - led governments have tightened restrictions on cannabis sales , while local youngsters seem increasingly indifferent to the coffee shops ’ charms .
[ Analysis : the awesome power of the illegal high ]
A report from European Union ’s drug monitoring center made headlines in November when it showed young Dutch people lagged well behind many of their European neighbors when it came to smoking weed .
According to the survey , 11.4 percent of Dutch people aged 15 to 24 had consumed cannabis over the previous year , down from 14.3 percent eight years earlier .
The Netherlands was ranked 13th out of 23 nations — way behind countries such as Spain , Italy and the Czech Republic , which register more than double the Dutch rate .
In the 420 Cafe , the only locals in view were a group of 50 - something friends of the owner nodding contentedly to the Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix tunes coming from the sound system .
“ It ’s not as exciting [ for Dutch kids ] as it is in other countries and we had education together with the tolerant attitude , so our kids know about drugs , ” said Veling .
“ Our customers are mainly from England and the United States , but because of the economic crisis the percentage of continental Europeans has risen , ” he said .
“ Last summer we saw the first wave of Chinese middle class , that ’s a very promising market . ”
Veling is perhaps unique among coffee shop owners in that he is also an active member and one - time city councilor with the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal party of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende , which has done much to clamp down on the Dutch dope trade in recent years .
Coffee shops have seen the maximum amount they can sell customers reduced from 30 grams to 5 grams .
In 2007 a ban on cannabis outlets serving alcohol was enforced , meaning coffee shop owners had to choose between booze or pot — which explains why the strongest drinks at Cafe 420 are coffee , tea and chocolate .
Moreover , advertising for cannabis is banned , so while souvenir shops selling T - shirts festooned with marijuana - leaf designs abound , coffee shops are not allowed to use the image .
Many city councils prohibit the opening of new coffee shops and are quick to shut down any that break the rules .
A ban on smoking tobacco in all Dutch cafes and bars hit the coffee shops hard when it was introduced in July 2008 , since cannabis cigarettes are often mixed with tobacco .
Now the rule is widely ignored .
" There are all kinds of ridiculous regulations , ” said Fredrick Polak , a veteran campaigner for more liberal drug laws .
“ It does not work , it is counterproductive … the state has no business interfering with individual grown - up citizens and what they want to put in their bodies . "
Polak , a white - haired , 67 - year - old psychiatrist who works at Amsterdam ’s drug dependency unit , said Dutch authorities have caved into pressure from neighboring nations concerned that so many young people were buying cannabis in the Netherlands to take back home .
French , Belgian and German authorities have been particularly worried about a proliferation of outlets in border cities , so the Dutch government has sought to crack down on “ drug tourism . ”
The cities of Bergen op Zoom and Rosendaal near the Belgian border closed down six of their eight coffee shops last year after residents complained about rowdy behavior from an estimated 25,000 drug tourists passing through every week .
In the southeastern city of Maastricht , authorities have proposed making coffee shops members - only clubs , effectively banning foreign day - trippers .
The country ’s largest coffee shop , Checkpoint in the southern border town of Terneuzen , was closed down in 2008 at a time when it was reportedly serving 3,000 customers a day .
Polak complains that criminal elements continue to play a leading role in the cannabis trade due to an anomaly in the laws :
While the retailing is tolerated , wholesale trade remains illegal , meaning coffee shop owners often have to get their supplies from criminal networks , which are also involved in illegal exports of the drug and violent turf wars .
“ With our system , for people who want to smoke marijuana it ’s very pleasant , but on the supply side here there is no control , it ’s still completely illegal , so the wrong people make very much money , " Polak said .
Six states used turbines to generate more than 5 percent of their electricity last year , as wind power weathered a second year of recession to post new records of generation , the industry 's trade group reported today .
Iowa led the pack for wind 's share in the market , producing 14.2 percent of its electric power from wind last year .
It ranked second to Texas in the amount of wind generation capacity , as the Lone Star State exceeded 9,000 megawatts at the end of last year .
More than 10,000 megawatts of new generating capacity was built nationwide last year , and wind power produced almost 2 percent of all U.S. electricity , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) said .
" Jobs , business opportunities , clean air , energy security -- wind power is delivering today on all those fronts for Americans , " said Denise Bode , the group 's CEO .
" Our annual report documents an industry hard at work and on the verge of explosive growth if the right policies -- including a national renewable electricity standard -- are put in place . "
AWEA 's annual market report reflects a patchwork of wind development , which remains concentrated in the Great Plains and Pacific Coast states , with smaller clusters along the Great Lakes .
The Southeast , in the Appalachians ' shadow , where onshore wind resources are weakest , comes up empty on AWEA 's maps of new project starts .
The report acknowledges constraints on wind development caused by shortages of transmission capacity to link wind centers with urban areas .
AWEA said that nearly 300,000 megawatts of proposed wind projects are in line for connections to the grid .
Several studies and reviews on how to expand transmission to handle more renewable power are under way around the country , but Congress has not been able to agree on new policies for siting power lines or apportioning their costs .
Wind power growth is also being squeezed by low prices for natural gas - fired electricity and by the absence of a national renewable energy standard , AWEA says .
In a conference call with reporters , Don Furman , the president of AWEA 's board , described such a standard as the linchpin of an international " policy race " that will determine the sector 's fate .
" The wind industry was essentially invented in the U.S. , and today , most of the manufacturing is moving offshore , " Furman said .
" To remain competitive , we 're going to have to have those policies . "
This year , the electricity produced by U.S. wind generators , supplanting power from gas - and coal - fired plants , will cut national carbon dioxide emissions by 62 million metric tons , equivalent to taking 10.5 million cars off the road , AWEA said .
The small - wind market , for turbines rated at 100 kilowatts or less and generally designed to power individual businesses or homes , grew 15 percent in 2009 , the association reported .
That was down slightly from the previous year 's expansion .
The association stressed the small but growing contribution that wind power installations are making to U.S. jobs and manufacturing output .
It said that the wind industry " supported " 85,000 jobs last year .
It counted nine U.S. turbine manufacturers and more than 200 facilities , including parts suppliers , that serve the industry .
GE Energy continues to be the U.S. industry 's largest supplier , followed by Denmark 's Vestas , Germany 's Siemens , and Mitsubishi of Japan .

FOR anyone who thinks that climate science must be unimpeachable to be useful , the past few months have been a depressing time .
A large stash of e-mails from and to investigators at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia provided more than enough evidence for concern about the way some climate science is done .
That the picture they painted , when seen in the round — or as much of the round as the incomplete selection available allows — was not as alarming as the most damning quotes taken out of context is little comfort .
They offered plenty of grounds for both shame and blame .
At about the same time , glaciologists pointed out that a statement concerning Himalayan glaciers in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was wrong .
This led to the discovery of other poorly worded or poorly sourced claims made by the IPCC , which seeks to create a scientific consensus for the world 's politicians , and to more general worries about the panel 's partiality , transparency and leadership .
Taken together , and buttressed by previous criticisms , these two revelations have raised levels of scepticism about the consensus on climate change to new heights .
Increased antsiness about action on climate change can also be traced to the recession , the unedifying spectacle of last December 's climate - change summit in Copenhagen , the political realities of the American Senate and an abnormally cold winter in much of the northern hemisphere .
The new doubts about the science , though , are clearly also a part of that story .
Should they be ?
In any complex scientific picture of the world there will be gaps , misperceptions and mistakes .
Whether your impression is dominated by the whole or the holes will depend on your attitude to the project at hand .
You might say that some see a jigsaw where others see a house of cards .
Jigsaw types have in mind an overall picture and are open to bits being taken out , moved around or abandoned should they not fit .
Those who see houses of cards think that if any piece is removed , the whole lot falls down .
When it comes to climate , academic scientists are jigsaw types , dissenters from their view house - of - cards - ists .
The defenders of the consensus tend to stress the general consilience of their efforts — the way that data , theory and modelling back each other up .
Doubters see this as a thoroughgoing version of “ confirmation bias ” , the tendency people have to select the evidence that agrees with their original outlook .
But although there is undoubtedly some degree of that ( the errors in the IPCC , such as they are , all make the problem look worse , not better ) there is still genuine power to the way different arguments and datasets in climate science tend to reinforce each other .
The doubters tend to focus on specific bits of empirical evidence , not on the whole picture .
This is worthwhile — facts do need to be well grounded — but it can make the doubts seem more fundamental than they are .
People often assume that data are simple , graspable and trustworthy , whereas theory is complex , recondite and slippery , and so give the former priority .
In the case of climate change , as in much of science , the reverse is at least as fair a picture .
Data are vexatious ; theory is quite straightforward .
Constructing a set of data that tells you about the temperature of the Earth over time is much harder than putting together the basic theoretical story of how the temperature should be changing , given what else is known about the universe in general .
Absorb and reflect
The most relevant part of that universal what - else is the requirement laid down by thermodynamics that , for a planet at a constant temperature , the amount of energy absorbed as sunlight and the amount emitted back to space in the longer wavelengths of the infra-red must be the same .
In the case of the Earth , the amount of sunlight absorbed is 239 watts per square metre .
According to the laws of thermodynamics , a simple body emitting energy at that rate should have a temperature of about – 18 ºC .
You do not need a comprehensive set of surface - temperature data to notice that this is not the average temperature at which humanity goes about its business .
The discrepancy is due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , which absorb and re-emit infra-red radiation , and thus keep the lower atmosphere , and the surface , warm ( see the diagram below ) .
The radiation that gets out to the cosmos comes mostly from above the bulk of the greenhouse gases , where the air temperature is indeed around – 18ºC .
Adding to those greenhouse gases in the atmosphere makes it harder still for the energy to get out .
As a result , the surface and the lower atmosphere warm up .
This changes the average temperature , the way energy moves from the planet 's surface to the atmosphere above it and the way that energy flows from equator to poles , thus changing the patterns of the weather .
No one doubts that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , good at absorbing infra-red radiation .
It is also well established that human activity is putting more of it into the atmosphere than natural processes can currently remove .
Measurements made since the 1950s show the level of carbon dioxide rising year on year , from 316 parts per million ( ppm ) in 1959 to 387 ppm in 2009 .
Less direct records show that the rise began about 1750 , and that the level was stable at around 280 ppm for about 10,000 years before that .
This fits with human history : in the middle of the 18th century people started to burn fossil fuels in order to power industrial machinery .
Analysis of carbon isotopes , among other things , shows that the carbon dioxide from industry accounts for most of the build - up in the atmosphere .
The serious disagreements start when discussion turns to the level of warming associated with that rise in carbon dioxide .
For various reasons , scientists would not expect temperatures simply to rise in step with the carbon dioxide ( and other greenhouse gases ) .
The climate is a noisy thing , with ups and downs of its own that can make trends hard to detect .
What 's more , the oceans can absorb a great deal of heat — and there is evidence that they have done so — and in storing heat away , they add inertia to the system .
This means that the atmosphere will warm more slowly than a given level of greenhouse gas would lead you to expect .
There are three records of land - surface temperature put together from thermometer readings in common use by climatologists , one of which is compiled at the Climatic Research Unit of e-mail infamy .
They all show warming , and , within academia , their reliability is widely accepted .
Various industrious bloggers are not so convinced .
They think that adjustments made to the raw data introduce a warming bias .
They also think the effects of urbanisation have confused the data because towns , which are sources of heat , have grown up near weather stations .
Anthony Watts , a retired weather forecaster who blogs on climate , has set up a site , surfacestations.org , where volunteers can help record the actual sites of weather instruments used to provide climate data , showing whether they are situated close to asphalt or affected by sources of bias .
Those who compile the data are aware of this urban heat - island effect , and try in various ways to compensate for it .
Their efforts may be insufficient , but various lines of evidence suggest that any errors it is inserting are not too bad .
The heat - island effect is likely to be strongest on still nights , for example , yet trends from data recorded on still nights are not that different from those from windy ones .
And the temperature of waters at the surface of the seas shows similar trends to that on land over the past century , as does the record of air temperature over the oceans as measured at night ( see chart 1 ) .
A recent analysis by Matthew Menne and his colleagues at America 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , published in the Journal of Geophysical Research , argued that trends calculated from climate stations that surfacestation.org found to be poorly sited and from those it found well sited were more or less indistinguishable .
Mr Watts has problems with that analysis , and promises a thorough study of the project 's findings later .
There is undoubtedly room for improvement in the surface - temperature record — not least because , at the moment , it provides only monthly mean temperatures , and there are other things people would like to know about .
( When worrying about future heatwaves , for example , hot days and nights , not hot months , are the figures of most interest . )
In February Britain 's Met ( ie , meteorological )
Office called for the creation of a new set of temperature databases compiled in rigorously transparent ways and open to analysis and interpretation by all and sundry .
Such an initiative would serve science well , help restore the credibility of land - surface records , and demonstrate an openness on the part of climate science which has not always been evident in the past .
Simplify and amplify
For many , the facts that an increase in carbon dioxide should produce warming , and that warming is observed in a number of different indicators and measurements , add up to a primafacie case for accepting that greenhouse gases are warming the Earth and that the higher levels of greenhouse gases that business as usual would bring over the course of this century would warm it a lot further .
The warming caused by a given increase in carbon dioxide can be calculated on the basis of laboratory measurements which show how much infra-red radiation at which specific wavelengths carbon dioxide molecules absorb .
This sort of work shows that if you double the carbon dioxide level you get about 1 ºC of warming .
So the shift from the pre-industrial 280 ppm to 560 ppm , a level which on current trends might be reached around 2070 , makes the world a degree warmer .
If the level were to double again , to 1,100 ppm , which seems unlikely , you would get another degree .
The amount of warming expected for a doubling of carbon dioxide has become known as the “ climate sensitivity ” — and a climate sensitivity of one degree would be small enough to end most climate - related worries .
But carbon dioxide 's direct effect is not the only thing to worry about .
Several types of feedback can amplify its effect .
The most important involve water vapour , which is now quite well understood , and clouds , which are not .
It is on these areas that academic doubters tend to focus .
As carbon dioxide warms the air it also moistens it , and because water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas , that will provide further warming .
Other things people do — such as clearing land for farms , and irrigating them — also change water vapour levels , and these can be significant on a regional level .
But the effects are not as large .
Climate doubters raise various questions about water vapour , some trivial , some serious .
A trivial one is to argue that because water vapour is such a powerful greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide is unimportant .
But this ignores the fact that the level of water vapour depends on temperature .
A higher level of carbon dioxide , by contrast , governs temperature , and can endure for centuries .
A more serious doubting point has to do with the manner of the moistening .
In the 1990s Richard Lindzen , a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , pointed out that there were ways in which moistening might not greatly enhance warming .
The subsequent two decades have seen much observational and theoretical work aimed at this problem .
New satellites can now track water vapour in the atmosphere far better than before ( see chart 2 ) .
As a result preliminary estimates based on simplifications have been shown to be reasonably robust , with water - vapour feedbacks increasing the warming to be expected from a doubling of carbon dioxide from 1 º C without water vapour to about 1.7ºC .
Dr Lindzen agrees that for parts of the atmosphere without clouds this is probably about right .
This moistening offers a helpful way to see what sort of climate change is going on .
When water vapour condenses into cloud droplets it gives up energy and warms the surrounding air .
This means that in a world where greenhouse warming is wetting the atmosphere , the lower parts of the atmosphere should warm at a greater rate than the surface , most notably in the tropics .
At the same time , in an effect that does not depend on water vapour , an increase in carbon dioxide will cause the upper stratosphere to cool .
This pattern of warming down below and cooling up on top is expected from greenhouse warming , but would not be expected if something other than the greenhouse effect was warming the world : a hotter sun would heat the stratosphere more , not less .
During the 1990s this was a point on which doubters laid considerable weight , because satellite measurements did not show the warming in the lower atmosphere that theory would predict .
Over the past ten years , though , this picture has changed .
To begin with , only one team was turning data from the relevant instruments that have flown on weather satellites since the 1970s into a temperature record resolved by altitude .
Now others have joined them , and identified errors in the way that the calculations ( which are complex and depend on a number of finicky details ) were carried out .
Though different teams still get different amounts and rates of warming in the lower atmosphere , there is no longer any denying that warming is seen .
Stratospheric cooling is complicated by the effects of ozone depletion , but those do not seem large enough to account for the degree of cooling that has been seen there , further strengthening the case for warming by the greenhouse effect and not some other form of climate perturbation .
On top of the effect of water vapour , though , the clouds that form from it provide a further and greater source of uncertainty .
On the one hand , the droplets of water of which these are made also have a strong greenhouse effect .
On the other , water vapour is transparent , whereas clouds reflect light .
In particular , they reflect sunlight back into space , stopping it from being absorbed by the Earth .
Clouds can thus have a marked cooling effect and also a marked warming effect .
Which will grow more in a greenhouse world ?
Model maze
It is at this point that detailed computer models of the climate need to be called into play .
These models slice the atmosphere and oceans into stacks of three - dimensional cells .
The state of the air ( temperature , pressure , etc ) within each cell is continuously updated on the basis of what its state used to be , what is going on in adjacent cells and the greenhousing and other properties of its contents .
These models are phenomenally complex .
They are also gross oversimplifications .
The size of the cells stops them from explicitly capturing processes that take place at scales smaller than a hundred kilometres or so , which includes the processes that create clouds .
Despite their limitations , climate models do capture various aspects of the real world 's climate : seasons , trade winds , monsoons and the like .
They also put clouds in the places where they are seen .
When used to explore the effect of an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases on the climate these models , which have been developed by different teams , all predict more warming than greenhouse gases and water - vapour feedback can supply unaided .
The models assessed for the IPCC 's fourth report had sensitivities ranging from 2.1 ºC to 4.4ºC .
The IPCC estimated that if clouds were not included , the range would be more like 1.7 ºC to 2.1ºC .
So in all the models clouds amplify warming , and in some the amplification is large .
However , there are so far no compelling data on how clouds are affecting warming in fact , as opposed to in models .
Ray Pierrehumbert , a climate scientist at the University of Chicago who generally has a strong way with sceptics , is happy to agree that there might be processes by which clouds rein in , rather than exaggerate , greenhouse - warming effects , but adds that , so far , few have been suggested in any way that makes sense .
Dr Lindzen and a colleague suggested a plausible mechanism in 2001 .
They proposed that tropical clouds in an atmosphere with more greenhouse gas might dry out neighbouring parts of the sky , making them more transparent to outgoing infra-red .
The evidence Dr Lindzen brought to bear in support of this was criticised in ways convincing enough to discourage other scientists from taking the idea further .
A subsequent paper by Dr Lindzen on observations that would be compatible with his ideas about low sensitivity has also suffered significant criticisms , and he accepts many of them .
But having taken them on board has not , he thinks , invalidated his line of research .
Arguments based on past climates also suggest that sensitivity is unlikely to be low .
Much of the cooling during the ice ages was maintained by the presence of a large northern hemisphere ice cap reflecting away a lot of sunlight , but carbon dioxide levels were lower , too .
To account for all of the cooling , especially in the southern hemisphere , is most easily done with a sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide higher than Dr Lindzen would have it .
Before the ice age , the Earth had a little more carbon dioxide and was a good bit warmer than today — which suggests a fairly high sensitivity .
More recently , the dip in global temperatures after the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 , which inserted a layer of sunlight - diffusing sulphur particles into the stratosphere , also bolsters the case for a sensitivity near the centre of the model range — although sensitivity to a transient event and the warming that follows a slow doubling of carbon dioxide are not exactly the same sort of thing .
Logs and blogs
Moving into data from the past , though , brings the argument to one of the areas that blog - based doubters have chosen as a preferred battleground : the temperature record of the past millennium , as construed from natural records that are both sensitive to temperature and capable of precise dating .
Tree rings are the obvious , and most controversial , example .
Their best known use has been in a reconstruction of temperatures over the past millennium published in Nature in 1998 and widely known as the hockey stick , because it was mostly flat but had a blade sticking up at the 20th - century end .
Stephen McIntyre , a retired Canadian mining consultant , was struck by the very clear message of this graph and delved into the science behind it , a process that left him and followers of his blog , Climate Audit , intensely sceptical about its value .
In 2006 a review by America 's National Research Council endorsed points Mr McIntyre and his colleagues made on some methods used to make the hockey stick , and on doubts over a specific set of tree rings .
Despite this it sided with the hockey stick 's overall conclusion , which did little to stem the criticism .
The fact that tree - ring records do not capture recent warming adds to the scepticism about the value of such records .
For many of Mr McIntyre 's fans ( though it is not , he says , his central concern ) the important thing about this work is that the hockey stick seemed to abolish the “ medieval warm period ” .
This is a time when temperatures are held to have been as high as or higher than today 's — a warmth associated with the Norse settlement of Greenland and vineyards in England .
Many climate scientists suspect this phenomenon was given undue prominence by climatologists of earlier generations with an unduly Eurocentric view of the world .
There is evidence for cooling at the time in parts of the Pacific .
Doubters for the most part are big fans of the medieval warm period , and see in the climate scientists ' arguments an attempt to rewrite history so as to maximise the drama of today 's warming and minimise the possibility that natural variation might explain the 20th - century record .
The possibility of more climatic variability , though , does not , in itself , mean that greenhouse warming is not happening too .
And if the medieval warmth were due to some external factor , such as a slightly brighter sun , that would suggest that the climate was indeed quite sensitive .
Looking at the more recent record , logged as it has been by thermometers , you might hope it could shed light on which of the climate models is closest to being right , and thus what the sensitivity actually is .
Unfortunately , other confounding factors make this difficult .
Greenhouse gases are not the only climatically active ingredients that industry , farming and land clearance add to the atmosphere .
There are also aerosols — particles of pollution floating in the wind .
Some aerosols cool the atmosphere .
Other , sootier , ones warm it .
The aggregate effect , globally , is thought to be a cooling , possibly a quite strong one .
But the overall history of aerosols , which are mostly short - lived , is nothing like as well known as that of greenhouse gases , and it is unlikely that any of the models are properly capturing their chemistry or their effects on clouds .
Taking aerosols into account , climate models do a pretty good job of emulating the climate trends of the 20th century .
This seems odd , since the models have different sensitivities .
In practice , it appears that the way the aerosols are dealt with in the models and the sensitivity of those models tend to go hand in hand ; sensitive models also have strong cooling aerosol effects .
Reto Knutti of ETH Zurich , an expert on climate sensitivity , sees this as evidence that , consciously or unconsciously , aerosols are used as counterweights to sensitivity to ensure that the trends look right .
This is not evidence of dishonesty , and it is not necessarily a bad thing .
Since the models need to be able to capture the 20th century , putting them together in such a way that they end up doing so makes sense .
But it does mean that looking at how well various models match the 20th century does not give a good indication of the climate 's actual sensitivity to greenhouse gas .
Adding the uncertainties about sensitivity to uncertainties about how much greenhouse gas will be emitted , the IPCC expects the temperature to have increased by 1.1 ºC to 6.4ºC over the course of the 21st century .
That low figure would sit fairly well with the sort of picture that doubters think science is ignoring or covering up .
In this account , the climate has natural fluctuations larger in scale and longer in duration ( such as that of the medieval warm period ) than climate science normally allows , and the Earth 's recent warming is caused mostly by such a fluctuation , the effects of which have been exaggerated by a contaminated surface - temperature record .
Greenhouse warming has been comparatively minor , this argument would continue , because the Earth 's sensitivity to increased levels of carbon dioxide is lower than that seen in models , which have an inbuilt bias towards high sensitivities .
As a result subsequent warming , even if emissions continue full bore , will be muted too .
It seems unlikely that the errors , misprisions and sloppiness in a number of different types of climate science might all favour such a minimised effect .
That said , the doubters tend to assume that climate scientists are not acting in good faith , and so are happy to believe exactly that .
Climategate and the IPCC 's problems have reinforced this position .
Using the IPCC 's assessment of probabilities , the sensitivity to a doubling of carbon dioxide of less than 1.5 ºC in such a scenario has perhaps one chance in ten of being correct .
But if the IPCC were underestimating things by a factor of five or so , that would still leave only a 50:50 chance of such a desirable outcome .
The fact that the uncertainties allow you to construct a relatively benign future does not allow you to ignore futures in which climate change is large , and in some of which it is very dangerous indeed .
The doubters are right that uncertainties are rife in climate science .
They are wrong when they present that as a reason for inaction .
A judge has sentenced a Missouri man to two years in prison and a fine for illegally recording " The Dark Knight ’ in a theater and selling it as pirated DVDs , the Motion Picture Association announced .
Robert Henderson of Grandview , Missouri , was ordered to pay $ 24,738 in fines and serve 24 months in federal prison for recording the movie .
Henderson pleaded guilty after being caught recording the film in 2008 in an MPAA investigation .
“ This is an appropriate sentence for a very serious crime , and we hope it will serve as a warning to would - be movie thieves that they will face severe consequences for engaging in these activities , " said Mike Robinson , Sr. Vice President Content Protection , Chief of Operations for the MPAA .
Henderson will get three years probation .
Here ’s the full release :
Los Angeles – A Missouri man was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Kansas City to 24 months in federal prison for illegally trafficking in counterfeit DVDs after using a recording device to illegally record “ The Dark Knight . ” Judge Fernando J. Gaitan also ordered the defendant , Robert Henderson of Grandview , Mo. , to pay $ 24,738 in restitution .
Henderson ’s prison sentence will be followed by three years probation .
“ The theft of films by camcording is a serious threat to the health of the motion picture industry and the 2.4 million Americans it employs , ” said Mike Robinson , Sr. Vice President Content Protection , Chief of Operations for the MPAA .
“ This is an appropriate sentence for a very serious crime , and we hope it will serve as a warning to would - be movie thieves that they will face severe consequences for engaging in these activities . ”
Henderson pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement for using a digital camera to record “ The Dark Knight ” on July 18 , 2008 , when he was apprehended as part of an investigation by the MPAA .
“ We are grateful to everyone involved in the apprehension and prosecution of this defendant and want to particularly thank Beth Phillips , U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri ; Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew P. Wolesky ; the Lee ’s Summit Police Department ; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation , ” continued Robinson .
The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act enacted in 2005 made camcording in a theater a federal felony ( camcording in theaters is also prohibited by many state statutes ) and established new penalties for pirating works that have not yet been released commercially .
First - time violators can be sentenced to three and five years , respectively , for these crimes and fined up to $ 250,000 .
The Economist asked Americans : " What is the best way to cut the deficit ? "
5 % said , " increase taxes . "
62 % said , " reduce government spending . "
OK , said The Economist .
" Here is a list of things the federal government spends money on .
Which things should the government spend less on ? "
As you can see in the chart above , over two - thirds of Americans do n't want to reduce spending on anything single category , except foreign aid .
And as Mother Jones points out , foreign aid represents less than 1 % of America 's total spending .
Beyond that , there were only four areas that even a quarter of the population was willing to cut : mass transit , agriculture , housing , and the environment .
At a rough guess , these areas account for about 3 % of the federal budget .
You could slash their budgets by a third and still barely make a dent in federal spending .
Party on !
The Europa League , which sounded like a new far - right party when Uefa invented it , has revealed a truth about top - level football , in which every little setback starts a clamour to hand over £ 40 m for some hot - shot so his school of agent - sharks can feed .
Days ago a caller to a phone - in berated Manchester United for buying " a dud " in Mame Biram Diouf .
It had escaped the hot brain of this irate Dave from Dewsbury that Diouf is 22 and joined United in January from Norwegian football .
Five appearances and one goal later , the young Senegalese striker , who was recommended by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer , was being dismissed as a flop despite all the precedents of youngsters from foreign countries needing time to download big - club software .
Fulham 's training ground at Motspur Park is in the kind of nondescript south London suburb the Kinks or the Jam might have written a tune about .
But it feels just like Carrington .
It is big , well ‑equipped and radiates purpose .
It is a place where a manager and his coaches extract the maximum productivity from the talent they already have instead of dreaming about the star names they would love to buy .
For a decade or more English football has been unable to see beyond getting and spending .
The elimination of all four Premier League clubs from the Champions League by the quarter - final stage has put fresh heat on chief executives to burn cash they do n't have .
Then , 21 seconds into a Europa League quarter - final against Wolfsburg , Bobby Zamora , below , once the bête noire of Fulham fans , fires Roy Hodgson 's team into the semi-finals in the 16th match of a campaign that started on 30 July in Lithuania , and that has also taken them past Shakhtar Donetsk ( the holders ) and Juventus .
The mid-table Premier League game at Anfield today is also a rehearsal for a potential European final in Hamburg on 12 May .
For Liverpool , who face Atlético Madrid in the last four of the Consolation Cup , Uefa 's Byzantine Europa construct feels like a punishment : a walk of shame that speaks of regression .
A club with five European Cups to shine could feel no other way about a competition that looked like a dumping ground in the way the Uefa and European Cup - Winners '
Cups never quite did .
A second - tier continental championship is not to be sneered at , though , especially now , particularly down by the Thames , where Fulham were an exercise in self - deprecation until Mohammed Fayed took his punt and Hodgson 's appointment on 28 December 2007 turned out to be one of the most inspired headhunts in the whole sack - happy saga of the Premier League .
Eleven months after he led them to their highest ever league finish ( seventh place ) , Hodgson has coached Zamora to the edge of a World Cup spot with England and sculpted European semi-finalists from a squad of vastly improved nearly - men .
Danny Murphy was nearly a top - six midfielder , Paul Konchesky was nearly a top - half left - back , Damien Duff was nearly the wizard he used to be at Blackburn and Chelsea , Zamora was nearly , but not quite , good enough to be the main goal - getter in a top - 10 Premier League side .
" No tree grows to heaven " Hodgson told me in November , in an interview in these pages , citing an old Swedish adage .
What he meant was that expectation can explode on you .
He said : " I constantly preach the message that all the time we can remain a Premier League club , filling the stadium with 25,000 people , playing the sort of football that those 25,000 people seem to appreciate , I 've got to say I think that 's success . "
This is the obverse of the Champions League mentality , so maybe this is what the Europa League is really for : reason , rather than mania .
Hodgson even went so far as to question the wisdom of heavy spending : " Who knows : maybe one or two of those big - hitters we 'd brought in for £ 10 - 15 m , and £ 50,000 or £ 60,000 a week – money we do n't pay – would n't be as dedicated to doing the job on the training field .
Maybe it would be a different type of management .
Maybe we'd be handing the club over to them . "
In football as we know it this is counter - intuitive , and brilliant , because Hodgson is defending the old faith .
A good manager identifies stalled talent and coaches it to a far higher level .
At Viking FK in Norway , he sees that Brede Hangeland is good enough to play in the Premier League and later brings him over .
He and his staff spot Chris Smalling playing centre - back for Maidstone United and within nine months of his first - team debut are selling him on to Manchester United for £ 10 m .
In a vanished showbiz past , when Craven Cottage was a house of post - war fun , Tommy Trinder would promise his cashmere camel coat to anyone who could score a hat - trick , and Charlie Mitten would order Johnny Haynes off the physio's table so his dog could be treated for a race at Wimbledon .
It took Fulham an age to transcend that knockabout mythology .
They made football laugh .
Now they ask it to learn .

UPDATE : Happy April Fools ’ Day !
We ’ve pulled your leg .
Look who else is laughing : McDonald ’s on Twitter .
McDonald ’s announced this morning that it would discontinue plans for a worldwide composting initiative after scientists confirmed that no item on the McDonald ’s menu is compostable .
The plan to keep food waste — more than 1.5 billion tons a month — out of landfills would have been the largest composting program in the world , with bright green composting bins at all the 31,000 - plus restaurants around the world .
But McDonald ’s halted the plan after scientists at the University of California - Berkeley discovered that none of the items on the McDonald ’s menu would compost in the next 500 years , nor would any start breaking down for an estimated 1,000 years , the projected life span of a plastic bag .
“ To be honest , this food is better off in a landfill . ” said lead researcher Donald MacGregor , from the University of California - Berkeley , on a press call early this morning .
“ It would get in the way of perfectly good compostable materials .
Additionally , gardeners disliked the highly acidic leaching of the non-composting Big Macs in field tests . ”
McDonald ’s says it has no plans to reconsider the idea .
However , company officials will be considering other waste management options , such as incineration and outer - atmospheric storage .
“ It would have been great for McDonald ’s to lead the way on corporate composting , ” said McDonald ’s CEO Jim Skinner at a press conference today outside the fast food giant ’s headquarters in Oak Brook , Illinois .
“ We had to make a tough decision , but in the end I think we made the right one for us and for the environment . ”
A source at Greenpeace says today ’s announcement is “ extremely disturbing . ”
The group plans to launch a campaign to get McDonald ’s to overhaul its menu .
For the past week or so , I have been testing a sleek , light , silver - and - black tablet computer called an iPad .
After spending hours and hours with it , I believe this beautiful new touch - screen device from Apple has the potential to change portable computing profoundly , and to challenge the primacy of the laptop .
It could even help , eventually , to propel the finger - driven , multitouch user interface ahead of the mouse - driven interface that has prevailed for decades .
But first , it will have to prove that it really can replace the laptop or netbook for enough common tasks , enough of the time , to make it a viable alternative .
And that may not be easy , because previous tablet computers have failed to catch on in the mass market , and the iPad lacks some of the features — such as a physical keyboard , a Webcam , USB ports and multitasking — that most laptop or netbook users have come to expect .
If people see the iPad mainly as an extra device to carry around , it will likely have limited appeal .
If , however , they see it as a way to replace heavier , bulkier computers much of the time — for Web surfing , email , social - networking , video - and photo - viewing , gaming , music and even some light content creation — it could be a game changer the way Apple ’s iPhone has been .
The iPad is much more than an e-book or digital periodical reader , though it does those tasks brilliantly , better in my view than the Amazon Kindle .
And it ’s far more than just a big iPhone , even though it uses the same easy - to - master interface , and Apple ( AAPL ) says it runs nearly all of the 150,000 apps that work on the iPhone .
When held horizontally , the iPad ’s virtual keyboard is roomy and easy to use .
When held horizontally , the iPad ’s virtual keyboard is roomy and easy to use .
It ’s qualitatively different , a whole new type of computer that , through a simple interface , can run more - sophisticated , PC - like software than a phone does , and whose large screen allows much more functionality when compared with a phone ’s .
But , because the iPad is a new type of computer , you have to feel it , to use it , to fully understand it and decide if it is for you , or whether , say , a netbook might do better .
So I ’ve been using my test iPad heavily day and night , instead of my trusty laptops most of the time .
As I got deeper into it , I found the iPad a pleasure to use , and had less and less interest in cracking open my heavier ThinkPad or MacBook .
I probably used the laptops about 20 % as often as normal , reserving them mainly for writing or editing longer documents , or viewing Web videos in Adobe ’s ( ADBE )
Flash technology , which the iPad does n’t support , despite its wide popularity online .
My verdict is that , while it has compromises and drawbacks , the iPad can indeed replace a laptop for most data communication , content consumption and even limited content creation , a lot of the time .
But it all depends on how you use your computer .
If you ’re mainly a Web surfer , note - taker , social - networker and emailer , and a consumer of photos , videos , books , periodicals and music — this could be for you .
If you need to create or edit giant spreadsheets or long documents , or you have elaborate systems for organizing email , or need to perform video chats , the iPad is n’t going to cut it as your go - to device .
The iPad is thinner and lighter than any netbook or laptop I ’ve seen .
It weighs just 1.5 pounds , and its aluminum and glass body is a mere half - inch thick .
It boasts a big , bright color 9.7 - inch screen that occupies most of the front .
As on all Apple portable devices , the battery is sealed in and nonreplaceable .
It has a decent speaker , and even a tiny microphone .
Memory , also sealed in and nonexpandable , ranges from 16 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes .
And you can order one with just a Wi -Fi wireless connection to the Internet , or Wi-Fi plus an AT&T ( T ) 3G cellular connection .
The Wi-Fi models will be available Saturday and the 3G models , which I did n’t test , about a month later .
Prices start at $ 499 and go to $ 829 , with the costlier models having more memory and / or 3G .
The cellular models do n’t require a contract or termination fee .
You can pay AT&T either $ 15 a month for 250 megabytes of data use , or $ 30 a month for unlimited data — a significant reduction from typical prices for laptop cellular connectivity .
I was impressed with the iPad ’s battery life , which I found to be even longer than Apple ’s ten - hour claim , and far longer than on my laptops or smart phones .
For my battery test , I played movies , TV shows and other videos back - to - back until the iPad died .
This stressed the device ’s most power - hogging feature , its screen .
The iPad lasted 11 hours and 28 minutes , about 15 % more than Apple claimed .
I was able to watch four feature - length movies , four TV episodes and a video of a 90 - minute corporate presentation , before the battery died midway through an episode of “ The Closer . ”
Walt ’s mountain - view wallpaper with app icons arranged during his tests .
Oh , and all the while during this battery marathon , I kept the Wi-Fi network running and the email downloading constantly in the background .
Your mileage may vary , but with Wi-Fi off and the screen turned down from the fairly bright level I used , you might even do better .
Music plays far longer with the screen off .
On the other hand , playing games constantly might yield worse battery life .
Apple says video playback , Web use and book reading all take about the same amount of juice .
When I was doing the latter two tasks for an hour or two at a time , the battery ran down so slowly for me that I stopped thinking about it .
I also was impressed with the overall speed of the iPad .
Apple ’s custom processor makes it wicked fast .
Screens appear almost instantly , and the Wi-Fi in my home tested as fast as it does on a laptop .
I found email easy and productive to use , and had no trouble typing accurately and quickly on the iPad ’s wide on - screen keyboard .
In fact , I found the iPad virtual keyboard more comfortable and accurate to use than the cramped keyboards and touchpads on many netbooks , though some fast touch typists might disagree .
Apple ’s $ 39 iPad case , which bends to set up a nice angle for typing , helps .
The Web browser also works beautifully , and takes advantage of the big screen to show full pages and cut down on scrolling .
It even now has a bookmarks bar at the top .
As noted , however , it does n’t support Adobe ’s Flash technology .
I also was able to easily sync the iPad ’s calendar and contacts apps with Google ( GOOG ) and Apple ’s MobileMe .
Watching videos , viewing photos , listening to music , reading books and playing games was satisfying and fun .
I used the device heavily for Twitter and Facebook .
And I even got some light work done in the optional iPad word processor , called Pages , which is part of a $ 30 suite that also includes a spreadsheet and presentation program .
This is a serious content creation app that should help the iPad compete with laptops and can import Microsoft Office files .
However , only the word processor exports to Microsoft ’s formats , and not always accurately .
In one case , the exported Word file had misaligned text .
When I then tried exporting the document as a PDF file , it was unreadable .
Apple created a touch version of its Pages word processor for the iPad .

The iPad can run two types of third - party apps , both available from Apple ’s app store .
It can use nearly all existing iPhone apps .
These can either run in a small , iPhone - size window in the middle of the screen , which makes them look tiny , or blown up to double size .
The larger size makes them fill the screen , but can make type inside them look blocky .
Still , the dozens I tested all worked properly .
And it can run a new class of specially designed iPad apps , of which Apple hopes to have 1,000 at launch .
I successfully tested the revamped App Store , which features the iPad apps most prominently when you ’re on an iPad .
Based on my very small sample , some app developers may be testing higher prices for iPad apps than the 99 cents or $ 1.99 typical for paid iPhone apps .
The paid iPad apps I saw ranged from $ 3.99 to $ 49.99 .
Others were free .
Apple has rebuilt its own core iPhone apps for the iPad to add sophisticated features that make the programs look and work more like PC or Mac software .
For instance , there are “ popover ” menus that make it easier to make choices without leaving the screen you ’re on .
And , when the iPad is held horizontally , in landscape mode , as I often preferred to use it , many programs now have two panels , making them faster and more useful .
For example , in email , a left - hand panel shows your message list , while a larger right - hand panel shows the message itself .
The photo app is striking , and much more like the one on the Mac than the one on the iPhone .
The device can even be used as a digital picture frame .
The iPod app is beautiful , too , as are the calendar and contacts app .
Unfortunately , Apple excluded some of the more familiar apps from the iPhone , including Weather , Clock and Stocks .
I tested a small selection of the new third - party iPad apps Apple hopes to have available at launch , and most were also rich and feature - filled , beyond what iPhone apps offer .
These included games such as Scrabble and “ Touch Hockey , ” a database app , news services and more .
I was able to try a pre-release version of The Wall Street Journal ’s new iPad app ( which I had nothing to do with designing ) , and found it gorgeous and highly functional — by far the best implementation of the newspaper I have ever seen on a screen .
Unlike the Journal ’s Web site , or its smart - phone apps , the iPad version blends much more of the look and feel of the print paper into the electronic environment .
Other newspapers and magazines have announced plans for their own , dramatically more realistic iPad apps .
I also found iBooks , Apple ’s book reader and store , easy to use , and read a couple of books on it .
I consider the larger color screen superior to the Kindle ’s , and encountered no eye strain .
But the iPad is much heavier than the Kindle and most people will need two hands to use it .
The iBooks app also lacks any way to enter notes , and Apple ’s catalog at launch will only be about 60,000 books versus more than 400,000 for Kindle .
I did run into some other annoying limitations .
For instance , the email program lacks the ability to create local folders or rules for auto - sorting messages , and it does n’t allow group addressing .
The browser lacks tabs .
And the Wi-Fi-only version lacks GPS .
Also , videophiles may dislike the fact that the iPad ’s screen lacks wide - screen dimensions , so you either get black bars above or below wide - screen videos , or , if you choose an option to fill the screen , some of the picture may get cut off .
All in all , however , the iPad is an advance in making more - sophisticated computing possible via a simple touch interface on a slender , light device .
Only time will tell if it ’s a real challenger to the laptop and netbook .

We cannot deny the emotions that bring tears to the surface .
The only thing we can change is how we cope with everything that 's happening .
According to the first known evidence of " double burials , " ancient people in what is now Mexico routinely dug up decomposing bodies and took off their arms , legs , and heads , then reburied the bodies , new research shows .
Indigenous peoples of the Cape Region of Baja California Sur ( see map ) practiced these double burials for about 4,500 years , from about 300 B.C. to the 16th - century A.D , when Europeans first arrived in the region , anthropologists say .
To the native groups , death was " a motionless , painful state , from which the living could free " the dead by sectioning the limbs , physical anthropologist Alfonso Rosales - Lopez said in an email translated from Spanish . "
The double - burial practice , he added , is consistent with beliefs in other cultures around the world that death is n't the end of life but rather a passing from one state to another .
Since 1991 Rosales - Lopez has examined more than a hundred of the double burials along the southern coast of Baja California and is currently working on a paper describing the practice .
Double - Burial Corpses Torn Limb From Limb
Immediately after death , candidates for double burial were shrouded in animal skins and bound tightly in the fetal position with cords made from agave plants , the same succulents used in tequila production .
Each corpse was then placed in an individual shallow grave lined with seashells , charcoal , and soil .
" It would appear this would end the funeral , but the abundance of sectioned remains clearly shows this is not the case — rather , it was only the first part , " said Rosalez - Lopez , of Mexico 's National Institute of Anthropology and History .
About six to eight months after a first burial , a body would be exhumed .
At this point , the corpse would have decomposed enough that the limbs and head could be easily broken off , he noted .
Once separated , the dismembered parts were placed near the body and reburied .
Near the burial sites , Rosalez - Lopez and colleagues also found stone tools — such as projectile heads , knives , and fishing harpoons — that would have been used to kill and prepare food .
Food remains including shells of mollusks , seeds , and plants were also discovered .
Reasons for Double Burials Still Speculative
Double burials appear unique to the Cape Region , said Don Laylander , senior archaeologist with the archaeological consulting firm ASM Affiliates and co-editor of The Prehistory of Baja California : Advances in the Archaeology of the Forgotten Peninsula .
Rosales - Lopez 's research also offers some new insight into the culture of Mexico 's ancient native peoples , Laylander said .
For instance , the double burials and the shells and bones found at the sites certainly point to a culture that emphasized ceremony and were seminomadic , Laylander , who was not involved in the research , noted via email .
That 's because the artifacts suggests the people did not abandon their settlements forever — they had an obligation to revisit and protect their dead , project leader Rosalez - Lopez said .
Not much more is known about the culture , Laylander said .
The Cape Region groups became culturally extinct more than two centuries ago , he added , and there are few modern ethnographic accounts of them .

Debbie Churgai
An interview with Debbie Churgai by Abby Stoddard , PharmD , MBA on behalf of The Client Centered Network .
Oregon is one of the few but growing number of states that have both a medical cannabis program and an adult use ( recreational ) program , and users of cannabis medicine can be found in either group .
Enrolling in Oregon 's medical marijuana program ( OMMP ) requires an application , physician and patient documentation , and a fee , but does have benefits .
Patients in the OMMP program do not have to pay sales tax , are eligible to receive free product , and many dispensaries give OMMP members preference on things like delivery , parking , and in - store service .
If you are considering applying to the OMMP program please check out our resource page , especially our cost calculator , to see if it might be a good fit for your situation .
Whether you enroll in the OMMP or not , I always encourage those using cannabis medicine to keep their health care providers in the loop - whether that 's your naturopath , your therapist , your chiropractor or your primary care physician .
Just like prescription medication , diet and exercise , cannabis can impact other therapies and treatments you may be using , so it 's important to make sure whoever you 're working with has the full picture and can monitor your progress or make adjustments if needed .
Of course having the conversation about cannabis can be complicated , intimidating and nerve racking .
Medical cannabis has been legal in Oregon since 1998 , but there can still be stigma , misinformation , and entrenched opinions on its use in the mainstream medical community .
That is slowly but surely changing for the better , but in the mean time I wanted to speak to someone who knows the ins and outs of this dilemma and who can offer even more resources to empower users of cannabis medicine .
I sat down ( virtually of course ) with Debbie Churgai , Executive Director of Americans for Safe Access to get some tips and talking points to help patients start this conversation .
A big thank you to Debbie for her time and to ASA for all that they do .
Read on for more on the free resources ASA provides to empower you to direct your cannabis care with your provider team .
Geeks and LEGO seem to go together like mac and cheese ( or Macs and Apples , even ) with tons of fan - made geek - inspired creations to be found in every corner of the interweb , including the LEGO Flickr group .
From both full - time , professional LEGO artists to those who just have a penchant for the colorful little Danish building blocks , we bring you a great gallery of LEGO sculptures that are inspired by the world of tech , online and social media .
Have a gander now and let us know your favorites - or any others we 've missed that you think are worthy of mention - in the comments box below .
This PS3 controller was bricked up for a Sony advert for the Chilean market .
Aside from the LEGO - themed video games link , the thinking behind it is reported to be that the console is as classic and recognizable as LEGO itself .
Just a bit more pricey .

LEGO builder Fredoichi took a break from more hardcore LEGO creations to make Ollie , Twitterrific 's avian icon , because his little girl thought it was " a cute thing to have . "
Awww !
Apparently Larry and Sergey are " avid lovers of the LEGO brick " and as such commissioned LEGO artist Sean Kenney to piece together two Google LEGO logos which are currently on show in the online giant 's New York and Copenhagen offices .
One of the online world 's sweetest error messages gets rendered in 3D in the medium of LEGO by Bjarne P Tveskov who cunningly Photoshopped the once - yellow " eye " brick - as it's really a smiley LEGO mouth .
Google staffers themselves got in on the brick - building action with this Google Talk sculpture made from LEGO .
We only hope it was built during their 20 % time .
PodBrix 's Apple - themed scene is set back in ' 72 and shows the two young Steves in minifig form - Steve J already dreaming of the iPhone and Woz , wrench in hand fiddling with a circuit board .
Another Sean Kenney creation , this gargantuan LEGO DSi was commissioned by the Japanese gaming giant to grace the Nintendo World Store in New York .
You 're looking at 51,324 LEGO pieces in this 7 - foot wide construction which makes most home - made efforts look a little puny .
A slightly different take on the LEGO angle , as well as on your usual unboxing , this Flickr photo - set sees minifigs merrily unpacking an Apple iPhone - until tragedy strikes , that is .
Do n't fret , there 's a happy ending .

Biden to Obama : " A big [ expletive ] deal "
After introducing Obama at Tuesday 's health - care bill signing ceremony , Vice President Biden turned to the president and said , " This is a big [ expletive ] deal . "
Shortly after the event , press secretary Robert Gibbs said on Twitter , " Powerful moment when the President described the people he was signing this for and for the millions back in control of their health care ...
And yes Mr. Vice President , you 're right . "
It was n't the first time Biden was caught cursing on an open mic .
" Despite the fact that we were going through tough times economically and CPI was only 1.5 per cent , coffee prices rose 7.5 per cent in the same period in Brisbane , " Gilkatho managing director Wayne Fowler said .
The company , which surveyed about 200 cafes each in the three centres , found coffee consumers in Brisbane could pay as little as $ 1.60 or as much as $ 4.50 depending on where they went .
Milton was the most expensive suburb overall , with an average cappucino price of $ 3.44 .
But Bulimba recorded the highest price for a simple espresso coffee - $ 4.50 .
The cheapest coffee was in the CBD where prices were as low as $ 1.80 and the average was $ 3.23 a cup , the same as West End .
In Sydney , prices ranged from $ 2 - $ 4.50 and in Melbourne prices ranged from $ 2 - $ 4 .

At the same time that the Gateway Arch was completed , Interstate 70 opened between the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial site and downtown St. Louis .
Although intended to bring people into the region 's center , the interstate disrupted the city 's street grid and isolated the new national monument and the river from the activity of downtown .
A two - hundred - year - old connection was lost .
Now , St. Louis has a momentous opportunity to revisit the unintended consequences of the interstate .

How can TV turn people into torturers ?
A documentary broadcast on French television depicts a game show where participants willingly give electric shocks to rival contestants .
The game , Extreme Zone , is fake and the victim an actor – but those taking part and the audience think it ’s for real .
The documentary aims to illustrate the hold TV exerts on people .
“ It ’s really the notion of power that ’s the issue , much greater than that of the individual ” , said documentary maker Christophe Nick .
“ He ’s alone when he ’s on the set , without any bearings , without anyone telling him , ‘ hey , watch what you ’re doing , have you seen what he ’s doing to you ?’.
You ’re on your own , and when you ’re on your own , faced with a power that abuses its authority , you become very easy to manipulate . ”
The documentary was inspired by an American psychological experiment from the 1960s .
Contestants gave what they thought were increasingly violent electric shocks to rivals who gave wrong answers .
Eight out of ten pushed it to the maximum level .
“ I never believed in the power of television , ” said social psychologist Jean - Léon Beauvois .
“ I believed in its influence , certainly , but not in television ’s power .
So , I was very surprised , I never expected those kind of figures , ” he added .
Of eighty people invited to take part in the spoof show , none refused .
Programme makers say what it reveals about human behaviour is frightening .
If you 're looking for a new bank , and not of the Bank of America variety , financial site Kiplinger explains how to use several free tools to find a local bank where you 're sure your money is safe .

Why switch to a local bank ?
Managing editor of Kiplinger Robert Long explains why he prefers smaller local banks :
My local bank recently got acquired , and it 's already starting to act like a big bank even before they change the letterhead or the signage outside each branch .
I just suffered through a week - long customer - service nightmare filled with egregious bank errors ( accidentally closing down my wife 's debit card ) , contradictory statements made by different representatives , failure to deliver ( still ! ) a replacement card promised within 3 - 5 business days , proposed fees for actions necessary to resolve the bank 's own errors , and a general unwillingness by any of a half - dozen representative and managers to pursue solutions on our behalf .

Often , consumers head straight to mega - banks they 've heard of , but if you want to switch to a more personal , local bank , you may not have even heard of any .
The Independent Community Bankers of America web site will help you search for local banks , and the Credit Union National Association will help you look for local credit unions .
Long used these tools to find several local banks he'd never heard of .
You 'll also want to try Checking Finder to compare between community banks for the best perks .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Step two involves making sure your money is secure at said banks .
For this information , you 'll want to check with money and government sites like the FDIC , BankRate , and the Move Your Money campaign .
The Move Your Money web site lets you search for local banks scoring a " B " or higher in ratings .
Obviously , you 'll want to compare interest rates and policies before you make your final decision , and check out the full post at Kiplinger for more advice .
Got any tips , pros or cons , of going local instead of going with a big chain bank ?

How to Find a Local Bank [ Kiplinger via The Consumerist ]
I want privacy because I break the law
To the police and future employers :
I do n’t really do illegal things .
I ’m actually a pretty top notch guy .
Some of the stories in the article may be embellished / fabricated .
I do have to say that , right ?
Bruce Schneier is one of the greatest minds of our time .
Schneier on Security , is a collection of some of his best essays from 2002 to 2008 and has really shaped my thinking towards privacy and security .
( Also available , at a higher price but personally signed , from his own website ) .
Back in December he posted this in response to Eric Schmidt ’s ( CEO of Google ) claim that :
If you have something that you do n’t want anyone to know , maybe you should n’t be doing it in the first place .
If you really need that kind of privacy , the reality is that search engines – including Google – do retain this information for some time …
I ’ve thought about Schneier ’s response ( that people want privacy for a whole host of reasons , like when we make love , sing in the shower , and do things that are totally legal at the time of law ) for some time now and I have come to this conclusion :
Yes .
I do want privacy for those reasons .
I do not want people knowing when I search for “ smelly foot rash ” or , even worse , “ why do women cheat on good men ” .
These are embarrassing or very emotionally painful subjects that I do n’t want anyone to know about .
Say there is only a 0.1 % chance that in the next year Google ’s servers have a search history leak ( between all their sharing of data back and forth with the US government ) .
If it does happen , my searches will forever be available for people to find .
I ’m always logged into my Gmail account , so my coworkers would n’t even need to know my IP .
All they would have to do is search “ [ my email ] google search history leak ” or possibly just my full name .
But that is n’t everything .
I want privacy because I break the law and I do n’t want to be fined or thrown in prison .
No , I ’ve never done or dealt illegal drugs .
No , I do n’t jack cars or commuter bikes .
But I do break the law .
Probably every day .
Some things are minor : 12 km/h over the limit , parking for 2 seconds to drop something off when the sign clearly says “ parking after 8 pm only . ”
Some things are major : keyloggers and password dictionary attacks while the Grade 11 English teacher was out of the room .
( Sidenote : My friends and I were stupid in high school .
We never got caught with our hackety , crackity shenanigans and we I never changed my grades .
But it was still stupid .
I also understand the hilarity of blogging about privacy after installing keyloggers on highschool computers and dict forcing teachers email passwords .
At least I have the I - was - an - idiot - teenager excuse , unlike some major corporations . )
What about not even knowing about breaking the law ?
Let me ask you this :
Have you ever committed a felony ?
Before you answer , have you read through and understood the millions of laws you must abide by ?
If not , your truest answer to the original question would be “ I hope I have n’t committed a felony , and if I have , I hope nobody finds out because I do n’t want to go to prison .
I ’m basically a good person and I do n’t deserve to be financially ruined and separated from my family . ”
Check out this lovely law that Prof .
Duane shared with the class .
( square brackets and bold emphasis mine , italics emphasis source )
It is unlawful for any person to import , export , transport , sell , receive , acquire , possess , or purchase any fish , wildlife , or plant taken , possessed , transported , or sold in violation of any Federal , State , foreign [!? ] , or Indian tribal law , treaty , or regulation .
…
Criminal penalties fall into two categories .
For a felony offense , a maximum $ 250,000 fine per individual and $ 500,000 per organization , and / or up to 5 years imprisonment for each violation of the Act can be assessed .
A misdemeanor offense carries a maximum $ 100,000 fine per individual and $ 200,000 per organization , and / or up to 1 year imprisonment .
Now I ’m not an attorney , so I ’m hoping I ’m reading this wrong , but to me ( and my completely limited knowledge of the law ) this is a technically possible scenario :
You buy a lemon for Ceasars at home with some friends .
Unfortunately , last week Russia declared it illegal to possess lemons due to new Russian research that the rest of the world thinks is crazy .
A Google search you made tipped off your local American authorities that you are breaking 16 USC 3370 .
Do Not Pass Go , Do Not Collect $ 200 .
Instead go to prison for 1 to 5 years after laying out up to $ 250 k on a fine , unless you get an understanding judge .
Remember : Absent knowledge of the law is NOT exemption from the law .
You are required to know and follow all the laws in your country , provice / state , county / region , municipality / city .
The government never really tells you that this is physically impossible .
I could n’t possibly read laws as fast as legislature or consul write them , let alone catch up on centuries of already written laws and judicial interpretation .
Getting back to knowingly breaking the law .
My mom had surgery a couple years back and ran out of Tylenol 3s ( T3s are basically a small dosage of codeine with caffeine ) .
Because I ’ve had excruciatingly painful bi-yearly migraines since I hit adolescence I have an unlimited , legal supply of T3s .
Personal use only , of course .
But even though it was illegal , did I give my mom two or three T3s to keep her pain down until she could get her bottle refilled the next morning ?
You bet .
I did n’t even blink .
Was I trafficking narcotics ( or whatever giving prescription drugs to other people is called ) ?
You would have to ask a Canadian judge and jury that .
But luckily for me big brother does n’t have a log of me giving my mom a couple pain killers .
This is why I want privacy .
I break the law .
Sometimes for good reasons , sometimes for stupid reasons .
Now , I rarely knowingly break big laws , but I ’m sure it has happened a couple of times .
Have I ruined anyone ’s life ?
No .
Have I destroyed anyone ’s wealth ?
No .
Do I breach others privacy ?
Not since I was an idiot kid .
Then stop snooping .
Leave me the hell alone .
Maybe if I ’m doing something online that I do n’t want anyone to find out I should do it anyway , safe in the knowledge that I live in a free country and that my right to privacy is assured - unless I do something that gives the police enough evidence for a judge signed warrant .
Feb. 18 , 2010  --
Love it or loathe it , Google Buzz has dominated tech headlines since its launch last week .
The latest product unveiled by the Mountain View tech giant , Google Buzz , is a social networking service that plugs right into a Gmail user 's e-mail account .
Like Facebook or Twitter , the new tool lets users post status updates , YouTube videos and photos , connecting users in an ongoing online conversation .
While some people have hailed Google Buzz as a potential " Facebook killer , " others have lambasted the service for publicizing users ' private information .
One law school student decided this week to take the Google Buzz backlash to a whole new level .
Complaint Cites Electronic Communications Privacy Act
Law firms in San Francisco and Washington , D.C. , Wednesday filed a class- action complaint in San Jose , Calif. , federal court against Google Buzz on behalf of Eva Hibnick , a 24 - year - old Harvard Law School student .
The complaint alleges that Google Buzz , which automatically opted - in all Gmail users upon its launch , unlawfully shared personal data without users ' permission .
The document cites the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act , the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , the Federal Stored Communications Act and California common and statutory law .
" I feel like they did something wrong , " said Hibnick , an active Gmail user and second - year law student .
" They opted me into this social network and I did n't want it . "
Hibnick said she typically uses Gmail about two to three times a day , and when she signed in to the service Feb. 9 ( the day of Google Buzz 's launch ) , she did n't realize at first that she had been automatically signed up for the new social network .
When she realized later , she said she was concerned that Google Buzz had publicly disclosed her personal relationships .
Student : Google Buzz Revealed Personal Contacts
When the service first launched , it set users up to automatically " follow " ( or receive status updates from ) the people they most e-mailed or chatted with , leading many users to worry that their contacts were public to anyone on the Web .
Hibnick said that some of the people Google had selected to follow her were people she had n't spoken to in months .
Hibnick said she mentioned her frustrations to a classmate , who happened to be a research assistant for a Harvard professor who specializes in civil procedure and class - action law .
When he agreed that Google Buzz could indeed constitute a privacy breach , he put them in touch with one of the attorneys now representing Hibnick .
" I feel really deeply about this issue and that 's why I decided to step forward , " Hibnick said .
Attorney : Google Buzz Not What People Expect From Electronic Media
Hibnick is bringing the complaint on behalf of all Gmail users whose accounts were linked to Google Buzz ( there were 31.2 million users as of January , according to the filing ) and is seeking injunctions to prevent the company from acting similarly in the future , as well as monetary relief .
One of her attorneys , Gary E. Mason of Washington , D.C. - based Mason Law Firm LLP , said , " It 's not so much that we 're expecting to get millions of people hundreds of dollars .
What we'd like to see as result is a commitment from Google that they 're not going to do this again the next time they launch a product . "
Although Google has apologized for Buzz 's flaws and has addressed some of the issues ( for example , they abandoned the auto - follow model and now recommend people to follow ) , Mason contends the company 's changes are insufficient .
The program remains an opt - out program , which , he said , he thinks is " an unfair and generally deceptive practice . "
He also said that the company can't un - do their initial failings .
" We take issue with the way it was launched , " he said .
" It was a violation originally . …
This is not the kind of behavior that people expect from electronic media and that 's why these laws are in place . "
Google : No Comment on Suit
In a statement , a Google spokesperson said , " We have n't yet been served , so we can't comment on the suit until we 've had a chance to review it . "
After the initial storm of gripes from Gmail users , Gmail and Google Buzz product manager Todd Jackson took to the official Gmail blog Saturday to apologize for the new service 's flaws and announced a series of changes .
" We quickly realized that we did n't get everything quite right , " he wrote .
" We 're very sorry for the concern we 've caused and have been working hard ever since to improve things based on your feedback .
We 'll continue to do so . "
In addition to eliminating the auto - follow model , Jackson said , Google Buzz no longer auto - connected other Google applications to the social network and could be disabled by accessing Gmail settings .
But the apology and changes did n't prevent privacy watchdog Electronic Privacy Information Center from filing a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission .
Privacy Watchdog Files FTC Complaint
In the complaint filed Tuesday , the center alleged that Google is " engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices " that violated user privacy expectations , contradicted Google 's own privacy policy and may have violated federal wiretap laws .
Kimberly Nguyen , consumer privacy counsel for the center , said , " Our main concern is that Google should allow users to have meaningful control over their personal information and Google Buzz does n't allow for that . "
Gmail users expected an e-mail service from Google , she said , but when the company rolled out Google Buzz , users were involuntarily pulled into a social networking service for which they did n't sign up .
Although the company has changed several Google Buzz features , she said , it has not made one key change : Instead of offering Google Buzz to Gmail users and letting them choose to opt-in , Google automatically registered Gmail users with the service , only giving them the choice to opt-out .
" To make this opt - in versus opt - out is very important , " she said .
" The bottom line is users should have control over their information .
Although she had n't read Hibnick 's complaint , she said there could be some " real merit " to it .
" A lot of people were outraged when they first saw that their private e-mail contacts were being publicized to the world , " she said .
The Democrats will think that this is over .
It is not .
They have to be given pants filling , boot wetting moments once they start campaigning .
... Chase them up a tree and then throw rocks at them .
Have the look of fear and terror show on their faces when they ask the press what happened .
Surround their cars and rock them .
A life filled with cold sweating nightmares and awakening to every little creak and knock in their house is what they deserve .
* Killing babies on Sunday at 4 pm. Democrats .**
So let 's get this straight : those who were concerned ( through several linked " worst case scenarios " and much misinterpretation ) that the health care bill might possibly allow federal funds to be used for abortion in contradiction to existing US law now know that can't happen .
That makes those politician " baby killers " ?

I wanted to add one more , and a perspective plucked from history :
Prohibition was repealed , so can this .
And prohibition was popular when enacted ... this never had any public support .
Aside from the poster 's inability to understand polls , there 's that wonderful statement :
" This is the largest tax bill in history , " the Republican leader fumed .
The reform " is unjust , unworkable , stupidly drafted and wastefully financed . "
And that was n’t all .
This " cruel hoax , " he said , this " folly " of " bungling and waste , " compared poorly to the " much less expensive " and " practical measures " favored by the Republicans .
" We must repeal , " the GOP leader argued .
" The Republican Party is pledged to do this . "

The Indian Suicides
Farmers in India are finding that the " biotechnology revolution " is having a devastating effect on their crop lands and personal debt levels .
" In 1998 , the World Bank 's structural adjustment policies forced India to open up its seed sector to global corporations like Cargill , Monsanto , and Syngenta .
The global corporations changed the input economy overnight .
Farm saved seeds were replaced by corporate seeds which needed fertilizers and pesticides and could not be saved " Says Vandana Shiva , leader of the movement to oust Monsanto from India in her 2004 article The Suicide Economy Of Corporate Globalisation .
" As seed saving is prevented by patents as well as by the engineering of seeds with non-renewable traits , seed has to be bought for every planting season by poor peasants .
A free resource available on farms became a commodity which farmers were forced to buy every year .
This increases poverty and leads to indebtedness .
As debts increase and become unpayable , farmers are compelled to sell kidneys or even commit suicide .
More than 25,000 peasants in India have taken their lives since 1997 when the practice of seed saving was transformed under globalisation pressures and multinational seed corporations started to take control of the seed supply .
Seed saving gives farmers life .
Seed monopolies rob farmers of life " [ 1 ] .
UPDATE : " Since 1997 , 182,936 Indian farmers have taken their lives and the numbers continue to rise .
According to a recent study by the National Crime Records Bureau , 46 Indian farmers kill themselves every day – that is roughly one suicide every 30 minutes – an alarming statistic in a country where agriculture is the economic mainstay " . [ 2 ]
Yet even this number may be underestimated .
According to P. Sainath , rural affairs editor of The Hindu , " the states where these [ figures ] are gathered leave out thousands from the definition of " farmer " and , thus , massage the numbers downward .
For instance , women farmers are not normally accepted as farmers ( by custom , land is almost never in their names ) .
They do the bulk of work in agriculture - but are just " farmers ' wives . "
This classification enables governments to exclude countless women farmer suicides .
They will be recorded as suicide deaths - but not as " farmers ' suicides . "
Likewise , many other groups , too , have been excluded from that list " The Largest Wave Of Suicides In History .
This has been called a genocide [ 3 ] .
Says the Deccan Herald , " Bt cotton requiring more water than hybrid cotton , was knowingly promoted so as to allow the seed industry to make profits .
What happens to the farmers as a result was nobody 's concern .
And never was ....
Strange , the country has already jumped into the second phase of green revolution without first drawing a balance sheet of the first phase of the technology era .
Such an approach will only worsen the crisis , and force more farmers to commit suicide or abandon their farms .
As a result , India is sure to witness the worst environmental displacement the world has known and this will be in the field of agriculture . " [ 4 ]
" Farmers across India are in distress and despair , ' said Kishor Tiwari , a farmer rights activist , ' but Vidarbha is the epicentre of farm suicides ' .
Vidarbha cotton farmers ’ yearly costs – for genetically modified seeds , pesticides , fertilisers , electricity , water and labour – continue to rise , while the price of cotton has been declining with decreased productivity and quality .
Scant rainfall last year has exacerbated the crisis , giving rise to drought - like conditions , not favourable for the genetically modified seeds , which require twice the amount of water compared to traditional seeds .
A dearth of irrigation facilities has made matters worse , farmers complain " [ 5 ] .
Why do many Indian farmers continue to buy BT cotton when it has had such a unpredictable success / failure rate ?
Was it , as Monsanto claims , because of it 's obvious success ?
" University of Washington researcher Glenn Stone 's multi - year study of Bt cotton adoption in the Warangal district of AP - one of the suicide - prone states the authors mention - showed such adoption was not based on farmers carefully assessing the technology before adopting it more widely but a " craze " reliant on advertising and a kind of herd mentality , where everybody copies everyone else leading to blind adoption .
The hype around GM seeds , in fact , had added to the deskilling of the farmers - the undermining of cautious traditional assessment of performance " [ 6 ] .

Recently the pro-GM International Food Policy Research Institute has sought to downplay the connection between Indian Suicides and GM BT [ 8 ] .
However they also note in their study that " What we cannot reject , however , is the potential role of Bt cotton varieties in the observed discrete increase in farmer suicides in certain states and years " .
For a fuller rebuttal see [ 9 ] ( PDF ) .
While there may be other factors involved besides GM crops , Monsanto has , predictably , refused to accept any responsibility for the suicides [ 10 ] .

As in other parts of the world , GM farm fields and Monsanto property have been under attack in retaliation [ 11 ] .
Use of Child and Slave Labor
Additionally , Monsanto and related companies use many thousands of children in its labor force in India , the reason is simple , they can pay them less and work them more - up to 13 hours a day .
" Farmers employ children , particularly girls , primarily in order to minimize costs .
Earlier studies by these authors which examined reasons for child labour in this industry found that labour costs account for about 50 % of total cultivation costs .
Farmers endeavour to cut these labour costs by hiring children because the wages paid to children are far below both the market wages for adults in other agricultural field work and even further below official minimum wages .
Farmers also hire children in preference to adults because farmers can squeeze out higher productivity from children per day : children will work longer hours , will work much more intensively and they are generally much easier to control than adult workers – whether through verbal or physical abuse or through inexpensive treats like chocolate or hair ribbons .
Moreover , children cannot complain as effectively as adults do when they are exposed to poisonous pesticides , which are used in very high quantities in cottonseed cultivation .
Moreover , children work in the context of partial adult unemployment – children work whilst their parents cannot " The Price of Childhood .
Serious disrespect of their workers in other countries signal a pattern for Monsanto .
" Argentina 's tax agency has raided a Monsanto Co. contractor and found what it calls slave - like conditions among workers in its cornfields .
The AFIP tax agency says Rural Power SA hired all its farmhands illegally , prevented them from leaving the fields and withheld their salaries .
They had to de-tassel corn 14 hours a day and buy their food at inflated prices from the company store .
AFIP says it will hold the American agro - giant responsible for its contractor 's slave - like labor conditions .
" Argentina says Monsanto contractor abuses workers
Further , according to Courthouse News Service ,
" Monsanto , Philip Morris and other U.S. tobacco giants knowingly poisoned Argentinean tobacco farmers with pesticides , causing ' devastating birth defects ' in their children , dozens of workers claim in court ....
The farmers claim the tobacco companies asked them to use herbicides , pesticides and other toxic products made and distributed by Monsanto , and assured them the products were safe .
They say the defendants ' wrongfully caused the parental and infant plaintiffs to be exposed to those chemicals and substances which they both knew , or should have known , would cause the infant offspring of the parental plaintiffs to be born with devastating birth defects . '
Birth defects cited in the 55 - page complaint include cerebral palsy , psychomotor retardation , epilepsy , spina bifida , intellectual disabilities , metabolic disorders , congenital heart defects , Down syndrome , missing fingers and blindness ....
They claim that Monsanto and the tobacco companies , ' motivated by a desire for unwarranted economic gain and profit , ' ignored health risks associated with pesticides .
" Monsanto and Big Tobacco Blamed for Birth Defects
The High Cost of High Price
" Monsanto has patent rights over BT gene and it has sublicensed its gene to other companies .
Monsanto collects huge amounts of money as a royalty from these companies ....
Compared to non-BT hybrids , the gap between procurement price [ price paid to farmers ] and marketing prices of BT hybrids and unofficial BT hybrids is huge .
Marketing prices are 12.1 times more in case of official BT ....
Though companies obtain huge earnings from selling seed , they do not seem to be making any rational calculation about the cost of cultivation when fixing the procurement price to be paid to their seed farmers .
With the current procurement prices of the companies , seed farmers are forced to minimize wages to the labourers " [ 12 ] .
Ironically , Monsanto itself admits , " Farmer suicide has numerous causes with most experts agreeing that indebtedness is one of the main factors .
Farmers unable to repay loans and facing spiraling interest often see suicide as the only solution " [ 13 ] .
What they do n't say is that while high interest loans from loan sharks to buy the seeds contribute to the problem they are responsible for the exorbitant costs of their seeds in the first place .
In fact some Municipalities in India have gone to court in an effort to try to force Monsanto to lower the price of their seed .
Monsanto is fighting it contending that the GM trait is worth the extra cost .
The government , however , said that the cost was much higher than that charged to other , less poor countries [ 14 ] .
" One of the big headaches in Vidarbha is the state propagandised and favoured the promotion of Bt Cotton .
Firstly , Bt Cotton technologies are themselves suspect in a number of ways .
However , promoting them in a dry and un-irrigated area like Vidarbha was murderous .
It was stupid , it was killing .
The Bt Cotton packet was costing Rs 1800 to 1850 for a packet of 450 grams .
On each packet of Rs 1850 , Monsanto was making a royalty of Rs 1250 .
Coming back the MNC's , their role in the crisis has been devastating .
One , they have been able to corrupt and lobby government policy very significantly changing it in their favour and against the farmers "
‘ The relief package is a bureaucratic sham ’
" The price difference is staggering : £ 10 for 100 grams of GM seed , compared with less than £ 10 for 1,000 times more traditional seeds .
But GM salesmen and government officials had promised farmers that these were ' magic seeds ' - with better crops that would be free from parasites and insects .
Indeed , in a bid to promote the uptake of GM seeds , traditional varieties were banned from many government seed banks " [ 15 ] .
The Organic Center has produced a report on the price differences between organic and GM crops .
" In recent years the price of genetically engineered corn , soybean , and cotton seed has risen sharply .
Seed expenditures per acre are now cutting into net farm income , and transferring earnings that used to stay on the farm to the seed industry ....
Surprisingly , the biotech seed price premium is much larger than the organic seed price premium , despite the major differences in the value embedded in each " [ 1 ]

Cost table has been featured by CNN , PBS , Dollars and Sense Magazine and praised by financial services expert and author Nomi Prins .
" Given the government 's reticence at providing transparent information regarding its gifts to Wall Street , and having painstakingly compiled dynamic monthly tallies of the total federal bailout and subsidies for which the American people are at risk , I know too well how difficult it is to accumulate this data in a meaningful way .
CMD 's much - needed contribution toward further delineating the disbursement amounts completes the picture of the banking system 's hoard at our expense .
This fantastic work provides a scary yardstick for exactly where we are now , even if the banks never raid a single cent more of the perks to which they still have access . "

Glossary
These terms are used in the chart above and in the charts for each individual program , which are hyperlinked above .
“ At - risk ” means the total commitment of taxpayer funds made publicly by the relevant public officials ( for example , the government may have committed $ 3.35 billion dollars to guarantee losses in money market mutual funds without having actually disbursed them ) .
“ Maximum at - risk ” is the high - water mark of government commitments to a program , the maximum level of taxpayer funds that were " at - risk " of being tapped at the height of the crisis .
On the program charts you will also see “ current at - risk , ” which refers to the present , publicly stated level of commitment to a program ( for example , when Treasury announced that the Public - Private Investment Program could entail up to a trillion dollars in government investments when first announced , but that figure was later revised downwards and currently stands at $ 30 billion ) .
“ Disbursed ” means funds that have either gone out the door or , as is common at the Federal Reserve , new balances that were created on the Fed ’s balance sheet and placed in a specific account .
“ Outstanding ” means funds that have been disbursed but have not been paid back or removed from the balance sheet .
For individual program totals , see the complete program details in the individual program pages .
Generally , figures for disbursements are taken directly from data released by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury .
Many “ max at - risk ” figures are taken from reports of the Special Inspector General for TARP .
All figures are individually sourced .

The Pope's Bavarian homeland has not escaped the scandal As accusations of historic sexual abuse by Roman Catholics emerge in another European country , the Vatican has insisted it has dealt with " the very serious issue " promptly and decisively .
After recent revelations of widespread abuse in Ireland , and claims of similar mistreatment of children by priests in Austria and Germany , Catholic bishops in the Netherlands have now set up an independent inquiry to look into allegations there .
More than 200 reports of abuse have been made to a victims ' support organisation in the last few days .
Dutch bishops have offered their apologies to those who were abused .
The Church in Ireland is already struggling to repair relations with a disillusioned public after three official reports in the past five years detailed abuse stretching over several decades and condemned the Church for keeping it secret .
Pope Benedict is expected to issue a letter to be read out in Catholic churches in Ireland later this month , in which he will respond publicly to the scandal .
' Wall of silence '
The allegations from Germany are particularly sensitive , because the Pope was born in the country , and because they include a choir led by his brother Georg .
Reports surfaced last month that Catholic priests had sexually abused more than 170 children at Jesuit schools in Germany .
More scandals could shake people 's faith in the Church , as they have in Ireland Those have been followed by fresh allegations of abuse at three Catholic schools in Bavaria , and within a boys ' choir that was directed for 30 years by Monsignor Georg Ratzinger .
Monsignor Ratzinger said he was aware that children had been beaten at schools attended by the choristers .
However , he said he knew nothing of the kind of sex abuse now being reported .
In Austria the head of a Benedictine monastery in Salzburg has resigned after admitting to sexually abusing a 12 - year - old boy more than four decades ago .
Criticism of the Church has intensified in Germany , with an accusation by the justice minister that bishops behaved secretively in dealing with even severe cases of abuse .
Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger said : " In many schools there was a wall of silence allowing for abuse and violence . "
Church officials called the minister 's remarks " absurd " , and the Vatican insisted that Roman Catholic leaders had " shown a desire for transparency " .
Authority at risk
Its spokesman , Frederico Lombardi said the Church had accelerated the process of unearthing abuse by encouraging victims to speak out about old cases .
Fr Lombardi acknowledged " the gravity of the anguish the Church is going through " , adding that it was striving for better protection for children as well as its own " purification " .
However , he insisted that the problem of sex abuse - although especially reprehensible when it happened inside the Church - was a problem belonging to the whole of society .
The Church is already fighting a battle against secularisation in Western Europe , and the steady erosion of its influence .
There are demands for modernisation , especially the ending of celibacy for priests , fiercely resisted by Pope Benedict .
The experience of the Catholic Church in the United States shows how damaging a long drawn out scandal of sex abuse could be to the Church 's authority and prestige in Europe too .

And Now for Something Completely Different : Your Skin is a Touchpad
April 7th , 2010 by Tina Casey
When it comes to the future of computing , why not skip the middleman ?
That ’s the basic idea behind Skinput , a technology that skips the whole notion of using manufactured touchpads or keyboards to interface with electronic devices .
What could be more simple , elegant and sustainable than using your own skin , which you already have , which lasts a lifetime , and which you will never leave behind in a taxi ?
Skinput was developed by a team headed by Carnegie Mellon University student Chris Harrison , as a way to enable people to manipulate ever - smaller electronic devices .
[ social_buttons ]
Though new technologies are bringing us closer to molecular - sized computers , the size of touchpads and keyboards is still somewhat limited by the size of the average human finger .
Freed from that equation , electronic devices like phones and MP3 players could shrink down to truly microscopic sizes – and that could have some important implications for e-waste , energy efficiency and the sustainable future of electronics .
Inputting with Skinput
If you ’ve ever been “ sounded ” by a doctor thumping on your back or stomach , that ’s the basic mechanics of a skin - based touchpad .
Using acoustic sensors attached to the upper arm , the research team found that the tap of each fingertip on certain locations of the arm generates a unique sound that can be taught to machine learning programs .
A test -run of the system on 20 subjects produced a decent rate of accuracy at an average of 88 % , with finger flicks taking top marks at 97 % .
Skinput , Energy Efficiency , and E - Waste
It ’s no secret that the world is facing a surge in energy gobbling electronic devices and a consequent flood of e-waste , which is bound to climb higher along with the global population and the development of undeveloped regions .
Harrison ’s Skinput provides at least a partial solution by opening the door for much smaller and lighter equipment that generates less e-waste .
It dovetails perfectly with new advances in molecular - level computing , especially for nanomaterials like graphene .
It also meshes with other e-waste solutions such as reducing toxic metals in electronics , and it complements new advances in energy efficient computer chips .

' The internet ' is in the running for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize .
The BBC reports that ' the internet ' is among a record 237 individuals and organizations nominated , up from even last year 's all - time high of 205 .
Modesty does not prevent us from reporting that the candidacy of ' The internet ' was championed by the Italian edition of Wired for advancing " dialogue , debate and consensus " .
" The internet can be considered the first weapon of mass construction , which we can deploy to destroy hate and conflict and to propagate peace and democracy , " Riccardo Luna , editor - in - chief of the Italian edition of Wired magazine , said when it backed the effort last November .
" What happened in Iran after the latest election , and the role the web played in spreading information that would otherwise have been censored , are only the newest examples of how the internet can become a weapon of global hope . "
Nobel institution director Geir Lundestad told the BCC that " thousands of nominations " had been received .
The institute itself does not reveal who is on the short list , though nominating parties often do .
Others believed to be in the running are Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo , the BBC said .
Twitter did n't make the cut as Time Magazine 's " Person of the Year " , but the judging criteria are n't exactly the same — and no offense , but the internet has at least as much experience bringing about world peace as last year 's winner .
Only question : Should ' The internet ' win , who will accept at the lavish ceremony in Stockholm Oslo ( Thank you , BEL ) next Oct.
8 ? Let the comments commence ...

Point :
If only computer RPGs could match up to Pen and Papers RPGs .
You know – real RPGs .
Counterpoint : Piss - right off .
You still hear this attitude a lot .
Hell , back in the day , I suspect I expressed it a bit .
But I was 13 years old , and an idiot .
That it ’s persisting over two decades is getting increasingly embarrassing .
The implicit elitism and defensiveness does a lot to explain why Pen & Paper ( P&P ) still gets eye - raises even in otherwise all - accepting geeky circles .
Nothing makes someone more willing to dismiss your opinion than you sneering at something they love .
If you ignore anything else I say in this column , here ’s one reason to stop using the phrase :
That it ’s self defeating conservative ghettoism .
You either see that as a problem or you are the problem .
Perhaps what most interests me about the continuing existence of this argument is that it ’s an internal - to - gaming phenomenon directly comparable to gaming ’s comparison with other cultural forms .
The film and the novel see the game and looks down it , noting it does n’t do – for example – narrative nearly as well as them , and is therefore is inferior .
An old form judging a new form by its own standards , and logically , finding it lacking .
As if architecture would look down on opera for not providing particularly good roofs , or similar .
Meanwhile , P&P RPG devotees judge Computer RPGs by their own standards , and find them equally lacking .
Like , obviously .
In the same way that proto - P&P Wargamers looked down on D&D for having all this yap getting in the way of the actual game .
It is different .
It does different things .
One is not more “ real ” than another .
Each is its own thing , using its strengths to explore the same idea .
And while some people who use the phrase will protest , the inherent prejudice and rejection - of - another to a second - class citizen is betrayed by the language .
Specifically , the use of the word “ real ” .
This struck me as directly equivalent to the idea of Rockism in pop-criticism .
This is where some forms of music – linked to its production methods – are intrinsically more authentic than others – and authenticity is a sign of merit .
In short , the Byrds are better than Betty Boo because they ’re from the sixties playing bits of wood and string while wearing tassels while Betty Boo came from Mars by way of Glasgow and made music out of spangles and shiny .
Oh – and they ’re guys , of course .
There ’s all sorts of nasty conservative tendencies bubbling beneath the most common examples of the attitude .
Rockist leanings are the sort of thing that get you laughed at if you talk in pop-critic circles , because of the obvious snobbishness .
In other words , this article is n’t about actually preferring one to the other .
You can prefer either .
It ’s the sneer in “ real ” .
The “ real ” can go fuck itself .
For a Fantasy game to come down to a question “ real ” is openly ludicrous .
They are simply different things .
And looked at cleanly , without idea of some virtues being intrinsically better than the other , they come across pretty well as complimentary , overlapping forms .
According to Ron Edwards ’ old GNS
Theory there ’s three sorts of urges underlying pen and paper RPGs , and each creates its own priorities : the gamist urge , the simulationist urge , and the narrativist urge .
Gamist is the most obvious – the idea of using the mechanics of a game to triumph .
A battlefield full of foes and you ; how can you use the rules of the game to win .
The simulationist is about the shared fantasy – the idea that this is a place which you go and explore .
A key observation , for me anyway , would be the simulationist urge is often fine with rules which add to the sense of place , which serve no other function .
The rules are a device to help reach this fantastical , imaginary place .
They ’re its fictional physics .
The narrativist is about creating a story and supporting theme .
Which does n’t mean that it ’s necessarily solely freeform , but rules to help encourage the central issues of what ’s the game ’s about .
For example , the scribbles I have for my own Phonogram RPG is firmly narrativist , with the level system subverted so that as players progress , they lose absolute power , so simulating the slow drift into irrelevance with relation to pop culture .
It would make the game a tragedy as what the individuals gave up so much of their life to slowly bleeds away .
To state the obvious , computer RPGs do a job which compares favourably to pen-and - paper RPGs in two of the categories , while lagging well behind on the third .
Gamist is , frankly , an easy win .
In P&P games you gain a freedom of tactics – but the solidity and speed of play in basic problem - solving exercises that a computer RPG brings to the situation overpowers it .
On simulationist , it ’s more both ways .
You lose the delicacy of touch human interaction can add to the world , but gain an enormous , robust physical simulation .
While not all simulationist , P&P games lean toward realism – it ’s about a consistent fantasy world – many simulationist P&P games play slowly due to the rules ’ complexity .
Does something float or sink ?
In a computer game , the answer is there and extrapolated instantly .
We can see the simulation ’s results and it plays out in real time .
In short : Dwarf Fortress is a better simulation model than any pen and paper RPG in history .
It also does it far quicker than any of them .
The argument being that the player ’s leap of faith which allows you to transform the situation into something more magical – the room a kingdom , your probably - pallid - gamesmaster into a beautiful elf - maid .
And yeah , you can do that .
But you can also apply the same leap of faith to your experience of a videogame and imprint on the universe another human mind has created for you there .
And it ’s as easy .
It ’s much easier , because the touch of another is more distant .
When you gasp at the idea of multiple layers of flesh in the new Dwarf Fortress , that ’s the Simulationist urge being delighted .
And for every limitation of the game you bump against , even in the less physics - based RPGs , factor a disruption of the session when another player decides to quote a joke from their favourite sitcom .
If you ’re sticking to the Real RPGs position at this point , you ’ll probably say “ you must not have good players ” .
I ’ve played with humans rather than imaginary hyperrobots .
And if you ’re genuinely overlooking the disruption of humanity in favour of what else hanging out with people means , you ’re not actually talking about P&P as a game – you ’re talking about P&P as a social activity .
A chance to get together with friends and have fun .
Which is fantastic – but irrelevant to P&P as a game ’s merits and if you include it in the positive attributes intrinsic with the form , I ’ll just end up comparing P&P games unfavourably to getting high on tasty booze and making out with hotties .
Because that ’s far better than throwing around polyhedral dice and thinking about orcs .
Well , mostly .
Or , to take that particular observation the opposite away , assume it is part of P&P RPGs .
As Edwards ’s later model puts it , the social contract between players is actually part of the game .
Single Player Computer Games do n’t have a social contract .
That removes both problems ( sulking folk , The Smelly Chap No- One Wants To Play With And Everyone ’s Too Polite To Tell To Go Away ) and benefits ( glorious improvisation interplay ) .
They do different things .
And the different things , if explored properly , can be enormously rewarding .
Jim notes that in his Pen & Paper history that he stripped down the gamist elements enormously , because it was so treacly slow , in favour of the joys of the story .
With Computer Games you do n’t have to do that .
And , running at full speed , it seems that the pure gamist elements which underlie many more traditional P&P RPGs are wonderfully compulsive systems to wrestle with .
Jim views narrative in videogames as of secondary importance , and it ’s at least in part as he ’s aware that P&P games just do it better .
But that ’s a difference in the form rather than a difference in merit .
He prefers computer games to be gamist as they ’re better at it and he prefers P&P games to be narrativist because they ’re better at that .
The “ real ” does n’t come into it .
In short : the common insult is that computer - role - playing games do n’t have any real role - playing , so should n’t be called role - playing games .
The only riposte is that pen & paper role - playing games do n’t have any real game .
Compared to computer RPGs P&Ps gamist elements are embarrassingly minor .
Neither have any real better claim on the name “ Role - playing games ” , because the other side has a far firmer grasp on the side half of it .
“ The other side ” is a misnomer .
Understand the joy here .
We do n’t need to pick sides .
We can identify the unique benefits of each – and then with that knowledge be better equipped to face new things , like Sleep Is Death , and cleanly examine what they specifically offer .
We get to focus on what is interesting and new … which is another piece .
In practice , the name problem is n’t a problem unless you want to pick a fight .
If we ’re talking about videogames , “ role - playing game ” is fine .
If you ’re in the context of real world games , it ’s equally clear what you meant by the phrase .
And if there ’s confusion , neutral terms like “ Computer role - playing games ” and “ tabletop ” are the correct way to draw a line .
First does not mean primary or “ real ” any more than Epic Verse existing before Tragedy in ancient Greece is any more than a historical note .
And politeness hurts no - one , bignose .
And if you have no interest in what computer RPGs can do and insist on calling pen and paper the “ real ” RPGs , you ’re the sightless man saying that no - one should care about colours .
And just as blind .
Long frustrated by Washington ’s control over much of their state , Utah legislators are proposing a novel way to deal with federal land -- seize it and develop it .
The Utah House of Representatives last week passed a bill allowing the state to use eminent domain to take land the federal government owns and has long protected from development .
The state wants to develop three hotly contested areas -- national forest land in the Wasatch Mountains north of Salt Lake City , land in a proposed wilderness area in the red rock southwestern corner of the state , and a stretch of desert outside of Arches National Park that the Obama administration has declared off - limits to oil and gas development .
Supporters argue that provisions in the legislation that granted Utah statehood allow it to make such a land grab .
They also hope to spark a showdown in the Supreme Court that would rearrange the balance of power between states and the federal government .
Some legal experts say the effort is unlikely to succeed , but Republican state Rep. Chris Herrod , one of the authors of the bill , said the state had little choice .
“ I love America , and I ’m a peaceful guy , ” Herrod said , “ but the only real option we have is rebellion , which I do n’t believe in , and the courts . ”
The eminent domain proposal is among the most audacious yet in a state accustomed to heated battles over the two - thirds of its land owned by the federal government .
This is the state , after all , where local officials bulldozed their own roads through Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument , tore down signs barring off - roading in Canyonlands National Park and , with funding from the statehouse , spent years unsuccessfully defending those actions in federal court .
The eminent domain proposal quickly drew scorn from environmental groups .
“ This is an ideological fantasy , ” said Scott Groene , executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance in Moab .
“ Everybody knows this is n’t going to happen .
The federal public lands are the thing that makes the American West so great . ”
The proposal is one of a host in statehouses nationwide that show a deep discontent with federal authority .
Eight legislatures have passed resolutions asserting , to various degrees , the sovereignty of their states .
In Utah , a dozen measures have been introduced since January that defy the federal government .
It has reached such a pitch that the House ’s Democratic leader last week complained that Republicans were spending too much time on such proposals .
The most aggressive efforts are generally by conservative groups , but Michael Boldin of the 10th Amendment Center in Los Angeles -- named for the constitutional clause that some contend limits federal power over states -- said that states ’ rights were also being cited by liberals in support of state proposals to legalize marijuana and gay marriage .
In the Intermountain West , particularly in rural areas , residents have long complained that federal preservation of land has prevented development that could provide reliable jobs and bolster the tax base .
Last week , a Utah congressman warned that the Obama administration was plotting to create two national monuments in the state , and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert announced that he would meet with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to urge him to reconsider .
The administration said the hullabaloo was sparked by a memo identifying areas that could be protected at some point in the future , not imminently .
A spokeswoman said Herbert supported the concept of the eminent domain proposal but was unsure whether it would survive a legal challenge .
The bill ’s authors contend they can rely on the legislation that brought Utah into the union in 1896 , which they read as requiring the federal government to sell its land in the state and give Utah a 5 % cut .
The legislators want to seize and open two roads through national forest land that the federal government closed .
This would allow access to state land that they hope to sell to developers to build high - end cabins .
A third area would be more provocative : a swath of federal land outside Arches National Park where the George W. Bush administration , on the eve of the 2008 election , authorized oil and gas exploration .
The Obama administration reversed the decision .
Legal experts contend that the federal government is under no obligation to sell its land in Utah and that no state could successfully seize federal property .
“ It flies in the face of history and is also inconsistent as a point of law , ” said Bob Keiter , a law professor at the University of Utah .
Keiter and others argue that the move illustrates a pattern in recent Western history -- a conservative backlash to the election of a Democratic president .
After Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 , the movement known as the Sagebrush Rebellion helped lock up the West for the GOP and put Ronald Reagan in the White House .
President Clinton faced a similar backlash , aggravated by his creation before the 1996 presidential election of Grand Staircase - Escalante Monument .
“ Utah has this history of grand conservation gains , ” Groene said .
“ Every time it happens it triggers this anger .
And 20 years later we always look back and agree that conservation was a wise idea . ”

The ISS Crew Return Vehicle ( CRV ) program is just one example of NASA canceling a program without consultation with its international partners : a dangerous legacy .
( credit : NASA ) Does NASA have an international future ?
As long as NASA cannot maintain a serious large - scale program that can last more than one administration , it is hard to see how it can be taken seriously as a solid long - term partner by foreign space agencies .
The US has a mixed record of sticking to its international space commitments .
The International Space Station ( ISS ) program is a shining example of the US taking a decision to lead a partnership and then doing just about everything it could to insure the success of the effort .
As long as NASA cannot maintain a serious large - scale program that can last more than one administration , it is hard to see how it can be taken seriously as a solid long - term partner by foreign space agencies .
Ever since Bill Clinton turned Ronald Reagan ’s Space Station Freedom program into the ISS in 1993 , the program has thrived in spite of its many critics and in the face of costly delays and the aftermath of the Columbia disaster .
It exists today and it is a marvelous example of what America can do when it wants to .
The international partners have performed well , but without the US the thing never would have been built .
In contrast , in 2002 NASA administrator Sean O’Keefe canceled the Crew Return Vehicle ( CRV ) development program due to what he said were budget problems .
Germany had invested considerable time and money to design a nose cone for the CRV , and this investment was lost .
Yet the CRV fiasco was a minor glitch compared to the 1981 cancellation of the US - European International Solar Polar Mission ( ISPM ) .
This was one of he most ambitious heliophysics missions ever proposed .
In the first months of the Reagan administration , budget cuts forced NASA to cancel either the space telescope , the Galileo Jupiter mission , or the ISPM .
The Europeans vigorously protested the cancellation : they had assumed that the US would follow their tradition , which was ( and is ) to never cancel any international program no matter how much stress this puts on purely national programs .
Since then the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and NASA have successfully cooperated on several solar physics missions , including the long running SOHO probe and now the potentially spectacular Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) spacecraft launched last month .
Yet even after thirty years , ESA has not forgotten , or forgiven , what happened to the ISPM .
Another European disappointment was the Spacelab module , which flew far fewer missions than ESA had hoped .
At least that program led the way for Italy to become proficient at building space structures .
The science work that had been planned had to be abandoned , leaving NASA with yet another blot on its international record .
The US has a fundamental problem with the way it designs and builds long - term civilian science and technology programs .
It is simply too easy for an administration to propose a new project , if Congress agrees to get funding .
But there is nothing that obliges any future administration to continue any particular program .
Even worse , there is no sense among politicians or civil servants that once a program has begun it is wise to finish it .
A nation with a reputation for never finishing what it starts will find few genuine partners for any of its major projects .
One of the worst examples of this was the cancellation in 1993 of the Superconducting Super Collider , a giant particle physics project that was voted down by a Congress anxious to deal a blow to what was then known as “ Big Science ” .
Since then America ’s standing in this branch of science has fallen from a place of indisputable leadership to one of parity with Europe and Japan .
CERN in Geneva is world ’s premier center for this research and the technological benefits that go along with it have long been lost .
The US has a fundamental problem with the way it designs and builds long - term civilian science and technology programs .
There is nothing that obliges any future administration to continue any particular program .
Though the problem may appear to be political , it might be a good idea to look at the structural roots of this phenomenon .
The US has never been able to put together a “ Capital Improvement Budget ” .
The Pentagon can occasionally put together a multi - year program , but they are generally restricted to items that have been in production for many years and whose cost structure is well understood by the procurement bureaucracy and industry .
Ambitious science and technology projects fall well outside this category .
The negative reaction by some in Congress to the proposed cancellation of the Constellation program could be seen as an opportunity for the US legislature to rethink the way it funds these big long - term programs .
It should not be beyond the ability of Congress to pass a budget law designating certain programs as “ settled ” and immunizing them from the normal year - to - year political flux .
The fact that such programs would deprive Congress of its ability to fine - tune annual policy would insure that these programs would be rare indeed and would have to be especially valuable .
Such a change in the system would , over the long term , make the US a leading partner in global science and technology projects , not only due to the excellence of our researchers and the size of our budgets , but due to America ’s reliability .
Otherwise we will continue to be seen as a dangerous and unstable ally , liable to quit any project with the slightest shift in the political winds .

Pastoral letter to victims expresses shame and remorse of Catholic church and calls on priests to face justice
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The pope today apologised to the victims of child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland , saying he was " truly sorry " for their suffering .
In a pastoral letter to Irish Catholics , Benedict XVI castigated Irish bishops for " grave errors of judgment " in their handling of the paedophilia scandal and ordered a Vatican investigation into the Irish church .
But he made no mention of any Vatican responsibility and gave no specific punishments for bishops who have been blamed by victims and Irish government inquiries for having concealed the abuse .
" You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry , " the pope wrote , addressing the victims .
" It is understandable that you find it hard to forgive or be reconciled with the church .
In her name , I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel . "
The letter described the sexual and physical abuse perpetrated by priests , brothers and nuns as " sinful and criminal " , saying they had betrayed the trust of the faithful , brought shame on the church and now must answer to God and civil authorities .
" Conceal nothing , " he said .
" Openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of God 's mercy . "
Benedict criticised the Irish bishops for having failed , " sometimes grievously " , to apply the church 's punishments for child abusers , which include defrocking them .
But he did not rebuke them specifically for having failed to report cases of abuse to police .
" I recognise how difficult it was to grasp the extent and complexity of the problem , to obtain reliable information and to make the right decisions in the light of conflicting expert advice , " Benedict wrote .
" Nevertheless , it must be admitted that grave errors of judgment were made and failures of leadership occurred .
And this has seriously undermined your credibility and effectiveness . "
In recent weeks , the Vatican has been trying to contain damage as a string of scandals over sexual abuse of children by priests has hit Ireland , Germany , Austria and the Netherlands .
The pope ordered a Vatican investigation into some dioceses , seminaries and religious orders .
Such inquiries only occur when the Vatican considers a local church unable to deal with a problem on its own , as in the case of sexual abuse by US priests .
Victims have demanded that bishops resign .
Three Irish bishops have offered to step down but the pope has not accepted their resignations .
Three official inquiries , ordered by the Irish government , documented how thousands of Irish children were raped , molested or otherwise abused by priests in their parishes , and by nuns and brothers in boarding schools and orphanages .
Irish bishops did not report a single case to police until 1996 after victims began to sue the church .
Benedict said he recognised that nothing could undo the victims ' pain and he compared their suffering to that of Christ on the cross .
" Christ 's own wounds , transformed by his redemptive sufferings , are the very means by which the power of evil is broken and we are reborn to life and hope . "
Update :
The University of Oregon is reportedly expected to offer Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo the largest contract in college basketball ,
A source from the Oregon athletic department
in a report Sunday night that Nike chairman Phil Knight – an Oregon booster and alumnus – will be “ backing ” the contract .
The proposed offer is expected to match or surpass Kentucky coach John Calipari ’s record - setting contract , after he signed an eight - year , $ 31.65 million deal last year .
Izzo currently makes more than $ 3 million annually and earns $ 1 million bonuses each year he remains with the Spartans .
As of Sunday night , there were no known discussions between the parties and no official offer had been made , the TV station reports .
Oregon cannot interview Izzo or make any formal offer until Michigan State is finished playing in the NCAA Tournament .
The Spartans , who on Sunday beat Tennessee , will meet Butler in the Final Four on Saturday in a meeting of two No. 5 seeds .
It will be the sixth time in 12 years that Izzo has taken Michigan State to the Final Four .
Former Ducks athletic director Pat Kilkenny , who is leading the coaching search after Mike Bellotti's resignation as athletic director , said he expects to fill the school 's vacancy by the Final Four -- a week from now ,
.
Kilkenny reportedly traveled from New York to Houston on Sunday , where it is believed he met with Pitt coach Jamie Dixon .
Kilkenny is said to be in Houston to meet with Tom Penders , who resigned last week as coach of the Houston Cougars , and Houston Rockets coach Rick Adelman .
The Irish have their St. Patrick 's Day ( 3/17 ) , the Welsh have their St. David's , with parades and other events during the Welsh " national holiday . "
Apparently 87 percent of the would like to have St Davids be a " bank holiday , " but a petition to that effect in 2007 was rejected by Tony Blair .
While the Irish has their shamrock , the Welsh have their leek to wear .
We do n't know a great deal about David , and while you will find the usual skeptical opinion - -" he is so shrouded in legend and overlaid with later hagiography that maybe he never existed " -- there is enough historical evidence to believe that he existed , that he taught in Wales , and that he made a marked that lasted and spread .
( The earliest surviving reference to him may well be an early 7th - century inscription on a gravestone : " Here lies Idnert , the son of Jacob , who was killed defending the church of holy David from pillage . " )
You find this pattern of influence throughout the history of the church -- Patrick in Ireland , Columba on Iona , Aidan of Lindisfarne , Romanus and Lupicinus of the Jura Mountains , Gall in Switzerland , Boniface in Germany , Genevieve in Paris , and certainly there are modern examples -- the Orthodox might point to Herman of Alaska and the influence and fruit of his labor among the native populations .
We see someone who takes the Gospel seriously , gives his or her entire life to living it and spreading it , counting themselves as servants of Jesus Christ , and a previously pagan society some years or generations later has become populated with churches , monasteries , scriptural knowledge , increasing literacy , with a downturn in things such as human sacrifice and infanticide .
Those who carry the burden of presenting Jesus Christ to those outside the faith are following in the steps of the apostles , sent out to make disciples of all nations .
The apostles , of course , were for the most part fishermen , sent out to bring the " whole world into their net . "
It requires people like David , Brigit of Ireland , Columba , Gall , Francis Xavier , and modern day laborers in the " fields white unto harvest . "
There is no rest , each generation needing the Gospel taught and lived , to show that Christ is indeed with us even now in our midst , " till the end of the age . "
Were St. David alive today , what would he do ?
Just as he did before .
What he do with a bank holiday ?
Preach !
By salvation I mean , not barely , according to the vulgar notion , deliverance form hell , or going to heaven ; but a present deliverance from sin , a restoration of the soul to its primitive health , its original purity ; a recovery of the divine nature ; the renewal of our souls after the image of God , in righteousness and true holiness , in justice , mercy , and truth .
This implies all holy and heavenly tempers , and , by consequence , all holiness of conversation .
Now , if by salvation we mean a present salvation from sin , we cannot say , holiness is the condition of it ; for it is the thing itself .
Salvation , in this sense , and holiness , are synonymous terms .
The facts :
In June 2008 , Alberto Armandi , Maurizio Colarossi and Olivier Lalonde formed an internet advertising startup named Wozad.com , and attempted to raise $ 250,000 through micro funding , claiming the company would generate $ 5 billion in revenue by 2010 and run neck and neck with Google AdWords in 2012 .
Yeah , we know .
On or about February 2 , 2010 , an Alberto Armandi found videos of the Smit MID - 560 tablet around the internet , and wrote comments like the below on each :
Hey , i am doing trading business in china and just ordered a lot of 500 pieces of the Smit 560 .
The thing is real and i can show off real pictures .
I will get a sample in about 15 days .
Is anybody interested in a reseller opportunity ?
Accompanying each comment , he provided a link to a series of eBay auctions , each for a lot of 50 tablets .
These eBay auctions have since been deleted .
On February 4th , Alberto Armandi purchased the enso - now.com domain name , supplying an address in Shenzhen , China .
On March 8th , Alberto ( under the handle enso - now ) attempted to get feedback on the website at Y Combinator .
He told commentors that he did not yet have a device , but was instead " waiting to meet with the factory to buy the prototype . "
Two comments later , he wrote : " i am not pre-selling anything , the device is currently produced and i can ship you 500 hundreds of pieces to you in a week . "
On March 8th , Maurizio's twitter account pointed to the website .
( On March 4th , it pointed to another of Alberto 's get - rich - quick ideas , watch - replicas.net . )
On March 10th , Alberto defended Enso 's reputation amidst scam allegations , again at Y Combinator .
On March 12th , eBay seller " enso - now*com " got neutral feedback on an auction for an individual tablet , under the name " GOOGLE ANDROID TABLET IPAD IPHONE STYLE WIFI GPS 3G . "
On March 22nd , it got negative feedback for the same item , with the buyer claiming that he had n't received it after a 45 day wait , and had to get his refund through PayPal .
These auctions and the eBay seller account have since been deleted .
In between our March 22nd posting and now , customers on the official Enso Facebook page and various websites complained that they were n't receiving so much as a payment confirmation after purchase .
Until around March 30th , customers ordering the zenPad through the Enso website had to send money directly to a co-founder 's PayPal account , " OLALONDE . "
Originally , Enso 's about page promised devices would be processed and shipped within 7 working days .
Then , customers on the official Facebook page wrote that Enso had replied to their worried emails saying that the company was overwhelmed by orders and the device would start shipping April 10 .
As of this week , the company 's website was updated to read :
Due to our huge and sudden success , our facilities have a hard time to keep up with demand and shipping delays are longer than usual .
Be advised that the current average wait time for shipping is 15 - 23 days .
As mentioned earlier , Enso now says it cannot ship the device until May 8th .
As of April 5th , customers claimed they were unable to log into their accounts at Enso 's website , and noticed that Enso 's logo was similar to that of other companies called Enso .
( Since " enso " is Japanese for a circle in calligraphy , anger at the latter is probably misinformed . )
Customer Jerry O'Hara got in touch with Enso , who told him that sales records were being " saved in a database " and that customers would be informed when the devices started to ship .
We emailed Enso on April 6th .
We received no reply .
On or around April 7th , Multimediawereld .be got in touch with manufacturer Shenzhen State Micro Technology ( SMIT ) , who confirmed that Enso had purchased a single sample tablet , but had not placed an order :
This is Forrest from SMIT , how are you ?
I 'm in charge of the overseas sales for the MIS products .
Regarding your question below , for Enso
They did purchase a MID - 560 sample from us two weeks ago .
They Have not Placed mass production order to us .
Forrest also told Multimediawereld that the current MID - 560 does not support several features , including 3G connectivity , that Enso claims their zenPad does , and questioned if the zenPad was in fact the same device .
On April 8th , Enso posted their first two official blog entries , backdating one to appear as if it was posted March 31st .
They claim that the startup is a " victim of its own sudden success " and has already sold thousands of zenPads , but that the sudden influx of money caused eBay and PayPal to freeze its accounts , preventing them from manufacturing and shipping the tablets .
Enso also claims that they are currently unable to refund customers who purchased before March 30th because the company had a limited PayPal account at that time .
We just spoke with Olivier Lalonde , who confirmed that the company does not and never did have more than 25 units , the majority of which he says have already been shipped out to customers .
He would n't disclose how many units have been sold or how much money the company has accumulated , but told us that less than 15 % of their customers have opted for a refund , and that Enso has already begun paying them back .
" Most of them are okay with the shipping delay , they just wanted to know that they would receive the device , " he told us .
When asked about the company 's practice of selling merchandise they did not have , Olivier said , " Honestly , we did n't expect so many orders in such a short span of time , " and recommended that any worried customers apply for a refund , and re-purchase later on when the company had proven itself .
Even with the deck stacked against them , it 's still quite possible Enso is wholly legit , and plans to issue both tablets and refunds in short order .
They 're certainly polite , when they get around to answering our calls .
But honestly , with a company as shady ( or unprepared ) as this , it 's just not worth the risk .
PayPal director of communications Anuj Nayar told us that if you want a refund , the online payment processor gives you no more than 45 days from the order date to file a dispute , and you might as well do so : " If a buyer is worried , they can open a claim , and and then just close it if things work out .
"
We 'd close with a JooJoo joke here , but hey , it actually shipped .
Although that might have actually made matters worse [ Thanks , Brecht ]

Some argue voodoo should play a leading role A month before Haiti 's devastating earthquake , prominent musician Theodore " Lolo " Beaubrun and a few friends were summoned by spirits who tried to warn them about the impending cataclysm .
" They told us to pray for Haiti because many people would die , " says Mr Beaubrun - the frontman of the group Boukman Eksperyans .
" I thought it was about politics .
I did n't know it was going to be an earthquake . "
The spirits may have failed to make themselves understood , but according to Mr Beaubrun - whose music and outlook are steeped in voodoo culture - they are standing by the Haitian people in their hour of need .
" We are extremely traumatised , " he says .
" We have seen death .
But the spirits entered the minds of people to advise and help them heal .
They speak to us .
It 's like therapy . "
But Mr Breaubrun 's idea that voodoo should play a leading role in helping victims of the country 's worst - ever natural disaster is currently little more than a hope .
Voodoo relief Haiti's traditional religion has kept a low profile in the aftermath of the earthquake .
The songs and prayers heard amid the rubble and tent cities around Port - au - Prince are overwhelmingly Christian .
Some Christian communities do not want to give food to voodoo followers
Theodore ' Lolo ' Beaubrun
Singer
The voodoo religion may be practised by many Haitians - the exact number is unknown - and has not been totally absent from the aid effort .
Louis Leslie Marcelin , another singer who also describes himself as a spiritual guide and healer , has used his home in Port - au - Prince as an alternative school and a care centre .
" We work with children and parents , " he says .
" We work with poor people whose relatives have died . "
But such efforts by voodoo leaders have been few and far between .
The bulk of the religious relief aid work in Haiti has been carried out by Catholic and Protestant groups .
" For a religion that 's supposedly the national religion of the Haitian people , it 's amazingly absent in the earthquake phenomena , " says Gerald Murray , a University of Florida anthropologist who has carried out extensive fieldwork in Haiti .
Prejudice Some argue that voodoo's conspicuous absence in the aftermath of the quake is due to prejudice .
Many Christians - especially Protestants - regard voodoo as devil worship .
This idea was expressed in its most striking form by the US televangelist Pat Robertson , who said shortly after the quake that Haiti had made a " pact with the devil " when it defeated French colonists two centuries ago .
According to Mr Beaubrun , such attitudes have been in evidence during relief operations .
" Some Christian communities do not want to give food to voodoo followers , " he says .
" As soon as they see people wearing peasant clothes or voodoo handkerchiefs , they put them aside and deny them food .
" This is something I 've seen . "
The 12 January quake left more than a million homeless
Hostility to voodoo - which blends elements of Christianity with West African animistic beliefs and practices - is indeed rife among some evangelical groups in Haiti and elsewhere .
However most mainstream Christians - notably Catholics - have insisted on not marginalising the voodoo faith .
Father Reginald Jean - Marie of Notre - Dame , the largest Roman Catholic church in Miami's Little Haiti , insists : " Any system of belief that people cling to especially in a time of crisis can be of help to them . "
Blaming voodoo for the country 's problems , he says , is " theological nonsense " .
" When the ( Asian ) tsunami happened it was not because people did wrong , " he says .
" Things happen because they are natural disasters .
If you claim that voodoo is responsible for those things , then is God responsible when bad things happen to good Christians ? "
Faraway god
The three days of prayer held for earthquake victims on 12 , 13 and 14 February pointedly included voodoo practitioners .
And , perhaps equally pointedly , a houngan ( voodoo priest ) taking part in the event stressed the common element between his faith and Christianity .
Religious faith plays an important role in Haitian society
He told the BBC he would " pray to bondye " - referring to the voodoo supreme god , while not stressing the " loa " , the lesser spirits that are at the centre of rituals .
This suggests tension between Haiti 's rival faiths is not the main reason for voodoo's lack of visibility after the earthquake .
The principal factor , according to anthropologist Gerald Murray , could be theological .
In the voodoo belief system , natural disasters are not caused by the " loa " , but by a distant " bondye " .
The supreme being that unleashes the forces of nature is an unfathomable entity which cannot be influenced .
Only the lowly " loa " , Mr Murray notes , can be accessed or propitiated - often through rituals led by houngans .
The main role of these specialists , Mr Murray adds , is the diagnosis and healing of an individual 's illnesses .
" They have not traditionally played a role of national , social leaders of any type , " he says .
" They will continue to be spirit healers for people who believe that their problems have been caused by the loa - but this earthquake was not caused by the loa . "
Many Haitians will find solace in voodoo , which remains an important element of Haitian identity .
But the coping strategies it offers in the aftermath of the earthquake may be limited .

Can you recommend any source of it ?

Thanks Brad , I know it stupid to even have to go into the details on such a discredited story ... but I think its a great thing to do this .
These rats devised their strategy to trick these ACORN employees based their assumption the employees would care about them and try to help them ... so these rats told them a sympathetic story .
So no good deed goes unpunished .
Again and again I see these emotional stories floated that are made to seem credible by MSM and then too slowly over time the " official " story is debunked as actual details emerge .
Since 60 minutes not likely to do it , a 10 to 15 min video showing what really happened at these ACORN offices and compare it to the unquestioning media coverage of this .
Even the Daily Show fell for this OKeefe crap , the should do one of the funny media critics / lampoons on this ... I 'm waiting .
Thanks Brad , this is really very very important work you are doing ... hard being heard shouting into a storm but when you are trying to help , its worth doing .

Brad sez : since three investigations ( one from the Congressional Research Service , one from MA 's former Attorney General , and the latest , just this week from the Brooklyn , NY District Attorney ) have all found no criminal wrongdoing by the low - level ACORN employees caught on secret video , and ; Can you help me out , Brad , and point me to the language in the CRS report that finds no criminal wrongdoing by ACORN ?
Just a quote and / or citation to a particular page number , if you please .

It 's just sinking in , after reading this , how horribly racist these sickos are .
I know ... I had just focused on the ridiculousness of it all , the mendacity , and the failing of the mainstream media once again .
But my God , this is just fucking hateful shit .
This is targeted ... premeditated ... assassination .
If there is a hell , these subhumans should burn for a good long while .
Nice and toasty on their balls .

You link my lengthy post of liberal myths I debunk but do not address a single point that I made in that post .
Not one .
Instead you talk about the tin , which I do not talk about in that post .
I 'm not following how the video is supposedly deceptive --- at least in light of the presence of the unedited audio .
Are you saying that O'Keefe should have included this passage ( which you quote in the post ) in the video ?
when you buy , let me tell you something when you buy the house with a back yard .
You get a tin if Tom Jones is going to come beat you and want money you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you do n't tell a single soul but yourself where it is Is that your point ?
That he should have included that passage in the video , and not just in the unedited audio ?
You do acknowledge that this passage is in the unedited audio , correct ?
And the transcript ?
Provided by O'Keefe ?
That 's where you found it .
Right ?
Do you find it ironic that every piece of evidence you claim undercuts the videos ' honesty was PROVIDED BY O'KEEFE ?
( Footage of him walking into ACORN in slacks .
Audio of women talking about Tom Jomes , etc. ) P.S. I 'm not talking about people 's DESCRIPTIONS of the video .
( For example , you have badly misrepresented what is on the videos , repeatedly saying O'Keefe did not pose as a pimp when he repeatedly said he wanted to set up a house and have Giles and underage girls turn tricks , turning the money over to O'Keefe for his Congressional campaign . )
I 'm talking about the VIDEO ITSELF and trying to understand your beef .
Are you saying O'Keefe had some kind of responsibility to include the above passage in the video as opposed to just the unedited audio and the transcript ?
Where you found the above passage ?

@soul rebel , - yes when I think about , they went in with a plan : that they would act , for the media , like they presented themselves as outlandish , obvious degenerates and criminal types , but that in reality they would go into these offices looking reasonable ( clean cut college law student trying to help abused woman leave behind street life ) and they planned to LIE to the ACORN employees purposely trying to trap them in something that will be made to look much worse than it is .
And they planned to LIE to media when they filmed Okeefe as a pimp , knowing they would lie and say he told ACRON folks he was a pimp .
Think about having that as your plan ... that is straight up cold - blooded .
And their plan in fact acknowledges that they will have to trick media into thinking one thing happened when in fact they will beahve in a wholly different manner to ACORN ... that was plan all along .
And with that trick , I bet they thought they'd get at least one bad apple , what org does n't have one corrupt one , or a stupid one , that would say or do something illegal for this fake , hard - luck couple ..... but they get basically squat , so they had to do another further immoral step to smear the very ACORN staff , who in good faith tried to help them ( as the people they were acting to be ) , by editing their video underhandedly .
So time and time again , ACORN employees treat these people ( appearing to be legit , but in a tough spot ) with respect and helpfulness and these rats turn on them with a national smear campaign .
And they , these white people take their racist stereotypes and try to fake like this is what ACORN / black people are about as a whole group , corrupt help for immoral , criminal people ( read : black people in white peoples eyes ) ..
When in fact the ACORN staff behaved professionally and humanely ... while these spoiled white jerks " journalists " were the liars , corrupt , immoral ones , and were the criminals , illegally recording people , libeling a national do - good organization with false editing and lying about the interviews .
These jerks had to know people would lose jobs because of their lies and that the organization would lose funding / support because their baseless smears , they had to have made personal connections with many people working at these offices , no doubt they were genearlly treated kindly and with respect as I , a white person at such black community orgs , have always been treated .
No doubt in Okeefes extended travels and visist , he saw ACORN offices doing good things for people .
Despite watching ACORN employees try over and over again to help his fake persona , Okeefe , still forges ahead with his smear campaign ... his selfish , biased , and racist agenda trumped all .
I 'm sure he wanted to be famous rich , conservative darling , and trashing a whole do - good community and a bunch of black people along the way ... hey who cares , we it will make us rich and famous ...
And the racism in the mainstream media is awful ... while OKeefe seemed like obvious amateur hour , the media implicitly trusted this BOY with no credentials and no raw tape and sources confirming their telling of events , and yet they took his word over ACORN 's staff .
Did MSM interview the guy at ACORN office - was it in SanDiego ? - ( who was suspicious of OKeefe enough to call the cops ) for his side of the story ?
Or did they interview any ACORN staff at all to hear how these kids presented themselves ?.. NO , From MSM perspective , there is apparently only one side of the story , the WHITE side , which is apparently instantly credible regardless lack of credibility of source , if FOX says one thing , then it must be so ... and the black people are assumed to be criminal , suspect , unworthy of even being heard or asked to tell their side , let along getting credible reporting .
arrrrgggg the MSM should really pay for this , they must be held accountable for not spending a few hours talking to ACORN staff , who I 'm sure had many office admin , staff people , client / passersby who could have quickly and consistently made two things we now know as facts clear : ... 1 ) Okeefe appeared different in offices that purported on tapes and 2 ) told a different ( and reasonable story ) to ACORn offices compared to the lies they told to MSM media about what they said at offices .
I bet there were at least 50 witnesses at these various offices of ACORN who could have been easily found within a day or two of these tapes being released , who would have consistently contradicted the fabricated story of these immoral , selfish liars .
That MSM did not even bother , let alone do a good fact checking and follow up stories tells all about the state of MSM .
If white folks said it on FOx news and what they said is : black people and their organizations are corrupt , criminal and immoral ... then it REALLY must be true , why would we even think for a second to ask any questions ... FOX and OKeefe appear so credible , and our horrible biases about black people have been totally confirmed , so it must be so .

Okay , I 've gone through the San Diego transcript which is pretty fun cuz there 's so little of anything you could even try to manipulate .
This did not stop our intrepid journalists from doing their gosh darn best to bring down those evil Acorns , however .
They made a video .
Unfortunately they somehow left out of the video the Acorn interviewer ( Juan Carlos ) taking pictures of them with his cell phone .
And somehow , maybe cuz they were in such a hurry to get the truth out , they subsequently neglected to include in their stories the fact that after they left the Acorn office , Juan Carlos contacted " his cousin , a National City Police Detective , to ask him general advice regarding information he had received about possible human trafficking . " ( from police report quoted in Harshbarger report ) .
It was unclear , from either the video or transcript , which part of the " pimp " / prostitute ruse Juan Carlos was n't buying .

What does Brad Friedman say of the fact that the Brooklyn DA said O'Keefe and Giles posed as a pimp and prostitute ?
The three had been secretly videotaped by two people posing as a pimp and prostitute , who came to ACORN ’S Brooklyn office , seeking advice about how to purchase a house with money generated by their ‘ business . ’
Brad ?
Will you ever publish this comment ?
What say you ?

sorry , should 've clarified .
You know Juan Carlos was taking pictures of them cuz it's in the transcript .
And the way I read the transcript , O'Keefe is alarmed at all the pictures being taken .

Patterico said @ 6 : You link my lengthy post of liberal myths I debunk but do not address a single point that I made in that post .
It 's cuz I 'm stilling trying to figure out what a " liberal myth " is .
Is it one that is even more mythier than a regular myth ?
As I 've noted previously , Patty , you are not a serious person .
You offer disingenuous arguments that you know to be disingenuous , but you offer them anyway .
You are proven wrong on point after point and do n't have the intellectual honesty to post a transparent apology / correction , but instead hide your failures on a post you never publish to your front page .
You even know how disingenuous you are / were in your arguments that , as noted in the article above , are n't serious enough to waste time in responding to , particularly as you have not once bothered to offer the courtesy of an answer to the question I have asked you over and over again .
I 'll do so again now :
How have you , as a Deputy District Attorney , authenticated the " unedited audio " that you say " proves " this , that or the other thing ?
You know what the standards of evidence are as a Deputy D.A. in Los Angeles .
At least I 'd presume you do .
But you have n't bothered to share with us the answer to that question .
Please do .
Thank you .
( Still trying to figure out that whole " liberal myth " thing myself ... a myth that is an unorthodox myth ?
A non-traditional myth ? ... I 'll keep working on it , you keep making stuff up and defending fraudsters in the meantime . )

Dear Patterico-- re : San Diego Acorn 1 . From what I can make out in San Diego , the only action that was taken by anyone from Acorn was Juan Carlos calling the cops cuz he thought O'Keefe and Giles were involved in human trafficking .
What is Acorn supposed to be guilty of here ?
2 . What 's the justification for going into an Acorn office in San Diego and lying your heads off in an attempt to discredit community organizers who 's job is trying to help the disenfranchised ?
3 . Do you really condone wholesale lying to people who have done you no harm ?

Meanwhile , at the global banking conspiracy ... From Black Swan on Mish 's blog :
If you look at the TARP payouts from AIG , they match up almost perfectly with those big banks that donated $ 300 million each to keep LTCM afloat in 1998 .
In fact , right before the actual bailout , AIG , Goldman Sachs and Buffet offered to buy out the LTCM fund 's partners for $ 250 million , and offered to dump in an additional whopping $ 3.75 billion so that Goldman 's traders could operate the LTCM hedge fund .
Who would have guessed at the time , that AIG would some day be on the other end of the bailouts ?
Ultimately , Bankers Trust , Barclays , Chase , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , J.P. Morgan , Morgan Stanley , Salomon Smith Barney and UBS kicked in $ 300 million each , and Société Générale kicked in an additional $ 1.25 million .
To figure out why some banks recieved more than others from AIG , it helps to look at the consolidations .
Bankers
Trust ( talk about an oxymoron ) was swallowed up by Deutsche Bank .
Chase was engulfed by JP Morgan which had already been sucked up by Chemical Bank ( which took the JP Morgan name ) , Merrill Lynch was " purchased " by Bank of America and Salomon Smith Barney became the step child of Citigroup .
Barkley 's , of course , dined on what was left of Lehman Brothers , which had donated $ 100 million to the LTCM bailout cause in 1998 .
This AIG reward money theory is my own .
I 've never read it anywhere , but I have read that Bear Stearns was allowed to fail because the IB refused to kick in a dime to save LTCM .
I believe that if anybody really researched it , my AIG reward theory would hold up .
It got me believing in the international banking conspiracy .
If you do n't believe in the international banking conspiracy , it 's hard to explain why all those European banks were gifted with billions of US taxpayers dollars through the AIG bailout scam .

Brad , I 'm on your side but why are you demanding " retractions " or " corrections " .
The NY Times did n't make up the stuff .
They were duped .
But they should do follow - up stories on the outcome of the trial and the shameful actions of the perpetrators that have come to ligt .
Just as in the Duke Lacrosse " rape " case , media did n't do " retractions " in the classic sense ; they just printed the story as it developed and ended up making the guys the victims and the lady a villain !
If I were the Times I would n't necessary apologize for printing what we believed to be true , but I would defnitely do an in depth follow - ups , particularly due ot the importance and impact of the sotry .
I 'm not being facetious , the Acorn Pimp story was one the the biggest and most influential stories of the year .
The fact that it was a hoax has to be big news .
Then fact that the Times and others are ignoring the continuing story is a disgrace .

Do you believe that O'Keefe told any ACORN employees that he wanted to set up a house where Giles and underage girls would turn tricks and give the money to him for his Congressional campaign ?
I really want to know that my oft - repeated question will be answered so I would like to hold up discussing San Diego until you answer that .

Brad ,
Your fundmental claim in this post is that the video was edited deceptively in one way .
I 'm not talking about people 's DESCRIPTIONS of the video .
( For example , you have badly misrepresented what is on the videos , repeatedly saying O'Keefe did not pose as a pimp when he repeatedly said he wanted to set up a house and have Giles and underage girls turn tricks , turning the money over to O'Keefe for his Congressional campaign . )
I 'm talking about the VIDEO ITSELF and trying to understand your beef .
You refer to a passage about Tom Jones .
You do acknowledge that this passage is in the unedited audio , correct ?
And the transcript ?
Provided by O'Keefe ?
That 's where you found it .
Right ?
Do you find it ironic that every piece of evidence you claim undercuts the videos ' honesty was PROVIDED BY O'KEEFE ?
( Footage of him walking into ACORN in slacks .
Audio of women talking about Tom Jomes , etc. )
Are you saying that O'Keefe should have included this passage ( which you quote in the post ) in the video ?
when you buy , let me tell you something when you buy the house with a back yard .
You get a tin if Tom Jones is going to come beat you and want money you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you do n't tell a single soul but yourself where it is Is that your point ?
That he should have included that passage in the video , and not just in the unedited audio ?
Where you found it , because it had been provided by O'Keefe ?

It allows us to say " hit job " instead of " sting operation " and allows us to confirm that O'Keefe not only did n't dress like a pimp , he did n't present himself as one , except possibly in a few phrases deviously slipped in to the conversation once it was well under way .
Even then I would hold judgment until the full unedited videos are released .

____________________________
Both I and others have repeatedly asked Patterico aka Deputy DA Patrick Frey two simple questions : 1 . Why has n't his office initiated an investigation into whether O'Keefe and Giles violated CA Penal Code 632 , which bars secret recordings of confidential communications ?
( Note : One of their sting operations took place in the City of Los Angeles which is within his jurisdiction ) .
2 . Does he , Mr. Frey , feel that his defense of individuals who should be the subject of a criminal investigation by his office creates an ethical dilemma for him ?
To date , Mr. Frey has refused to answer those straightforward questions .
As I noted elsewhere , if Mr. Frey does not believe that his defense of O'Keefe and Giles creates an ethical dilemma , he should simply say so , explaining why .
Yet he remains silent , and that silence speaks volumes .
Finally , to add to your observations Weaseldog , one of the two " con-artists " Mr. Frey is defending is facing charges for an alleged federal felony .
Mr. Frey has chosen to rely on the content of what are probably illegally recorded audiotapes , not to initiate prosecutions against those who obtained them , but to score political points in his desire to smear the reputation of a benevolent community organization .
My parents used to tell me , " You 're known by the company you keep . "
While I did not choose criminal law as a field I ever wanted to practice in , I 've always had the utmost respect for those who devote their lives to insuring that our society is both safe and lawful .
I admire and respect those who choose to work as criminal prosecutors .
I express no opinion on whether Mr. Frey has actually violated any ethical standard .
However , I must acknowledge that , personally , I find it just a wee bit disconcerting to see a Deputy DA stepping forward to defend the deceitful and probably unlawful behavior of an accused federal felon like James O'Keefe .

Poor Patterico aka LA County Deputy DA Patrick
Frey plays the why me ?
card of a wounded child because Brad Friedman placed his posts in " moderation " because , despite repeated warnings , he continued to level personal attacks on others with whom he disagrees .
He gave no warning to me before blocking my IP .
If he 's modified it since , I do n't really know , though I really do n't care as I have no desire to waste further time commenting at such an uninformed site .
What I did find interesting is a certain level of vindictiveness on Pat 's part .
He has no problem posting anonymously as Patterico , but when L.A. Times Columnist Michael Hiltzak posted anonymously , Pat reported that to Hiltzak 's employer because anonymous postings are contrary to the paper 's rules .
As the article reveals , our Patrick Frey was displeased with Hiltzek 's liberal views .
For Patrick
Frey , free speech is a one - way street .

I believed Mrs. Dixon , the former secretary to Lt. Col. Killian , and what she told Dan Rather about what she remembered happening years earlier when George W. Bush skipped out on fulfilling his Texas Air National Guard commitment .
She was credible .
She was an eyewitness .
Thus , Dan Rather , being an excellent journalist , found an eyewitness who corroborated what was contained on those typewritten pages , making the " authenticity " of those pages secondary to her eyewitness account , in my view .
George W. Bush went AWOL and his daddy covered it all up through his connections .
Either George W. Bush got cold feet and could n't function as a fighter pilot any longer or he began drinking so much his performance deteriorated to the point he ended up in a two - seater training jet ... so he threw a tantrum and skipped out .

So , if one of the other deputy DA 's in your office were to be formally assigned the task of investigating whether O'Keefe violated CA PC 632 , are you telling us that you have the " free speech " right to interfere with that investigation by publicly stating on your blog or in comments , in your private capacity of course , that you do not feel an investigation is warranted ?
Hmmm .
I do n't know , Pat , but it seems your " free speech " argument might be a bit tenuous .

Also , Pat , since the alleged PC 632 violation took place in your jurisdiction , does n't your ongoing defense of O'Keefe , in your private capacity of course , mean that if your employer should assign the task of investigating the PC 632 violation to you , that your " private capacity " statements would force you to recuse yourself --- thereby interfering with the efficient operation of your office ?

This whole ACORN thing reeks of racism .
Even if they claim it 's not , it 's about suppressing black voter registration .

Dear Patterico--
I have been falling behind in the conversation because I needed to get away from the computer .
Here 's my answer to your question which I finally saw this morning that you 'd asked a couple of posts earlier .
I answered there this morning and repeat it here now as this post is more recent .
Maybe you 'll catch it somewhere .
COMMENT # 159 [ Permalink ]
... David Lasagna said on 3/5/2010 @ 10:43 am PT ... Dear Patterico and Bluehawk -- Sorry , just seeing your most recent remarks now .
Been off this comment section for a few days .
Thought maybe all the action had moved on .
Still a novice at exactly how all this works in cyberland .
Patterico re : your questions at # 145 , # 150
Yes , when I try to look at it from what I make up is your way of looking at it , I see where I think you are seeing that he is establishing his pimphood and the rest .
I see it .
I read it and I say , oh here 's where that interpretation is coming from .
The reason that does n't make me jump over to agree with your overall interpretation , however , is that I see a lot of other things in there as well .
Where you seem to see a complete damning of the Acorn worker , I see other possibilities of interpretation .
And in trying to be fair , like I 'm trying to be with you , I have to take into account that I 'm only reading a transcript .
I was not in that room .
If I could see / hear the unedited videos I would have more of an idea of the multiple clues often given in human interaction through tone , eyes , inflection , cadence , etc .
There are a lot of heavy accusations being made back and forth all based on the interpretations of realities represented by these videos .
I want to be very careful to not leap to unwarranted conclusions .
1 . First of all I have to back the whole interpretation process up to a point I have not seen you acknowledge exists .
Acorn is an organization that as far as I know was just minding its own business .
However , efficient or inefficient , one might think they are , they were just doing what they do , which is trying to help poor people .
There were no child prostitution rings with 13 year olds from El Salvador or Guatemala .
There was no prostitution anything .
Giles and O'Keefe come in and start lying .
A young , attractive couple comes into Acorn and starts lying their heads off .
I was taught not to lie .
So my first question for you is -- are you in favor of wholesale lying to complete strangers who have done you no harm ?
2 . When I read the transcript , I tried to look at it not only from what I was imagining was your point of view , but what I imagined was the Acorn person 's point of view .
Is there any reason in the world your view is the only possible one here ?
I 've seen you make no claims to being infallible so I 'm hoping you 'll agree there are other possibly viable viewpoints besides your own .
Reading it from what I imagine might be the Acorn person 's point of view , it 's not hard to see a person who is trying to do their job in a very weird circumstance .
This is a strange tale , full of lies , she is being told .
She 's being told this sweet young girl is in trouble .
That Hannah is in danger .
The Acorn worker is trying , at least some of the time to get them to pay taxes .
She 's trying to get the fictitious children , arriving soon , into school .
Is she doing that because she 's an evil child prostitution advocate or is she doing her best , while being constantly lied to , to come up with whatever she can to maybe help the little girls and this young couple ?
I do n't have an absolutely definitive answer to that .
But I see nothing to swing me to your interpretation over a more generous one towards her .
This is long enough for now .
But I have my second question for you .
re : San Diego -- Juan Carlos said yeah , yeah , yeah many times to Giles and O'Keefe .
He said other things as well .
But when they left , after having taking multiple pictures of Hannah and freaking O'Keefe out in the process , he called his cousin , a policeman , because ( again being lied to ) he thought there was human trafficking going on .
What is Acorn supposed to be guilty of here ?

Lasagna , I appreciate the answer , and I have said more than once that the behavior of the workers springs from a benevolent principle of non-discrimination against criminals , which principle got carried too far .
But we can't have a conversation unless we answer each others ' questions .
And the question I have posed many times is still unanswered .
I would like to continue the dialogue but if you will not answer this question , I do n't think it 's going anywhere .
I would like to address your question too but feel it fair to request that you first answer the question I have asked so many times .
That question is :
In YOUR opinion , not applying my point of view or an ACORN worker 's point of view or anyone else 's --- and with the caveat that you 're missing some visual nuances from passages where there is audio and transcript but no video --- is O'Keefe telling ACORN workers that he wants to set up a house where Giles and underage girls can turn tricks and give him the proceeds for his Congressional campaign ?
And if so , does that constitute posing as a pimp ( albeit perhaps a less evil pimp than the other pimp in the scenario ) ?
With all respect towards your productive approach , if your next comment does n't address this question I will have to abandon the conversation as a non-dialogue .

Funny you should mention that Patrick .
I 've asked you now , more than half a dozen times , I believe , how it is that you , as a Deputy D.A. have authenticated the " unedited audio " from O'Keefe and Breitbart which you say proves this or that .
Of course , as an L.A. County Deputy D.A. surely you understand what constitutes " evidence " and the procedures necessary for authenticating such evidence .
So , again , I ask you , what are the steps you 've taken to authenticate the audio which you claim is " proof " and / or " evidence " of this claim or that claim that you continue to make both here in comments and over at your own blog ?
As you obviously know , " we can't have a conversation unless we answer each others ' questions .
And the question I have posed many times is still unanswered .
I would like to continue the dialogue but if you will not answer this question , I do n't think it 's going anywhere . "
So thanks in advance , yet again , for answering the simple question .

_____________________
Objection : Argumentative .
Without waiver of the objection , Answer :
When the Baltimore transcript is considered in its entirety , especially when augmented by the conversation with the third ACORN employee , a receptionist , whom O'Keefe did not record , the answer is a resounding " No ! "
If you wish to ignore context , which includes , per Harshbarger , the initial representation to the receptionist that Giles was a " dancer " and O'Keefe a college student just trying to help her , if your purpose is to extract disjointed sentences from a 46 page transcript that belies beyond a reasonable doubt that O'Keefe " posed as a pimp ; " and if you then reassemble those words in order to erect the sentence you wrote , Patrick , then " yes " I would concede that it is possible to reconstruct the entire event in a thoroughly deceptive manner to write out the sentence you have provided .
But doing so would not to justice to the full text of the still unauthenticated transcript .
" Justice , " I deeply regret having to say , appears to be shockingly absent inside the minds of right - wing ideologues like Alberto Gonzales , Jay S. Bybee , John Yoo and Patrick Frey .
Brad , if I may venture beyond law to provide a little word of medical advice .
Do n't hold your breath waiting for a straight answer from Patrick Frey to your very straight forward question .
Here 's a list of questions I posed to him that he has not answered : 1 . Does he believe that James O'Keefe and Hanna Giles should be under investigation by his office for a possible PC 632 violation ?
2 . Has he spoken directly with Mr. O'Keefe about this matter ?
( Note : Harshbarger interviewed numerous ACORN employees who were not recorded in addition to reviewing the edited videos and considering the unauthenticated transcripts .
Unless Pat Frey questioned O'Keefe about his methodology , then tested that against the actual audio tapes , he would be in no position to vouch for the authenticity of the tapes , though Frey appears to have repeatedly called you a " liar " whenever you questioned whether these audio tapes and transcripts are complete and unedited ) .
3 ) Frey , who begged off the PC 632 question , suggesting that he was not responsible for enforcing that statute at his office , failed to answer my question --- how does he get from the minutia of the details of what was or was not said inside three ( 3 ) ACORN offices to disparaging the reputation of a nation - wide community organization consisting of 400,000 member families in 75 cities ?
And this guy has the nerve to suggest that you have not answered his argumentative questions --- questions that are of the variety of " when did you last stop beating your wife . "
As I commented before , and with all due respect , I am not very impressed with this man 's lawyering skills .
Sorry , Pat , I do n't say that as a means to disparage you .
It 's just the way I see it .

Patterico @ 53 Just seeing your response here because I 've taken a leave of absence from this discussion cuz I can't take it anymore .
I 'm too alone here and it takes too much energy trying to fight off everyone on every side of the fucking argument .
No one was getting what I was saying .
It seemed like an endlessly futile gesture is ever there was one .
If I want to talk to myself it 's more fun to do it not a computer .
You may not like my answers but I thought I was asnwering your question .
Try once more .
The way I read the transcript sometimes O'Keefe is telling one story -- he's her law student friend trying to help her -- then he 's saying things or almost saying things that sound to me like he 's trying to suggest he 's somehow involved in her business without ever really saying anything definitively .
He sounds purposely vague to me .
He sounds like he 's trying to say suggestive things while simultaneously trying to be concerned , courteous , and solicitous .
Creepy , weird lying .
If he wanted me to unequivocally agree with you that he was portraying himself as a pimp , he could have saved us all a whole lot of trouble and bother by just being a man and coming out and saying he was her pimp .
But nooooooooo ......
And speaking of not answering questions , I 've been trying to answer yours for a while now but I 'm not seeing a lot of good faith effort by you to answer mine .
1 . Do you approve of wholesale lying to complete strangers who have done you no harm ?
2 . In San Diego the Acorn worker documented the visit of the supposed human traffickers with photos and then called his cousin the cop .
What 's he supposed to be guilty of ?
3 . Why is n't this just a clumsy attempt at entrapment ?
The only hint of prostitution were the lies that O'Keefe and Giles brought in with them .

Patterico--
Just went back and checked because it 's been a while since I read the transcript and the way you worded your question filled me with doubt that maybe I was n't remembering correctly or fairly .
When you ask -- is O'Keefe telling ACORN workers that he wants to set up a house where Giles and underage girls can turn tricks and give him the proceeds for his Congressional campaign ?
And if so , does that constitute posing as a pimp ( albeit perhaps a less evil pimp than the other pimp in the scenario ) ?--
I 'd say that question frames the rather long , rambling , disjointed conversation that took place with significant distortion .
I see one place where O'Keefe says , " .. we want to use a lot of cash for my campaign . "
I see another place where he says , " I am not going to be involved with the house that is why I am trying to get her independent . "
Those are the two most definitive statements I can find concerning any relationship / non- relationship O'Keefe might be thinking of having with Giles ' house and they seem more mutually exclusive than anything .
So no , in the absence of other comments one way or the other and in the presence of all the other misdirecting comments , I do n't think anyone could say for sure he was posing as a pimp .
It 's unclear what the hell he 's doing or talking about .

Hey Ernie , Between you and me , when you say to Pat - - If you wish to ignore context , which includes , per Harshbarger , the initial representation to the receptionist that Giles was a " dancer " and O'Keefe a college student just trying to help her , if your purpose is to extract disjointed sentences from a 46 page transcript that belies beyond a reasonable doubt that O'Keefe " posed as a pimp ; " and if you then reassemble those words in order to erect the sentence you wrote , Patrick , then " yes " I would concede that it is possible to reconstruct the entire event in a thoroughly deceptive manner to write out the sentence you have provided .-- that 's a version of seeing it through Patterico 's eyes that I 've been trying to get people to hear that I thought I was able to do , to little avail here .
If you allow for a person 's bias and need to interpret things with a particular agenda , yeah , it 's not hard to interpret anything in just about any way they want / need .
My mission impossible / ridiculous was trying to give Patterico the benefit of the doubt that he might have his own reasons , that I was taking to be human ones , for engaging in what was looking to me to be quite likely just this sort of self - deceptive practice .
And my insane thought was that by not making war with him maybe a tiny bit of progress could be made in the deconstruction of such a process , done in good faith and without the goal of vilification or submission .
Maybe we all could learn a little bit about how the " enemy " thinks .
I thought if that were possible , it could only be good .
For all concerned .
It is my sense that the strange behavior we all see manifested all around us in so many ways is the product of fear and pain .
Just trying to address it all in a different way .
I particularly love your tone in your latest comment here because to me anyway it was without attitude and gave me , finally , a feeling of company in my vain pursuits .
Of course maybe I 'm fooling myself again .
But just in case I 'm not -- thank you thank you thank you .

Dave , I think the problem lies with your effort to " give Patterico the benefit of the doubt . "
Pat Frey is a well - educated propagandist .
He knows full well that he has deceptively distorted what occurred .
He intentionally pulled these isolated words out of context and reassembled them not because he believes what he says to be true but because he has an agenda , as did O'Keefe when O'Keefe slyly elicited responses to innocuous questions , knowing he would later use voice - overs to twist what was said to meet his , O'Keefe 's , political agenda .
Frey knows full well that he is way over the top in trying to condemn a benevolent community organization of some 400,000 families in 75 cities on the basis of a few isolated words taken out of context in an interaction with a low level ACORN part time employee who violated ACORN protocols .
Of course , I favor decorum over the abrasive character assaults , but if you think for a minute that Pat Frey is sincerely believes the crap he has unloaded , you are indeed " fooling " yourself .
As I wrote , previously , David , I have a piece in the can which will explain fully where the ACORN smear campaigns are coming from .
I ask , my friend , for your patience , for all will be revealed when it is posted .

The Garbage of Naples How the Mafia Helped Send Italy 's Trash to Germany
German courts have been dealing with an unusual problem .
More than 100,000 tons of Italian trash were shipped to eastern Germany , saving a waste treatment plant from bankruptcy .
But what could have been a solution to Naples ' notorious garbage crisis ran afoul of the law .
And yet no - one seems to get it :
I watched Obama 's rise from Hyde Park over the last 15 yrs .
Two things stand out : his political rivals almost always , and fatally , underestimate the guy 's abilities .
I sense there 's some racism there , and his opponents always try to smear him as a " radical black guy " but Obama has always positioned himself above racial street fighting .
The fact is , Obama is not just smart , he 's brilliant .
Second , the guy constantly fights a war of attrition , staying the course , keeping his cool , but applying constant steady pressure to the abutments of the opposition , and over time almost all of them crumble .
I do n't think conservatives have yet figured this out about a guy , who now , is their biggest danger to future political relevance .
He 's grinding them , slowly , into dust .
It 's why I supported him .
Because he was change ; and because he actually thought change was needed for substantive reasons ; and because he had proven his capacity not just to argue for change , but to persist in it , zigging and zagging , waiting and holding back , but still persisting .

Filmmaker Amy Berg recounts a harrowing story of child abuse and how a serial child molester went free for the better part of two decades in this documentary .
Oliver O'Grady was a Catholic priest who served in a number of parishes in Southern California during the 1970s and ' 80s .
O'Grady was also a habitual child molester who abused dozens of youngsters who were entrusted to his care , and while his superiors in the church were aware of O'Grady 's crimes as early as 1973 , they opted to simply move him from one congregation to another rather than turn him in to authorities or strip him of his ordination .
In Deliver Us From Evil , a number of O'Grady 's victims and their families discuss his crimes and the repercussions they feel to this day .
O'Grady himself also appears in the film , speaking candidly about his career as a sexual predator and recounting his misdeeds in detail .
( After finally being convicted of child sexual abuse , O'Grady served time in prison and now lives in Ireland , where he is still looked after by Catholic clergy . )
Berg also offers a look into the history of the Catholic Church and how its leadership has often protected those within the hierarchy at the expense of their worshipers .

The battle over health care reform is not only pitting liberals against conservatives but also stirring up old feuds on the left .
In an appearance Tuesday on MSNBC ’s Countdown , Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas criticized Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s threat to vote against health care reform legislation as “ a very Ralph Nader - esque approach to politics ” and indicated that he would consider such a vote to be legitimate grounds for a primary challenge .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s not perfect , ” Moulitsas said of the current health care legislation , “ but it ’s a first step , and God knows it ’s taken us a long time to even get our toe in the door . …
If somebody like Kucinich wants to block that , I find that completely reprehensible . ”
In an appearance on Countdown the previous night , Kucinich had called the current bill “ a giveaway to the insurance industry ” and reaffirmed his position that he “ could n’t support the bill if it did n’t have a robust public option and at least if it did n’t have something that was going to protect consumers from these rampant premium increases . ”
“ If that sounded like a no [ vote ] , you ’re correct , ” Kucinich told guest host Lawrence O’Donnell .
“ Ralph Nader paved the way for eight years of George Bush , ” Moulitsas explained to O’Donnell on Tuesday , referring to Nader ’s third - party campaign for president in 2000 .
“ I ’m going to hold people like Dennis Kucinich responsible for the 40,000 Americans that die each year from a lack of health care . ”
“ Is it reprehensible enough to mount a primary challenge against him ? ” O’Donnell asked .
“ Is it possible to be too liberal ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Absolutely , ” Moulitsas responded .
“ I do n’t think he gets a pass .
I do n’t care what his excuse is .
…
He ”s not elected to grandstand and to give us his ideal utopian society .
…
He ’s not representing the uninsured constituents in his district by pretending to take the high ground here .
…
I think that ’s the perfect excuse and rationale for a primary challenge . ”
Animosity from Moulitsas towards Kucinich goes back many years .
In early 2007 , when the possibility of a Kucinich presidential campaign was being raised , the blogger wrote , “ When talking about Kucinich , I usually leave it at ‘ ugh ’ .
I ’ve found that much kinder than actually getting into Kucinich ’s record . ”
He then proceeded to sum up a decade ’s worth of attacks on Kucinich ’s more utopian positions , concluding , “ He used his 2004 run for president to score dates .
Luckily , he ’s married this time around so we ’ll be spared that pathetic display of desperation . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Moulitsas himself , however , might be accused of empty grandstanding on this occasion , since — in the words of an ascerbic post by blogger David Dayen at FireDogLake — there is “ one flaw in the brilliant plan . ”
“ The Ohio primary takes place on May 4 , and the filing deadline for candidates was February 18 , ” Dayen notes .
“ Kucinich has no Democratic challenger . …
In addition , as Markos well knows ( and I do n’t blame him for being baited into an answer about a primary challenge which is physically impossible ; Lawrence O’Donnell needs a researcher ) it ’s pretty difficult putting together a primary challenge .
…
In fact , they often take multiple cycles . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But one diarist at Daily Kos reacted with far greater dismay to the attack on Kucinich , calling it , “ the night the left in America died . ”
“ It looks like the purge of the left and the final push for the corporate - care insurance bill is on , ” writes poplist2003 .
“ Topping it all off was the astonishing attack on Dennis Kucinich tonight by Markos on the Countdown show , culminating in a call for a primary challenge ( presumably by a nice centrist corporate ‘ Democrat ’ – how about Harold Ford ? ) to Kucinich .

We got some one - on - one time with the HTC EVO 4G today , and let us succinctly sum up our experience for you : wow .
We ’ll start with the screen … it ’s gorgeous .
4.3 inches , enormous , easy to type on , responsive … it ’s everything you want out of a touch screen .
How ’s the phones speed you ask ?
The product manager from HTC kept saying : “ this is n’t the final software build , so there could be some lag ” but to be honest , we could n’t really find any .
Opening Google Earth with 5 applications running in the background produced a tiny lag ( 3 seconds ) but once Google Earth was up and running we were flying again .
The 1GHz Snapdragon processor really flexes its muscle in the EVO 4G .
We pressed the product managers about a realistic battery life with 4G on , but all they could muster up for us was , “ it ’s good . ”
Bollocks .
If you love HTC ’s Sense UI , you ’re really , really going to love this phone .
The enhancements to Android ’s UI are done with great detail and add minimal overhead to the phone ’s resources ( arguable , we guess ) .
Widgets provide easy access to social media content , bookmarks , and other phone resources .
You can update your “ status ” on several social media sites using HTC ’s social widget .
The EVO is a “ with Google ” phone and supports Exchange , Gmail , POP , and IMAP email accounts — although you can only have one Exchange account configured to the phone .
We prefer having support for multiple Exchange accounts , but for most users this wo n’t be the end of the world .
Want more good news ?
The video camera is awesome .
You can choose your desired resolution — we know you ’re going to be keeping it in 720 p — record , using either the front or rear facing camera , and upload to your favorite social media site , send via email or even transfer via Bluetooth .
The quality is great and watching your videos play back on that screen is a real treat .
We could go on and on about this phone but you get the idea .
Great screen , very responsive , and , currently is in a class of it ’s own as far as Android ( and dare we say all ) devices go .
All Sprint and HTC will give us for a release timeline is “ summer . ”
We ’ve got June 21st circled on our calendars .
Hit up the gallery for images !
UPDATE : The screen is not AMOLED as I originally wrote , I ’m low on sleep .
Sorry for the confusion !

Deputy political editor , BBC News
The only prediction I will make with absolute assurance is that any prediction about the second prime ministerial debate will almost certainly be wrong .
No one expected that 90 minutes of television last week would give one party a 10 % point lift in the polls and turn British politics upside down .
As Mr Zimmerman once sang , " the wheel 's still in spin and there 's no telling who that it 's namin ' " .
All we should expect is the unexpected .
But let me try a few modest observations nonetheless for Thursday night 's encounter in Bristol : 1 . It will be harder for Nick Clegg to ' win ' .
Such are the inflated expectations following his performance last week that anything less than Cicero will disappoint .
He has set his own bar very high .
2 . It will not matter if Mr Clegg is deemed not to have ' won ' .
The public last week warmed not to his technical debating skill but to his apparent novelty , his folksy charm , and the fact that he was not called Gordon or David .
For many voters , Mr Clegg is their vehicle of choice to express anger at the political establishment and hope for some kind of change .
This political reality is not going to alter as a result of some arcane debate about Britain 's precise relationship with Europe or the United States .
3 . Gordon Brown will try to focus the debate on the economy .
This would allow him to demonstrate his international experience and replay his greatest hits from G7 to G20 , otherwise known as , " How I turned round the global financial crisis , which began in America and had nothing to do with Britain 's own deficit " .
It would allow him to return to the subject he thinks will ultimately decide this election .
And it is the best card he has got .
4 . Mr Brown will struggle to turn this into a debate about the economy .
Not only is this the subject of next week 's final debate , but also this debate is much more likely to be dominated by Europe .
Messrs Cameron and Brown - no fans of the Euro they - will be tempted to highlight Mr Clegg 's unashamed pro-European credentials .
SECOND PRIME MINISTERIAL DEBATE
Hosted by Sky News , from 2000 BST to 2130 BST
Will also be shown simultaneously on the BBC News Channel and Sky 3 Streamed live on the BBC News website Broadcast live on BBC Radio 4 The Lib Dem leader believes , of course , that it is in the long - term interests of Britain to join the Euro , in the right conditions , subject to a referendum .
At the same time , Messrs Clegg and Brown will be quick to point out Mr Cameron 's gut Euro scepticism , asking perhaps which EU competencies the Tory leader might wish to try to return to Britain in the face of overwhelming continental opposition to the reopening of any constitutional issues .
The detail might be boring but the Lib / Lab message will be clear : same old Tories .
5 . All three men will offer paeans of praise for British forces in Afghanistan - but they will scrap like dogs over whether they had - and have - enough helicopters and body armour .
This will not matter because for all the huffing and puffing , there is a broad consensus on the current strategy for the war - at least for now .
On the same territory , Mr Clegg will try to remind voters how much his party opposed the war in Iraq .
6 . Gordon Brown and David Cameron will gang up on Nick Clegg over Trident .
They will point out that he is the only leader not unequivocally supporting a like - for - like replacement of the nuclear missile system .
Mr Clegg will point to a clutch of generals who are desperate to spend more money on soldiers and less on submarines and who agree with the Lib Dems that Trident should be part of a future defence review .
7 . David Cameron and Gordon Brown will try to ' learn ' from Nick Clegg and address the camera more than the studio audience .
It probably will not make much difference .
Viewers can " learn " too and it could easily appear forced or a touch cheesy .
8 . Mr Cameron will try to be more passionate .
Much of the criticism against the Conservative leader last week was that he was too controlled , refusing to rise to Mr Brown 's hostile bait .
This led critics to say he appeared colourless and detached , never engaging emotionally with the audience .
The aim this time will be to " let Cameron be Cameron " , as some of his team have it .
9 . Someone will mess up .
Abroad is a dangerous place for politicians .
It is all too easy to forget a foreign leader or mispronounce their name .

At RubyKaigi 2008 , Ruby 's inventor Matz announced plans to standardize Ruby in order to " improve the compatibility between different Ruby implementations [..] and to ease Ruby 's way into the Japanese government " .
The first proposal for standardization will be to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee and in a further step to the ISO , to become an international standard .
For now , a first draft ( that weighs in at over 300 pages ) and official announcement are available .
Alternatively , there 's a wiki under development to make the standard available in HTML format .
A very different approach to unite Ruby implementations is the RubySpec project ( more RubySpec related news on InfoQ ) , a community driven effort to build an executable specification .
RubySpec is an offspring of the Rubinius project :
The RubySpec project aims to write a complete executable specification for the Ruby programming language that is syntax - compatible with RSpec. [..]
The specs generally serve two purposes : 1 ) to drive development , and 2 ) as a verification mechanism .
InfoQ talked to RubySpec 's father Brian Ford to find out what he thinks about the standardization and what this means for RubySpec .
I think the ISO Standardization effort is very important for Ruby , both for the language and for the community , which in my mind includes the Ruby programmers , people who use software written in Ruby , and the increasing number of businesses based on or using software written in Ruby .
The Standardization document and RubySpec are complementary in my view .
The document places primary importance on describing Ruby in prose with appropriate formatting formalities .
The document envisions essentially one definition of Ruby .
RubySpec , in contrast , places primary importance on code that demonstrates the behavior of Ruby .
However , RubySpec also emphasizes describing Ruby in prose as an essential element of the executable specification and is the reason we use RSpec - compatible syntax .
RubySpec also attempts to capture the behavior of the union of all Ruby implementations .
It provides execution guards that document the specs for differences between implementations .
For example , not all platforms used to implement Ruby support forking a process .
So the specs have guards for which implementations provide that feature .
This illustrates an important difference between the ISO Standardization document and RubySpec .
The ISO document can simply state that a particular aspect of the language is " implementation defined " and provide no further guidance .
Unfortunately , implementing such a standard can be difficult , as we have seen with the confusion caused by various browser vendors attempting to implement CSS .
RubySpec attempts to squeeze the total number of unspecified Ruby behaviors to the smallest size possible .
Once the ISO Standardization document matures , we will add some sort of tagging to RubySpec to enable an implementation to run all specs tagged as " ISO Standard " .
This would enable an implementation to claim that they faithfully conform to the behavior specified in the ISO document .
I do n't know yet if running the specs like this will be accepted by an agency ( perhaps governmental ) attempting to verify an implementation 's standard compliance .
InfoQ : Will Rubinius be standards - compliant ?
Absolutely .
From the very beginning , I worked on RubySpec to ensure that Rubinius would be as faithful as possible to the " standard implementation " or MRI ( Matz 's Ruby Interpreter ) .
We 've worked very hard at this and there are very few places in RubySpec where we have added " not_compliant_on : rubinius " guards .
Since the ISO Standard is more lenient than RubySpec , I expect we will have no problem being " ISO Standard " compliant .
The standard draft is based on Ruby 1.8.7 , but Ruby 1.9.2 is already on the horizon .
We asked Yuki Sonoda , Ruby 1.9 release manager , what the plans for Ruby 1.9 with regards to the standardization are :
The JIS / ISO standard draft was designed so that Ruby 1.9 conforms to it .
So the draft is intentionally loose .
It gives Ruby processors the minimum restriction to be a " Ruby " .
So even 1.8.7 needs stricter specification like RubySpec to keep compatibility between implementations .
From the other Ruby implementations , Monty Williams of Gemstone , the company behind MagLev , tells us what he thinks of the standardization efforts :
We certainly applaud the effort to come up with a Ruby standard .
At a high level , an approved standard should help in increasing Ruby adoption in certain sectors .
We expect we 'll be able to assure MagLev is standards compliant once the standard is finalized .
InfoQ : Could the standard be useful in developing MagLev ?
Much of the implementation work on MagLev preceded the draft standard .
At this point what would help us most would be a compatibility test kit which certifies standards compliance , similar to the JCK .
The RubySpec project is a great step in the right direction here .
However , the standard could be a big help to future implementors in figuring out Ruby details .
What do our readers think : will it be easier to introduce Ruby in their organizations if there 's an ISO standard behind it ?
Is there a political sex scandal double standard ?
Do Republicans get off easier than Democrats ?
Steve Benen and Matt Yglesias think so .
As does every other partisan in the world !
Republicans have been whining for years that Clinton was not really punished for his blow job , but they get in trouble every time they furtively park outside the Senate page dorm in the middle of the night and do god knows what until the Capitol Police show up .
But the pendulum seems to have swung the other way lately , with John Edwards , Eliot Spitzer , and Eric Massa all having been " driven from public life . "
Meanwhile , John Ensign , David Vitter , Mark Sanford , and Jim Gibbons all still have their jobs !
Then consider the folks on the other side of the aisle .
Ensign 's sex scandal , which appears to include possible criminal misconduct , has n't interfered with him remaining a Republican senator in good standing .
Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , another right - wing , " family - values " hypocrite , got caught with a prostitute .
Not only did he stay in office , but he 's seeking re-election — and polls show him winning .
Gov. Mark Sanford 's ( R - S.C. ) sex scandal got plenty of coverage , but note that he 's still the governor .
Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons ( R ) found himself in a sex scandal , but like Vitter , he not only stayed in his job , but he 's running for another term , too .
Former Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) was caught up in an especially humiliating controversy , but he did n't resign before the end of his term , either .
Ok , guys , you 're both really smart bloggers , so it 's weird that you did n't notice what those shamed Republicans all have in common : they just did n't resign .
And eventually the media moved on to the next thing .
The governor of New York does n't really have the luxury of waiting out the press , but the fact remain that Spitzer just up and quit .
Here is a good counterexample for your list , Steve Benen : the current governor of New York , who admitted to sex and drugs and all that , and who is also , Larry Craig - style , planning to finish his term .
Gibbons is actually in deep shit and still being harassed by the local press in Nevada — we do n't hear about it because the national media is based out of New York and DC .
But Ensign and Vitter just ... refused to resign .
When we say Massa and Spitzer were " forced out , " we mean they bowed to pressure and decided , themselves , to quit .
Edwards has nothing to resign from , so I really do n't know what he has to do with anything .
( Is the press coverage outsized ?
He ran two credible presidential campaigns and ended up on a major party ticket ! )
So , yes , it is hilarious that John Ensign and David Vitter and Mark Sanford have n't resigned , but that is because of their shamelessness , not anyone 's double standard .
( That said , everyone should totally be talking more about the John Ensign revelations , and we should all be careful to note , as often as possible , that Senator David Vitter has sex with hookers while wearing diapers . )
With the United States mired in its deepest recession in decades , Democrats and Republicans have sparred over which party bears the lion 's share of blame .
In a March 9 , 2010 , House floor speech , North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia
Foxx made clear which party she thinks is most at fault .
Foxx spoke after the conclusion of a speech by Rep. Gerry Connolly , a Virginia Democrat .
Connolly said Americans had lost $ 17.5 trillion in net worth from December 2007 through March 2009 .
From that point , Connolly said , Americans began to recover .
" We are not out of the woods just yet , " Connolly said .
" Households lost value every month for the longest recession since World War II .
But we have turned the corner , and Americans today have $ 5 trillion more in net worth because of our actions . "
After hearing Connolly 's remarks , Foxx held off beginning her prepared statement on health care reform so that she could respond to what Connolly said .
" Madam Speaker , I came to talk about health reform , but would first note that the gentleman from Virginia fails to mention that the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007 .
For 54 months before that , with a Republican president and Republican control of Congress , the economy was doing very well and growing . "
We decided to see if the data supported Foxx 's claims .
We turned to GDP figures because she specifically referred to the economy " growing . "
Foxx 's second argument is a bit easier to verify , so we 'll get that out of the way .
Foxx said that for 54 months under Republican control of the presidency and Congress , " the economy was doing very well and growing . "
We are n't sure why she picked 54 months -- that takes us to July 2002 , which was neither the start of George W. Bush 's presidency ( January 2001 ) nor the end of the Democrats ' brief majority in the Senate ( January 2003 ) -- but the key statistics do n't differ much , so we 'll stick to her timeline .
During the 54 - month period Foxx cited , growth in gross domestic product -- the basic measure of economic expansion for the nation as a whole -- remained in positive territory for every single quarter .
During that period , the average of the quarterly annualized GDP growth rates was 2.8 percent -- not earth - shattering , but steady growth .
And if you instead date the statistics back to the official start of the economic expansion -- that is , back to the fourth quarter of 2001 -- then the average growth rate was roughly the same , 2.7 percent .
So we conclude that Foxx is right to say that the economy experienced growth during that entire period ( although , contrary to what she suggested , the Democrats controlled the Senate for six months out of the 54 ) .
Now let 's look at the notion that " the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007 . "
For the first four quarters of the newly Democratic Congress -- the four quarters of 2007 -- the annualized GDP growth rates were , in order , 1.2 percent , 3.2 percent , 3.6 percent and 2.1 percent .
Each quarter showed positive growth , and the average for those four quarterly figures was 2.5 percent -- not much lower than the average growth during the previous 54 months .
Officially , the recession started in December 2007 .
In the first quarter of 2008 , GDP fell by seven - tenths of 1 percent .
It rebounded briefly to 1.5 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 , then got really rocky in the third quarter of 2008 .
During that quarter and the following two , GDP fell by 2.7 percent , 5.4 percent and 6.4 percent , respectively .
If you date the " nose dive " to the first quarter of 2008 -- the earliest quarter with negative growth -- that was a full year after the Democratic takeover .
And if you compare each quarter of 2006 ( the last under GOP control ) to the equivalent quarter of 2007 ( the first under Democratic control ) , the pattern does not always favor the GOP .
In both the first and fourth quarters , the 2006 level of growth under the GOP exceeded the 2007 level of growth under the Democrats .
But in the second and third quarters , the Democrats did better in 2007 than the GOP did in 2006 .
We asked an ideological cross-section of economists what they thought of Foxx 's claim .
Karen Campbell , a macroeconomics policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation , said that in her view , " no statistical causation between political party in power and economic growth was established " by Foxx 's statement .
Measured by economic growth , " the economy did not technically begin a nose dive when the Democrats took over . "
Economist Gary Burtless of the liberal Brookings Institution wonders what Foxx would say if the shoe were on the other foot .
" The longest post - World - War - II business expansion ended in March 2001 , one and a half months after a Republican Administration took office , " Burtless said .
" That new Republican administration also had the good fortune to have a House of Representatives and , at first , a Senate that was controlled by the same party .
According to Rep .
Foxx ’s reasoning , the recession that began after March 2001 must have been ' caused ' by the political change - over in control of the White House .
Of course , I think this reasoning is specious , but it is equally ludicrous to claim that the recession which began in January 2008 was ' caused ' by a change in political control of Congress that took place in January 2007 . "
Most of the economists we spoke to agreed that the recession was caused most directly by long - term trends , especially a bust in housing prices and high energy prices , rather than by political factors .
" The Democrats can be blamed for setting the economy on a bubble - driven path in the 1990s , but the Republicans cannot escape blame for continuing this path and allowing an even larger and more dangerous bubble to develop in the first decade of the 21st century , " said Dean Baker , an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" Is Rep .
Foxx claiming that if we just left the Republicans in control , the housing bubble would still be growing so that we would have an even greater disaster to look forward to at the point when it finally collapsed ? "
Alan Reynolds , a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute , said that it 's conceivable that fear of the Democratic takeover could have spooked the financial markets and pushed the economy into a recession by depressing household wealth , bank capital and the ability of firms to raise funds in equity markets .
In reality , though , the Dow Jones Industrial average actually rose from about 12,100 just before Election Day 2006 -- when the Democrats took back the House and Senate -- to a high of 13,930 in October 2007 , which was 10 months after the Democrats took control of Congress .
( The Dow then fell precipitously until early 2009 . )
" Anyone who tries to link the ups and downs in business to something happening in D.C. is obligated to explain what it is that happened , " Reynolds said .
" Otherwise , it 's likely random luck .
Politicians are not as important as they like to think they are . "
We agree .
The evidence shows that the economy did not " nose dive " for at least a year after the Democrats took control of Congress , and experts of various ideological backgrounds agree that long - term trends in the housing and energy markets played a bigger role in directly causing the recession .
While what happens in Washington can certainly influence the economy , it is only one of many factors .
We believe it is the height of partisan wishful thinking to imply that one party 's accession to power in Congress is to blame for a major recession .
Pants on Fire !
Wellington man Victor Huang was n't going to let an audacious octopus get away with his brand - new digital camera .
The amateur camera man and nature enthusiast was diving near the Wahine Memorial between Breaker Bay and Moa Point on Wellington 's south coast yesterday when he spotted the " cheeky " thief .
Putting his camera up close to get some footage as the octopus clung to a rock behind a clump of kelp , it suddenly thrust out a tentacle , grasping the camera .
" Out of nowhere it just completely shot straight for me , " he said .
In an initial panic , Mr Huang said he " freaked out " for a bit to free his arm before realising the octopus only clung to the camera .
Eventually managing to free its shiny new $ 700 toy , the octopus swam off with Mr Huang giving chase , while the camera , being used for the first time , continued to record .
" He swam away very quickly like a naughty shoplifter , " he said .
The 31 - year - old chased it for five minutes until he caught up with it , placed his speargun beneath it and worked it free from the octopuses ' mouth .
Not to be defeated , the persistent sea creature then grabbed hold of the gun , refusing to let go .
Now enjoying his unique brush with nature , Mr Huang then swam around with the octopus on his speargun , saying the tentacled sea creature seemed to enjoy the ride , while his workmate whom he had been diving with told him they had to hurry to get back to work .
It never appeared as though the octopus wanted to attack him , he said .
" I honestly believe that it saw the bright blue digital camera and went 'oh I need that ' , you know ? "
His parents had seen the video and told him to stop diving , fearing it too dangerous , he said .
Having moved here from San Francisco six years ago to work on animation in the King Kong movie , he said he had fallen in love with the lifestyle and , now engaged to a Kiwi girl , had made the move permanent .
Mr Huang had set out to record the wildlife and scenery around Wellington , saying Kiwis did n't seem to truly appreciate what was on offer .
" You jump in to the water five metres from work and there 's an octopus , " he said .

PÅ den danske karikaturtegneren Kurt Westergaard i Danmark nylig diskuteres på nytt ytringsfrihetens kår .
I dag har Dagbladets tegner Finn Graff illustrert John Olav Egelands kommentar om ytringsfrihet med en tegning av en skjeggete mann med en bombe på hodet .
Ikke helt ulik Kurt Westergaards tegning som vakte så mange reaksjoner i januar 2006 , og som fortsatt debatteres .
Den danske tegningen er verdenskjent nå , til tross for påholdenhet i pressen hva gjelder publisering .
Den viser også en skjeggete mann med bombe på hodet .
Westergaard selv har fremholdt at det dreide seg om en kritikk av islamisme , mens mange mente det var profeten Mohammed som var uthengt .

This is shocking :
The Obama administration will announce a major new stock market initiative on Friday that will directly tackle the problem of the millions of Americans who lost money betting on stocks .
The government will buy loans from stock brokerage houses at the current value of the stocks in an investor ’s portfolio , in an effort to stabilize the stock market , people briefed on the plan said .
The government will also increase incentive payments to stock brokers who loaned on margin to their investing clients and now assume some of the losses of those clients .
And it will require those stock brokers to cover some of the losses of unemployed investors for a minimum of three months .
OK , I made that up .
But how is it different from this , which is real ?
The Obama administration will announce a major new housing initiative on Friday that will directly tackle the problem of the millions of Americans who owe more on their houses than they are worth .
The government will buy loans from investors at the current value of the house in an effort to stabilize the market , people briefed on the plan said .
The government will also increase incentive payments to lenders that cut the principal of borrowers in modification programs .
And it will require lenders to cut the monthly payments of unemployed borrowers for a minimum of three months .
The Administration is using tax dollars to subsidize some homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages .
Today they are beefing up two housing programs with more money .
These programs are targeted at homeowners who could almost but not quite afford their mortgage .
The idea is that , with some taxpayer subsidy , their lender will agree to reduce or delay some mortgage payments .
Who is eligible ?
Under one program , called HAMP , the Home Affordable Modification Program , you are eligible if you :
… live in an owner occupied principal residence , have a mortgage balance less than $ 729,750 , owe monthly mortgage payments that are not affordable ( greater than 31 percent of their income ) and demonstrate a financial hardship .
The new flexibilities for the modification initiative announced today continue to target this group of homeowners .
Excuse me ?
We ’re going to subsidize someone with a mortgage balance of $ 700,000 ?!
( Updated : A knowledgeable reader thinks my 5.25 % interest rate was unreasonably low , so I ’m changing the example to assume a 7 % rate . )
Let ’s do a quick back - of - the - envelope calculation .
Suppose you have a mortgage balance of $ 700 K , with 28 years left on your 30 - year mortgage at a fixed 7 % 5.25 % .
Your monthly mortgage payments would be almost $ 4,800 .
If that ’s greater than 31 % of your income , you make less than $ 186,000 per year .
Does it really make sense for the Administration to use taxpayer funds to subsidize someone making less than $ 186,000 per year to stay in a home with a $ 700,000 mortgage balance ?!
We further learn the Administration intends to spend $ 50 B of TARP money for these initiatives .
The Administration argues their goal “ is to promote stability for both the housing market and homeowners . ”
Stability sounds good .
The risk is that instead of solving the foreclosure problem , these policies may just prolong it .
( The same could be said of some housing initiatives we did in the Bush Administration . )
A core housing policy question is whether it ’s better in the long run to buy time for struggling homeowners in the hope that they and the housing market will eventually recover , or instead to just rip off the band aid as quickly as possible .
Allow the housing market to adjust quickly by not trying to create artificial “ stability ” above a market - clearing price .
Such an adjustment would be excruciating in the short run , and painful for many who would lose their homes .
But like ripping off a band aid , it would get all the pain behind us , so that things could return to a normal and more stable growth pattern going forward .
I do n’t have the answer to this question , but I do get nervous with those who confidently assert that they can create stability , and that they know the right price at which stability should be maintained .
Every little kid knows there ’s less total pain if you rip off a band - aid quickly .
The same may be true here .
Buying a house is a big deal .
So is getting a mortgage .
As with any investment , when you buy a house and a mortgage you assume both upside and downside risk .
You are responsible for both sides of that bet , not someone else .
Some homeowners were fooled or deceived into buying a bad adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) .
I feel bad for them and am willing to consider policies directed at them .
At the same time , it ’s hard to distinguish “ fooled or deceived ” ARM buyers from “ savvy speculator ” ARM buyers , so if we subsidize one we may end up subsidizing the other as well .
But now let ’s look at a homeowner with a fixed rate mortgage who is “ underwater ” because his home has declined in value so that the house is worth less than the mortgage .
His net worth has declined because the value of his home plummeted , and that ’s tragic .
But since he has a fixed rate mortgage , his monthly mortgage payment has not changed .
The decline in the value of their home has not affected his ability to make his mortgage payment , and therefore to remain in that home .
He can continue to live in his home and wait for the value to appreciate , just as a stockholder can hold onto a stock after a decline and wait for the price to recover .
I do n’t see why taxpayers should subsidize him because he lost money on an investment , just as taxpayers should n’t subsidize him if he lost money in the stock market .
This homeowner may face some other financial hardship ( see the underlined language above ) .
Maybe he lost his job , or maybe he got hit by a bus and has high medical costs .
This financial hardship may cause him to be unable to make his mortgage payments , and with the lost equity value , he cannot borrow against the value of his home .
But again , this is no different than if he lost big in the stock market and then lost his job or got hit by a bus .
Imagine twin brothers , each with $ 180 K of annual income .
One rents , and the other has a $ 700,000 mortgage on a home that declined from $ 800,000 in value to $ 600,000 in value .
Both brothers lose their jobs .
Why should the renter pay higher taxes to subsidize his brother ’s mortgage payments ?
Losing a home due to financial hardship is tragic .
Does that make it someone else ’s responsibility ?
Why should a broad - based decline in housing prices shift responsibility for planning for a financial loss from a homeowner to taxpayers ?
Why do policymakers ( on both sides of the aisle ) think we should make taxpayers ( some of whom struggle to make their own mortgage payments , and others of whom rent housing ) subsidize someone who lost money on an investment ?
I would like to hear a sound and compassionate policy argument that addresses my twin brother example .
To make sure your argument works , please assume there is also a triplet brother who also rents but recently lost $ 200,000 in the stock market , and explain how your policy applies to him .
My conclusions :
I would not use tax dollars to subsidize homeowners with fixed rate mortgages .
It ’s unfair to the taxpayers , those who rent , and those who might want to buy a home .
It also slows down painful but inevitable housing market adjustments .
I would treat a loss on a home ’s value the same way I would treat an investment loss in the stock market .
Both are private responsibilities of the investor .
I would be willing to use some tax dollars to subsidize a subset of those homeowners who were fooled or deceived into buying bad adjustable rate mortgages .
I would subsidize only the ones who , with a little taxpayer assistance , could afford to keep their home .
The hard part is determining who was fooled or deceived .
This subsidy would apply only to bad ARMs made in the past and therefore would not be designed as a permanent program .
My solution would probably mean more foreclosures in the short run and more rapid housing price declines .
I think it would also mean housing markets would adjust more rapidly .
My goal would be to allow housing markets to adjust to their market - clearing levels as quickly as possible , based on the logic that this both minimizes total pain and gets it behind us .
My recommendations would depend heavily on the numbers .
Based on the numbers I saw in 2007 and 2008 , in all of these policies the taxpayer subsidies per foreclosure avoided are huge .
In addition , since it ’s hard to distinguish empathetic cases from savvy investors who were placing bets , a significant fraction of the subsidies goes to people whom I believe do not deserve help .
Both quantitative factors reinforce the principles that drive my conclusions .

" A huge pile of shit " is how Serguei Beloussov , CEO of Parallels , describes open source ( with a laugh ) in an interview with German magazine T3n .
Parallels produces virtualisation software including OpenVZ , the open source basis for Parallels Virtuozzo Containers .
The company is among the top ten companies who contribute to the Linux kernel .
Beloussov says that he grew up under communism and does n't like to hear talk about " community " .
He complains that open source communities act , sometimes , as trade unionists to primarily serve their own ego .
He believes that pure open source projects are n't able to deliver a high - quality , fast and well coordinated product , and that this is why Linux faces a " great challenge " .
Update : Beloussov has now clarified his comments and apologised to the open source community .

When one thinks of Apple , a single word often comes to mind : battery .
It 's no secret that the Cupertino - based developer has inched the totality of its product lines toward non-replaceable batteries .
So what happens , then , when your iPhone or Macbook Pro battery loses its ability to hold much of a charge ?
What about the iPad ?
Will you have to run back to your local Apple store to pick up a replacement ?
Apple just announced the terms of the deal for the iPad and , all jokes aside , it 's just like the iPhone 's battery replacement service ... but bigger !
Provided your iPad has n't gone through some catastrophic amount of damage --" as result of an accident , liquid contact , disassembly , unauthorized service or unauthorized modifications , " suggests Apple -- then you 'll be eligible to take advantage of the company 's battery replacement service .
But what does that entail ?
First , you 'll have to shell out $ 99 ( plus $ 6.95 for shipping and whatever your local tax happens to be ) for the opportunity for a brand - new device .
And I phrase that as I do for a very specific reason .
When you send your iPad off to Apple , you are n't just getting your same ol ' iPad back in the mail after one week or thereabouts .
Opting for the company 's battery replacement service will basically put you on the list for a refurbished iPad - - although the exterior case of the device will be brand - new , the underlying product will be one that 's gone through Apple 's fix - it procedures in some capacity .
Naturally , any data you 've kept on your old iPad device will go the way of the dinosaur :
You 'll want to back up all your settings and information prior to asking Apple for a new battery .
This is the exact same treatment that iPhone users receive , minus $ 20 to the overall cost of the replacement .
It 's interesting to note that the replacement fee is n't tiered at all , meaning that even the lowest of devices -- the $ 499 , 16GB iPad - - will cost the same amount to replace with a refurbished product as the $ 829 64 GB device .
That can be a confusing issue for consumers , but you have to keep Apple 's battery replacement service in perspective .
When Apple receives a device for battery replacement , it essentially sticks the product in a " to be fixed " bin .
In order to guarantee a rapid turnaround time for the iPad you 've sent in , it 's easier to grab an identical item that 's been previously fixed off the shelf and send it your way .
Once your device is fixed , it 'll go in the waiting line for someone else suffering from a near - dead battery .
You 're not paying Apple for a refurbished unit per se ; you 're paying for the entire process .
That 's not quite the case with battery replacement services for the replacement - unfriendly MacBook Pro.
Given that the laptop system could be a person 's entire -- and only -- computing setup , Apple suggests that the data on the device could be preserved during the course of a normal battery service appointment .
As well , one can take a MacBook Pro to any Apple retail store for same - day repair -- not so with Apple 's portable devices .
Photographs can be one of the most cherished items we possess , but they can also be things that we wish never existed .
This list looks at the latter and the damage that some pictures have had on 10 notable careers .
10 Mike Dukakis Damaged Political Career
Mike Dukakis was the Governor of Massachusetts from 1975 – 1979 , and the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988 .
During his presidential run , Dukakis was criticized for being too soft on defense .
To prove that he took his country ’s defense very seriously , someone had a brilliant idea to get a picture of him in a tank .
The plan was for the picture to become his key image for the campaign .
However , it did n’t quite turn out that way .
The now famous photo op was such a disaster that the Dukakis tank picture was used in television ads for George H.W. Bush ’s campaign , as evidence that Dukakis would not make a very convincing commander - in - chief .
“ Dukakis in the tank ” is still used to describe a backfired public relations campaign .
Interesting Fact :
In 1986 , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had been photographed in a similar situation riding in a Challenger tank .
For some reason , even though it was somewhat out of character the image was effective and helped her reelection prospects .
You can see the picture here .
9 Shane Gibson Damaged Political Career
In 2002 , Shane Gibson was a member of the , then ruling , Progressive Liberal Party , and was elected to the Parliament of the Bahamas as the Immigration Minister .
In February 2007 , after the death of Anna Nicole Smith , newspapers published photographs showing the famous model and Gibson in bed together embracing .
Even though both were fully clothed , the photographs fired up a controversy because it appeared that a sexual relationship between the two had expedited Smith ’s application for permanent residency in the Bahamas .
Gibson then resigned because of all the questions and rumors surrounding the nature of his relationship with Smith .
When Gibson stepped down , he denied any wrongdoing and apologized to all persons who might have been offended by anything that he might have said or done that was perceived wrong .
Interesting Fact : Soon after Anna Nicole Smith died , the most popular taxi tour in the Bahamas was called ( what else ) The Anna Nicole Smith Tour .
The sightseeing included the Hospital in Nassau where her son Daniel died , the home where she lived with Howard K. Stern and her five month old daughter , the Church where her funeral was and Lakeview Memorial Gardens where she and her son are buried .
8 Michael Phelps Damaged Endorsement Career
Michael Phelps is often credited with being the greatest swimmer and one of the greatest Olympians of all time .
He has won 14 career Olympic gold medals , the most by any Olympian .
In 2009 , a photo by the British tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using a bong and smoking marijuana .
Following the publication , an investigation followed but , due to lack of evidence , Phelps was not charged .
He was however suspended from swimming competitively for three months , and Kellogg announced that it would not renew his endorsement contract .
The cereal company stated that his recent behavior is “ not consistent with the image of Kellogg . ”
Cereal deals are usually worth around $ 250,000 , but it is believed that Phelps ’ deal was much more .
Phelps apologized , said he demonstrated bad judgment and that his behavior was regrettable .
Interesting Fact : Many of Kellogg ’s cereal boxes , that were intended for a food bank , with Phelps ’s picture on them disappeared after the he was dropped by Kellogg .
It was confirmed that some were kept as souvenirs and others were showing up on e-Bay .
Other Phelps endorsed companies like Subway , Visa and Omega ( note the watch in the photo ) believed Phelps was no different than other people of his generation who experiment or make youthful mistakes , and kept him on as a spokesperson .
7 Millard Tydings Damaged Political Career
Millard Tydings was a United States Democratic Senator from Maryland , from 1927 to 1951 .
In 1950 , Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that there was Communist penetration into the federal government and military .
Tydings responded and investigated by forming and overseeing the Tyding hearings .
After the hearings he published a report denouncing McCarthy and his Communist claims as a hoax .
When Tydings was running for re-election , McCarthy ’s staff distributed a picture of Tydings with Earl Browder , who was the former leader of the American Communist Party .
In reality , Tydings had never met Browder before and the picture was actually a composite of a 1938 photo of Tydings ( right ) and a 1940 photo of Browder ( left ) .
The image is believed to have contributed to Tydings ’ defeat in his bid for reelection .
You can see the pictures used to create the composite photo here .
Interesting Fact : Millard Tydings is the grandfather of actress Alexandra Tydings who is best known for her role as the Greek goddess Aphrodite on the popular TV series Hercules , and on its spin - off , Xena .
6 Vanessa Williams Damaged Beauty Queen Career
In 1983 , Vanessa Williams became the first African - American to be crowned Miss America .
Ten months after Williams was crowned , she received an anonymous phone call stating they had nude photos of her .
The photos were taken in 1982 , by Photographer Tom Chiapel , when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco , New York .
According to Williams , Chiapel wanted to try a new concept of silhouettes using two female models .
He photographed Williams and another woman in several nude poses with some in simulated sexual positions .
Williams believed the photographs were private and had been destroyed , and never signed a release permitting the photos to be used .
Days later , the publisher of Penthouse , Bob Guccione , announced that his magazine would publish the pictures in their September 1984 issue .
When the photos hit the news stand , sponsors threatened to pull out of the upcoming 1985 pageant .
Williams then resigned after pressure was put on her by Pageant officials .
The title then went to the first - runner up , Suzette Charles , who is also African - American .
Interesting Fact : Williams is officially recognized today as “ Miss America 1984 ” and Suzette Charles as “ Miss America 1984 b ” .
The photos netted Bob Guccione a huge profit of $ 14 million .
Williams filed a $ 500 million lawsuit against Chiapel and Guccione but eventually dropped the suit to avoid further legal battles , choosing to move on with her life .
Williams is quoted as saying , “ the best revenge is success ” .
5 Kate Moss Damaged Modeling Career
Kate Moss is a British supermodel and has appeared on over 300 magazine covers .
On September 2005 , the Daily Mirror ran a front page and inside photos showing 31 year old Moss snorting cocaine at a West London recording studio .
The images were captured during a Daily Mirror undercover investigation , which revealed that Moss , who repeatedly denied using cocaine , was an avid user .
She reportedly prepared up to 20 lines of coke on the back of a plastic CD and snorted five lines in 40 minutes .
Within a short time after the photos were published , Moss lost major modeling contracts with several international companies including H&M , Chanel and Burberry .
Moss quickly issued an apology but stopped short of admitting drug use and said “ I take full responsibility for my actions . ”
In June 2006 , after an investigation , British police dropped the charges for lack of evidence because photographs of alleged drug - taking are not admissible evidence in English courts .
Interesting Fact : Apparently the damage to her modeling career did not last long .
In 2007 , she came in 2nd on the Forbes top- earning models list , earning an estimated £ 6,500,00.00 ( $ 9 million ) in one year .
4 Chris Brown Damaged Singing Career
Chris Brown is a very popular American singer and actor .
On March 5 , 2009 , Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats .
The police report did not name the female in the incident but stated that a woman had “ suffered visible injuries ” .
Sources identified the alleged victim as his girlfriend and fellow R&B singer , Rihanna .
A leaked photograph from the Los Angeles Police Department , obtained by TMZ , revealed Rihanna had sustained visible injuries .
After the photo was released , many of Browns fans were disgusted and outraged .
Following his arrest and the release of the photo , several of his commercial ads were suspended and his music was withdrawn from multiple radio stations .
Brown also withdrew his appearance at the 2009 Grammy Awards .
On June 22 , 2009 , Brown pled guilty to the felony assault .
In exchange for his plea , Brown received five years probation and was ordered to stay fifty yards away from Rihanna , unless at public events , which then will be reduced to ten yards .
Interesting Fact :
In a 2009 interview , Brown said that it is “ tough ” for him to look at the famous photograph released of Rihanna ’s battered face , which may be the one image to haunt and define him forever .
3 Gary Hart Damaged Political Career
Gary Hart was a United States Senator from Colorado and was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 presidential election .
Soon after he announced his candidacy for President , rumors began to circulate that Hart was having an extramarital affair .
Hart responded to the rumors by daring the press , and said “ Follow me around .
I do n’t care .
I ’m serious .
If anybody wants to put a tail on me , go ahead .
They ’ll be very bored . ”
Previously to that meeting with the press , two reporters from the Miami Herald observed a woman who was identified as Donna Rice coming out of Hart ’s Washington D.C. townhouse .
The paper was able to publish the story on the same day as Hart ’s challenge .
Hart claimed that the reporters had no knowledge of exactly when the woman arrived or why she was there .
Two days after that story , the Herald obtained a photograph of Rice sitting on Hart ’s lap in Bimini aboard a yacht , ironically named Monkey Business .
The celebrity tabloid National Enquirer immediately published the photograph and within five days , Hart dropped out of the Presidential race .
Interesting Fact : Because of the scandal , Donna Rice lost her job as a marketing representative for a pharmaceutical company in South Florida .
She refused many opportunities offered to her after the scandal , including an appearance in Playboy magazine .
2 Edison Chen Damaged Entertainment Career
Edison Chen is a very popular Hong Kong - based Chinese Canadian film actor , singer and pop icon .
Chen has a total of 16 albums , and has appeared in 28 films .
In January 2008 , Chen was involved in a widely publicized sex scandal when sexually explicit photographs of himself and several actresses became widely circulated on the Internet .
The pictures were taken from Chen ’s laptop by a technician who was repairing it .
There were approximately 1,300 pictures , which included actresses Gillian Chung , Bobo Chan , Cecilia Cheung and many others .
Mr. Chen had originally claimed that the photos were faked but then admitted to taking the photos .
Chen then held a press conference where he said that he was ashamed and was leaving show business indefinitely .
Following his apology Chen attended a rehab center in Utah , for “ sex addiction . ”
Interesting Fact :
Due to the photo scandal , the Google search engine rankings for 2008 resulted in Chen ’s Chinese name being the number 1 search term in China .
1 General Nguyen Ngoc Loan Damaged Entire Career
The photo above was taken in 1968 , and is one of the most famous images of the 20th century .
The picture was taken by photographer Eddie Adams and won the Pulitzer Prize .
It is also included in the 15 Incredible Historical Photographs list .
Many have seen this photograph but most are not aware of the full story behind it .
The man on the left shown executing a prisoner is South Vietnamese national police commander , General Loan .
Before the execution it was reported that the prisoner had been the captain of a terrorist squad that killed the family of one of his deputy commanders .
After shooting the prisoner , the general walked over to a reporter and said , “ These guys kill a lot of our people , and I think Buddha will forgive me . ”
When the photo was shown on television and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world , it was seen as an act of savagery and symbolized an unjustified war .
Three months after the photo was taken , General Loan was severely wounded and taken to Australia for treatment .
There was such an outcry against him that he was moved to Walter Reed Army Medical Center , in Washington DC .
During the fall of Saigon in 1975 , he asked for American help in fleeing with his family but was ignored and had to escape with his family in a South Vietnamese plane .
Gen .
Loan , whose right leg had been amputated , settled in northern Virginia , where he eventually opened a pizzeria restaurant .
Loan was then forced into retirement when his identity was publicly disclosed .
Eddie Adams ( the photographer ) stayed in touch and recalled that on his last visit to the pizza shop , he had seen written on a restroom wall “ We know who you are , fucker . ”
Interesting Fact : Eddie Adams said this in a Time magazine interview : “ The general killed the Viet Cong ; I killed the general with my camera .
Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world .
People believe them , but photographs do lie , even without manipulation .
They are only half - truths .
What the photograph did n’t say was , ‘ What would you do if you were the general at that time and place on that hot day , and you caught the so - called bad guy after he blew away one , two or three American soldiers ? ’ ”
When General Loan died of cancer , in 1998 , Adams praised him and sent flowers with a card that read , “ I ’m sorry .
There are tears in my eyes . ”
Daedalic Entertainment has released a playable demo for its adventure game The Whispered World , now available for download .
The demo contains a section from the first of the four chapters of the title which was originally due way back in 2008 .
The file weighs in at 593 MB and can be downloaded via a couple of mirrors , here and here as well .
Sadwick awakes from one of his nightmares and and must first speak with his eccentric circus family , before finding his way into the depths of the Autumn Forest .
There he comes face to face with an odd stranger and an earth - shattering prophecy .
Sen . John McCain — despite supporting the military ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” prohibition on openly gay servicemembers — has been a staunch critic of a national amendment to ban same - sex unions .
In fact , during debate on the federal marriage amendment in 1994 , he called the push to ban same - sex marriage “ un-Republican . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
His Republican primary challenger , however , is singing a rather different tune .
Humming , maybe — or neighing .
On an Orlando radio station Sunday , McCain challenger J.D. Hayworth said that gay marriages , under Massachusetts law , could lead to “ man on horse ” unions .
“ You see , the Massachusetts Supreme Court , when it started this move toward same - sex marriage , actually defined marriage — now get this — it defined marriage as simply , ‘ the establishment of intimacy , ' ” Hayworth remarked .
“ Now how dangerous is that ?
I mean , I do n’t mean to be absurd about it , but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point — I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse , I guess you could marry your horse .
It ’s just the wrong way to go , and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support . ”
The clip was allegedly forwarded to The Huffington Post from a “ Republican source , ” raising questions of the motivation of its publication online .
The Post ’s Sam Stein notes that Hayworth ’s comment echoes one made by then - Sen . Rick Santorum ( R - PA ) almost a decade earlier .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In every society , the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality , ” Santorum said .
“ That ’s not to pick on homosexuality .
It ’s not , you know , man on child , man on dog , or whatever the case may be . ”
Wondering about the above photograph ?
It ’s a screen - cap from Old Spice ’s two - in - one campaign , in which a “ half - man / half - horse lathers up while speaking about the benefits of being ‘ two things in one : a man and a pretty smart shopper . ' ”
With the election of Senator Scott Brown , Republican of Massachusetts , Democrats can no longer hold off a Republican filibuster .
And while Democrats are emboldened by the health care vote , the passage of the legislation — which is already facing legal challenges from Republicans who say it is unconstitutional — has left the Senate more polarized than ever and created a climate in which the courts could easily become an election issue .
For the court , Justice Stevens ’s departure will be the end of an era .
He is the longest - serving justice by more than a decade , and he is the last remaining justice to have served in World War II .
( He joined the Navy , where he served as a cryptographer , the day before Pearl Harbor was attacked . )
His leaving will not , however , change the composition of the court ; although he was appointed in 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford , a Republican , he has become one of its most reliably liberal members during his nearly 35 - year tenure , as the court drifted ever rightward .
Still , for Mr. Obama , who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago ( where he was a colleague of Judge Wood ) , the vacancy is an unmistakable chance to put his stamp on the direction the court takes for the next several decades .
Mr. Obama is already engaged in an unusual public confrontation with the court over its recent decision in the Citizens United case , which lifted strict limits on corporate spending in elections .
On Friday , during a brief appearance in the Rose Garden , he made clear that the case was very much on his mind .
He vowed to “ move quickly ” in announcing a nominee .
Senior advisers said they expected a decision within the next several weeks .
The president said he would look for a candidate who possessed what he described as qualities similar to that of Justice Stevens : “ an independent mind , a record of excellence and integrity , a fierce dedication to the rule of law and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people . ”
And , in what legal scholars took as a clear swipe at the Citizens United decision ( for which Justice Stevens wrote the dissent ) , the president said he would look for a justice who “ knows that in a democracy , powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens . ”
The White House already has a Supreme Court nomination team in place , with the selection process run by the new White House counsel , Robert F. Bauer , and overseen by Rahm Emanuel , the chief of staff .
Once a nominee is picked , Mr. Bauer ’s wife , Anita Dunn , who is Mr. Obama ’s former communications director , will coordinate with advocacy groups .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during some of its most contentious confirmation fights , is also likely to play a crucial role .

The picture was hastily withdrawn after numerous complaints France 's justice minister has called for legal action to be taken against a man who was photographed wiping his bottom with the French flag .
Michele Alliot - Marie said it was unacceptable for the tricolour to be insulted in this way , and called for those responsible to be prosecuted .
Her response came after the photograph was displayed in a competition run by the media retailer , FNAC .
The image won a special mention in the " politically incorrect " category .
Taken on the street , the photograph shows a man seen from behind : his trousers are around his ankles and he is apparently wiping his bottom with a French flag .
Law - change call
The picture appeared last month in Metro , a free national newspaper , and was hastily withdrawn from the contest in the southern city of Nice after complaints from veterans ' groups .
French law holds it is not an offence to insult the tricolour at a private event " As soon as we saw that people were shocked by the image , we withdrew it from the list of winners , with the photographer 's consent , and we have not exhibited it , " said a FNAC spokeswoman .
The government got involved after being alerted by a local MP , says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris .
But under French law , it is only an offence to insult the flag in an event organised by the public authorities - not in a private , cultural event such as this , adds our correspondent .
Ms Alliot - Marie said the law should be changed .
" Presumably the law has the legal means to punish such an intolerable act against the French flag , " said the minister 's spokesman .
" If the existing law proves incomplete in this regard , it should be revised . "

Women 's community groups have had a dramatic effect on reducing neonatal mortality rates in some of the poorest areas on India , according to a study published March 7 in the journal the Lancet .
The groups provide a cost - effective intervention with added benefits such as reducing significantly maternal depression and improving decision - making amongst the women .
Every year , an estimated four million children worldwide die within the first month of their lives .
Less than a quarter of the sixty - eight countries targeted by the Millennium Development Goal 4 ( reduction of mortality rate in children less than five years old by two - thirds by 2015 ) are on track to achieve that goal .
A previous study conducted in Nepal and published by the Lancet in 2004 suggested that participatory women 's groups could achieve a significant impact on neonatal health in poorer countries , far more than one - to - one contact with a health worker .
To see if these findings could be applied in other countries , the researchers repeated the exercise in Jharkhand and Orissa , two of the poorest states in eastern India .
Neonatal mortality rates in the two regions are 49 and 45 per 1000 live births respectively , disproportionately higher than India 's national estimates of 39 per 1000 .
By comparison , in the UK the figures are 4 per 1000 .
Between 2005 and 2008 , a team of researchers led by Professor Anthony Costello from the Institute of Child Health , UCL ( University College London ) , and Dr Prasanta Tripathy , from the Indian voluntary organisation Ekjut , evaluated how women 's groups affected neonatal mortality and maternal depression in intervention areas as compared to areas where no participatory groups were set up .
The groups were evaluated using a cluster - randomised controlled trial , which was funded by the Health Foundation , the UK Department for International Development , the Wellcome Trust and the UK Big Lottery Fund .
The groups were facilitated by women recruited in the local area , non-healthcare professionals who tended to be married , with some schooling , and a respected member of the community .
The number of women taking part of in the groups increased from one in six women ( 17 % ) of childbearing age in the first year to over a half ( 55 % ) in the third year .
The women worked through a ' community action cycle ' involving four stages : identifying the problems associated with pregnancy , childbirth and care of newborns ; developing strategies to tackle these problems , such as improving hygiene , raising emergency funds and producing their own birthing kits ; working with local community leaders , teachers , politicians and others to implement these strategies , and ; evaluating their success .

" It was crucial that the women were allowed to think thought through the issues and implement their own strategies to tackle them , rather than us telling them what to do , " says .. Dr Nirmala Nair of Ekjut .
" We believe that a trained facilitator who supports informed peer learning is more effective for lasting behaviour change than a traditional instructor / learner approach . "
The effects of the interventions were dramatic : by the second and third years of the trial , the neonatal mortality rate in the areas where the participatory women 's groups existed had fallen by 45 % .
These areas also saw a significant fall ( 57 % ) in moderate depression amongst mothers by the third year of the trial .
" What we were seeing was a change in behaviour towards better hygiene practices and improved care for newborns , " explains Professor Costello .
" There was a move away from harmful practices such as giving birth in unclean environments and delaying breastfeeding .
We saw significant improvements in areas such as basic hygiene by birth attendants , clean cord care and women responding earlier to care needs . "
The researchers believe that improved social capital -- the access the group gave women to a wider support network of peers -- was potentially the most valuable aspect of the groups and would have contributed towards the improved childbirth and childcare practices and the reduction in maternal depression .
It may also explain why such groups have had much greater success than direct -- even one - to - one -- interventions with healthcare workers .
" Many of the women in these groups would have been relatively young , living in arranged marriages with only their mother - in - law or a very limited network of friends for support , " explains Dr Audrey Prost from UCL .
" The groups empower the women to take preventive measures and to deal with problems more effectively when they arise .
If you 've been to a group and a problem arises , you 've got a ready - made network that you can go to for help and support . "
The researchers estimate that the additional cost on introducing support to these groups per newborn life saved was around US$ 910 .
However , this raises questions over who would pay for supporting these groups : federal or state government , non-governmental organisations , or a combination of the two .
The Lancet has also published a second study carried out by Professor Costello and colleagues using the same approach -- women 's groups -- in Bangladesh .
The study failed to reproduce the benefits of the India trial .
However , in this case , the researchers believe that there were a number of issues which may have affected the outcome , including a failure to achieve the same coverage of women 's groups and recruitment of pregnant women as the India trial .
You already know that salt intake is highly correlated with high blood pressure and heart disease .
And you probably have a vague sense that processed foods contain a lot of salt .
But the specifics are truly terrifying , as this graphic by Next Generation Food shows .
It ’s not exactly the most legible graph –I mean , triangles are n’t exactly a case study in information clarity .
But the point comes through .
Check out , for example , that fact that a single Burger King Whopper with cheese has 75 % of your recommended daily salt intake ; and the fact that Americans eat 250 % of their recommended daily allotment :
Obviously , eating less meat and more vegetables is an easy way to reducing salt consumption .
And the benefits could be vast :
An important recent study by the American Heart Association found that just reducing salt intake by a teaspoon could save 200,000 lives every single year .
Their advice ?
Basically the same as those of Michael Pollan :
If it comes in prepackaged and it does n’t rot , do n’t eat it .
An angry mother of a South Hadley High School students has spoken out about the bullying 15 - year - old Irish girl , Phoebe Prince , encountered the last few days before she hanged herself .
The mother , who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Boston Herald for fear her daughter will get picked on , said the day Phoebe took her own life , one of the bullies wrote the cold word " accomplished ” on Phoebe 's Facebook page .
There is uproar between the Northeastern District Attorney 's office and South Hadley school authorities .
School superintendent , Gus Sayer , has said the staff at the school only became aware of the bullying one week before Phoebe 's death .
Northeastern District Attorney Elizabeth Scheibel said this is a lie .
In her criminal investigation - in which nine students from the school were charged in connection with the bullying - Scheibel said Phoebe 's mother reported the harassment her daughter was suffering twice to school officials .
According to the mother , three days before Phoebe 's death , a student confided in a staff member that someone had scratched Phoebe 's face out of a class photo and drawn something obscene over it .
The staffer apparently took the picture down .
“ Phoebe had to go into that classroom and see that on one of the last days of her life , ” said the woman .
Sayer said he was not aware of the obscene drawing .
The mother also stated that another staff member was present when Phoebe was being verbally attacked while studying in the library the day of her death .
Scheibel said the staff member never reported the incident until after Phoebe 's death .
Sayer disputed this .
“ I do n’t believe ( the staffer ) witnessed it , ” he said .
“ There was a staff member present , but that person did not overhear those conversations . ”
" Sweeping it under the rug , " is what the mother calls it .
" Eventually it ’ll all go away .
That ’s their motto , ” the mother said .
A friend of Phoebe's , Sergio Loubriel , told the Globe he had made plans with Phoebe for the evening she hanged herself .
She planned to call to his house after her dinner .
“ In the hallways , people would give little smart remarks , just look at her funny like she had three eyes , ” Loubriel said .
He added that students called her a “ slut ” and an “ Irish whore , ” but Prince never discussed her worries with him .
“ Right away they just jumped on her without even giving her a try , ” Loubriel said .
In other related news , the anti-bullying hot line established a few weeks ago in the wake of Phoebe 's death has been inundated with calls from students reporting bullying .
The call flow has been extremely high with students reporting various types of bullying including nasty and obscene messages being posted to their Facebook accounts .
Boston city officials are moving fast to try and get to the bottom of the reports .
VATICAN CITY —
The two Ratzinger brothers have always stood together .
They were both ordained as Catholic priests the same day in the same small German town where they came of age .
And they both rose up through the German hierarchy of the Catholic Church , with Joseph eventually joining the Roman Curia and elevated as Pope Benedict XVI , and his brother Georg Ratzinger named a Monsignor .
Now Georg has been implicated in a growing physical and sexual abuse scandal in Germany that dates back to the years when the two brothers served the church in their native Bavaria .
There is reportedly growing concern in the Vatican that the pope himself may be implicated in this scandal .
The still - unfolding scandal in Germany is the latest in a string of disturbing sexual abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic church globally in Boston , Ireland , Canada and Australia .
It has reverberated around the world and crippled the finances of the Catholic Church in America as a result of enormous lawsuits .
The Vatican has been seen by victims ' rights groups particularly in America as too dismissive of these scandals and the damage they have done to the church financially and spiritually .
But now preoccupation is mounting in the Vatican as the growing sex abuse scandal in Germany has directly touched the Pope through his brother , Ratzinger .
Senior officials in the Roman Curia are now worried , as the Italian daily La Repubblica reported on Wednesday , that the scandal will eventually reach the Pope himself and put into question whether — and how much — he knew of abuse cases during his tenure as Archbishop of Munich between 1977 and 1981 .
Tension has been palpable since cases of child molestation and violence were reported in the school that trained singers for the renowned Domspatzen Choir of Regensburg , which was directed from 1964 to 1994 by Ratzinger .
In an interview with the German regional daily Neue Passauer Presse on Tuesday , Ratzinger apologized to child victims of sexual abuse at the school , while maintaining that he was unaware of the alleged incidents .
Ratzinger admitted to slapping some pupils early in his career but said that he “ always had a troubled conscience about it ” and “ was happy when physical punishments were completely forbidden in 1980 by legislation . ”
In the Vatican , church officials — speaking on condition of anonymity , as is the norm — showed appreciation for the openness shown by the Pope 's brother but questioned the timing and content of his admissions .
Reacting to the crisis , German bishops have called for victims to come forward and denounce their abusers .
They 've also appointed a bishop as responsible for dealing with abuse cases countrywide and have announced a toughening of their guidelines against child abuse .
In an unusually ample statement , Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi praised the German bishops ' “ timely and decisive action . ”
“ They have demonstrated their desire for transparency and , in a certain sense , accelerated the emergence of the problem by inviting victims to speak out , even when the cases involved dates from many years ago , ” he said .
But there is now fear that new cases might surface .
Episodes of pedophilia and brutal physical violence are already being investigated by prosecutors at the Benedictine monastery of Ettal , in Bavaria , which falls under the church jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Munich .
The current leadership of the monastery has resigned , taking full responsibility for the cases , which date from the 1970s to the early 1990s , according to a " special mediator " appointed by the monks .
The Vatican has announced it will send an " apostolic visitor , " or investigator , to examine the situation at the monastery .
But Christian Weisner , spokesman for the Catholic reform movement We Are Church , challenged the Pope to explain “ what he knew then and why he acted as he did . ”
“ Joseph Ratzinger was bishop of Munich from 1977 to 1981 , so he has to answer the question , ” he said in a statement .
More cases of abuses seem also bound to come up at the Domspatzen Choir .
The director and composer Franz Wittenbrink , who lived in the choir preparatory school until 1967 , told Der Spiegel magazine that an “ elaborate system of sadistic punishments combined with sexual lust ” was in place in the school .
He said the headmaster at the time “ would choose two or three of us boys in the dormitories in the evenings and take them to his flat .
Everyone knew about it . ”
He added , “ I find it inexplicable that the Pope 's brother Georg Ratzinger , who had been cathedral bandmaster since 1964 , apparently knew nothing about it . ”
From English - speaking countries such as the U.S. and Ireland , the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church is now spreading quickly through Europe .
Sex abuse victims have come forward in 19 of Germany 's 27 dioceses , as well as Austria and Holland , where the bishops have ordered an independent investigation .
The president of the German bishops , Robert Zollitsch , will be in Rome today for a meeting with the Pope .
The audience had already been scheduled for weeks but talks will be inevitably dominated by the abuse issue .
The scandal has also renewed friction between the Vatican and German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government .
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger has accused the church of covering up the scandals and pressed the bishops to cooperate with prosecutors .
Germany 's Catholic Church now seems willing to take part in “ round table ” talks about child abuse in schools , together with Protestant leaders , family associations and local officials .
It had earlier and somewhat indignantly rejected calls for an investigation into Catholic schools only .

A nurse shark may be similar in shape but not size to the prehistoric fossil
The fossilised remains of a gigantic 10 m - long predatory shark have been unearthed in Kansas , US .
Scientists dug up a gigantic jawbone , teeth and scales belonging to the shark which lived 89 million years ago .
The bottom - dwelling predator had huge tooth plates , which it likely used to crush large shelled animals such as giant clams .
Palaeontologists already knew about the shark , but the new specimen suggests it was far bigger than previously thought .
The scientists who made the discovery , published in the journal Cretaceous Research , last week also released details of other newly discovered giant plankton - eating fish that swam in prehistoric seas for more than 100 million years .
The size of the jaw fragment in fact supports the contention that P. mortoni was a gigantic animal
Dr Kenshu Shimada , DePaul University
But this new fish , called Ptychodus mortoni , is both bigger and more fierce , having a taste for flesh rather than plankton .
It may even have been the largest shellfish - eating animal ever to have roamed the Earth .
Dr Kenshu Shimada of DePaul university in Chicago , Illinois , US found the fossilized remains of the shark in rocks known as the Fort Hays Limestone in Kansas .
" Kansas back then was smack in the middle of an inland sea known as the Western Interior Seaway that extended in a north - south direction across North America , " says Dr Shimada .
The jawbone fragment came from a huge fish ( diagram courtesy of Dr Shimada )
Along with a piece of jaw , Dr Shimada and colleagues uncovered a piece of jaw , teeth and scales .
" Although it represents a fraction of the entire body of the shark , the jaw fragment is gigantic .
The estimated jaw length was almost 1 m long , and that would suggest that the shark was likely at least 10 m in length , " says Dr Shimada .
Due to the lack of a complete skeleton , it is difficult to gauge the physical appearance of the shark .
But Dr Shimada suspects it had a body shaped much like that of a modern nurse shark ( Ginglymostoma cirratum ) , with a broad rounded head and stout body .
However , its teeth and lifestyle would have been very different .
Hundreds of robust teeth line the upper and lower parts of the shark 's mouth , forming large slab - like plates capable of crushing shellfish .
" This in turn suggests that P. mortoni was probably a sluggish bottom - dwelling shark , rather than an actively fast swimmer , " says Dr Shimada .
Fossils of this and other closely - related species have long been known .
" While there have been many teeth and a few incomplete skeletal remains of P. mortoni in museum collections , the significance of this new specimen is that it contains one of the largest teeth of this species that were found with a gigantic jaw fragment .
" The size of the jaw fragment in fact supports the contention that P. mortoni was likely a gigantic animal , " says Dr Shimada .
The scientists have dated the fossil at 88.7 million years old .
At that time , a variety of animals , such as giant clams , other sharks , bony fishes , and predatory marine reptiles called mosasaurs and plesiosaurs inhabited the same water .
Some , including certain mosasaurs would also have grown to gigantic proportions , reaching lengths of 10 m or more .
Dr Shimada excavates the jawbone
Why P. mortoni became so huge is still a mystery .
" The emergence of large ptychodontids roughly coincides with the timing of when many other kinds of organisms , including clams as well as sharks and bony fishes , became bigger , " explains Dr Shimada .
" Clearly , the food resources must have been abundant enough in the marine ecosystem to support such large organisms .
" Becoming big does have advantages such as deterring predators and being able to travel faster , but it does come with disadvantages as well , most notably needing more food for energy . "
Ptychodus mortoni's tooth , close up
Another specimen of P. mortoni has been found alongside another type of meat - eating shark called Squalicorax , with some scientists suggesting that the meat - eating shark may have been scavenging on the body of its larger relative .
Last week , Dr Shimada and colleagues published details in the journal Science of how a dynasty of large plankton - eating fish roamed the oceans between 66 and 172 million years ago .
These fish died out with the dinosaurs .
Once they had vanished from the ecosystem , mammals and cartilaginous fish such as manta rays , basking sharks and whale sharks began to adapt to fill a similar ecological role .

Justice John Paul Stevens , the oldest member of the US Supreme Court , has announced he is to retire .
Justice Stevens leads the court 's liberal bloc .
His replacement will be nominated by President Barack Obama .
The judge , who turns 90 in 11 days time , says he will step down when the court finishes its work for the summer - in late June or early July .
Mr Obama hailed Justice Stevens as a " brilliant " jurist and said he would quickly nominate a successor .
His announcement has not come as a surprise , says the BBC's Steve Kingstone , in Washington .
' Fierce dedication ' " We cannot replace Justice Stevens 's experience or wisdom , " Mr Obama said at the White House .
JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS Born 20 April 1920 Appointed to Supreme Court by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975 Sided with liberal justices on cases involving abortion , civil rights and church - state relations Led dissenting justices in case that sealed George W Bush 's 2000 presidential election win over Al Gore " I 'll seek someone in the coming weeks with similar qualities : an independent mind , a record of excellence and integrity , a fierce dedication to the rule of law and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people , " he said .
Chief Justice John Roberts said in a written statement that Justice Stevens had earned the gratitude and admiration of the American people .
" He has enriched the lives of everyone at the court through his intellect , independence , and warm grace , " he said .
Supreme Court justices serve for life and the US constitution gives the president sole authority to nominate them .
Nominations must be confirmed by the Senate .
The nomination is likely to become a political battleground ahead of the Congressional mid-term elections in November .
Justice Stevens 's polite , dignified interventions made him a likeable figure on the bench , but he was also a powerful intellectual and strategic presence , our correspondent adds .
He informed Mr Obama of his pending retirement in a one - paragraph letter addressed to " My dear Mr President " .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan is seen as a possible successor Analysts say Justice Stevens 's departure will not change the court 's conservative - liberal split because President Obama is certain to name a liberal - leaning replacement .
The Washington Post , quoting aides and Democrats close to the process , named three people as likely candidates to replace Justice Stevens - Solicitor General Elena Kagan and federal judges Diane Wood and Merrick Garland .
An administration official said Mr Obama was considering about 10 potential candidates for the post , Reuters news agency reported .
It will be the second time in his presidency that Mr Obama makes such a nomination .
Last year he named Sonia Sotomayor to replace retiring Justice David Souter .
Justice Stevens was nominated in 1975 by then US President Gerald Ford , to replace Justice William Douglas , who had retired .

I was a bit skeptical when a user from 4 chan claimed to be an “ android trusted tester ” and posted screenshots of a MyTouch 3G supposedly running Android 2.2 Froyo – afterall we know how easily those “ About ” screens are faked .
But after some trolling ( “ No one cares , take this $ #!* to XDA ” ) and small talk ( “ is it nice ” , “ hurr ” ) the OP follows up with a picture that has me ( at least partially ) believing .
Well , not ONLY believing … also yearning for the arrival of 2.2 .
You see , if the below pic is the real deal , then we could see an option to allow applications on your Android phone to automatically update when new versions of that application are available :
You really do n’t understand how long I ’ve , well , longed for this .
I would have settled for a “ bulk update ” feature that allowed you to view a list of updateable apps , select multiple apps with a check box , and 1 - touch update those chosen , but this is even more desirable than that .
An app - by - app bulk update option does has some other benefits , and I hope they consider including that as well , but this would be a magnificent step in the right direction .
Often times it ’s the little things that make or break a use experience and this option will definitely make Android better .
It ’s overwhelming to have 75 + apps installed and see 34 apps have updates waiting in Android Market .
I just shake my head at the status bar , cry a bit inside , admit defeat and go on using my old applications unless I already know something golden rests in one of those new APKs .
And of course , if you ’re enabling automatic updates , a feature where you allow manual downgrades or rollbacks of applications would be appreciated .
Nothing would be worse than to see a company hastily release an update that unintentionally glitches up your phone , leaving you stuck with a broken app and no way of turning back .
There are some potentially interesting side effects that could come of this as well :
What if a developer launches a really simple application in hopes of baiting as many downloads as possible , waits until they have a mass quantity of installs , and then release an update that is either malicious or intends to collect user information not previously agreed to in the original app download .
I ’m guessing Google will only allow automatic updates when applications have no additional permissions compared to their previously installed version , making an alternate bulk update option even more attractive .
Of course the onus should also be on the user to only agree to automatic updates from companies they extremely trust .
Developers could more easily migrate from a 100 % free application with no ads towards showing display advertising here and there without making it so obvious .
Instead of having an app , updating it , and then realizing you ’re suddenly inundated with ads , developers could slowly integrate different monetization strategies without bombarding users .
Some people will hate this but personally , I think its great for the developer community .
Less fragmentation .
The phones , operating systems , specs , carriers and a lot of other variables already contribute to an ecosystem that will inherently have some level of fragmentation .
With automatic updates at least developers will be able to more easily push their latest wares out without having to worry that a large quantity of people are having different experiences for different reasons .
And ultimately , this will allow them to provide better customer support .
This is all just rumored discussion coming from one thread on 4 chan so take the chatter lightly , but its an obvious move for Google to make and one I will gladly welcome .
Has anyone else been dying for an upgraded upgrade system ?
I was just reading about President Obama ’s new push to pass his health care legislation and the republican opposition .
It ’s an interesting subject .
Supporters believe that every American should have health care .
Opponents believe that universal health care means a lower standard of care for everyone and will plunge the country deeper into debt .
Amidst all of the political wrangling , however , there is one group of people who have been all but ignored : the uninsured .
Physicians claim that universal health care will require them to adopt an assembly - line approach to health care .
They argue that they will be paid less to see patients , so they will have to see more patients to recoup their losses .
Lobbyists converge upon Washington and make their arguments why universal health care is good or bad for our country , whether it makes fiscal sense or not and how it threatens our democratic way of life .
In the meantime , people are dying from otherwise benign ailments , because they ca n’t afford an office visit or simple antibiotics .
There are people in this state who have no health care because they are unemployed , yet ca n’t get Medicaid because of a legislative loophole which disqualifies them .
They certainly can’t afford private health care , nor can they afford to go to a doctor on their own .
While politicians and lobbyists jockey for political gain , real people suffer .
Here is one of their stories .
Steven is a student at Eastern Michigan University .
He is divorced and has two children .
He returned to school after becoming disabled because he wanted to finish his degree .
Since he could n’t work , it seemed like a perfect time .
He went to the Department of Human Services to apply for state aid and he applied for disability benefits through Social Security .
He was denied for both .
Steven has a good relationship with his ex and they had always taken care of child support between themselves .
The state , however , would not approve benefits unless he dragged his ex into court to get a Friend of the Court ruling for child care payments .
That also disqualified him from Medicaid or any other benefits .
Steven ’s interest in maintaining a positive relationship with his ex for his childrens ’ benefit cost him any help from the state .
Social Security , on the other hand , decided that he was n’t really disabled because he was going to school .
The Social Security Administration ’s logic is that if he can go to school , he can work , so he does n’t qualify for disability .
Apparently , the SSA requires disabled people to sit on their butts at home all day long .
Steven has no income , no savings , no assets , and has tapped out his available student loans , so he probably wo n’t be able to stay in school for very much longer .
Of course , he also has no health care .
What happens if he gets sick ?
What if he slips on ice and breaks his arm ?
What if any of a million possible freak accidents happens to him ?
While physicians ’ lobbyist groups complain that universal health care will cost doctors money , a profession that averages a $ 280,400 - per - year salary , because they will be paid less per patient , Steven has nothing .
While doctors complain that they will have to see more patients to make up the difference , thereby meaning less individualized attention for each patient , Steven ca n’t even walk through a doctor ’s front door .
Steven ’s story is not unique .
He is , unfortunately , in the same situation as a growing segment of our country ’s population .
He would give anything for one - tenth of a doctor ’s average salary .
He would be grateful for an abbreviated doctor ’s visit , because it ’s more than he has right now .
Politicians and lobbyists in Washington squabble over political posturing and partisanship while good people go without .
These people seem to have lost sight of what really matters , though — the people .
While people can control a lot of things in their lives , whether they get sick or not is n’t one of them .
While republicans and democrats bicker over principles , Steven sits at home , waiting and praying he does n’t get sick .
I would encourage anyone who cares about his fellow Americans to write to your Congressman or Senator and encourage them to put aside partisanship for a moment and do the right thing .
Doctors swear to “ remember that ( they ) remain a member of society , with special obligations to all ( their ) fellow human beings , those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm , ” when they take the Hippocratic Oath .
That seems to be an ideal they have misunderstood or lost sight of .
Perhaps it ’s time for physicians in this country to look back at that ancient oath and all it stands for , and renew their pledge to do their service for humanity .
Perhaps it ’s an ideal we can all aspire to .

Pope Benedict XVI has announced plans for all Roman Catholic clergy to be fitted with a special ‘ panic button ’ that will allow users to report suspected paedophiles .
In a pastoral tweet , the Pontiff revealed that the emergency button would be visible at the bottom right hand side of all cassocks , providing a direct link to CEOP , the Catholic Exploitation and Online Protection centre .
He assured the faithful that the button would mean an end to cover-ups .
‘ Every complaint registered with us will be thoroughly investigated , ’ he promised , ‘ by our newly - appointed Papal Noncio . ’
The button , which will feature an image of a ‘ Smiley Pope ’ , also gives users instant access to CSI Vatican , a crack team of cardinals who will visit the scene of any alleged crime and , using the very latest forensic techniques , miraculously find no evidence whatsoever .

One of our closest primate relatives , the bonobo , has been shown to voluntarily share food , scientists report .
This sort of generous behaviour was previously thought by some to be an exclusively human trait .
But a team has carried out an experiment that revealed that bonobos were more likely to choose to share their food than opt to dine alone .
The research is published in the journal Current Biology .
Dr Brian Hare from Duke University , US , and Suzy Kwetuenda from Lola y Bonobo , a centre for orphaned bonobos in the Democratic Republic of Congo , gave a hungry bonobo access to a room with some food in it .
This room was adjacent to another two rooms , which the creature could easily see into .
One of these rooms was empty while the other contained another bonobo .
Scientists want to find out what drives this behaviour
The hungry primate could then choose to eat the food alone or unlock the door by removing a wooden peg and share his fare with the other bonobo .
Dr Hare wrote in Current Biology : " We found that the test subjects preferred to voluntarily open the recipient 's door to allow them to share the highly desirable food that they could have easily eaten alone . "
They now hope to uncover why the bonobos seem to prefer to share their food .
Dr Hare said it could be purely altruistic , or more selfish motives could drive this behaviour because sharing could be exchanged for future favours .
The researchers hope this work could also shed light on what drives humans to voluntarily share .

It dries very quickly and is ready to use again the next day , however having two is probably better so you can rotate them .
Since it 's cotton , you can also machine wash and dry it if you want to .
The fox attack left the zoo 's flamingo pen empty
A fox has broken into a zoo in Finland and killed an entire flock of 16 flamingos , officials at the zoo say .
The fox climbed over a fence at the Helsinki zoo to get into the flamingo pen overnight .
The zoo is on an island in the Finnish capital and the fox had apparently walked over ice to reach it .
An investigation was under way as to why the flamingos - which were normally brought inside overnight because of the cold - had been left out .
The zoo has 150 animal species and nearly 1,000 plant species .
When members of the Gambino crime family correctly suspected in the late 1990s that a nephew of one of their most powerful captains was cooperating with the government , they plotted to kill him , the authorities say .
But before carrying out the plot , they sought permission from the captain , who was in prison at the time .
The captain , Daniel Marino , authorized the killing , federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Tuesday .
The nephew , who was 31 , was lured to a strip club on Staten Island , and was shot and killed , the prosecutors said .
The killing was just one of a series of crimes included in an indictment unsealed on Tuesday against 14 members and associates of the Gambino family .
The cases represent “ literally decades of criminality , ” as Preet Bharara , the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York , put it at a news conference .

This guide covers a few server configuration changes that may be necessary for your web server to correctly serve Ogg media files .
This information may also be useful if you encounter other media types your server is n't already configured to recognize .
Serve media with the correct MIME type
*.ogg and *.ogv files containing video ( possibly with an audio track as well , of course ) , should be served with the video / ogg MIME type .
*.oga and *.ogg files containing only audio should be served with the audio / ogg MIME type .
If you do n't know whether the Ogg file contains audio or video , you can serve it with the MIME type application / ogg , and the browser will treat it as a video file .
Most servers do n't by default serve Ogg media with the correct MIME types , so you 'll likely need to add the appropriate configuration for this .
For Apache , you can add the following to your configuration :
AddType audio/ogg .oga AddType video / ogg .ogv AddType application / ogg .ogg
You can find specific information about possible media file types and the codecs used within them in our comprehensive guide to media types and formats on the web .
In particular , the article on media container formats will be especially helpful when configuring serers to host media properly .
Handle HTTP 1.1 byte range requests correctly
In order to support seeking and playing back regions of the media that are n't yet downloaded , Gecko uses HTTP 1.1 byte - range requests to retrieve the media from the seek target position .
In addition , Gecko uses byte - range requests to seek to the end of the media ( assuming you serve the Content - Length header ) in order to determine the duration of the media .
Your server should accept the Accept - Ranges : bytes HTTP header if it can accept byte - range requests .
It must return 206 : Partial content to all byte range requests ; otherwise , browsers can't be sure you actually support byte range requests .
Your server must also return 206 : Partial Content for the request Range : bytes=0 - as well .
Include regular key frames
When the browser seeks through Ogg media to a specified time , it has to seek to the nearest key frame before the seek target , then download and decode the video from there until the requested target time .
The farther apart your key frames are , the longer this takes , so it 's helpful to include key frames at regular intervals .
By default , ffmpeg2 theora uses one key frame every 64 frames ( or about every 2 seconds at 30 frames per second ) , which works pretty well .
Note :
Of course , the more key frames you use , the larger your video file is , so you may need to experiment a bit to get the right balance between file size and seek performance .
Consider using the preload attribute
The HTML < audio > and < video > elements provide the preload attribute , which tells the browser to attempt to download the entire media when the page loads .
Without preload , the browser only downloads enough of the media to display the first video frame , and to determine the media 's duration .
preload is off by default , so if getting to video is the point of your web page , your users may appreciate it if you include preload in your video elements .
using preload=" metadata " will preload the media file 's metadata and possibly the first few frames of video .
Setting payload to auto tells the browser to automatically begin downloading the media as soon as the page is loaded , under the assumption that the user will play it .
Configuration for older Firefox versions
Serve X - Content - Duration headers
Note : As of Firefox 41 , the X - Content - Duration header is no longer supported .
See bug 1160695 for more details .
The Ogg format does n't encapsulate the duration of media , so for the progress bar on the video controls to display the duration of the video , Gecko needs to determine the length of the media using other means .
There are two ways Gecko can do this .
The best way is to offer an X - Content - Duration header when serving Ogg media files .
This header provides the duration of the video in seconds ( not in HH : MM : SS format ) as a floating - point value .
For example , if the video is 1 minute and 32.6 seconds long , this header would be :
X- Content - Duration : 92.6
If your server provides the X - Content - Duration header when serving Ogg media , Gecko does n't have to do any extra HTTP requests to seek to the end of the file to calculate its duration .
This makes the entire process much more efficient as well as more accurate .
As an inferior alternative , Gecko can estimate the video length based on the Content - Length .
See next point .
Do n't use HTTP compression for media files
One common way to reduce the load on a web server is to use gzip or deflate compression when serving to a supporting web browser .
Although it 's unlikely , it 's possible the browser may advertise that it supports HTTP compression ( gzip / deflate ) using the Accept - Encoding : gzip , deflate header when requesting media files .
Your server should be configured to not do so .
The data in media files is already compressed , so you wo n't get any real benefit from compression , and the use of compression makes it impossible for the browser to properly seek the video or determine its duration .
Another probelm with allowing HTTP compression for media streaming : Apache servers do n't send the Content - Length response header if gzip encoding is used .
Getting the duration of Ogg media
You can use the oggz - info tool to get the media duration ; this tool is included with the oggz - tools package .
The output from oggz - info looks like this :
$ oggz - info /g/ media/bruce_vs_ironman.ogv Content - Duration : 00:01:00.046 Skeleton : serialno 1976223438 4 packets in 3 pages , 1.3 packets / page , 27.508 % Ogg overhead Presentation - Time : 0.000 Basetime : 0.000 Theora : serialno 0170995062 1790 packets in 1068 pages , 1.7 packets / page , 1.049 % Ogg overhead Video - Framerate : 29.983 fps Video - Width : 640 Video - Height : 360 Vorbis : serialno 0708996688 4531 packets in 167 pages , 27.1 packets / page , 1.408 % Ogg overhead Audio - Samplerate : 44100 Hz Audio - Channels : 2
Note that you can't simply serve up the reported Content - Duration line reported by oggz - info , because it 's reported in HH : MM :SS format .
You 'll need to convert it to seconds only , then serve that as your X - Content - Duration value .
Just parse out the HH , MM , and SS into numbers , then do ( HH * 3600 ) +( MM *60 ) +SS to get the value you should report .
It 's important to note that it appears that oggz - info makes a read pass of the media in order to calculate its duration , so it 's a good idea to store the duration value in order to avoid lengthy delays while the value is calculated for every HTTP request of your Ogg media .

A new Republican health reform proposal would allow insurers to bypass consumer protection laws and remove restrictions on rate hikes , according to published reports .
In the GOP ’s 230 - page draft of an alternative health care bill is the following passage :
This policy may be less expensive than others because it is not subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations of the state … including coverage of some services or benefits mandated by the law of the state …
Additionally , this policy is not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes …

The bill , which caps medical malpractice awards , additionally seeks to increase the use of health savings accounts and would create insurance pools for high - risk individuals .
Rep. John Boehner is calling the bill “ The Affordable Health Care for America Act . ”
A key to the expansion of coverage and choice is permitting health insurers to offer interstate policies , they claim .
As Think Progress points out , under the Republican proposal the insurer can choose a primary state “ whose covered laws shall govern the health insurance issuer ” and can change states “ upon renewal of the policy . ”
Page 129 requires a “ health insurance issuer ” to “ provide the following notice ” informing consumers in so - called “ secondary states ” that the policy is “ not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes of the state . ”
On CNN over the weekend , Boehner told host John King that Republicans seek , “ a common sense approach to make the current system work better . ”
However , allowing insurers to ignore consumer protections could make things worse than they already are .

Health care providers could simply choose to do business in states that allow them to charge sick patients more , attracting only the healthiest applicants .
Or as Think Progress suggests , “ Companies could choose a state with scarce regulations and sell policies that do n’t provide mental health parity or cancer screenings . ”
Boehner aides told the Associated Press the measure was not final and changes were being made .

Guest post by Steven Mosher
In Climategate : The Crutape letters we tried to avoid accusing Professor Jones of CRU and UEA of outright fraud .
Instead , based on the record found in the emails , we argued a case of noble cause corruption .
I enlarged upon that charge at Pajama ’s Media .
Commenters took me to task for being too soft on Jones .
Based on the extant text at that time I would still hold to my case .
No skeptic could change my mind .
But Phil Jones makes it hard to defend him anymore .
On March 1st he testified before Parliament and there he argued that it was standard scientific practice to not share data .
Those who still insist on being generous with him could , I suppose , argue that he has no recollection , but in my mind he is playing with the truth and knows he is playing with the truth .
In 2002 Steve McIntyre had no publications in climate science .
He wrote to Jones requesting temperature data .
The history of their exchange is detailed in this Climate Audit Post .
Jones sent data to McIntyre along with the following mail :
Dear Steve ,
Attached are the two similar files [ normup6190 , cruwld.dat ] to those I sent before which should be for the 1994 version .
This is still the current version until the paper appears for the new one .
As before the stations with normal values do not get used .
I ’ll bear your comments in mind when possibly releasing the station data for the new version ( comments wrt annual temperatures as well as the monthly ) .
One problem with this is then deciding how many months are needed to constitute an annual average .
With monthly data I can use even one value for a station in a year ( for the month concerned ) , but for annual data I would have to decide on something like 8 - 11 months being needed for an annual average .
With fewer than 12 I then have to decide what to insert for missing data .
Problem also applies to the grid box dataset but is slightly less of an issue .
I say possibly releasing above , as I do n’t want to run into the issues that GHCN have come across with some European countries objecting to data being freely available .
I would like to see more countries make their data freely available ( and although these monthly averages should be according to GCOS rules for GAA - operational Met. Service .
Cheers
Phil Jones
We should note these things : Jones sent data .
That was his practice .
Jones is aware of the problems in releasing this data .
Jones believes that these monthly averages should be released according to GCOS [ WMO resolution 40 ] rules .
In 2002 his practice is to release data to a total unknown with no history of publication .
And Jones releases the data to him knowing that there are issues around releasing that data .
In 2004 Warwick Hughes exchanges a series of mails with Jones .
In 2000 Jones appears to have a cooperative relationship with Hughes .
In 2004 the record shows the following
Dear Jean Palutikof , Dr P.D. Jones ,
I was just reading your web page at ; http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warming/ and wish to access the station by station temperature data , updated through 2001 referred to on your CRU web page ; http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/#datdow as “ Over land regions of the world over 3000 monthly station temperature time series are used . ”
Where can I download the latest station by station data which is a foundation of Dr Jones et al published papers ?
Note , I am not asking about the CRU gridded data which I can see on your web site .
Looking forward to your help , Best wishes , Warwick Hughes Warwick ,
The station data are not on the CRU web site .
If you look at the GHCN page at NCDC , you ’ll see they have stopped access and cited WMO Res. 40 for this .
To my mind this resolution is supposed to make access free .
However , it was hinted at to me a year or two ago that I should also not make the station data available .
The gridded data are there as you know .
I would suggest you take this up with WMO and / or GCOS .
I have raised it several times with them and got nowhere .
Cheers Phil
As Jones points out he believes that WMO Resolution 40 should make access free .
Jones also says that he himself has taken up this issue with them .
One can presume he took it up because he wanted to give access to data .
Further , he knows that there may be agreements that preclude release of the data .
The start of 2005 is a critical point in the story line .
Jones had cordial exchanges with Hughes in 2000 .
Jones shared data with McIntyre in 2002 and in 2004 Jones believed that the data should be shared .
In 2005 he has been transformed .
In January of 2005 , McIntyre published a paper ( MM05 ) critical of Mann .
As luck would have it at this time former CRU employee Wigley sent an email to Jones about a flyer he has received that discusses FOIA .
At this stage no FOIA have been sent to CRU .
But Wigley and Jones are concerned about skeptics .
What ever willingness Jones had to share data is gone .
Again , Jones shows a clear understanding of the existence of agreements :
Data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people , so I will be hiding behind them .
I ’ll be passing any requests onto the person at UEA who has been given a post to deal with them .
At the start of Feb 2005 , Jones ’ attitude toward data sharing becomes clearer and also contradictory .
Some people can get this data in violation of agreements , while others who ask for it using legal means will be thwarted .
Mike , I presume congratulations are in order – so congrats etc !
Just sent loads of station data to Scott [ Rutherford ] .
Make sure he documents everything better this time !
And do n’t leave stuff lying around on ftp sites – you never know who is trawling them .
The two MMs [ McIntyre and McKittrick ] have been after the CRU station data for years .
If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone .
Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20 days ?
– our does !
The UK works on precedents , so the first request will test it .
We also have a data protection act , which I will hide behind .
Tom Wigley has sent me a worried email when he heard about it – thought people could ask him for his model code .
He has retired officially from UEA so he can hide behind that .
IPR should be relevant here , but I can see me getting into an argument with someone at UEA who ’ll say we must adhere to it !
Two weeks after the publication of MM05 , prior to the issuance of any FOIA whatsoever , Jones contemplates destroying data rather than sharing it .
But read closely .
Jones sends this data to Scott Rutherford .
So what ’s the standard scientific practice ?
The data is covered by confidentiality agreements .
Jones shared it with McIntyre in 2002 , and now shares it with Rutherford in 2005 .
Jones knows it is covered by agreements and he ’s questioned those agreements — except when he finds it convenient to hide behind those agreements .
He violates them as he pleases .
He shares data as he pleases .
And if he is pushed to share it he contemplates destroying it .
On Feb 21 , 2005 Keith Briffa sends Jones a mail with a list of editorials that are critical of Dr. Mann for not releasing data .
Jones replies to Warwick Hughes ’ request for data that same day :
Warwick , Hans Teunisson will reply .
He ’ll tell you which other people should reply .
Hans is “ Hans Teunissen ” I should warn you that some data we have we are not supposed top pass on to others .
We can pass on the gridded data – which we do .
Even if WMO agrees , I will still not pass on the data .
We have 25 or so years invested in the work .
Why should I make the data available to you , when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it .
There is IPR to consider .
You can get similar data from GHCN at NCDC .
Australia is n’t restricted there .
Several European countries are .
Basically because , for example , France does n’t want the French picking up data on France from Asheville .
Meteo France wants to supply data to the French on France .
Same story in most of the others .
Cheers Phil
Jones has changed his attitude about the WMO .
Prior to the publication of MM05 Jones believed that the WMO guidelines would make the data available .
Moreover he argued with WMO that it should be released .
Now , Jones changes his tune .
He argues that he will not release the data even if the WMO agrees .
His concern ?
Hughes will find something wrong with it .
When it comes to deciding whether to share data or not , standards have nothing to do with the decisions Jones made and he knows that .
He knows he shared confidential data with Rutherford while he denied it to McIntyre and Hughes .
He knows he regarded the confidentiality of those agreements quixotically .
Violating them or hiding behind them on a whim .
This was scientific malpractice .
Lying about that now is beyond excuse .
April 2005 comes and we turn to another request from McIntyre :
There is a constant refrain amongst AGW defenders that people do n’t need to share code and data .
They argue that papers do a fine job of explaining the science :
They argue that people should write their own code based on description in papers .
Here is McIntyre ’s request .
Note that he has read the paper and tried to emulate the method :
Dear Phil ,
In keeping with the spirit of your suggestions to look at some of the other multiproxy publications , I ’ve been looking at Jones et al [ 1998 ] .
The methodology here is obviously more straightforward than MBH98 .
However , while I have been able to substantially emulate your calculations , I have been unable to do so exactly .
The differences are larger in the early periods .
Since I have been unable to replicate the results exactly based on available materials , I would appreciate a copy of the actual data set used in Jones et al [ 1998 ] as well as the code used in these calculations .
There is an interesting article on replication by Anderson et al. , some distinguished economists , here [ 1 ]
http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2005/2005-014.pdf discussing the issue of replication in applied economics and referring favorably to our attempts in respect to MBH98 .
Regards , Steve McIntyre
When you cannot replicate a paper based on a description of the data and a description of the method , standard practice is to request materials from the author .
McIntyre does that .
Jones ’ “ practice ” is revealed in his mail to Mann :
From : Phil Jones < p.jones@xxxxxxxxx.xxx >
To : mann@xxxxxxxxx.xxx
Subject : Fwd : CCNet : DEBUNKING THE “ DANGEROUS CLIMATE CHANGE ” SCARE Date : Wed Apr 27 09:06:53 2005 Mike , Presumably you ’ve seen all this – the forwarded email from Tim .
I got this email from McIntyre a few days ago .
As far as I ’m concerned he has the data sent ages ago .
I ’ll tell him this , but that ’s all – no code .
If I can find it , it is likely to be hundreds of lines of uncommented fortran !
I recall the program did a lot more that just average the series .
I know why he ca n’t replicate the results early on – it is because there was a variance correction for fewer series .
See you in Bern .
Cheers Phil
Jones does not argue that code should be withheld because of IPR [ Intellectual Property Rights ] .
It ’s withheld because he is not sure he can find it and he suspects that it is a mess .
More importantly Jones says he knows why McIntyre cannot replicate the results .
Jones does not argue “ standard scientific practice ” to withhold code ; he withholds code because it ’s either lost , or sloppy and because it will allow McIntyre to understand exactly how the calculations were done .
This is malpractice .
Today when questioned whether people could replicate his work from the papers he wrote Jones “ forgot this mail ” and said they could replicate his work .
And we should note one last thing .
Jones again acknowledges sending data to McIntyre .
So , what exactly is Jones ’ notion of standard practice ?
To share or not to share ?
What the record shows is that Jones shared data and did n’t share data , confidential or not , on a basis that cannot be described as scientific or standard .
He did so selectively and prejudicially .
Just as he refused data to Hughes to prevent his work being checked he refuses information that McIntyre needs to replicate his published results .
At the same time he releases that data to others .
That ’s not the end of the story as we all know .
In 2007 the first two FOIA were issued to CRU for data .
One request for a subset of the data was fulfilled after some delay .
The larger request was denied .
By 2009 it became clear to McIntyre that the CRU data had also been shared with Webster .
When McIntyre requested the very same data that Webster got from Jones , CRU started again with a series of denials again citing confidentiality agreements , inventing the terms of those agreements ex nihilo .
Webster could have the data .
McIntyre could not .
What the record shows is that Jones had no standard scientific practice of sharing or not sharing data .
He had no consistent practice of abiding by or violating confidentiality agreements .
He had his chance to sit before Parliament and come clean about the record .
He had an opportunity to explain exactly why he took these various contradictory actions over the course of years .
Instead he played with the truth again .
Enough .

Usually when we head to the library , we 're looking for something relatively mundane , like a common book or a periodical .
Step into a library 's special collections , though , and you 'll find all sorts of offbeat offerings .
From puppets to porn , here 's a look at some unusual special collections one can peruse in reading rooms around the country .
1. Kidney Literature
Yearning to learn more about your kidneys ?
Head to the University of North Carolina 's Carl W. Gottschalk Collection .
The 12,400 - item collection houses legendary medical professor Gottschalk 's passion : historical items related to the study of kidneys .
Gottschalk 's medical research focused on the kidneys , and throughout his life he managed to collect texts , engravings , woodcuts , and other relics on the subject that dated back to the 16th century .
2. Glass Eyeballs
Not to be outdone , UNC 's rival Duke has an interesting medical collection of its own .
When the Duke History of Medicine Collections underwent an internal audit last year , it found a number of interesting stockpiles in its holdings , including boxes of glass eyeballs and old surgical saws that date back nearly 400 years .
3. Showgirls
Could a library collection that focuses on showgirls be anywhere other than UNLV ?
The school 's collection of showgirl - related memorabilia includes drawings and costumes that have been used in some of Vegas ' racy entertainments .
And yes , there 's nudity , but the collection 's website notes " [ I ]t would be a misrepresentation of that history to ignore topless showgirls and their costumes .
In the context of this exhibit the object is the costume , not the woman wearing it . " 
4. Dean Martin
Showgirls are n't the only Vegas institution immortalized in UNLV 's special collections .
The school 's library also has a special exhibition that focuses on stalwart entertainer Dean Martin 's career at the Sands and other casinos , including early pictures of the Rat Pack yukking it up on stage .
5. Puppets
If you 're like me and feel just a little creeped out by puppets , you might want to steer clear of UC - Santa Barbara 's library .
The Betsy Brown Puppetry Collection features everything you could ever want to see — possibly in your nightmares — related to puppets .
The collection — which is named after famed puppeteer Betsy Brown — includes puppet plays , materials related to puppet design , photographs of puppets , and even puppet periodicals .
If you can't find the puppet materials you 're looking for here , try McGill University 's Rosalynde Stearn Puppet Collection , which contains 171 puppets of its own .
6. Witchcraft
If you 're looking for a particularly obscure spell , Cornell might have some answers for you .
The Cornell Witchcraft Collection includes over 3,000 titles that examine the history of persecuted witches .
Although the collection — which the school started assembling in the late 19th century — focuses mostly on the theological aspects of treating witches as heretics , there are also Latin volumes on demonology and graphic depictions of the torture of suspected witches .
7. Baby Books
For centuries parents have been keeping meticulous records of their children 's early years in baby books , and UCLA has an amazing special collection of these treasured mementos .
The Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library has been working on building a collection of these memory books from the 19th through 21st centuries to help shed light on trends in early childhood care and children 's health .
The collection includes everything from books that have n't been filled out at all to diligently completed books .
Where has the school been able to round up so many baby books ?
You guessed it : eBay .
8. Bloodletting
UCLA does n't just have baby books , though .
The school also houses a collection devoted solely to bloodletting .
The materials inside cover everything from the difficulties of applying leeches ( you can try to dump them onto the patient out of a wine glass , but some will just stick to the glass ) to pictures of the required instruments for a good bloodletting .
Sure , the practice has been out of favor for well over a hundred years , but if it ever catches back on , head to Los Angeles to get up to speed .
9. Patent Medicine Ads
UCLA 's libraries sound like an absolute goldmine .
In addition to the aforementioned collections , it also houses a terrific set of patent medicine advertisements .
How can you pass up a chance to look at ads for products like A. Danforth 's Great Vegetable Pain Destroyer or Merchant 's Gargling Oil , which is good for burns , scalds , flesh wounds , hemorrhoids , toothaches , and " many other diseases incident to man and beast ? " 
They 're all online here , and they 're absolutely worth checking out .
10 . Libertine Literature
What 's libertine literature ?
To put it bluntly , it 's old smut .
Princeton has a large collection of early English pornography , including what it calls " two of the earliest substantial pieces of pornographic writing in English . " 
Some of the material in the collection dates back to the 17th century , but it also contains items like Venus Miscellany , a 19th - century publication said to be America 's first pornographic newspaper .
Sounds a little more exciting than the average trip to the periodicals room .
11 . Magic
Princeton 's other unusual collection focuses on magic .
Carl W. Jones , a 1911 Princeton grad , built up an impressive library of scrapbooks regarding the performance of magic in the U.S. , and when he died his wife presented it to his alma mater .
In addition to covering regular magic , the collection includes a number of rare early texts on witchcraft , including the 16th - century book De Praestigiis Daemonum , an influential text on demonology .

How It Works : The Next - Gen Wind Turbine
To take advantage of the strong winds that blow over the ocean , this gearless turbine uses a giant ring of magnets and 176 - foot blades
Smiling Faces Of Freaky American Nationalism
Although the terms fascism and neofascism are highly charged , it is instructive to consider the possibility that neofascist beliefs have insinuated themselves via the religious right into mainstream American society , culture , and law .
The below clip is from a speech that Rick Warren gave to a crowd of several thousand and the clip following Warren ’s speech is from the film , Cabaret .
They are both short and it is edifying to watch them both before continuing to read .
A special thanks to Mike Tidmus and Dan Savage for inspiration .
Christian Reconstructionism and Neofascism ’s Emergence
The Warren clip well characterizes the ideology of Christian Reconstructionism .
Michael
York ’s statement to the bisexual Baron at the end of the second clip is something like “ Do you still think you can contain them ? ” and seems pertinent to the insinuation of anti-Constitutional conservatives in positions of influence .
In Germany at this time , the prevailing social ideology – religion – was national socialism , and the fascist leaders knew they could whip up fervent support if they exploited the massive economic failures of German society to their own ends : does this look familiar ?
The USA has been in a similar situation since Reaganoids seized power and the Democrats , moderates , liberals , and lefties have been running around in circles , as extremist elements have infiltrated every level of government , the judiciary , and society .
Meanwhile , the rule of law is diminished at every turn , as the religious beliefs have been applied by every stealth politician elected to office through the use of massive networks of Christian churches and organizations .
In this way , the recent granting of asylum status to a German family who fled to the US because of their fervent belief in homeschooling , is ironic .
Along with one of his primary sources and inspirations , RJ Rushdoony , Warren believes that the USA is a nation founded on Christian ideology and that the rule of Constitutional law should be replaced with Mosaic law .
Warren is savvy enough to realized he cannot outright declare such positions , however .
The Reconstructionist Christianity movement is candidly authoritarian in its worldview : they know what ’s better for us than we do for ourselves is a good description .
I suggest people read Margaret Atwood ’s The Handmaid ’s Tale ( or rent the movie ) , if they want to see how anyone deemed “ less - than ” is dealt with in a theocracy : uppity women and gay folks are branded as gender - traitor deviants and are mutilated , raped , and hanged , similar to the brutal crucifixion of Matthew Shepard .
Not only could such a totalitarian government emerge in the USA , but it has taken root over the past 40 years , accelerating with the ascension of the right .
In this way , the Reconstructionist , fundamentalist , and evangelical Christians such as Warren mirror extremist Muslim sects and schools that share a dominator vision that aggressively represses free thought and is blatantly intolerant of a pluralist democracy .
The problem with fundamentalist Christianity and Christian Reconstructionism is that they refuse to permit other beliefs and practices to exist in their weltanschauung .
Pluralism , by definition , would permit dissent and even encourage it .
Defending Democracy Requires Vigilance
American nationalist ideology , coupled with Christian Reconstructionism , is a new form of neofascist nationalism with an American pedigree .
In this regard , the challenge facing Americans is that we simply do not believe such a movement could seize power in the USA .
Such extremism would carry a unique American branding and fundamentalist Christianity , in its Rushdoony - inspired vision , is both homegrown and dominator - authoritarian in ideology and practice .
Both the Nazis and the Christian Reconstructionists use the subtle and powerful metaphors of motherhood , family , and children to rally the masses to their cause , with the unmistakable implication that anyone who opposes them must be anti-motherhood , anti-family , and anti-children , as dissent has no place in their ideology .
Lesbians , gays , trans , and bi folks are yet again demonized , villified , criminalized , diseased , and outlawed .
Clearly , no one needs a new smiling face of domination , no matter how it is spun : not Warren ’s , not Palin ’s , not Beck ’s , not anybody ’s .
It does appear that Warren and similar types are showing that they have learned to soft - peddle their exclusionary beliefs , especially since the children and grandchildren of religious conservatives appear to be evading the polarizing political activism foisted on them by zealot parents and preachers .
The problem that remains is what will happen with the brainwashed kids from Jesus Camp : how will they cope in a progressively more secular and post - religious USA while clinging to such anti-democratic beliefs ?
Much like the hetero - niceness of too many families , bring a queer into the picture and – voila !
– nastiness often emerges from conservative religious types , nearly always directed toward the one who is held as different .
Freedom - loving people must be vigilant in every generation to guard the foundations of liberty and democracy , else we will lose our freedoms and the American Constitution will be tossed aside by the misguided passions of a population led by freaky smiling faces .

9 -YEAR BATTLE …WILL TO LIVE … FAITH DRIVEN …PRAYERS ANSWERED
After the lymphoma transformed into a more aggressive type in August 2009 , George endured a critical , several month period of intense chemo treatments at City of Hope Medical Center ( COH ) .
Several different chemo regimens were proven ineffective .
By mid-March 2010 , the radiation sessions were also unsuccessful at shrinking the 12 cm abdominal tumor .
George was told he had 2 months to live .
In desperation , the radiation dosage was doubled for the remaining 4 sessions .
George then traveled to Oasis of Hope Hospital ( OOH ) in Tijuana for alternative - treatments not available in the USA .
Miraculously , the combination of those therapies and lingering effects of the radiation “ melted ” the tumor sufficiently to qualify him for a Bone Marrow / Stem Cell Transplant ( BM / SCT ) in May at COH .
Go to George ’s Journal and read the April - June 2010 entries featuring his experiences in Mexico and the BM / SCT .
George believes , “ With God all things are possible . ” ( Matthew 19:26 )
With resolute faith and tremendous love , support and inspiration from family and friends , George persevered .
We ’re thrilled that he is now cancer free !

Access to the Internet is a fundamental right to nearly four out of five adults across the globe , and those in South Korea , Mexico , and China seem to have the strongest feelings on the topic .
This is according to a report ( PDF ) by the BBC World Service , which polled 27,973 adults on their feelings about , usage of , and concerns about the Internet .
Although users are somewhat divided on whether the Internet should be regulated , they are in agreement on its usefulness for learning and information discovery .
Across all 26 countries , 79 percent of Internet and non-Internet users said that they felt that Internet access should be " the fundamental right of all people . "
When isolated for people who already use the Internet , that number went up to 87 percent .
Almost universally ( 90 percent ) , respondents said that the Internet was a good place to learn and almost 80 percent said the Internet brought them greater freedom .
This undoubtedly leaves many of us with warm fuzzies , but survey respondents expressed a number of worries when it comes to Internet use .
One of the top concerns was the ability to express opinions online safely — overall , respondents were split almost evenly over this issue , and users in South Korea , Germany , France , and Japan held the strongest beliefs that they could not safely express opinions while surfing .
Other major areas of concern were fraud ( leading at 32 percent ) as well as violent or explicit content ( 27 percent ) and threats to privacy ( 20 percent ) .
Government regulation of the Internet ended up being a somewhat divisive issue among those surveyed , however .
A little more than half agreed that the Internet should never be regulated by any level of government , though certain regions had significantly differing opinions on the topic .
For example , China , Thailand , Indonesia , and much of Europe either " somewhat " or " strongly " disagreed with such a statement .
Conversely , users in Mexico , Nigeria , and South Korea were heavily against government regulation .
( The US fell mostly in the middle , with 57 percent against government regulation ) .
Secretary general of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , Dr. Hamadoun Toure , told the BBC that everyone should be able to participate in our " knowledge society " online and that it's a powerful source of enlightenment .
He said that , because of this , governments must " regard the Internet as basic infrastructure — just like roads , waste and water . "
Indeed , more governments are beginning to regard Internet access as a utility .
Monticello , MN even made headlines last June after a court ruled in favor of the town saying that Internet was a utility and that it could be financed as such .
However , there are still large swaths of people , both in the US and around the globe , who have yet to get even basic Internet access .
With 44 percent of all respondents telling the BBC that they simply cannot cope without Internet access , it 's clear that there 's still plenty of work to do in getting that " fundamental right " to citizens of the world .

SUPREME COURT : AS " PEOPLE , " CORPORATIONS CAN RUN FOR PRESIDENT
Halliburton said it is narrowing its choices for vice president .
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) -
In a little reviewed passage of the holding by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , the Court said that corporations have the same Constitutional rights as people .
" Corporations with rights of personhood , can even run for the presidency of the United States as long as they were incorporated in America at least 35 years ago . "
This language came in focus when Halliburton announced that it will run for the presidency in the Republican primary in 2012 .
" Rather than line the pockets of our favorite candidate who we hope will do our bidding , " said David Lesar , Halliburton CEO , " thanks to the Supreme Court , we can now eliminate the middleman and be sure of the outcome by running for office ourselves . "
Halliburton announced yesterday that it will run on a platform of strong national defense ; selling cheap weapons and exploding teabags to militias ; eliminating costly long term health care by terminating the sick ; and by letting its core voters know that the only thing black about Halliburton is its black operations .
Halliburton said it is narrowing its choices for vice president .
" Sarah Palin was able to prove people did rode dinosaurs as she rode that McCainasaurus almost to victory .
But we are even more impressed with her new company called the Iquit ( pronounced EYE - kwit ) Corporation .
The Democrats are also contemplating jumping on the Corporation bandwagon .
" While Barack Obama is still popular , " said David Smiley , a Democratic strategist , " we are thinking of running UnitedHealthcare because there is nothing that says ' yes we can ' than better than billions of dollars . "
Ralph Nader , who plans to run as an Independent on the Rumpled Jacket Party ticket , said all these corporations are unsafe for America at any speed .

The BBC has gained exclusive access to one of the most secretive buildings in the UK - GCHQ , the government listening station .
But , says Mark Savage , it was n't exactly a warm welcome .
One of the signs that greeted the BBC team " Do n't take it personally , " said the woman behind the reception desk .
But it was hard not to .
People were avoiding us and there were signs all over the building warning of our presence .
" Caution .
BBC Radio 4 recording here .
Keep all conversations to ' Unclassified ' . "
It was hardly surprising .
We were being allowed to record inside one of Britain 's most secret establishments - GCHQ , the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire .
Their job is to listen in on others , record their conversations and pick up their e-mails .
It is said , by the government , to provide " essential intelligence in the battle against terrorism and [ contribute ] to the prevention of serious crime " .
But for the first time in its history we were turning the microphones on them .
We did n't exactly walk right in .
Negotiations for access to this highly secretive operation lasted several weeks .
Could we , they enquired , assure them that the microphones we were going to use were as " low sensitivity as possible " ?
And would we , they asked , allow their sound engineers to listen back to the recordings we made in open areas to check that we had n't picked up any conversations that we should n't have ?
' The Doughnut '
And then , when we got there , there was layer upon layer of security checks .
We got past the first two before my recording equipment was taken away to be examined .
I left it with three men in a room who were standing round a table with all sorts of weird looking devices .
FIND OUT MORE ...
GCHQ : Cracking the Code , written and presented by the BBC 's security correspondent Gordon Corera
It will be broadcast on Radio 4 at 2000 BST on Tuesday , 30 March
Or hear it later on the iPlayer
GCHQ denies giant database claims " Please look after my baby , " I said , before being escorted outside .
( Producers can , understandably , be very protective about their recording machines ) .
I have no idea what went on in that room but it obviously included the electronic equivalent of a full body search .
I had to piece everything back together afterwards .
Even the batteries were treated with suspicion - if I needed any more over the next 48 hours , I was told , they would supply them .
There were more checks to come .
We had n't , at this stage , even got past main reception .
A rather forbidding looking receptionist asked for identification before pointing to a sign which expressly forbade anyone taking cameras , mobile phones and - rather bizarrely , given the reason we were there - recording equipment or similar electronic devices into the main building .
Wide berth Somehow we got through and there we were , strolling with our minders , round what is known at GCHQ as The Street , a circular walkway which runs throughout the building nicknamed affectionately , The Doughnut .
ABOUT GCHQ GCHQ was established in 1919 as the Government Code and Cypher School
It adopted its present name in 1946 - when its headquarters were at Bletchley Park , Buckinghamshire ( above ) GCHQ has two main missions : gathering intelligence through the interception of communications ( known as ' signals intelligence ' , and providing services and advice as the UK 's national technical authority for information assurance Visitors to Cheltenham have to wear a red badge to mark them out , but you could n't miss me .
I was the one wearing headphones and carrying a large microphone .
People gave us a wide berth .
It felt like I had a communicable disease .
As one of the UK's three intelligence agencies - the others being MI5 and MI6 - secrecy at GCHQ is ingrained .
But some of those we spoke to were forthcoming if not about the substance of their work , then about the personal effect .
One member from the counter terrorism section described what it is like to listen in on terrorists ' conversations and the constant battle to predict where the next attack will come from .
" I do n't think you would be human if you did n't go home at night and could n't switch off and thought ' Oh my God .
What happens if ... ' "
Yet there were others who were n't entirely happy about the BBC 's presence .
As if to hammer the point home , there was an announcement over the public address system within minutes of our appearance .
" Blinds facing the street between blocks A and B should be lowered and closed immediately .
End of message . "
It turned out that a member of staff was worried about us being able to see through the windows into the open plan offices facing onto the street .
They did n't want us to be able to read what was on their computer screens and had alerted security .
There was a low whirring , grumbling noise and the shutters came down .
Exhibited Soviet radio - found in a field , but no one knows who buried it There were reminders of past " transgressors " - people who had betrayed their secrets - all around us .
Dotted around the building were glass cases with exhibits from GCHQ 's history including two radio sets .
The first was a radio used by the Portland Spy Ring to send messages back to Russia in the 50s and 60s .
Next to it was a radio set which had been discovered by a farmer ploughing his field near Aberystwyth .
It had been cached there by someone working for the Soviets but , to this day , no - one has any idea who it was .
Still , there was an upside to being avoided if not altogether shunned .
We had no trouble getting a table in the staff restaurant when it came to lunchtime .
You had only to announce that we were from the BBC and diners would obligingly move away to make room for us .
It 's not something you could count on when booking a table at a high class restaurant like Quaglinos but then GCHQ is an altogether different world .

The new iPhone developer agreement as quoted at http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler:
3.3.1 â € ” Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
Now think about this .
Basically , they have said " you can only use these PLs to originally write your code , use of any other PLs breaks this agreement . "
Now , assume iPhone continues to be widely successful and that ... eventually PCs are replaced by iPad devices .
And say everyone starts copying Apple 's locked fortress model , where will PL innovation go ?
I 'm very disappointed at Apple over this .
Las víctimas se dirigían a un evento de entrega de apoyos por parte del Gobierno Federal , para educación .
A balazos y granadazos asesinan a siete niños y a tres jóvenes en la sierra de Pueblo Nuevo ; la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Estado ( PGJE ) informó que los ahora occisos se dirigían a recibir apoyos para educación por parte de un programa del Gobierno Federal cuando un grupo de la delincuencia organizada los atacó y mató .
Las víctimas respondían a los nombres de Yesenia Sarabia Mancinas , de ocho años ; su hermana Juana Francisca , de 15 ; Érika Ortega Rueda , de 11 años y sus hermanos Margarita , de 13 ; Iván , de 17 , y Yolanda , de 19 ; además Carlos Ramírez Lyva , de 15 ; Sergio González Leyva , de 16 , y los hermanos Lázaro y Pedro Leyva Cabrera , de 19 y 21 , respectivamente , todos originarios del poblado El Aval , Pueblo Nuevo .
Extraoficialmente dos de las jóvenes estaban embarazadas .
No se quisieron parar
Los hechos se suscitaron al mediodía de ayer cuando los jovencitos iban a bordo de una camioneta tipo pick - up con rumbo al poblado Los Naranjos , en el mismo municipio , a una entrega de apoyos .
Faltaban siete kilómetros para llegar a Los Naranjos cuando un grupo de la delincuencia organizada , según informó la Procuraduría , les marcó el “ alto ” pero como éstos hicieron caso omiso les empezaron a disparar con potentes fusiles y hasta les lanzaron artefactos explosivos .
Agentes de la Procuraduría acudieron al lugar para dar fe de los hechos , al parecer acompañados por elementos del Ejército Mexicano ; sin embargo , hasta la noche de ayer no se sabía sobre ninguna persona detenida .
It 's Friday , so we 're sure the following heartwarming tale will cheer your final slog into the weekend : how Reg reader David Humpage is giving BT some serious grief with giant novelty cheques .
David wrote to the El Reg consumer affairs department explaining that a couple of years back he noticed he was being charged £ 4.50 a pop for paying his phone bills online .
This , he suggests , actually costs the telco nothing , so why the charge ?
Two years of correspondence later , BT admitted it did n't take a financial hit for processing online payments , but explained it " averaged together all the non - direct - debit payment methods , and on that basis it costs them £ 4.50 " .
David says : " Fair enough , I thought , I do n't want to do business with this kind of dishonesty and anyway you have n't apologised about Phorm yet .
So I left . "
He continues : " As I 'd been paying for over two years to have non-existent cheques cashed , I thought I may as well have something for this outlay , so my last cheque was sent blown up on A3 cardboard .
Remember , it 's legal to write a cheque on anything as long as it contains the right information - there are famous stories of a cheque written on a cow , or in one case on a fish .
In the circumstances , I thought they got off pretty lightly . "
BT did n't think so , and since dispatching his novelty cheque last November , David has " been deluged with calls from BT people who could n't speak English and were clearly following a script " .
The company also referred the matter to a debt collection agency , which claimed the cheque had bounced .
In fact , clarified David 's bank , it was never presented for payment .
BT then claimed the cheque rubbered " because it was non-standard " - something David nicely describes as " clearly bollocks " .
David splendidly concludes : " I 've had my solicitor write them several letters , pointing out that they 've been paid with a legal cheque , and it 's up to them to cash it .
I 've even offered to replace the cheque , though stipulating that there 'll be a £ 25 admin charge and the replacement will be on plywood . "
Well done that man .
The current state of play is that David 's solicitor has written to BT threatening to " take them to court if they did n't cash my cheque " .
He 's currently awaiting a reply , while the debt collectors have fallen silent .
We emailed BT this morning asking for its position on giant novelty cheques .
A press officer requested the phone number related to the bill in question , and promised to look into the matter .

Franken was right .
The Democrats were getting the crap kicked out of them .
Obama 's standing sank in the polls , the healthcare plan attracted shrinking support , and the Tea Party grew bolder and angrier .
And why would n't they ?
The Republicans succeeded brilliantly the last time , when Bill and Hillary Clinton tried to give America the same civilising protection enjoyed in every other industrialised country , some form of publicly mediated health insurance .
The Republicans routed them in 1993 , and took majority control of the Congress a year later .
The Republicans were working to repeat this plan , the seething conservative Tea Party mosh pit served to mobilise popular outrage .
It magnified the attention , anger and abuse .
The Tea Party got so worked up it could n't tell if Obama was a socialist , a communist - Mao Zedong they called him - or a fascist - he was Josef Stalin , then Adolf Hitler .
They threw it all at him in a frenzy of invective .
Their presidential hopeful Sarah Palin was happy to sponsor the misinformation that Obama 's plan would force citizens to appear before " death panels " .
Urged on by talkback 's Rush Limbaugh and Fox News 's Glenn Beck , they rallied under the chant " kill the bill " and hysteria built .
Then Obama pivoted .
Suddenly , the world saw his strategy for the first time .
He and the Democratic leaders in Congress abruptly abandoned bipartisanship , marshalled their forces , swiftly drove their bills through the Congress and declared victory .
The margin was slender , 219 votes to 212 in the House of Representatives ; even 34 Democrats voted no .
But it was a win on Obama 's signature reform , and the President himself clinched it by wooing a final handful of wavering Democrats .
The fringe elements among the Republicans ' shock troops discredited the conservative resistance by going beyond all reasonable bounds .
Tea Party protesters surged up to the Capitol as congressmen entered to vote , screaming " nigger " at black legislators and " faggot " at a gay member .
One spat on the black congressman Emanuel Cleaver .
The most senior black congressman , James Clyburn , said : " I have heard things today that I have not heard since March 15 , 1960 , when I was marching to get off the back of the bus . "
After the vote passed , it grew worse .
Ten Democratic Congress members reported getting death threats or suffering harassment or acts of vandalism .
The leader of the House Republicans , John Boehner , felt obliged to call for better behaviour .
The ugly violence " is n't the American way " , he said .
A conservative columnist in The Wall Street Journal , the former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan , wrote of a sense of something bad about to happen : " It 's a world full of people always cocking the gun and ready to say , if things turn bad , ' But I did n't tell anyone to shoot ! '
One of them , the Democrats cry , is Sarah Palin .
She told followers by Twitter last week after the vote : ' Do n't Retreat , Instead - RELOAD !'''
Although Noonan blamed both sides of politics and although Palin said she was using only the metaphors of arms and not urging actual violence , the politics is rebounding against the Republicans .
" At the next election , I think Obama can say , ' Did I not attempt again and again to reach out ' ? '' says Jim Loftus , a former Democratic White House staffer and aide to the Obama campaign , who is visiting Australia as part of a stood - down presidential advance party .
" By calling a modern politician like Obama a communist , the Republicans have invited eye - rolling and alienated the most important voters - the persuadable ones , " says Loftus , now a political consultant .
" And Obama gets to appeal to a sense of fairness . "
It 's not only Democrats who think so .
In a much - remarked blog , the former George W. Bush speechwriter and author of the phrase " axis of evil " , David Frum , wrote : " Conservatives and Republicans today suffered their most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s . "
He blamed the strategic decision to refuse any of Obama 's attempts at compromise : " We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat .
There were leaders who knew better , who would have liked to deal .
But they were trapped .
Conservative talkers on Fox and talk radio had whipped the Republican voting base into such a frenzy that deal - making was rendered impossible .
'' How do you negotiate with somebody who wants to murder your grandmother ?
Or - more exactly - with somebody whom your voters have been persuaded to believe wants to murder their grandmother ? "
Frum , who lost a position at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in retaliation for writing this analysis , is troubled by the newly revealed reality of US politics : Obama is a reasonable , results - driven President , and his opponents are extremists .
No one is calling Obama weak now .
I do n't know whether he 's read Sun Tzu's The Art of War , but it 's as if he read this much : " If your opponent is temperamental , seek to irritate him .
Pretend to be weak , that he may grow arrogant . "

SACRAMENTO — Californians on Thursday woke to the surprising news that , come November , they ’ll get to decide whether their state should be the first to legalize marijuana .
And with that news came one whopper of a question :
Dude . . . we can do that ?
According to law professors and other experts , the answer is yes — but …
No matter what Californians decide , marijuana will still be illegal under federal law .
That means a tangle of legal and political questions must be confronted before advocates can realize their dream of freely growing , selling and using marijuana everywhere in the Golden State .
First , voters have to sign off on what might be a contentious campaign — no sure thing , despite recent polls showing an upswing in support .
And complaints from neighboring states , whose residents could flock to California , may prove too loud for the White House to ignore .
Federal prosecutors and drug agents , who have largely let state prosecutors handle drug crimes in recent decades , could begin to intervene in smaller - scale cases .
“ The pressure on the Obama administration to try to block this or resist it is going to be enormous , ” said Robert MacCoun , a UC Berkeley law professor and drug policy expert .
“ It ’s very hard for a single state to pass a law like this and implement it . ”
Moreover , experts say , approval of the referendum could trigger a backlash against Proposition 215 , the state law that authorizes medicinal use of marijuana .
While the Obama administration last year promised to turn a blind eye to sick people , even though medical marijuana also conflicts with federal law , it may not be willing to do the same when it comes to street - corner dealers and people who just want to get high .
Advocates on Thursday appeared more sanguine .
“ The federal government is going to allow the state of California to move forward with this , ” said Salwa Ibrahim , spokeswoman for the pro-legalization campaign led by cannabis activist Richard Lee of Oakland .
“ We ’re not worried about it . ”
Added Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , sponsor of a separate decriminalization bill : “ We do have the right to legalize , even with the federal law as it is . ”
The initiative , officially the Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 , was certified for November ’s ballot Wednesday after backers turned in signatures from hundreds of thousands of voters .
If it ’s approved , adults 21 and older would be permitted to possess up to an ounce of marijuana ; anyone could grow up to 25 square feet of plants per residence ; and local governments would be asked to craft rules on distributing and taxing marijuana .
The Secretary of State ’s Office said it would take effect the day after Election Day .
Both the governor ’s office and the office of the state attorney general declined to comment on the initiative Thursday .
Attorney General Jerry Brown , who also will appear on the November ballot as the Democratic nominee for governor , is charged with writing official ballot summaries for initiatives and told reporters he should remain neutral for that reason .
A White House spokesman also declined to comment , although the president and some administration officials have previously said they do not support legalization .
Supporters are emboldened in part by a Board of Equalization estimate that said marijuana tax revenue could add more than $ 1 billion to the state ’s starved coffers — although some experts question that , saying few people likely would report marijuana sales on their federal income taxes for fear of prosecution .
“ If other states do this , over time , that might affect Congress ’ attitude , and the president ’s , ” said Vikram Amar , a law professor at UC Davis .
“ But until federal law changes , I would n’t advise someone to run the risk of getting thrown in federal jail . ”
Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a major nuclear arms treaty Thursday , but critics in the Senate will have their say before anything is put in place .
Among them is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , who said in a statement Thursday that the Obama administration " will need to meet three requirements if it expects favorable consideration of the START follow - on treaty . "
" The Senate will assess whether or not the agreement is verifiable , whether it reduces our Nation 's ability to defend itself and our allies from the threat of nuclear armed missiles , and whether or not this administration is committed to preserving our own nuclear triad , " McConnell said in a statement .
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- known as START -- builds on a previous agreement that expired in December .
The agreement reduces the number of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia by about one - third , among other provisions .
Read more about the START treaty
A Senate GOP leadership aide told CNN that as long as the administration can satisfactorily answer questions about verification , missile defense and the modernization of the existing U.S. stockpile , Republicans will likely support the new treaty .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said Thursday that he is confident there will be enough votes for the treaty to pass .
Under the U.S. Constitution , a treaty must pass a two - thirds vote threshold .
That means at least eight Republican senators must sign on to the ratification in addition to all 59 Democrats and independents in the Senate .
" Strategic arms control treaties similar to this one have historically passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support , and I am confident that this agreement will receive the 67 votes from both sides of the aisle needed for passage , " Reid said in a press release .
" There is no need to play politics with something as important as this is to our national security . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said he hopes Congress will ratify the treaty with a large bipartisan majority .
The GOP aide also said Republicans are surprised they have not gotten a classified briefing on this issue yet because their concerns would likely be addressed by such a briefing .
Administration officials said they would brief members of the Senate on the particulars of the treaty on Thursday .
The president 's recent Nuclear Posture Review , which would end the development of new weapons and restrict the conditions for using existing weapons , has caused concern among some conservatives .
They fear Obama will weaken the country 's nuclear deterrent against a possible attack .
" We believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism , Iran and North Korea , " according to a joint statement issued Tuesday by Arizona Republican Sens.
Jon Kyl and John McCain .
" The Obama administration 's policies , thus far , have failed to do that and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would - be proliferators and supporters of terrorism . "
Obama , though , has a key Senate Republican ally in Richard Lugar , a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" I commend the U.S. and Russian delegations for months of dedicated effort , " Lugar said in a March 25 press release .
" I look forward to the President 's submission of the new treaty , its protocols , annexes and all associated documents to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification . "
Lugar said he would work with the committee chairman , Sen .
John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , " to begin scheduling hearings and briefings for the Foreign Relations Committee so that we can work quickly to achieve ratification of the new treaty . "
Kerry 's message : " Let 's get it done . "
" I know there has been a partisan breakdown in recent years , but we can renew the Senate 's bipartisan tradition on arms control and approve ratification of this new treaty in 2010 , " he said in a March 26 release .
" As soon as the President sends the agreement to the Senate , we will appeal to all our colleagues to set aside preconceptions and partisanship and consider the treaty on its merits . "
Reducing nuclear stockpiles has been a top concern for several presidents -- including Ronald Reagan , who faced tense , Cold War relations with the Soviet Union during his presidency .
On several occasions , Reagan expressed his support for reducing the threat posed by nuclear arms .
" Since the dawn of the atomic age , we 've sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control , " Reagan said in an address to the nation on March 23 , 1983 .
But he noted that nations who think about " attacking the United States , or our allies , or our vital interests , concludes that the risks to him outweigh any potential gains .
Once he understands that , he wo n't attack .
We maintain the peace through our strength ; weakness only invites aggression . "
Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have indicated that the nuclear option is on the table if there is a threat from countries like North Korea and Iran , who have so far signaled they are unwilling to negotiate .
In an interview with John Avlon , a DailyBeast columnist and CNN contributor , George Shultz -- Reagan 's secretary of state -- said Obama 's nuclear priority would have received support from Reagan .
" President Obama has picked up on the notion that we can seek a world free of nuclear weapons , and that was very strongly felt by President Reagan , " he told Avlon after returning from a meeting with the president on Tuesday .
" Since the START Treaty that was proposed by President Reagan expired last December , it 's important to get it replaced with a treaty that has verification permissions in it and continuous investigations . "
CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
The Belgian state has stuck the father of five children who were murdered by their mother in 2007 with the bill for convicting her of the crime , the Le Soir daily reported .
A Belgian court sentenced Genvieve Lhermitte to life in prison in December 2009 for killing her son and four daughters , aged three to 14 , while her husband was on a trip to Morocco .
As Lhermitte is incarcerated and insolvent , the Belgian state has sought to recover court expenses and collect fines from her then husband , Bouchaib Moqadem .
" I do n't know what to say .
I am disgusted and revolted that I , who was wrongly deprived of my children , am being asked to pay for the trial of my ex-wife , who was convicted of murdering my five children by cruelly slitting their throats , " Mr Moqadem was quoted as saying by the newspaper .
The bill appears to conform with Belgian law , the newspaper said , with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement .
However Mr Moqadem 's lawyer , in a letter to finance minister Didier Reynders , called for " administrative requirements to be balanced by decency " given the nature of the tragedy .

The History of the Honey Trap
MI5 is worried about sex .
In a 14 - page document distributed last year to hundreds of British banks , businesses , and financial institutions , titled “ The Threat from Chinese Espionage , ” the famed British security service described a wide - ranging Chinese effort to blackmail Western businesspeople over sexual relationships .
The document , as the London Times reported in January , explicitly warns that Chinese intelligence services are trying to cultivate “ long - term relationships ” and have been known to “ exploit vulnerabilities such as sexual relationships … to pressurise individuals to co-operate with them . ”
This latest report on Chinese corporate espionage tactics is only the most recent installment in a long and sordid history of spies and sex .
For millennia , spymasters of all sorts have trained their spies to use the amorous arts to obtain secret information .
The trade name for this type of spying is the “ honey trap . ”
And it turns out that both men and women are equally adept at setting one — and equally vulnerable to tumbling in .
Spies use sex , intelligence , and the thrill of a secret life as bait .
Cleverness , training , character , and patriotism are often no defense against a well - set honey trap .
And as in normal life , no planning can take into account that a romance begun in deceit might actually turn into a genuine , passionate affair .
In fact , when an East German honey trap was exposed in 1997 , one of the women involved refused to believe she had been deceived , even when presented with the evidence .
“ No , that ’s not true , ” she insisted .
“ He really loved me . ”
Those who aim to perfect the art of the honey trap in the future , as well as those who seek to insulate themselves , would do well to learn from honey trap history .
Of course , there are far too many stories — too many dramas , too many rumpled bedsheets , rattled spouses , purloined letters , and ruined lives — to do that history justice here .
Yet one could begin with five famous stories and the lessons they offer for honey - trappers , and honey - trappees , everywhere .
1. Do n’t Follow That Girl
In 1986 , Mordechai Vanunu , an Israeli technician who had worked in Israel ’s Dimona nuclear facility , went to the British newspapers with his claim that Israel had developed atomic bombs .
His statement was starkly at odds with Israel ’s official policy of nuclear ambiguity — and he had photos to prove it .
The period of negotiation among the newspapers was tense , and at one point the London Sunday Times was keeping Vanunu hidden in a secret location in suburban London while it attempted to verify his story .
But Vanunu got restless .
He announced to his minders at the paper that he had met a young woman while visiting tourist attractions in London and that they were planning a romantic weekend in Rome .
The newspaper felt it had no right to prevent Vanunu from leaving .
It was a huge mistake : Soon after arriving in Rome with his lady friend , Vanunu was seized by Mossad officers , forcibly drugged , and smuggled out of Italy by ship to Israel , where he was eventually put on trial for treason .
Vanunu served 18 years in jail , 11 years of it in solitary confinement .
Released in 2004 , he is still confined to Israel under tight restrictions , which include not being allowed to meet with foreigners or talk about his experiences .
Britain has never held an inquiry into the affair .
The woman who set the honey trap was a Mossad officer , Cheryl Ben Tov , code - named “ Cindy . ” Born in Orlando , Fla. , she was married to an officer of the Israeli security service .
After the operation , she was given a new identity to prevent reprisals , and eventually she left Israel to return to the United States .
But her role in the Vanunu affair was vital .
The Mossad could not have risked a diplomatic incident by kidnapping Vanunu from British soil , so he had to be lured abroad — an audacious undertaking , but in this case a successful one .
2. Take Favors from No One
One of the best - known honey traps in spy history involves Mata Hari , a Dutch woman who had spent some years as an erotic dancer in Java .
( Greta Garbo played her in a famous 1931 film . )
During World War I , the French arrested her on charges of spying for the Germans , based on their discovery through intercepted telegrams that the German military attaché in Spain was sending her money .
The French claimed that the German was her control officer and she was passing French secrets to him , secrets she had obtained by seducing prominent French politicians and officers .
During the trial , Mata Hari defended herself vigorously , claiming that she was the attaché ’s mistress and he was sending her gifts .
But her arguments did not convince her judges .
She died by firing squad on Oct. 15 , 1917 , refusing a blindfold .
After the war , the French admitted that they had no real evidence against her .
The conclusion by most modern historians has been that she was shot not because she was running a honey trap operation , but to send a powerful message to any women who might be tempted to follow her example .
The lesson here , perhaps , is that resembling a honey trap can be as dangerous as actually being one .
3. Beware the Media
Sometimes a country ’s entire journalism corps can fall into an apparent honey trap .
Yevgeny Ivanov was a Soviet attaché in London in the early 1960s .
He was a handsome , personable officer and a popular figure on the British diplomatic and social scene , a frequent guest at parties given by society osteopath Stephen Ward .
Ward was famous for inviting the pick of London ’s beautiful young women to his gatherings .
One of them was Christine Keeler , a scatterbrained ’ 60s “ good - time girl ” who supposedly became Ivanov ’s mistress .
Unfortunately for everyone involved , Keeler was the lover of the married British MP and Secretary of State for War John Profumo , who was then working on plans with the United States to station cruise missiles in Germany .
In 1963 , Profumo ’s affair with Keeler was exposed in the press .
Britain ’s famed scandal sheets also blew up the Soviet spy / honey trap angle , for which there was no evidence .
Profumo was forced to resign for lying about the affair to the House of Commons .
His wife forgave him , but his career was ruined .
Ivanov was recalled to Moscow , where he lived out his days pouring ridicule on the whole story : “ It is ludicrous to think that Christine Keeler could have said to John Profumo in bed one night , ‘ Oh , by the way , darling , when are the cruise missiles going to arrive in Germany ? ' ”
He was probably right :
When the media gets hold of a potential honey trap , the truth is easily lost .
4. The Deadliest of Honey Traps
Not all honey traps are heterosexual ones .
In fact , during less tolerant eras , a homosexual honey trap with a goal of blackmail could be just as effective as using women as bait .
Take the tragic story of Jeremy Wolfenden , the London Daily Telegraph ‘s correspondent in Moscow in the early 1960s .
Wolfenden was doubly vulnerable to KGB infiltration :
He spoke Russian , and he was gay .
Seizing its opportunity , the KGB ordered the Ministry of Foreign Trade ’s barber to seduce him and put a man with a camera in Wolfenden ’s closet to take compromising photos .
The KGB then blackmailed Wolfenden , threatening to pass on the photographs to his employer if he did not spy on the Western community in Moscow .
Wolfenden reported the incident to his embassy , but the official British reaction was not what he expected .
On his next visit to London , he was called to see an officer from the Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS ) who asked him to work as a double agent , leading the KGB along but continuing to report back to SIS .
The stress led Wolfenden into alcoholism .
He tried to end his career as a spy , marrying a British woman he had met in Moscow , arranging a transfer from Moscow to the Daily Telegraph‘s Washington bureau , and telling friends he had put his espionage days behind him .
But the spy life was not so easily left behind .
After encountering his old SIS handler at a British Embassy party in Washington in 1965 , Wolfenden was again pulled back into the association .
His life fell into a blur of drunkenness .
On Dec. 28 , 1965 , when he was 31 , he died , apparently from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a fall in the bathroom .
His friends believed , no matter what the actual cause of death , that between them , the KGB and the SIS had sapped his will to live .
Ironically , his time as a spy probably produced little useful material for either side .
His colleagues were n’t giving him any information because they were warned that he was talking to the KGB , and the Soviets were n’t likely to give him anything either .
In this case , the honey pot proved deadly — with little purpose for anyone .
5 . All the Single Ladies
The broadest honey trap in intelligence history was probably the creation of the notorious East German spymaster , Markus Wolf .
In the early 1950s , Wolf recognized that , with marriageable German men killed in large numbers during World War II and more and more German women turning to careers , the higher echelons of German government , commerce , and industry were now stocked with lonely single women , ripe — in his mind — for the temptations of a honey trap .
Wolf set up a special department of the Stasi , East Germany ’s security service , and staffed it with his most handsome , intelligent officers .
He called them “ Romeo spies . ”
Their assignment was to infiltrate West Germany , seek out powerful , unmarried women , romance them , and squeeze from them all their secrets .
Thanks to the Romeo spies and their honey traps , the Stasi penetrated most levels of the West German government and industry .
At one stage , the East Germans even had a spy inside NATO who was able to give information on the West ’s deployment of nuclear weapons .
Another used her connections to become a secretary in the office of the West German chancellor , Helmut Schmidt .
The scheme lost its usefulness when the West German counterintelligence authorities devised a simple way of identifying the Stasi officers as soon as they arrived in West Germany :
They sported distinctly different haircuts — the practical “ short back and sides ” variety instead of the fashionable , elaborate West German style .
Alerted by train guards , counterintelligence officers would follow the Romeo spies and arrest them at their first wrong move .
Three of the women were caught and tried , but in general the punishment was lenient .
One woman who managed to penetrate West German intelligence was sentenced to only six and a half years in prison , probably because ordinary West Germans had some sympathy with the women .
Wolf himself faced trial twice after the collapse of communism but received only a two - year suspended sentence , given the confusion of whether an East German citizen could be guilty of treachery to West Germany .
Unlike most spymasters ,
Wolf preserved his own thoughts on his experience for posterity in his autobiography , Man Without a Face .
Wolf denied that he put pressure on his officers to use die Liebe to do their jobs ; it was up to the officers themselves :
“ They were sharp operators who realized that a lot can be done with sex .
This is true in business and espionage because it opens up channels of communication more quickly than other approaches . ”
How about the morality of it all ?
Wolf replied for all spymasters when he wrote , “ As long as there is espionage , there will be Romeos seducing unsuspecting [ targets ] with access to secrets . ”
Yet he maintains : “ I was running an intelligence service , not a lonely - hearts club . ”
As Tim Burton ’s take on the story consumes moviegoers across the world , it seems a good opportunity to read a letter or two from the original creator of Alice in Wonderland : Charles Dodgson .
Both letters were written by Dodgson – better - known by most under his pseudonym , Lewis Carroll – to a young friend called Isabel Seymour in May of 1869 , just four years after the release of the first Alice novel , and concern a railway ticket he had forgotten to pass on to the child .
The second letter in particular is a fantastic demonstration of his ability to transform the most ordinary of situations into an entertaining story .
The letters were kindly supplied by The Rosenbach Museum & Library in Philadelphia ; home to one of the finest Lewis Carroll collections in the world where hundreds of related letters , photographs , books – even original drawings by Sir John Tenniel – can be enjoyed .

The Chestnuts ,
Guildford
May 15 , 1869
My dear Isabel , Words cannot tell how horrified , terrified , petrified ( everything ending with “ fied , ” including all my sisters here saying “ fie ! ” when they heard of it ) I was when I found that I had carried off your ticket to Guildford .
I enquired directly I got there whether ­anything could be done , but found you must have arrived in London some time before I got here .
So there was nothing to be done but tear my hair ( there is almost none left now ) , weep , and surrender myself to the police .
I do hope you did n’t suffer any inconvenience on account of my forgetfulness , but you see you would talk so all the way ( though I begged you not ) that you drove everything out of my head , including the very small portion of brain that is usually to be found there .
Miss Lloyd will never forgive me for it — of that I feel certain .
But I have some hope that after many years , when you see me , an aged man on crutches , hobbling to your door , the sternness of your features may relax for a moment , and , holding out the forefinger of your left hand , you may bring yourself to say , “ All is forgotten and forgiven . ”
I hardly dare ask what really happened at Paddington , whether the gentleman and lady , who were in the carriage , helped you out of the difficulty , or whether your maid had money enough , or whether you had to go to prison .
If so , never mind : I ’ll do my best to get you out , and at any rate you shant be executed .
Seriously , I am so sorry for it , and with all sorts of apologies , I am sincerely yours , C. L. Dodgson
Second Letter
Ch. Ch. Oxford
May 29 , 1869
My dear Isabel , I was so sorry to hear from Miss Lloyd of your not being well , and I hope you will not think of writing to me about ‘ Alice ’ till you are well enough to do so .
I only write this on the chance of your being in the humour to read it , or to have it read to you .
When you are in that state , I should like you to know the real reason of my having carried off your railway - ticket .
You will guess by this , of course , that my last letter was a hoax .
Well , you told me , you know , that it was your first railway - journey alone : naturally that set me thinking , “ Now what can I do to give her a really exciting adventure ? ”
Now three plans occurred to me .
The first was to wait till the train had started from Reading , and then fire a pistol through your carriage - window , so that the bullet might go near your head and startle you a little .
But there were two objections to this plan — one , that I had n’t got a loaded pistol with me , the other , that the bullet might have gone in at a wrong window , and some people are so stupid , they might not have taken it as a joke .
The second plan was to give you , just as the train left Reading , what should look like a Banbury - cake , but should afterwards turn out to be a rattlesnake .
The only objection to this plan was , that they did n’t keep that kind at Reading .
They had only common Banbury - cakes , which would n’t have done at all .
The third plan was to keep the ticket , so that you might be alarmed when you got to London .
Of course I arranged thoroughly with the Guard that the thing was not to be overdone .
He was to look a little stern at first , and then gradually to let his expressive features kindle into a smile of benevolence .
I was very particular on this point and almost my last words to him were , “ Are you sure you can manage the benevolence ? ” and I made him practice it several times on the platform before I would let him go .
Now you know my whole plan for making your journey a real Adventure .
I only hope it succeeded .
So , hoping much to hear you are better again , I remain very truly yours , C. L. Dodgson P.S. I must tell you candidly that the whole of this letter is a hoax , and that my real reason was — to be able to make you a nice little portable present .
Friends suggested a corkscrew , a work - box , or a harmonium : but , as I cleverly remarked , “ These are all very well in their way , but you can only use them sometimes — whereas a railway ticket is always handy ! ”
Have I chosen well ?
Tanning tax in the health care bill : Ledger Live goes ultraviolet
Days after President Barack Obama signed the federal health care overhaul , Ledger Live heads out to New Jersey tanning salons to talk to tanning buffs and shop owners about the bill 's controversial 10 percent tax on tanning salons .
As Star - Ledger reporter Leslie Kwoh reported last month , the tax is just the latest blow for a troubled industry already facing tighter restrictions due to concerns about the health effects of lying beneath a wall of supercharged light bulbs .
The datatype features - deftype , defrecord and reify , provide the mechanism for defining implementations of abstractions , and in the case of reify , instances of those implementations .
The abstractions themselves are defined by either protocols or interfaces .
A datatype provides a host type , ( named in the case of deftype and defrecord , anonymous in the case of reify ) , with some structure ( explicit fields in the case of deftype and defrecord , implicit closure in the case of reify ) , and optional in - type implementations of abstraction methods .
They support , in a relatively clean manner , access to the highest - performance primitive representation and polymorphism mechanisms of the host .
N.B. that they are not merely host - in - parens constructs .
They support only a circumscribed subset of the host facilities , often with more dynamism than the host itself .
The intent is that , unless interop forces one to go beyond their circumscribed scope , one need not leave Clojure to get the highest - performing data structures possible on the platform .
When is the world going to finally decide Israel has gone too far – and do something about it ?
When Israel invaded and retained the occupied territories , imposing a regime that resembles the old South African apartheid system , the world looked the other way – after all , beleaguered Israel was fighting for its survival , and , besides that , peace talks were underway .
The daily grinding down of the Palestinians could be accepted as a temporary and even necessary evil as long as there was some sort of vague expiration date attached to the arrangement .
When it began to look like peace might be just a pipedream , and the Israelis continued sponsoring invasive " settlements " to cement their conquest , the world looked the other way .
After all , everybody knew Netanyahu had to deal with an increasingly right - wing Israeli electorate , and his government could fall apart at any moment : no one expected President Obama to get tough with Tel Aviv anyway , and so no one was too surprised when the US caved on the settlements issue .
The bombing and continued blockade of Gaza , the barbaric invasions of Lebanon , and the continuing refusal to correct the widespread human rights violations documented in the Goldstone report – all of this has darkened Israel ’s image considerably , even among its staunch supporters .
On account of this record , Israel is now widely considered a " rogue " nation , at least outside the US .
One of the major reasons for this shift in perception has to do with the wide - ranging activities of the Mossad , Israel ’s intelligence service .
With a fearsome reputation for ruthlessness second only to the old KGB , the Israeli intelligence services are known for their boldness and their buccaneering tactics .
This was once a public relations advantage : their raid on Entebbe was made into a successful movie for a reason .
From rescuing hostages , however , the Mossad has lately gone in for assassinations on foreign soil , most recently in Dubai , where they offed Hamas military commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
This is nothing new for the Israelis : picking off their enemies on foreign soil is a longtime favorite sport of the Mossad .
The innovation that ’s got Israel ’s allies in an uproar , however , is a relatively new weapon in the Mossad ’s arsenal : identity theft .
As the Telegraph reports :
" Ministers are understood to be furious that an alleged hit squad which murdered a Hamas leader in Dubai last month cloned the passports of six unsuspecting Britons , who are now living in fear of reprisals .
" Israel , which has not denied involvement in the murder , had previously promised that Mossad , its secret intelligence service , would never use British passports to help its agents carry out covert operations . "
The six are all British citizens living in Israel , where the Mossad had full access to their essential documents : they simply cloned the passports and sent their agents into Dubai .
There the Israelis reportedly assembled quite a contingent , as many as 18 , enough to qualify the effort as a full - scale military operation .
In effect , the Israelis carried out a mini-invasion of Dubai , a fact not lost on the Emirate authorities .
Interpol has posted the photos of the eleven ( so far ) known suspects , and issued a statement , including the following :
" Since INTERPOL has reason to believe that the suspects linked to this murder have stolen the identities of real people , the Red Notices specify that the names used were aliases used to commit murder .
INTERPOL has officially made public the photos and the names fraudulently used on the passports in order to limit the ability of accused murderers from traveling freely using the same false passports . "
If any institution embodies that vague abstraction known as " the international community , " then surely it is Interpol , which coordinates the capture of transnational criminal gangs – sex traffickers , drug lords , and , yes , Mossad assassins .
That they see Israel ’s intelligence agency as an obstacle in their task of limiting " the ability of accused murderers from traveling freely " speaks volumes about the degree to which Israel has truly crossed the line .
This is n’t exactly an innovation on the part of the Israelis : in New Zealand , you ’ll recall , they had a large - scale passport " farm " in operation a few years ago .
Their agents would identify someone completely disabled , or otherwise unlikely to travel abroad , and – unbeknownst to the victim — apply for a passport in their name .
When discovered , the Israelis denied everything , but the cops had the goods and the trial of the Israeli spies was front page news for weeks .
The New Zealanders all but broke off diplomatic relations with Israel over the matter , and the Israelis , while never admitting anything , made apologetic noises while the issue – mostly ignored by the Western media outside New Zealand — faded into obscurity .
Now it has arisen once again , but this time in a far more serious context : this is n’t inconsequential - albeit - lovely New Zealand but Britain , France , Germany , Ireland , and possibly other Western nations who have had their passport systems violated .
However , the worst of it is that the Mossad has apparently taken to " farming " the passports of Israelis who hold dual citizenships .
According to Ha’aretz : " Five Israelis who hold dual citizenship in Britain and Germany and whose names were on some of the passports denied any connection with the Dubai death . "
If Israel ’s intelligence services are now " farming " the passports of those numerous Israelis who hold dual citizenship , then the passport system – the key to maintaining security in the age of terrorism – is no longer reliable or even functional .
Israel is a multi-national " nation , " one created by a state - sponsored effort to get people the world over to move there , and many retain citizenship in their country of origin .
The US does n’t compile statistics on dual citizenship , but the number who hold dual Israeli and US citizenship is substantial : they are now all at risk of having their identities stolen by a covert army of assassins .
There ’s just one way to solve this growing problem , and that is to ban all dual citizenship , and ask Americans to choose .
Yes , there ’s a Supreme Court decision standing in the way , but if it requires a constitutional amendment , then so be it .
At a time when maintaining the integrity of our passport system is key to preventing terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens abroad , it ’s worth taking the trouble to patch up this gaping hole in our national security .
That Israel has gone this far in its international campaign of murder and intimidation ought to motivate the civilized nations of the world to unite in protest .
The government of Dubai is petitioning to have the head of the Mossad arrested for murder , and , come to think of it , issuing a warrant might not be such a bad idea .
With a foreign minister who is the Israeli equivalent of David Duke , and a foreign policy that owes much to the Klingons , Israel , which is veering off into Asiatic despotism , needs to be pulled back toward the West .
The way to do that is not to offer the Jewish state unconditional support , no matter how potty and self - destructive its policies may be , but to offer the kind of " tough love " that can bring it back into the Western orbit .
We ca n’t afford to look away anymore : Israel has massively compromised the security of international travel , and has brought this on itself .
Now is the time for the US and other Western countries to rein in their client state gone rogue – before it ’s too late .
Cache Machine : Automatic caching for your Django models
Cache Machine hooks into Django ’s ORM to provide easy object caching and invalidation .
One of our primary goals with the rewrite of addons.mozilla.org was to improve our cache management .
Large sites like AMO rely on layers of caching to stay afloat , and caching database queries in memcached is one of our favorite tools .
AMO heavily favors reads over writes , so we have great cache performance ; the hit rate ranges from 90 % - 98 % .
However , once something is in the cache , it ’s stuck there until timeout ( 60 minutes ) .
Combined with front - end caching , this can mean it ’s a couple of hours before add - on developers see their changes roll out to the site .
We do n’t like that .
For zamboni , our Django - based rewrite , seamless object caching and invalidation was my first project .
Today we released Cache Machine as a drop - in library for use in any Django application .
The package is available on pypi and the code is on github .
Usage
Here ’s a cache - enabled model :
from django.db import models import caching .
base class Zomg ( caching .
base .
CachingMixin , models .
Model ) : val = models .
IntegerField ( ) objects = caching .
base .
CachingManager ()
The first step is to inherit from CachingMixin .
This mixin gives your model post_sync and post_delete signal handlers that will flush the object from cache .
It also adds a cache_key property that helps invalidate the object properly .
Then you replace the default manager with CachingManager .
Instead of a normal QuerySet , this manager returns CachingQuerySets which try to pull objects from cache before performing a database lookup .
How it works
Cache Machine knows how to cache normal QuerySets and RawQuerySets .
Each QuerySet is keyed by the active locale and the SQL of the underlying query .
The CachingQuerySet wraps around Queryset.iterator ( ) to check cache before hitting the database .
Invalidation is the interesting part .
As we iterate through a set of objects in a database result , we create a “ flush list ” for each object .
The flush list maps each object to a list of cached queries it ’s a member of .
When an object is invalidated in the post_sync signal , all of the queries it was a part of are immediately invalidated .
Parent and child foreign - key relationships are also tracked in the flush lists .
If a parent object changes , its flush list will be invalidated along with all children that point to it , and vice versa .
Issues
Only the memcached and locmem backends are supported .
Cache Machine relies on infinite cache timeouts for storing flush lists , but none of Django ’s builtin backends support this ( even though the memcached server does ) .
We wrap the memcached and locmem backends to fix the infinite timeout issue , but file and database backends are n’t implemented since they ’re not useful to us .
Cache Machine does not cache values ( ) and values_list ( ) calls .
Since these methods do n’t return full objects , we ca n’t know how to invalidate them properly .
They could be overridden to do normal lookups and then pull out the results , but I have n’t gotten around to that yet .
count ( ) queries will not be cached .
These ca n’t be invalidated efficiently .
I recommend denormalizing your tables and adding a count field if you need to access it often .
Update : limited count caching was enabled in this commit .

This happened last december , but is bizarre enough to upload here now .
On 12 December 38 - year - old Chechen man came in as a guest at the wedding , which is celebrated in one of the Astrakhan cafe .
Collecting the men present around the table , the guest took a gun ( IZH - 79 - 9 ) , placed the muzzle against his head and pulled the trigger .
He then reloaded and invited anyone to repeat the " deed in honor of the groom " .
A young man , believing that the gun was empty , put the gun to his own temple and fired .
As a result , he was seriously injured and was taken to hospital .
He is still in serious condition .

Advertisement A crew of 16 sailors that included Britons has been rescued from a sinking yacht after it struck rocks in the Clipper Round the World Race .
The crew abandoned the Cork Clipper on life rafts after the accident in Indonesian waters , and was later rescued by two other competing yachts .
The 68ft ( 20.72 m ) yacht ran into trouble in high winds and rough seas in the early hours of Thursday local time .
All of the sailors are now safe and their families have been informed .
The Cork Clipper was holed by a rock near the small Indonesian island of Gosong Mampango , about 200 miles north - east of Java .
The crew radioed nearby yachts California Clipper and Team Finland before abandoning their boat on life rafts and paddling to nearby rocks .
The crew had a lucky escape .
You do n't abandon ship unless you have to
Falmouth Coastguard
Our sailor is safe and sound
The sailors were forced to paddle out on the stormy seas again to reach rescue boats , which had been about four nautical miles away and arrived near daybreak .
Irishman Sean Coote , 47 , who lives in Sunbury on Thames , said : " Our life raft was picked up approximately half an hour after leaving the island by the California crew who were immediately on hand with biscuits and hot tea .
" We are grateful to have escaped with no major injuries and proud to have rallied together as a team and survived a harrowing ordeal and test of our resilience . "
International Rescue Services had been alerted by Falmouth Coastguard , who co-ordinated the operation to rescue the crew after being contacted by Team Finland .
Multinational crew A spokeswoman for Falmouth Coastguard said : " The crew had a lucky escape .
You do n't abandon ship unless you have to . "
The Cork Clipper was the Irish entry in the race and the multinational also included members from the UK , Australia and one Chinese sailor .
It was skippered by Richie Fearon , 29 , from Londonderry .
The boat is based in Gosport , Hampshire .
The 10 - strong clipper fleet began the race on 13 September last year from the Humber estuary .
Its current leg is from Geraldton in Western Australia to Singapore .
Famed sailor Sir Robin Knox - Johnston , chairman of race organisers Clipper Ventures , said : " Clearly our priority has been the safety of the crew and we have confirmation that all on board have evacuated and are now safe .
" Their welfare is our prime concern at this time . "

Liverpool winger Albert Riera has back - tracked on his “ sinking ship ” comments about the club after admitting his plans for a move to Spartak Moscow have ground to a halt .
The Spain international was briefly suspended last month for his outburst , in which he also criticised manager Rafael Benitez for failing to communicate with his players .
An angry Benitez immediately sanctioned a loan move to Russia - whose transfer window is currently open until next week - and froze Riera out of his first - team plans .
However , now the escape route to Moscow appears to have been closed off after the two parties failed to agree personal terms Riera has tried to repair the damage done by his comments on the eve of the important Europa League last - 16 second leg against Lille last month .
“ Negotiations with Spartak Moscow are stalled ... my intention is to decide my future in the summer , ” he told Spanish newspaper Marca .
“ I want to continue my career at Liverpool because it is one of the best clubs in the world .
“ The feeling is spectacular , we have a great stadium and I feel very good at Liverpool .
“ I speak with Fernando Torres and ( Jose ) Reina and agree on the greatness of Liverpool . ”
Such apparent contrition is unlikely to convince Benitez to welcome him back into the fold .
The Reds boss has not forgiven Riera , worried about his World Cup chances , for so publicly trying to manufacture a move at a crucial time of the season by misrepresenting his relationship with him .

I saw this on Dutch commercial television , which more often than not features American series and subtitled or dubbed American advertising ‘ like you never left the US ’ .
Translation :
Guy :
Hey , you owe me money .
Girl : …
Guy :
For the burger .
Voice - over : So very Dutch !
Our new ( product name ) , etc .
Guy : Yep , right amount .
Voice - over :
It ca n’t get any more Dutch .
The adjective ‘ Hollands ’ meaning Dutch has this reference to the olden days when the Netherlands was just North Holland and South Holland .
It can be used in a neutral manner , derogatory or positive manner , depending on the context .
In this case it denotes comfort food ( brown bread and cheese being a classic here ) , which is positive .
The negative part remains the stereotype that the Dutch are cheap , which is a gross generalisation , but sometimes where there ’s smoke , there ’s fire .
The Dutch are traditionally thrifty and save a lot of money and do n’t run rampant with credit cards , not so much cheap .
Oh , and all the Dutch television shows with people about to lose their homes due to overspending kill this stereotype , with the Dutch calling their situation ‘ an American one ’ .
‘ Going Dutch ’ means paying your own way in English , which in American dating land is surely not a given .
And of course , anyone who only wants to pay half the bill at a fast food chain while on a date could easily be labelled poor , not cheap .

Different diets work better for some people than others A simple DNA test may predict whether someone is more likely to lose weight on a low fat or a low carbohydrate diet , say US researchers .
The results from the small preliminary study of 101 women showed those on the best diet for their genes lost two to three times more weight than the rest .
The results are being presented at an American Heart Association conference .
Experts said the findings tied in with previous studies , but further work should be carried out .
Cheek swab
The emerging field of " nutrigenomics " looks at how food interacts with genes .
It has long been known that people react to certain nutrients differently according to their genetic makeup .
Lactose intolerance , for example , is more common among Asians and Africans than of people of North European descent .
This is a very intriguing study - though very small
Prof Christine Williams ,
University of Reading
This study looked at how well people with different genes fared on different weight - loss diets .
The researchers , from Stanford University , analysed data from 101 white Caucasian women who provided DNA from a swab of their cheek cells .
The women had different diets for a year .
The diets were very low carbohydrate , low carbohydrate / high protein , and low or very low fat .
The researchers divided the group into three genotypes which they described as low carbohydrate diet responsive , low fat diet responsive and a balanced diet responsive genotype .
They found that those on a diet which matched their genotype lost 2 - 3 times more weight over 12 months compared with those on the " wrong " diet .
The researchers said their findings were preliminary , and need much more confirmation before they could be used commercially .
' Intriguing ' British experts pointed out that the study had looked at a very small number of people and did not make clear what genes were involved .
Prof Christine Williams , from the University of Reading , said : " This is a very intriguing study - though very small . "
She said it would be useful to get a better understanding of what genes were involved .
" It fits pretty well with some of our own studies which show that certain genotypes are more responsive than others to certain types of fats , eg diets high in omega - 3 fatty acids , " she added .

The administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration fleshed out plans for the coming years on Thursday by announcing a lineup of new programs and those NASA centers that would be responsible for them .
President Obama ’s plan for space , announced this year , would terminate the Constellation program , which was to develop rockets to return humans to the moon .
It would focus instead on developing commercial flights of crew and cargo to the International Space Station and long - range technology to allow sustained exploration , including by humans , beyond Earth ’s orbit .
At a one - hour telephone news conference , the NASA administrator , Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr. , and his deputy , Lori Garver , took turns rattling off names and price tags of new programs at each NASA center .
Among them is an effort known as Flagship Technology Demonstrations , intended to test things like orbital fuel depots and using planetary atmospheres instead of braking rockets to land safely .
A meteorite found in Antarctica called GRA 06129 may have come from a large body that was blasted apart in a collision early in the solar system ( Image : NASA )
Two rocks found together in Antarctica are chunks of a dwarf planet that was smashed apart early in the solar system ’s history , detailed studies suggest .
Other remnants of the proto - world may still be floating around in the asteroid belt , and might be identifiable by the spectrum of the sunlight they reflect .
In the solar system ’s first few tens of millions of years , collisions between rocky objects and the decay of radioactive isotopes melted the interiors of large objects .
Magma oceans – perhaps hundreds of kilometres deep – lapped over the Moon , the Earth , and other large bodies , allowing dense material to settle towards their centres in a process called differentiation .
The two meteorite pieces , called GRA 06128 and GRA 06129 after the Graves Nunataks area of Antarctica where they were found together in 2006 , show evidence of such differentiation – which suggests they came from a massive body .

That ’s because the two objects are made mostly of a mineral called feldspar , which constitutes about 75 to 90 % of their volume .
Feldspar is even more abundant in some lunar rocks .
That is thought to be the result of crystals of feldspar solidifying from the early magma ocean on the Moon .
Because feldspar is a relatively lightweight mineral , it would have floated to the top of the magma ocean , allowing it to form a highly concentrated layer of the mineral .
The amount of feldspar in the two meteorite fragments suggests they are remnants of a very large body that differentiated in a similar way , according to Allan Treiman of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , Texas , US , who led a study of one of the fragments .
‘ Strange new world ’
Other studies of the meteorite , including one led by Richard Ash of the University of Maryland in College Park , another headed by Chip Shearer of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque , and a third helmed by Ryan Zeigler of Washington University in St Louis , Missouri , all in the US , agree that the parent body must have been massive enough to have separated into layers .
The feldspar concentrations suggest that body was probably smaller than the 3500 - kilometre - wide Moon but larger than Vesta , the third largest asteroid in the solar system at 578 kilometres across , says Treiman .
That ’s because meteorites believed to be from Vesta contain solidified lava , but not large concentrations of feldspar .
That suggests that Vesta was massive enough to melt , but not so massive that it differentiated to form a distinct layer of the mineral .
“ This is a piece of a dwarf - planet size body that apparently no longer exists , ” Treiman told New Scientist .
“ We have here a sample of a strange new world , a sample we ’ve never seen before . ”
Ancient era
Zeigler , however , says the newly studied meteorites share similarities with a class of meteorites called brachinites , whose parent body appears to have been large enough to partially melt .
“ I think we can make a case that [ the new discovery ] is from the brachinite parent body [ but ]
I do n’t think we can say it definitively yet , ” he says .
The meteorites ’ composition has led scientists to rule out the possibility that they are chips off of the Moon , Mars or Venus .
And the ratio of iron to manganese does not match that of Earth , ruling out the possibility that it is an old chunk blasted off our planet ’s surface that later returned .
By measuring the radioactive decay of elements in the meteorite , scientists led by Richard Ash have shown that the rock must have formed around 4.5 billion years ago , when Earth and the other planets were coalescing .
Studying these fragments of a now - vanished object from that era provides a rare window into the early solar system , Treiman says .
At that time , a lot of dwarf - planet size objects were flying around the solar system .
Some would have been flung out of the solar system through gravitational interactions with other objects , while others collided to help build the planets present in the solar system today .
Remnant fragments
“ We ’re looking maybe at a part of solar system history when dwarf planets were all over the place and forming the terrestrial planets , ” Treiman says .
But exactly what happened to the parent object of GRA 06128 and GRA 06129 is not known .
If it was destroyed in a collision , there may be fragments of it still out there floating around the solar system as asteroids .
Treiman says such fragments might be identified by their light spectra .
Some aspects of the meteorite , such as the high abundance of sodium in some of its minerals , hint that the parent body may have contained a lot of water , according to another study of the meteorite by Tomoko Arai of the National Institute for Polar Research in Tokyo , Japan .
She argues that sodium and water are both volatile and easily lost to space , so if this body had lots of sodium , it may have had lots of water too .
But she says the high sodium content also argues against the idea that the parent body was entirely differentiated .
Sodium in a magma ocean would evaporate into space , leaving only sodium - poor material behind to form rocks , she says .
Lava - derived rocks from the Moon , for example , are sodium - poor .
The research from the five teams was presented on Wednesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas , US .
JOHANNESBURG : Police are investigating claims that Eugene Terreblanche was killed after attempting to sexually assault two male workers on his farm .
A lawyer for one of the two suspects was quoted as saying the two accused acted in self - defence after the white supremacist plied them with alcohol and made sexual advances .
" An unarmed white man is a dead white man " ...
Eugene Terreblanche looked like a cross between Moses and Mussolini .

Puna Moroko , lawyer for 28 - year - old Chris Mahlangu , told South Africa 's Sunday Times : '' My instructions from my client are that there was some sodomy going on and it sparked the murder of Mr Terreblanche . ''
Mr Moroko added that Mr Terreblanche had plied both workers with alcohol and tried to have sex '' with one or both ' ' of them .
The theory — which has evolved since pioneering female peacekeepers started participating in U.N. missions in the Balkans in the 1990s — is that women employ distinctive social skills in a rugged macho domain .
They are being counted on to bring calm to the streets and the barracks , acting as public servants instead of invaders .
“ When female soldiers are present , the situation is closer to real life , and as a result the men tend to behave , ” said Gerard J. DeGroot , a history professor at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who has written books about women in the military .
“ Any conflict where you have an all - male army , it ’s like a holiday from reality .
If you inject women into that situation , they do have a civilizing effect . ”
As modern peacekeeping has evolved into nation building , the number of female police officers in U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world has doubled during the past five years to 833 , or more than 6 percent of a force of 12,867 .
Nigeria and India are top contributors to a total that is still far below the international goal of 20 percent .
In some missions — notably Darfur and Liberia — women are edging closer : Women account for 14 percent of the 1,354 police peacekeepers in Liberia .
Liberia — a West African country created in 1847 to settle freed American slaves — is something of a modern laboratory for the rise of women making peace .
Women are marching in foot patrols ; the head of the U.N. mission , Ellen Margrethe Loj of Denmark , is a woman ; and the Liberian president , Mrs. Sirleaf , is the first woman elected as an African head of state , in 2005 .
Mrs. Sirleaf — whose nickname is “ Iron Lady ” — is particularly blunt about the role of women in the recovery of her fragile country , which was battered by 14 years of civil war that left about 200,000 people dead and survivors haunted by torture , systematic rapes and the exploitation of drug - addicted boy soldiers .

Abstract
Decision makers do not make choices in a vacuum .
They make them in an environment where many features , noticed and unnoticed , can influence their decisions .
The person who creates that environment is , in our terminology , a choice architect .
In this paper we analyze some of the tools that are available to choice architects .
Our goal is to show how choice architecture can be used to help nudge people to make better choices ( as judged by themselves ) without forcing certain outcomes upon anyone , a philosophy we call libertarian paternalism .
The tools we highlight are : defaults , expecting error , understanding mappings , giving feedback , structuring complex choices , and creating incentives .
( CNN ) --
Giant rocks came tumbling down a snowy Colorado mountainside early Monday , punching gaping holes in the interstate below , the Colorado Department of Transportation said .
The rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halted travel on Interstate 70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero , about 18 miles east , according to the department .
Glenwood Springs is about 120 miles west of Denver .
It is unclear when construction crews will complete enough work to open at least part of the roadway .
About 20 boulders struck the interstate shortly after midnight , the transportation department said .
They ranged from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter , with the largest weighing an estimated 66 tons , the department said on its Web site .
About eight holes or dips were left on the interstate .
Road underwiring was exposed and rock crumbles surrounded the damage , the department said .
The largest hole measured 20 feet by 10 feet -- bigger than a full - size SUV .
Rocks were scattered over a 100 - yard stretch of the road .
A steel guard rail and median barrier were also damaged .
The damage resembles a major rock slide in the area back in 2004 , the department said .
Cocktail of five vitamins may give cancer patients an extra two years
Cancer patients with terminal disease who take a daily cocktail of vitamins could extend their lives by two years or even longer , claim researchers .
Three out of four in a pilot study survived an average of five months longer than the expected one year , and some were still alive three years after treatment started .
Dr Bob Lister , co-author of the study by British and Danish researchers , said the results were similar to the survival gains from new drugs and in some cases better .
Three out of four cancer patients survived an average of five months longer after taking the cocktail of vitamins
But the important difference was there were no side effects reported by patients taking vitamins , he said .
Dr Lister , chairman of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition at London Metropolitan University , said : ' We believe these results are meaningful and justify trying to get backing for a proper clinical trial .
' People with cancer are constantly asking what can we do , not necessarily to beat the cancer but to have a better quality of life whatever the length of survival .
' Most importantly , taking these supplements is extremely safe , and there were no adverse reactions among the patients . '
The study followed patients suffering from breast , lung , brain , colon and other forms of cancer in Denmark between 1990 and 1999 who continued taking conventional cancer medication .
During the nine - year period , the patients were treated with coenzyme Q10 - a vitamin - like compound - essential for producing energy made naturally in the body - and six other antioxidants including vitamins A , C and E , selenium , folic acid , and beta carotene ( which was not given to lung cancer patients for safety reasons ) .
The patients were predicted to live for an average of 12 months , but 76 per cent lived an average of five months longer .
The doses of the supplements , supplied by manufacturers Pharma Nord , were large but were within recommended safety limits , said Dr Lister .
In addition , patients received small amounts of other nutrients including fish oil and B vitamins .
The findings are published in the Journal of International Medical Research .
However Dr Joanna Owens of Cancer Research UK said : ' This very small study tells us nothing new about supplements and cancer .
' All the patients in this study took the supplements so it is impossible to judge if they had any effect .
' It is no surprise that in a group of people with different types of cancer , some survived for longer than might have been expected , while others sadly did not .
' As yet , there is not enough evidence to know whether supplements are helpful or harmful during cancer treatment .
' We know that high doses of some supplements can increase the risk of cancer and it's possible that high doses of antioxidants can make treatment less effective .
' Until we know for sure , our advice is to try to get the vitamins you need through a balanced and varied diet rather than through vitamin supplements . '

Ohio police found their jobs made a little bit easier Monday after a chase ended with a suspect unwittingly fleeing straight into a prison .
Ricky Flowers , 20 , was stopped by police while driving with a suspended license , but fled the scene and led officers on a high - speed car chase through the Cleveland area , Garfield Heights Police Department told Fox 8 News .
Flowers abandoned the vehicle , took off on foot and scaled a 30 - foot fence to seek refuge on the other side -- only to realize he had landed directly in the yard of a women 's prison , police told the station .
Police used stun guns to arrest three passengers who also fled from the car , the station reported .

The " Waterloo " Strategy
Let 's go back for a moment to the original promise DeMint made in July of 2009 that the August recess would be the death of health care legislation and a crushing blow to the new President 's power and agenda :
I can almost guarantee you this thing wo n't pass before August , and if we can hold it back until we go home for a month 's break in August , " members of Congress will hear from " outraged " constituents , South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said on the call , which was organized by the group Conservatives for Patients Rights .
" Senators and Congressmen will come back in September afraid to vote against the American people , " DeMint predicted , adding that " this health care issue Is D - Day for freedom in America . "
" If we ’re able to stop Obama on this it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him , " he said .
The stated strategy was to scare the living daylights out of enough Senators and Representatives that they returned to Washington and abandoned any effort to change the status quo .
It is n't hard to kill health reform - it 's hard to pass it .
After all , no President in a century of trying had been able to move a comprehensive reform bill successfully through Congress .
The last effort died 15 years ago without even getting a floor vote in either chamber .
So a whole lot of noise in home districts should have been enough to do the trick , especially with a tough economy making voters nervous and a midterm election to worry about .
But that is n't what happened .
Reform came back from the dead , again and again .
August was not the Waterloo - sized defeat they were looking for - instead it was part of a long difficult war that is finally coming to a close with victory in sight for the Democrats .
There were several turning points , several opportunities to shut it down , but all of them have so far failed to break us .
How Reform Survived Again and Again
First in August , the The News Big Media Wo n't Report was how supporters totally outhustled opponents on the ground , outnumbering them at townhalls and staging rallies in major cities across the country .
OFA posted huge numbers , as did allies like HCAN , labor unions , Doctors for America , and many other offline organizations .
Move - On and FDL also sent pro-reform folks out to the townhalls .
In most places , members of Congress saw tea party protestors met by a much larger number of their constituents actively supporting the most liberal versions of reform .
And then in September the President gave a major address calling for Congress to move forward , to deal with the untenable status quo that leaves tens of millions without insurance , and hundreds of millions facing rising costs , consumer abuses , and the knowledge that if they lose their jobs they may wind up uninsured .
The House shut out the tea party callers screaming in their ear , OFA made 300,000 calls on October 20 , many other organizations continued to call , write and advocate , and in early November the House passed its bill .
The Senate side was an ugly process that produced a messy result and some painful losses for progressives , resulting in many myths and misconceptions about the good pieces of that bill .
It was n't pretty but by Christmas we had two successful floor votes despite a massive campaign to defeat reform altogether .
And then came January , Scott Brown and we came perilously close to losing everything .
Suddenly everyone was afraid to close the deal , but a broad coalition of voices demanded they " pass the damn bill , " Benen and Plouffe told them to buck up , and the President stepped into the vacuum .
Less than 72 hours after Massachusetts he was out at a town hall event saying he would not quit on reform .
He could have backed off or scaled back but he tripled down instead - from the State of the Union to the healthcare summit to a sustained attack on rising insurance premiums .
A couple of bloggers built a coalition including Move - On and HCAN and generated a petition drive of over 1 million in a single day .
Waterloo staved off yet again .
One of the longstanding myths of the political trajectory of reform is that the tea party had a huge victory in August against the bill and that Democrats have little success to show for their year - long legislative effort .
In fact , the tea party has failed to reach its goal so far .
They have failed to kill the bill .
Certainly they did some damage .
They made Democrats in more conservative districts nervous , which probably had an effect on how liberal the final packages looked in the House and Senate .
But no one on the right is walking away celebrating Medicaid expansion to 133 % instead of 150 % of the poverty level .
The tea party activists are n't thinking " Thank God we made them settle for just a highly regulated exchange that will make insurance better and cheaper for tens of millions of Americans - we really had a big win there keeping out the public option . "
Despite the tea party protests , 8 times as many industry lobbyists as members of Congress , and virtually unanimous Republican opposition , the Democrats are on the verge of a permanent seismic shift in the American political culture .
Waterloo for Conservatism
One of the biggest reasons I supported Barack Obama early on was because of a signature line in his campaign speeches , about changing the view Americans have of government , a powerful call to reclaim activist government : " I am my brother 's keeper , I am my sister 's keeper . "
He frequently said that this value of shared responsibility for each other " must express itself through our government . "
Beginning with the Reagan administration we have seen a three - decade long assault on this value .
For so long progressive change has been held back by the myth that Americans wo n't support activist government and that it is risky politics to even try for it .
Even in the depths of economic catastrophe , Republicans resisted government stimulus that could help .
Despite the clear market failure that is health insurance in the United States , the Party of No fears any solution that might make Americans question their message that government is always the enemy of the people .
That might make Americans remember that it's our government and it is there to help us when we need it .
This legislation , for all its limitations , represents the first time the federal government has said every American - sick or healthy , lucky or unlucky -- deserves access to affordable health insurance .
We owe it to each other .
I may be young and healthy and have insurance right now , but that can and will change .
And many of my fellow Americans are not so lucky .
The Democratic plan says we are , all of us , " my brother 's / sister 's keeper . "
The Republican " plan " simply reinforces the divide between the healthy and the sick , the lucky and the unlucky , and says its up to every individual to take care of themselves .
Jon Chait recently put it this way :
What separates the two parties is not how far to go , but in which direction to go .
The divide is simple .
Democrats propose to shift resources from the rich and the healthy to the poor and the sick .
Republicans want to do just the opposite .
Republican health care plans reflect the party ’s increasingly widespread belief that good health , like other forms of prosperity , is a matter of personal responsibility .
Democratic plans to help the sick at the expense of the healthy therefore amount to socialism .
This is a no-hold - barred fight over two radically different philosophies .
Chris Bowers has been writing about all the elements of reform that reflect progressive advocacy and organizing , and it is a good list .
But understanding this as a progressive win over a regressive philosophy goes beyond even the specific elements of the legislation .
It 's the very idea of the government addressing reform comprehensively with such a big package and such generous funding .
Progressives must win this fight , because it is so critical to the future direction of the Democratic Party and its agenda .
As Steve Benen says
This is why Democrats exist . . . . comprehensive health care reform . . . is at the core of the party 's platform , and has been the Democrats ' raison d'etre for decades .
It is , to a very real extent , precisely why the party exists .
. . . if the party backs off its most important issue , on the eve of a transformative victory , its entire agenda is suspect .
That 's why losing this is a potential Waterloo - level defeat .
Imagine walking away from all that we have now on the table , and expecting to get Congress to again tackle a comprehensive bill with a $ 900 billion level authorization any time soon .
On the other hand , signing the current Senate bill into law with the reconciliation fixes will be a big win for the Democrats and a devastating blow to the Republicans .
That 's why the GOP has fought this from Day 1 , and is concern trolling this final vote as hard as it can .
Passing reform will be Waterloo several times over for the Republican governing philosophy of " going it alone , " for their long term goal of dividing Americans from their government , and for their prospects of a big win in November .
How can we resist such an opportunity - especially with the added delightful bonus of driving Rush Limbaugh to leave the country ?
Democrats will have delivered a tangible , popular political initiative ( the elements of the current reform bill poll extremely well and that overall popularity is rising ) , triumphed over adversity to pull it off , and taken a critical step toward boosting turnout for the party in November .
OFA is upping the ante , by pledging over 9 million hours from their volunteer base for members of Congress who support reform .
From the group that pulled off 1000 phonebanks and 2 million calls for Coakley in a matter of days , having this army put to work for you should be appealing to any Democrat running for re-election this fall .
OFA volunteers are already working for two strong health care supporters facing tough races this fall : Senator Michael Bennet in Colorado and Congressman Tom Perriello in Virginia .
And around the country state staff and volunteer Community Organizers are calling people who signed up to take the pledge and talking to them about how they can take action .
( Click here to take the pledge . )
So the choice is clear - pass healthcare reform and strike a serious blow to three decades of troubling conservative political philosophy , while helping Democrats in tough races this fall .
Not to mention deal a major defeat to a year - long campaign of lies and obstruction and show that the tea party can't kill a core Democratic priority .
And if that 's not incentive enough , there 's always making Rush Limbaugh leave the country .
Now that 's what I call Waterloo .
If you have n't called or emailed or tweeted your Representative and Senators yet , what are you waiting for ?
OFA HEALTHCARE ACTION CENTER
UPDATES : Some truly amazing comments , thank you .
A number of folks have pointed out that we should n't be celebrating anything until this is done and that we have a lot of work to do .
Absolutely right .
This is n't an effort to " declare victory " as much as an effort to talk about what victory would mean and how important it is .
And also a reminder that a lot of people have fought really hard to get this far , overcoming tremendous obstacles , and so we can bring this home if we all step up to the plate .
As for the video clip , well , I just thought it was a hoot .
And sometimes we need a little fun to keep us going .
Finally , if you have n't gotten an email in your inbox from David Plouffe yet today , check out the new OFA Final March campaign designed to help push this over the line .
It took seven years , three trillion dollars and a million corpses , but America has finally transformed Iraq from a cruel dictatorship ruled by torture and ethnic cleansing into a cruel dictatorship ruled by torture and ethnic cleansing where select survivors are free to vote for the torturer of their choice .
And Jesus said " It is accomplished !
" Is Iraq a democracy ?
Of course not .
But is it close to becoming a democracy ?
Ha ha , no .
But it certainly does resemble , from a distance , when we squint , the vague shape of a notion of the idea of something that contains one particular rote procedural aspect of democracy - albeit one that happens to be attached to a military dictatorship .
And certainly that must be worth something .
And for the sake of argument , let 's say it 's worth , oh , I do n't know , everyone America has killed , bombed , starved , maimed and tortured in Iraq over the past two decades .
Because if it's not worth that , then that would mean the occupation of Iraq has not been a selfless nation - building project generously extended from the richest country in the world to one of the poorest , but a sustained and psychotic act of mass murder , a massive , nationwide industrial slaughter that deserves its place among history 's great atrocities .
And if that 's the case , we might find , on closer inspection , more and more American entries in those ranks , from Iraq to Nicaragua to Chile to Vietnam to Korea to Japan to the Philippines to the Trail of Tears .
And that would make the United States not an enormous force for good in the world but a monster of world - historical proportions , our leaders gore - guzzling psychopaths who wipe the blood from their chins just long enough to collect the occasional Nobel Prize , and ourselves their numbed , acquiescent followers .
And we know that can't be the case , because look at all the good we 're doing in Afghanistan .

Analysis
The Supreme Court on Tuesday seemed poised to require state and local governments to obey the Second Amendment guarantee of a personal right to a gun , but with perhaps considerable authority to regulate that right .
The dominant sentiment on the Court was to extend the Amendment beyond the federal level , based on the 14th Amendment ’s guarantee of “ due process , ” since doing so through another part of the 14th Amendment would raise too many questions about what other rights might emerge .
When the Justices cast their first vote after starting later this week to discuss where to go from here , it appeared that the focus of debate will be how extensive a “ right to keep and bear arms ” should be spelled out : would it be only some “ core right ” to have a gun for personal safety , or would it include every variation of that right that could emerge in the future as courts decide specific cases ?
The liberal wing of the Court appeared to be making a determined effort to hold the expanded Amendment in check , but even the conservatives open to applying the Second Amendment to states , counties and cities seemed ready to concede some — but perhaps fewer — limitations .
The eagerly awaited oral argument in McDonald , et al. , v. Chicago , et al. ( 08 - 1521 ) found all members of the Court actively involved except the usually silent Justice Clarence Thomas .
And , while no one said that the issue of “ incorporating ” the Second Amendment into the 14th Amendment had already been decided before the argument had even begun , the clear impression was that the Court majority was at least sentimentally in favor of that , with only the dimensions of the expansion to be worked out in this case and in a string of likely precedents coming as time went on .
An attempt by an attorney for the cities of Chicago and Oak Park , Ill. , defending local bans on handguns in those communities , to prevent any application of the constitutional gun right to states , counties and cities looked forlorn and even doomed .
The nub of that argument by James A. Feldman of Washington was that , unlike other constitutional rights that the Court has extended to the state and local level , the right to a gun recognized by the Court two years ago in District of Columbia v.
Heller pitted the threat that guns pose to human lives against a constitutional right , so the balance should be struck differently .
So far as the hearing Tuesday showed , Justice Stephen G. Breyer was the only member of the Court attracted to that approach .
Justice Breyer drew only thinly veiled ridicule from conservatives on the Court when he suggested that there be a constitutional “ chart ” drawn up to rank the higher and lower priorities of rights that would be protected against state and local infringement — perhaps the highest rank safeguarding the right to have a gun in community self - defense ( as with a “ militia ” ) but with a decidedly lower rank for a right to “ shoot burglars . ”
While that idea drew no support , the notion that the Second Amendment right restricting state and local gun laws would not be an absolute right had significant appeal , it appeared .
The first argument to collapse as the hearing unfolded was the plea by the lawyer for gun rights advocates , Alan Gura of Alexandria , Virginia , that the Court should “ incorporate ” the Second Amendment into the 14th Amendment through the “ privileges or immunities ” clause .
In the first comment from the bench after Gura had barely opened , Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , noted that the Court had essentially scuttled that argument with its ruling in the SlaughterHouse Cases in 1873 .
And within a few minutes , Justice Antonin Scalia — the author of the Heller opinion and the Court ’s most fervent gun enthusiast — was sarcastically dismissing the “ privileges or immunities ” argument .
“ Why , ” Scalia asked Gura , “ are you asking us to overrule 140 years of prior law …. unless you are bucking for a place on some law school faculty . ”
The Justice said the “ privileges or immunities ” argument was “ the darling of the professorate ” but wondered why Gura would “ undertake that burden . ”
And Scalia noted that the “ due process ” clause — an open - ended provision that he has strongly attacked on other occasions– was available as the vehicle for incorporation , and added : “ Even I have acquiesced in that . ”
Gura somewhat meekly said “ we would be extremely happy : ” if the Court used the “ due process ” clause to extend the Second Amendment ’s reach .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , one of the dissenters in Heller , then moved in to press Gura on just what “ unenumerated rights ” would be protected if the Court were to revive the “ privileges or immunities ” clause .
It was a theme that would recur often thereafter , solidifying the appearance that the argument had virtually no chance of succeeding .
( In fact , when Gura near the end of the argument returned to the podium for his rebuttal , his time was used up by Justices Ginsburg and Anthony M. Kennedy exploring what other rights might come into being if the Court gave new life to the “ privileges or immunities ” clause .
He responded that he could not provide a full list , to which Justice Scalia retorted : “ Doesn ’ t that trouble you ? ”
It was obvious that it troubled the Court . )
When Gura ’s argument moved on to the general question of “ incorporation ” of the Second Amendment , Justice John Paul Stevens explored whether such an extension would “ apply to all of the Second Amendment ” — including any court interpretations that ensued — or only “ a homeowner ’s right to protect against intruders in the home ” — the specific right that Heller recognized .
Gura responded that the Second Amendment “ was not so limited . ”
Stevens then asked whether the right would include “ a right to parade around in the streets with a gun . ”
Gura said that the states and cities would have to obey a right that was fully equal to all rights embraced by the right to keep and bear arms .
Justice Kennedy soon joined in that exchange , and asked whether “ incorporation ” would embrace “ all of the refinements ” that courts would make in interpreting the right , or “ just the core of the right . ”
Gura left no doubt that gun rights advocates were seeking the full panoply of whatever gun rights the Amendment were found to cover .
The remainder of Gura ’s time was spent amid an exchange between Breyer and Scalia over whether courts should give the Second Amendment lesser scope based on statistics about the social cost that would result in people killed from others ’ use of gun rights .
Gura was essentially a bystander as the two Justices jousted over that issue .
The Court then got the focus that a majority seemed to be hoping for : a full - scale plea , by former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement , to use the “ due process clause ” as the vehicle for extending gun rights to the state and local level .
And it was during Clement ’s time at the podium that the Court ’s liberal bloc began making a case — which Clement essentially resisted — to limit the “ incorporated ” right to , at most , some core guarantee , without all of the variations that would later develop .
Clement noted that there were “ not a lot ” of variations of the gun right yet , since Heller was the only precedent so far , and that was limited to gun rights for self - defense in the home .
Clement , however , said that the Court should allow a “ carryover ” into the 14th Amendment of all of the jurisprudence that develops on the Second Amendment ’s scope .
There should not be a Second Amendment right and then a mere “ shadow ” of it that applied to state and local government , he argued .
He did concede , though , that constitutional gun rights might be allowed to develop differently at the state and local level than at the federal level .
But that , he said , is different from creating only a “ shadow ” right applied to state and local laws .
The Court ’s strong leanings in the case became even more evident during questioning of Feldman , the lawyer for the two cities involved in the case .
Although he absolutely needs the vote of Justice Kennedy if his plea is to prevail , he almost immediately frustrated Kennedy by arguing that gun rights were not an essential attribute of “ ordered liberty , ” thus questioning whether such rights qualify as fundamental .
If they are not , Kennedy shot back , then the Heller decision was wrongly decided .
And Chief Justice Roberts told Feldman that there was no way to read the Heller opinion to make the Second Amendment seem a less important right .
Tellingly , however , the Chief Justice commented that “ we have n’t said anything about what the content of the Second Amendment is , ” so that , over time , it may develop that state and local governments may well be allowed to impose restrictions , such as bans on carrying concealed weapons .
And Scalia reminded Feldman that the Court in the Heller decision had left room for some regulation of guns even though the Second Amendment now embraced a personal right to have a gun .
Kennedy also noted that “ there are provisions of the Constitution ” that allow states to have “ significant latitude ” in regulating what those provisions seek to protect .
Feldman made no headway with an argument that state and local political processes should be left to develop gun control policy , unimpeded by the Second Amendment or its equivalent .
Some cities , he said , might conclude that “ a ban on handguns is the best way to protect people , ” and yet Heller says that the Second Amendment forbids such a ban .
That was , in essence , a total rejection of the idea of “ incorporation , ” and it was by then more than evident that there was no majority for such a rejection .
He also scored no points with a complaint that “ incorporation ” of the Second Amendment would go a long way toward establishing a national constitutional right of “ self - defense , ” which he said the Court has never mandated and should not now .
For 200 years , he said , it has been up to state and local government to sort out when self - defense was justified .
No member of the Court seemed persuaded that that was now at stake in the Second Amendment context .
Hundreds of butterflies , beetles and dragonflies are at risk of extinction across Europe with almost one - third of 435 butterfly species in decline , scientists have warned .
The loss of habitat caused by intensive farming , climate change , forest fires and the expansion of tourism is threatening with extinction 14 % of dragonflies , 11 % of saproxylic beetles and 9 % of butterflies within Europe , according to the European red list report for the European commission .
" When talking about threatened species , people tend to think of larger , more charismatic creatures such as pandas or tigers , but we must n't forget that the small species on our planet are just as important , " said Jane Smart of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , the conservation group which produced the report .
" Butterflies , for instance , play a hugely pivotal role as pollinators in the ecosystems in which they live . "
Many of the endangered insect species live in southern Europe where increasingly hot , dry summers combined with irrigation and water extraction is causing wetland habitats to dry up .
The Madeiran large white butterfly is listed as critically endangered on the red list , which reviews the status of 6,000 European species including mammals , reptiles and plants .
But the butterfly may already be extinct because it has not been seen on the island of Madeira for 20 years .
The Macedonian grayling butterfly is critically endangered because quarrying is reducing its habitat while other endangered species include the Danube clouded yellow , the violet copper and the Canary Islands large white .
Only 4 % of Europe 's butterfly species , which include 142 unique to the continent , are increasing in number .
Martin Warren , co-author of the butterfly section of the report and chief executive of UK charity , Butterfly Conservation , said the insects were being hit by the loss of grassland habitats due to both intensification of agriculture and recent abandonment of traditional farming land in Europe .
" In the 1950s and 60s we had massive losses of habitat in the UK , and it is still going on to a lesser extent , but in Europe big changes have been going on in the last five to 10 years , " said Warren .
We lost a lot of our flower - rich meadows in the 50s and 60s , while they are losing theirs at a rate of knots now . "
The large blue butterfly , a rare conservation success after it was reintroduced in Devon and Somerset after it became extinct in the UK in 1979 , is endangered throughout Europe , declining in every country where it occurs apart from the UK .
Other struggling species , such as the Duke of Burgundy and the Lulworth skipper , which both suffered their worst ever year in the UK last summer , are in decline in many countries across the continent .
Intensification of agriculture is destroying habitat in some areas , while flower and insect - rich pastures in many mountain regions in the Alps and Pyrenees are being abandoned and falling into a poor condition because livestock farming is not financially viable .
Warren called for more support for traditional farming systems to help insects such as butterflies , which he said were very good indicators of changes to the environment .
Saproxylic beetles , which depend on decaying wood in forests and play a crucial role in recycling nutrients , were assessed for the first time on the red list .
Logging , changing woodland management practices and a declining number of mature trees are threatening species such as the violet click beetle .
Almost 11 % , 46 of 431 species studied , are at risk of being lost to Europe and 7 % are threatened with global extinction .
A further 13 % are listed as " near threatened " in Europe .
Almost a quarter of 137 dragonfly species assessed , including 18 species not found anywhere else in the world , were found to be at risk of extinction or " near threatened " .
Last year , a new dragonfly centre opened in the UK in a bid to reverse a trend of decline that has seen one - third of British species facing extinction .
Let ’s be honest about America ’s wars and the men ( overwhelmingly ) and women who have fought them .

Mr Hu said a revaluation would not solve US unemployment Chinese President Hu Jintao has resisted pressure from President Obama to raise the value of the Chinese yuan .
He told Mr Obama that it would " neither balance Sino - US trade nor solve the [ US ] unemployment problem " , Chinese official news agency Xinhua reported .
However , Mr Hu indicated that the Chinese were preparing to change their policy on the yuan in their own time .
The Chinese and US presidents were meeting at the sidelines of a 47 - nation nuclear summit in Washington DC .
According to Xinhua , Mr Hu said that detailed measures for reform should be considered in the context of the world 's economic situation , as well as China's .
China News Service reported that Hu said China " is firmly committed to the direction of reforming the ... exchange rate regime .
This is based on the needs of China 's own economic development . "
However , he added that " outside pressures will not advance [ reform ] " .
For his part , Mr Obama called on his counterpart to switch to a more " market oriented " exchange rate , according to senior White House official Jeff Bader .
China has pegged its currency to the dollar since 2008 in response to market volatility during and after the financial crisis .
Market reaction to the comments was fairly muted , but seemed to interpret Mr Hu's comments as reducing the immediate prospects of any rise in the yuan 's value .
Other Asian currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and Korean won , lost between 0.5 % to 1 % against the dollar in early trading , ending strong rallies recorded during the past two months .
Markets had previously been speculating that if the yuan were allowed to appreciate , this would lead to similar rises in the currencies of other Asian countries that compete with China for exports to the US and Europe .
Trade sanctions
The meeting follows widespread speculation over the possibility of a trade war this year between the two nations .
The US has said China keeps the yuan artificially low , hurting the US economy Many economists , including Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman , have criticised the Chinese for pegging their currency to the dollar .
They say this gives the Chinese an unfair advantage , by making Chinese exports artificially cheap , and this acts as a drag on the rest of the world economy .
The meeting between the two presidents follows a hasty visit to China by US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on 8 April , and a decision on 3 April to postpone an important Treasury report .
That report , which was due to be delivered this month to Congress , would have stated whether the Treasury Department deemed China to be a " currency manipulator " .
This would have opened the way for Congress to impose trade sanctions on China , a move advocated by many congressmen as well as Mr Krugman .
Meanwhile , the Chinese commerce ministry has introduced a duty of up to 64.8 % on imports of US electrical steel , and 24 % on those from Russia , accusing the two countries of selling the steel at abnormally low prices .
The move follows a decision by the US government to impose an import tax on Chinese pipes .

By Simon Johnson : link to NPR radio interview ( and book excerpt ) on how 13 Bankers got their hands on so much political and economic power – and why this spells serious danger for the rest of us .
Against all the odds , a glimmer of hope for real financial reform begins to shine through .
It ’s not that anything definite has happened – in fact most of the recent Senate details are not encouraging – but rather that the broader political calculus has shifted in the right direction .
Instead of seeing the big banks as inviolable , top people in Obama administration are beginning to see the advantage of taking them on – at least on the issue of consumer protection .
Even Tim Geithner derided the banks recently as ,
“ those who told us all they were the masters of noble financial innovation and sophisticated risk management . ”
In part this is window dressing .
But in part it recognizes political opportunity – the big banks are unpopular because they remain completely unreformed and unrepentant .
And in part it responds to a very real danger – Senator Dodd ’s bill is so obviously weak on “ too big to fail ” issues that it will be hard to paint its opponents as friends of big banks .
Senator Richard Shelby knows this and is taking the offensive .
The administration can convert an easy win into an own goal if it fails to toughen substantially Senator Dodd ’s bill .
Fortunately , there is an easy way to address this issue .
Recall the political history of financial reform during the Obama administration .
The economic team ( Tim Geithner and Larry Summers ) felt that no substantive change in the structure and incentives for deeply troubled parts of the financial system was necessary or even possible during the height of crisis .
Consequently , they provided unlimited financial support to the country ’s largest banks – communicated by the “ stress tests ” – with no conditions , and they also proposed an initial set of legislative changes that was slight .
Quite quickly , however , this strategy ran into trouble – because the largest banks immediately and demonstrably went back to their uncontrolled risk - taking ways , now based on obvious government guarantees .
The lack of careful management within these banks is not an accident – it ’s very much part of the design , which enables large bonuses to be paid at all levels ; the point is not that individuals intentionally engender crisis every year , but the system runs through a loop that implies regular ( and , in our view , increasing ) government support over time .
Too Big To Fail pays well ; for the banks it is someone else ’s problem to fix , and for policymakers the temptation is to kick all available cans down the road .
From summer 2009 , leading banks also exuded arrogance – insulting the president and generally carrying on in a high and mighty fashion .
The abuse of power by our ever more powerful bankers became increasingly obvious – as did their lobbying ( Neal Wolin , Deputy Treasury Secretary , said this week that “ big banks and Wall Street financial firms ” spend $ 1.4 million per day on “ lobbying and campaign contributions ” ; and “ there are four financial lobbyists for every member of Congress ” ; good speech ) .
With perfect timing during the fall , in stepped Paul Volcker .
Not someone ever accused of being a populist – let alone carrying a pitchfork – he pointed out , simply and forcefully ( and publicly ) , that our biggest banks were out of control and must be reined in .
With the political side of the White House increasingly anxious about the electoral effects of pandering to an apparent financial oligarchy , Volcker was able to persuade the president to adopt the Volcker Rules : a limit on the risk - taking by big banks and an effective cap on their size .
Unfortunately , the specifics of the Volcker Rules were not well thought through by Treasury and their cause was hardly championed with force .
The Capitol Hill lobbying machine took over and mush duly appeared from Senator Dodd ’s committee on the issue of systemic risk .
But Paul Volcker is not finished , not by a long way .
Someone just needs to convince President Obama to call Senator Dodd ( or meet again with Dodd and Barney Frank ) , to ask – politely but firmly – that the Volcker size cap on big banks be legislated , and actually tightened relative to the January proposal .
The House already has the Kanjorski amendment , which is a step in the right direction .
On Tuesday , Volcker will go public again .
But that ’s not the most important conversation .
His public appearance is just a way to communicate more directly with the political side of the White House .
Volcker ’s point is simple .
Without the Volcker Rules , the administration would be in much more difficulty than it is now ; these proposals really helped to diffuse pressure .
Now it ’s time to make the Rules real – and this requires significantly reducing the size of our largest banks .
Phase the rules in , as proposed in January , and there is no reason to think this will constrain our recovery .
Chris Dodd can start this ball rolling and Barney Frank would back him up .
The consensus is ready to move .
This is such an easy and obvious political win .
Treasury and the White House economic team can be brought onside by being allowed to claim this was their idea all along – or they can say something along the lines of “ the facts changed , so we changed our opinions ” .
But if Paul Volcker does n’t tell the president , who will ?
[ The Gender Gap originally debuted in Issue 204 of Game Informer .
Here we provide the original article with expanded developer commentary . ]
Ask gamers who their favorite video game heroine is , and a few names will likely garner the majority of the vote .
Samus Aran , Lara Croft , and Joanna Dark are three early icons whose rareness catapulted them to stardom and helped keep their respective franchises afloat for more than a decade .
Who could forget the surprise when Metroid ’s protagonist removed her helmet to reveal long locks ?
Players never looked at masked heroes the same again .
The exploits of cyber “ it - girl ” of the late ‘ 90s , Lady Lara Croft , became a multi-million dollar brand that spawned film adaptations , a comic run , and endorsements deals for everything from energy drinks to luxury cars .
With such prominent female leads appearing in the early stages of the interactive entertainment phenomenon , the video games industry seemed well on its way to creating abundant gender diversity .
But since Croft 's glory days , progress has seemingly halted .
Sure , recent years have given us the occasional female leads in blockbusters like Uncharted 2 and critical darlings like Beyond Good and Evil , Mirror 's Edge and Bayonetta , but in general the fairer sex has been all but M.I.A. in action titles .
Some games even neglect to include a female character when allowing players to choose among multiple protagonists .
While some genres like role - playing and fighting games generally offer a level playing field , others seem to be treading water .
We chatted about the gender selection process with members of several prominent development studios and learned that the decision between XX and XY is n’t a frivolous one .
Demographics , cultural norms , technical constraints , and more must be considered .
So when narrative , setting , or historical context does n’t dictate the gender of a character , why are females noticeably absent from the action ?
Read on to find out .
The Numbers Game
First and foremost , numbers matter .
Perhaps the most influential factor in regards to core design decisions is player demographic .
An NPD survey detailed a five percent increase in female console gamers ( 23 percent to 28 percent ) between June 2008 and 2009 .
A similar Nielsen Company study showed that females 25 and older now make up the largest segment of PC gamers – holding strong at 46.2 percent .
The number of female gamers is obviously growing , especially in relation to specific platforms and genres .
This being said , female gamers are still the minority , even if not to the grossly overestimated degree perceived .
If there is any truth to the notion that individuals identify closer to characters of their own gender , then it ’s somewhat expected that we see a disproportionate ratio of males to females .
“ The game industry is constantly collecting information about who is buying games , and what types of games they ’re buying the most of , ” explains Jennifer Wildes , art director at Gearbox Software .
“ If these statistics suggest that your game will sell more copies within your demographic if the majority of the player characters are big hulking males , then it ’s obviously a bit risky to decide they should all be female instead . ”
Wildes also points out that while modern games may not have a new female protagonist on the level of Samus or Lara Croft , progress is being made .
“ It ’s important to note that only a few years ago , the male to female [ character ] ratio in these types of games was four to zero .
We may be moving slowly , but we are getting there . ”
Girls With Guns
The fact is gender roles still heavily influence decisions in regards to character development .
While games that draw from historical events or modern day military shooters have leeway because their goal is to reflect contemporary culture ( you ’re off the hook , Call of Duty ) , the trend bleeds heavily over the majority of other action titles .
Some developers credit the lack of female Special Forces characters in games to the deficiency of press or awareness about them in the real world .
“ Perhaps the perception about war and combat is that there are seldom ever women in the thick of it , even though there are many strong women who choose to serve their country on a regular basis , ” muses Cliff Bleszinski , design director at Epic Games .
“ It ’s kind of sad that the two female soldiers who received the most memorable public attention in the last 10 years are Jessica Lynch , who was known for being ‘ rescued ’ like a princess , and Lynndie England for her involvement in Abu Ghraib .
It would be nice to call out some women who perform heroic actions and kick ass in the field once in a while .
I ’m sure they ’re out there ! ”
While public perception may dictate character gender in games rooted in reality , even titles that exist in new fictions devoid of cultural constraints struggle with implementing the female gender as a protagonist .
It turns out that one of our favorite leading ladies from last year , Lilith from Gearbox ’s Borderlands , was almost a man .
Borderlands ' four protagonists were evolving throughout the entire production process .
Gearbox tweaked each of them until they felt right .
“ Initially all four player characters were male , and the character who eventually became the Siren started life off as a dry , pompous , genius sort named the Scientist , ” recalls Wildes .
The Scientist ’s skill set was similar to that of Lilith ’s , but the ability combined with a dry , narcissistic personality resulted in a character that no one liked .
A simple gender swap was the remedy .
“ The character became a bit more interesting when he was changed to a female , ” she explains .
“ What ’s better than a powerful , humorless , super - genius chick ?
Turns out : a powerful , mostly unstable one – they ’re infinitely more fun to hang out with .
Who knew ? ”

Some developers struggle with this notion less than others and have excelled at including women in their action - centric games .
BioWare , known for their extensive character customization tools , managed to create an iconic figurehead for their Mass Effect franchise via the male Commander Shepard , all the while allowing the player to dictate character gender in game .
Who says you can't have it both ways ?
Halo architect Bungie has also been a leader , making a point to include female combatants in their games and expanded lore .
Halo 3 multiplayer offers players a chance to choose their Spartan ’s gender , ( an appreciated gesture , even if the only difference is the pitch of voice ) and Bungie allows gamers to unlock Veronica Dare , a female intelligence officer , to use in Halo 3 : ODST ’s Firefight mode .
The Halo novels and other ancillary products have also been progressive at including female combatants .
“ At Bungie , we ’re all fans of great sci-fi war stories such as Joe Haldeman ’s Forever War and Heinlein ’s Starship Troopers , ” says Joseph Staten , writer and creative director of Halo 3 : ODST .
“ These stories ( as well as many others in the genre ) place women squarely on the front lines .
It ’s a simple answer , but giving women an equal share of the courage and sacrifice required to battle the Covenant just felt like the right thing to do .
In the 1990s , U.S. military female aviators finally earned the right to fly combat missions ; extrapolating 500 years in the future , we thought , why would n’t women do everything men could do on the battlefield ? ”
It ’s …Complicated
Demographics and cultural values aside , the technical concerns of gender diversity in video games can be equally critical .
While creating a female avatar is n’t any more difficult than a male counterpart , including both genders as playable characters is a monumental commitment , requiring double the render work , motion capturing , and voice acting .
Close attention also needs to be paid to dialogue and ambient chatter so to avoid gender - specific references .
This increased workload gives an alternative perspective on why it ’s easier for developers to allow superficial tweaks to a single character rig rather than creating a new one entirely .
Crackdown is a perfect example .
Augmented with cybernetics to enhance speed and strength , there is no contextual reason as to why the ethnically diverse Agents are all men .
This is a fact of which Crackdown 2 lead producer James Cope and creative director Billy Thomson are well aware .
“ It ’s a really frustrating thing , because in concept it is so simple , you do n’t expect the difference between a male and a female character would have such an impact , ” begins Cope .
“ But it really touches almost everything that you do as part of the game .
It changes the way the player interacts and the way the AI interacts and changes graphic production .
It essentially doubles the cost of the whole game in many respects . ”
“ We did have female characters in Crackdown originally , ” Cope continues .
“ Sadly , we had to take them out .
We were met with increasing time pressures and had to get the game finished . ”
As producer , Cope is held responsible for getting the most bang for the company ’s buck .
In Crackdown ’s case , splitting the animation team across two sets of playable characters was n’t feasible .
“ The best decision we could come to – even though we were n’t particularly happy about it – was to take one of the player types out .
At the time the male character was more complete , so he won . ”
Thompson concurs that removing the female Agents was undesired , but necessary .
“ We risked ending up with something that was just kind of average , or instead , really focusing on one , ” he says .
“ We had five models built , textured , and skinned for the female – and she looked really cool .
But we just could n’t do it . ”
This particular design limitation appears to be a shared one amongst developers .
“ [ Epic ] also takes technical concerns into account , like our animation budget , ” echoes Bleszinski , speaking about the flagship Gears of War franchise .
“ Characters that shoot and take cover outside of cinematic sequences share the same skeleton , which would look odd with a female body . ”
This underlying principle is why there are only playable male characters in the Gears games and females are limited to cinematic sequences or audio roles such as Anya Stroud .
In an interesting side note , Bleszinski explains that Stroud was intentionally made female because “ it 's a very powerful thing for our mostly male audience to have a feminine voice on the other end of the line giving them pointers .
The voice does n't get lost in the noise and there 's probably something subliminal going on for the players about an attractive woman giving objectives .
Freud would be proud . ”
“ For us it ’s less a technical issue and more a design challenge , ” weighs in Staten , speaking again on the Halo franchise .
“ When you choose to be a female character you might have certain expectations about body shape and movement style and all of these will have an impact on the collision profile of your character .
Which means in multiplayer you might be harder to hit .
Halo multiplayer depends on an even play field ; we work extremely hard to keep it all about skill and not the choices you make off the battlefield .
In Halo 3 it was hard enough to balance for Spartans and Elites , and adding gender – at least in the models – was too much to handle given all the other challenges we tackled .
But as for Reach ?
Well , we ’ve already shown one female Spartan , Kat , and it would be a shame if players could n’t choose to play as a female Spartan themselves … ”
While Borderlands went the extra mile to create a female protagonist , Wildes affirms that it takes a lot of work .
“ It ’s definitely harder to develop both male and female player characters .
Even though Lilith would be going through the same range of motions as other player characters , we had to make a unique rig to fit her proportion and then motion capture a unique set of animations .
It turns out that women are shaped differently , they move differently , and they sound different .
It ’s kind of a pain .
In the end , though , if these aspects are n’t considered , you end up with a character that is less than you deserve , or have made tradeoffs in the development process that you may regret . ”
The Ugly Truth
If the stars align and a developer decides to include playable heroines , new challenges await .
One of the more prominent obstacles relates to physical appearance .
Let ’s be honest – sex sells , and there is a stigma against less attractive female characters in games .
Men , not so much .
Leisure Suit Larry is “ endearing , ” but the same traits transposed onto a female character would be viewed as a poor marketing move .
Given this institutional constraint , developers appear less willing to take risks on female characters .
What if a game has an unusual art style that does n’t lend itself to traditional beauty standards ?
Do they conform female characters to said art style , or eliminate the risk of poor reception by sticking to the more flexible gender ?
Fable developer Lionhead Studios is a unique example in this regard , making no gameplay distinctions between genders in Fable II .
Male and female heroes can dress how they want , sleep with whom they desire , and behave as they please – despite what gender norms stereotypically dictate .
“ Cliché as it sounds Fable games are really about choice and consequence ; we absolutely did not want to put any restrictions on any player on the way they want to play , ” begins Louise Murray , head of the Fable Franchise .
“ I think it ’s great that you have an empowered female Hero who can dress as a man and sleep with women if you really want to . ”
Similarly , both genders in Fable II share the same physical progression .
Women bulk up just as much as the men when certain stats are maxed .
How were these muscular heroines received ?
We ferreted out several interesting threads from various gaming forums , all trading tips on how to keep their female heroes demure – even if the tradeoff was a drastic reduction in brute strength .
One contributor lamented , “ She ’s weak , but at least she ’s sexy . ”
Fable staffers are n’t oblivious to this sentiment , even if they are n’t willing to cater to it entirely .
“ It ’s funny how much harder it was to make the female , though , ” elaborates Murray .
“ On the one hand , we want her to be appealing .
On the other hand , we do n’t want to stereotype women . ”
Murray admits that as a woman playing Fable II she was n’t fond of the wide shoulders and extra bulk her heroine carried – she wanted a combination of traditional beauty and brute strength .
Fable figurehead Peter Molyneux echoed the sentiment himself at Microsoft ’s recent X10 event , describing the leveled - up females as “ looking like Russian shot - putters . ”
Murray admits that the mixed reception of the female Hero progression has been factored into character development in Fable III – making clear though that Lionhead would never take away the players ability to make an ugly character .
Murray ended by noting that Lionhead feels the extra time and effort they dedicated to gender diversity in Fable II paid off , giving players more chances to connect with a character than before .
Crackdown devs Thomson and Cope cite the same standards as one of the speed bumps that led to female Agents being eliminated from their game .
The complicated visual representation of skill level increases in female Agents caused them to lag behind male characters in the development process .
“ For a long time we were trying to do these mockups to capture the overall style and skill and shape of the female character across the five different levels , ” explains Thomson , “ And we were having real problems about how she would level up .
With the male it was easy ; we just increased the bulk and gave him a different suit .
But when you did that with the female it did n’t work quite as well .
You lost that sleek and quite desirable shape for something that was really large and cumbersome .
We ended up with something that did n’t look nearly as nice at the top levels as it did at the first level . ”
Epic ’s Bleszinski echoes the same concerns about finding the perfect female protagonists .
“ The real trick for creating a female playable character is roughly the same for any playable character , which is to make them relatable so that both male and female players want to play as them .
But for a female character , they have to be attractive ( but not sl*tty ) , kick butt ( but not too butch ) , and be smart ( but not too nerdy ) . ”
While we do n’t yet know much about Halo : Reach ’s female Spartan Kat , Bungie is trying hard to avoid getting ensnared in the expectations of what a female action star should look like .
The brief glimpse we ’ve got of her without a helmet shows a believable , battle - hardened veteran .
“ Kat - 320 is definitely not ‘ just one of the guys , ’ nor is she a flimsy female stereotype showing a bare midriff through her armor , ” says Joe Tung , executive producer of Halo : Reach .
“ She ’s a tactically brilliant Spartan III Lieutenant Commander .
We wanted to build a strong female character who is just as tough as the men in Noble .
You only have to look as far as her arm to know she has seen her share of combat and hardships .
She ’s a battle - tested , tactically brilliant Spartan III Lieutenant Commander , and has conceived some of the smartest and boldest plans Noble team has ever undertaken .
She ’s also probably the only member of Noble Team that Carter trusts implicitly . ”
Independent developer Valve also deserves accolades for their effort in this regard , taking risks in creating believable and non-exploitive female characters such as Half - Life 's Alyx Vance , Left 4 Dead 's Zoey and Portal 's Chell .
We recently spent some time chatting with Valve about Portal protagonist Chell 's redesign for the upcoming sequel .
Looking through concept art , it becomes obvious that the team is more interested in making a believable lead than caving to societal standards .
“ This is not supposed to look like a sexy Marvel superhero suit , ” said Matt Charlesworth , a concept artist at Valve .
“ It ’s supposed to look like it was designed without any thought of making her look attractive .
We do n't want to make her be unattractive , but we want to balance that out .
Chell is a test subject , so she should look like one . ”
Is the practicality appreciated ?
We 'd like to think so , but it 's not always clear - cut .
Portal fans appear polarized by Chell 's work - in - progress redesign , weighing in on various forums across the net .
Some find her new look fresh and perfectly utilitarian .
Others are already requesting swimsuit DLC post - launch .
Another recent divisive female lead is Faith Connors from DICE 's Mirror 's Edge .
We gave the developer props for creating a strong - willed and intelligent character whose build and attire are perfectly appropriate for her profession .
Still , some fans do n't appreciate her diminutive assets as much as others , as evidenced by an unofficial redesign that caught the attention of the DICE developers themselves .
The redesign saddened the team ; upset that some fans would rather Faith looked like a “ 12 - year - old with a boob job ” than a sharp - witted athlete .
Risks and Rewards
With light shed on the inner workings of the gender selection process , it ’s easier to understand that committing to character diversity does n’t come easy .
However , that knowledge does n’t entirely sate our desire to see more female characters in games – playable or otherwise .
With the gamer demographic diversifying and committed developers willing to take more risks , there is no time like the present .
Till the practice becomes standard , our simple request remains : More , please .
Bonus : Growing Gears
Epic Games design director Cliff Bleszinski offered several reasons why female Gears are missing in action when it comes to interactive avenues , but that has n’t stopped ancillary media products from crafting lore to bridge narrative gaps .
“ We do n’t want to bog down our summer blockbuster pace trying to explain everything that is going on in the world , ” says Bleszinski when asked about how females fit into the Gears of War universe .
“ We want the player to hit the ground running in a Gears game and to feel like he ’s on a nonstop fun thrill ride . ”
Through two Gears novels and an ongoing comic run , it ’s revealed that women fought as fiercely as men on the frontlines of the Pendulum Wars .
Emergence Day and the subsequent Hammer Strike forced humanity back into somewhat primitive roles , however .
Individuals who aligned with the fragmented Coalition of Ordered Governments were promised some semblance of security – at a cost .
Able - bodied men became Gears and fertile women were tasked with producing new ones .
“ It was all men now , near enough , ” reads a passage from Aspho Fields , the Gears novel by Karen Traviss .
“ The Pendulum War days of women in uniform were largely over .
As Hoffman left , a girl in a sober blue business suit stood at a filing cabinet with her back to him .
When she closed the drawer and turned , he could see she was several months pregnant .
That was a priority job now ; not just replacing engine parts and weapon components , but replacing humans . ”
Neither station in life – an expendable asset or a reproductive one – sounds particularly appealing .
But it makes for an intriguing story and something we ’d love to see migrate into the interactive branch of the franchise .
Change may be on the horizon .
In the most recent run of Gears comics , Epic and WildStorm introduced Alex Brand , a tough and believable female Gear with a surprisingly practical hairdo and impressive scar .
Turned away from the breeding farms after being identified as infertile , Alex has helped to set a precedent for female Gears in the modern Gears of War timeline .
Here ’s to hoping that she makes an appearance in the inevitable franchise follow - up .
Remaining coy when asked directly , Bleszinski seems to share our opinion , “ You ’ll have to wait and see .
It could be really amazing to see a girl crush a Locust head with her boot ... ”
When it comes to casual games on the Web , there are many out there vying for our attention .
While we 've all played those addictive Flash games our friends have sent us , casual MMOs have been growing in popularity for the past few years .
They 've become big business , especially when they 're implemented through social sites like MySpace and Facebook .
Case in point : Zynga , the developer of Farmville and Mafia Wars has an estimated worth of $ 3 billion .
However , one game on the Web has been accused of being little more than an elaborate scam designed to bilk gamers out of their money .
The game , Evony , has an extensive Web presence that has gained a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons , and that 's just the beginning of the bad press surrounding the title .
Accusations of shady business practices , legal bullying , and physical intimidation surround the game ; some of these claims are easy enough to parse , while others are practically impossible to figure out because the real story has become so convoluted that it 's a Gordian Knot of facts
The ads we all love to hate
Even if you 've never played Evony , odds are that you 've been startled by at least one ad for the game while you surfed the Web .
The ads are particularly notorious because they 've grown increasingly scandalous over time .
Originally , the advertisements featured buxom women in fantasy - like garb and the text encouraged viewers to save either " the princess " or " your lover . "
As time passed , the imagery has become more suggestive .
Instead of revealing dresses , the women began appearing in lingerie for no apparent reason .
One of the tamer ads shows a woman in jeans and a tank top , with a lot of attention being heaped on her cleavage ( accompanied by the confusing tagline , " Play the new game everyone 's talking about .
It 's obvious why they are : It makes you feel like King ! " ) .
The ads have yet to become truly pornographic , though there are some that feature nothing more than a pair of breasts over the text claiming Evony is the , " best free web game . "
If some of the girls in the ads look familiar , it 's probably because many of the more recent ( and more scandalous ) women are taken from stock photography sites like iStockPhoto .
In at least one instance , the image in an Evony ad was also featured as the cover of a low - grade porn DVD .
Compare and contrast : the original Evony ads and PopCap 's satirical ones .
Click for NSFW version
Gamers clearly are n't the only people who have gotten sick of these softcore ads .
Last summer , PopCap Games launched a Web campaign for Plants vs. Zombies that satirized Evony's .
Not only did PopCap 's ads feature ( sort - of ) busty female zombies showing off their sagging assets and remaining teeth , but the ads also included similarly nonsensical slogans sported in Evony's .
The satirical campaign was the result of a discussion between PopCap employees .
While PopCap will no longer talk about the ads with the general public , the company 's VP of Public Relations Garth Chouteau did explain the idea behind the ads with The Escapist shortly after the campaign began .
" We needed some quirky ads to help keep Plants vs. Zombies top of mind , " he explained , " and following the PvZ ' music video ' and zombatar and the zombies ' and plants ' takeover of PopCap.com when the game launched , we wanted to do something equally zany — and as gamers ourselves , these spoof ads had us rolling on the floor , so we figured other gamers would appreciate them too . "
Not only did gamers appreciate the ads , but the press did , too .
As soon as the parody banners hit the Web , PopCap received a ton of positive press for the campaign .
On one hand , Evony 's ads are effective because they manage to immediately snag a viewer 's attention and make them want to learn more .
However , the advertising is also completely deceptive , since there 's not a single princess or lover involved in the game 's story .
Instead , it 's a MMORTS that has players acting as the mayor of a town in a medieval world .
Moreover , while the game is technically free to play , the ads do n't mention the numerous virtual transactions associated with gameplay .
Evony 's marketing has also become hated due to numerous spam comments left on blogs and news sites .
A number of sites have complained about receiving comments like the following :
I just started playing this new game called evony .
It ’s pretty sweet I think you guys would like it .
Just a simple little flash game , but damn its addicting .
You can sign up for an account at [ LINK REMOVED ] .
I just found this cool new game called evony .
Check it out at [ LINK REMOVED ]
Comments like these are common for less reputable companies and / or websites , usually peddling penis / breast enlargements , dubious herbal remedies , or free pornography .
The fact that a game was being pimped with this technique makes it seem more than a little sleazy .
Of course , the game 's publisher quickly denied responsibility for this spamming , instead claiming that it was the result of " some players [ who ] have abusively and unethically engaged in spamming practices , " via a program known as iEvony .
iEvony allows players to earn in - game credits by referring new players ; more on that program later .
Beyond the ads
The hatred for Evony runs pretty deep throughout the Web , but its ad campaign is only part of the reason .
Another major factor for this distaste is that there 's little that 's actually original about Evony .
The first crack in the game 's façade is that Evony 's original title — Civony — was a little too close to Sid Meier 's classic Civilization for some critics ' comfort .
About a year ago , the name was changed from Civony to Evony , though no official explanation was given on what led to the switch .
Also , many websites have documented how the game featured buildings blatantly ripped off from Age of Empires II before the company started creating its own artwork .
Art assets from Age of Empires 2 and their appearance in Evony .

As pointed out by The Guardian , the actual gameplay mechanics are also highly reminiscent of Civilization .
Players gradually build up their cities by gathering resources , upgrading units , and eventually waging war against other players in the world .
Even though the game is technically free to play , upgrading units and issuing commands takes a bit of time to actually accomplish .
This means that if a player wants to get a leg up in the game , they need to buy items from the game 's Item Mall .
Some of these items include construction speedups and increases to a player 's resource production rate .
While Evony seems like many other strategy games , this illusion starts to fall apart after a player gets through the " beginner " levels .
During the introductory play sessions , fees do n't really make an appearnce .
However , things do n't stay free for long .
Once players advance past level five , fees are necessary to fully play the game ; even basic actions like sending in - game messages will cost players a nominal amount of cash .
We have now added geospatial indexing to the product .
Our approach has been to make something simple but fast : 2d only , and effective for common real world use cases such as lat / long location searches .
Would love to get some feedback on features people would like to see , how its working , etc …
We owe Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney an apology .
They were right about Barack Obama .
They were right about the corporate state .
They had the courage of their convictions and they stood fast despite wholesale defections and ridicule by liberals and progressives .
Obama lies as cravenly , if not as crudely , as George W. Bush .
He promised us that the transfer of $ 12.8 trillion in taxpayer money to Wall Street would open up credit and lending to the average consumer .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) , however , admitted last week that banks have reduced lending at the sharpest pace since 1942 .
As a senator , Obama promised he would filibuster amendments to the FISA Reform
Act that retroactively made legal the wiretapping and monitoring of millions of American citizens without warrant ; instead he supported passage of the loathsome legislation .
He told us he would withdraw American troops from Iraq , close the detention facility at Guantánamo , end torture , restore civil liberties such as habeas corpus and create new jobs .
None of this has happened .
He is shoving a health care bill down our throats that would give hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to the private health insurance industry in the form of subsidies , and force millions of uninsured Americans to buy insurers ’ defective products .
These policies would come with ever - rising co-pays , deductibles and premiums and see most of the seriously ill left bankrupt and unable to afford medical care .
Obama did nothing to halt the collapse of the Copenhagen climate conference , after promising meaningful environmental reform , and has left us at the mercy of corporations such as ExxonMobil .
He empowers Israel ’s brutal apartheid state .
He has expanded the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan , where hundreds of civilians , including entire families , have been slaughtered by sophisticated weapons systems such as the Hellfire missile , which sucks the air out of victims ’ lungs .
And he is delivering war and death to Yemen , Somalia and perhaps Iran .
The illegal wars and occupations , the largest transference of wealth upward in American history and the egregious assault on civil liberties , all begun under George W. Bush , raise only a flicker of tepid protest from liberals when propagated by the Democrats .
Liberals , unlike the right wing , are emotionally disabled .
They appear not to feel .
The tea-party protesters , the myopic supporters of Sarah Palin , the veterans signing up for Oath Keepers and the myriad of armed patriot groups have swept into their ranks legions of disenfranchised workers , angry libertarians , John Birchers and many who , until now , were never politically active .
They articulate a legitimate rage .
Yet liberals continue to speak in the bloodless language of issues and policies , and leave emotion and anger to the protofascists .
Take a look at the 3,000 - word suicide note left by Joe Stack , who flew his Piper Cherokee last month into an IRS office in Austin , Texas , murdering an IRS worker and injuring dozens .
He was not alone in his rage .
“ Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities ( and in the case of the GM executives , for scores of years ) and when it ’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity , the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours ? ”
Stack wrote .
“ Yet at the same time , the joke we call the American medical system , including the drug and insurance companies , are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple , and this country ’s leaders do n’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile , rich cronies .
Yet , the political ‘ representatives ’ ( thieves , liars , and self - serving scumbags is far more accurate ) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the ‘ terrible health care problem ’ .
It ’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people do n’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in . ”
The timidity of the left exposes its cowardice , lack of a moral compass and mounting political impotence .
The left stands for nothing .
The damage Obama and the Democrats have done is immense .
But the damage liberals do the longer they beg Obama and the Democrats for a few scraps is worse .
It is time to walk out on the Democrats .
It is time to back alternative third - party candidates and grass - roots movements , no matter how marginal such support may be .
If we do not take a stand soon we must prepare for the rise of a frightening protofascist movement , one that is already gaining huge ground among the permanently unemployed , a frightened middle class and frustrated low - wage workers .
We are , even more than Glenn Beck or tea-party protesters , responsible for the gusts fanning the flames of right - wing revolt because we have failed to articulate a credible alternative .
A shift to the Green Party , McKinney and Nader , along with genuine grass - roots movements , will not be a quick fix .
It will require years in the wilderness .
We will again be told by the Democrats that the least - worse candidate they select for office is better than the Republican troll trotted out as an alternative .
We will be bombarded with slick commercials about hope and change and spoken to in a cloying feel - your - pain language .
We will be made afraid .
But if we again acquiesce we will be reduced to sad and pathetic footnotes in our accelerating transformation from a democracy to a totalitarian corporate state .
Isolation and ridicule — ask Nader or McKinney — is the cost of defying power , speaking truth and building movements .
Anger at injustice , as Martin Luther King wrote , is the political expression of love .
And it is vital that this anger become our own .
We have historical precedents to fall back upon .
“ Here in the United States , at the beginning of the twentieth century , before there was a Soviet Union to spoil it , you see , socialism had a good name , ” the late historian and activist Howard Zinn said in a lecture a year ago at Binghamton University .
“ Millions of people in the United States read socialist newspapers .
They elected socialist members of Congress and socialist members of state legislatures .
You know , there were like fourteen socialist chapters in Oklahoma .
Really .
I mean , you know , socialism — who stood for socialism ?
Eugene Debs , Helen Keller , Emma Goldman , Clarence Darrow , Jack London , Upton Sinclair .
Yeah , socialism had a good name .
It needs to be restored . ”
Social change does not come through voting .
It is delivered through activism , organizing and mobilization that empower groups to confront the hegemony of the corporate state and the power elite .
The longer socialism is identified with the corporatist policies of the Democratic Party , the longer we allow the right wing to tag Obama as a socialist , the more absurd and ineffectual we become .
The right - wing mantra of “ Obama the socialist , ” repeated a few days ago to a room full of Georgia Republicans , by Newt Gingrich , the former U.S. speaker of the House , is discrediting socialism itself .
Gingrich , who looks set to run for president , called Obama the “ most radical president ” the country had seen in decades .
“ By any standard of government control of the economy , he is a socialist , ” Gingrich said .
If only the critique were true .
The hypocrisy and ineptitude of the Democrats become , in the eyes of the wider public , the hypocrisy and ineptitude of the liberal class .
We can continue to tie our own hands and bind our own feet or we can break free , endure the inevitable opprobrium , and fight back .
This means refusing to support the Democrats .
It means undertaking the laborious work of building a viable socialist movement .
It is the only alternative left to save our embattled open society .
We can begin by sending a message to the Green Party , McKinney and Nader .
Let them know they are no longer alone .
According to New York Times writer Anahad O’Connor , former First Lady Laura Bush “ has finally opened up publicly about the mysterious car accident she had when she was 17 , a crash that claimed the life of a high school friend on a dark country road in Midland , Tex . ”
In her new book , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Spoken From the Heart , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Mrs. Bush describes in vivid detail the circumstances surrounding the crash , which has haunted her for most of her adult life and which became the subject of questions and speculation when it was revealed during her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s first presidential run .
A copy of the book , scheduled for release in early May , was obtained by The New York Times at a bookstore .
ADVERTISEMENT
RAW STORY was unable to find an advance copy , so it ’s premature to conclude that the account is n’t so “ vivid ” , however , there are curious details left out of the New York Times write - up regarding the crash .
“ On a November night in 1963 , Mrs. Bush and a girlfriend were hurrying to a drive - in theater when Mrs. Bush , at the wheel of her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Chevy Impala , ran a stop sign on a small road and smashed into a car being driven by Mike Douglas , a star athlete and popular student at her school , ” O’Connor writes .
But the Times neglects to mention – perhaps because Laura Bush neglects to mention it – that the former first lady reportedly had some sort of a romantic involvement with Douglas .
Multiple accounts , including an unauthorized biography of Laura Bush , have quoted classmates or simply referred to Douglas as an ex-boyfriend .
After the police report was finally released to the Associated Press in 2000 , Jim Vertuno wrote as his lead sentence , “ At 17 , Laura Bush ran a stop sign and crashed into another car , killing her boyfriend who was driving it , according to an accident report released to The Associated Press on Wednesday . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But in Washington Post reporter Ann Gerhart ’s 2004 book “ The Perfect Wife : The Life and Choices of Laura Bush , ” the relationship was characterized as more nebulous :
“ What made the crash even more devastating was that the boy Laura killed was no stranger but a good friend of hers , a boy from her crowd .
Some said Mike Douglas was her boyfriend .
Or had been , or maybe she wanted him to be . ”
From Snopes :
There has always been speculation about the nature of his relationship with Laura Welch .
One rumor asserts the two had never dated , but that Laura had been romantically interested in him .
Another claims he had been Laura ’s boyfriend when he died , and another that he had once been her boyfriend but the couple had subsequently broken up .
( The latter theory is advanced in the 2002 biography of the Bushes , George and Laura : Portrait of an American Marriage , which states Laura Welch and Michael Douglas had dated throughout early and mid-1963 , but by the fall of that year Michael was going out with Regan Gammon , one of Miss Welch ’s closest friends . )

The Times article notes , “ Mrs. Bush concedes that she and her friend were chatting when she ran the stop sign .
But she also suggests a host of factors beyond her control played a role Ã¢â‚¬â€ the pitch - black road , an unusually dangerous intersection , the small size of the stop sign , and the car the victim was driving . ”
But , according to Gerhart ’s book , “ The police accident report notes that the pavement was dry and the visibility excellent on the night Laura flew through the stop sign at 50 miles per hour . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The photos in the police file show an intersection bisecting the flat Texas landscape , a stop sign unobscured by buildings or shrubs , nothing but utility poles marching toward the horizon .
They show the violence of the impact : Mike Douglas ’s ’ 62 Corvair looks like one of those carcasses police departments put by the side of the road to scare people off drinking and driving .
Its metal hood and right front side panel are crumpled like a ball of paper , its entire chassis wrenched out of shape .
The report by the officer on the scene notes that the investigation was not complete , but if there was any follow - up investigation those results have long since disappeared from the files at the Midland County Attorney ’s Office .
Gerhart notes Laura Bush “ was not charged , not even ticketed for running through the stop sign , although Douglas ’ death was the second fatality at that intersection that year .
The police reportedly found no evidence of drinking or excessive speed , although the report is inconclusive as to whether she was tested for alcohol . ”
The Washington Post writer speculated , “ Perhaps Mike Douglas ’s parents , who lived out in the country and were n’t part of the more affluent set in town , did n’t have the right connections to press for a more vigorous investigation . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Perhaps , like many white teenagers of comfortable means , then and now , Laura Welch was granted that chance to make a terrible mistake without it ruining her life , ” Gerhart added .
An earlier Raw Story article focused on Laura Bush ’s bizarre , unsubstantiated belief that she and President Bush may have been poisoned during a trip to Germany .
But Mrs. Bush ’s complaints about the car Douglas drove seem to carry some credence .
“ It was sporty and sleek , and it was also the car that Ralph Nader made famous in his book Unsafe at Any Speed , ” Laura Bush writes in her book .
“ He claimed the car was unstable and prone to rollover accidents .
A few years later , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration went so far as to investigate the CorvairÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s handling , but it did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t reach the same grim conclusions .
I was driving my dadÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s much larger and heavier Chevy Impala .
But none of that would ever ease the night of November 6 .
Not for me , and never for the Douglases . ”

The Times adds , “ Mrs. Bush reveals that she was wracked by guilt for years after the crash , especially after not attending the funeral and for not reaching out to the parents of the dead teenager .
Her parents did not want her to show up at the funeral , she states , and she ended up sleeping through it . ”
There is no mention if Mrs.
Bush ever even attempted to reach out to the Douglas family to offer her sorrow and condolences for their loss , even years after the tragic event .

Au revoir !
Michael Cuisance schließt sich Erstliga - Aufsteiger Leeds United an . Nach SPORT1 - Informationen hat sich der 21 - jährige Franzose am Donnerstag vor dem Vormittagstraining um 11 Uhr bereits von seinen Mitspielern verabschiedet .
Cuisance zu Leeds !
Der Transfer hatte sich in den vergangenen Tagen bereits abgezeichnet .
Der zentrale Mittelfeldspieler klagte immer wieder über zu wenig Spielzeit , die ihm Hansi Flick aber nicht zusichern konnte .
Zuletzt in Hoffenheim stand Cuisance nicht mal im Kader , weil sich Flick aus sportlichen Gründen für den 17 - jährigen Jamal Musiala entschieden hatte .
Rückkaufoption für Bayern ?
Laut l´Équipe bekommt er bei den Engländern einen Vertrag bis 2025 .
Die Bayern sollen sich aber eine Rückkaufoption gesichert haben .
22 Millionen sollen für ihn geboten worden sein .
Für den oft umstrittenen Techniker bezahlten die Bayern im Sommer 2019 rund acht Millionen Euro Ablöse an Borussia Mönchengladbach .
Nach SPORT1 - Informationen hätte die Ablösesumme auf bis zu 12 Millionen Euro anwachsen können , sobald er über 100 Pflichtspieleinsätze absolviert hätte , in denen er mindestens 45 Minuten zum Einsatz gekommen wäre .
Für die Münchner kam er nur elf Pflichtspiel - Einsätze ( ein Tor , ein Assist ) .
Im Supercup gegen Borussia Dortmund am Mittwochabend dürfte Cuisance somit nicht mehr im Kader stehen .
Sein nächstes Ziel heißt Leeds United .
In a truly bizarre product offering , WHISKAS ® presented a new line of bluefin tuna - flavored cat food before quickly eliminating the product “ due to public concerns ” , according to Greenpeace UK .
Bluefin tuna is listed by the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered due to overfishing .
Despite population collapse and fears of extinction , the bluefin tuna has failed to receive a fishing - ban from their managing organization , International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) , as well as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
The bluefin tuna trade is a highly lucrative trade : estimated at 7.2 billion dollars annually .
While the WHISKAS ® cat food , owned by Mars Inc , would not have contained any bluefin tuna ( the first ingredients were actually meat by - products and poultry by - products ) , the product was meant to taste like bluefin tuna .
According to the product ’s slogan : “ cats love classic ocean taste .
That ’s why we ’ve crafted this blue fin tuna recipe just for them . ”
It should be noted no species of cat , wild or domestic , hunt ocean life .
As quickly as it appeared , the line has been discontinued “ due to public concerns ” .
Greenpeace UK ponders on their blog : “ What ’s next for Tiddles ’ din-dins ?
‘ Roast Tiger flavour ’?
‘ Grilled Gorilla ’ ?
Or maybe ‘ Limited Edition Dodo ’ ? ”
Earlier this month , Mars Inc. made news by stating it would use only sustainably - sourced seafood in its pet products , including Whiskas , by 2020 .
It is the first pet food company to make such a pledge .
The Atlantic bluefin tuna population has plummeted by 80 percent since 1970 .

As a child I read about the near - extinction of the American bison .
Once the dominant species on America ’s Great Plains , I remember books illustrating how train - travelers would set their guns on open windows and shoot down bison by the hundreds as the locomotive sped through what was left of the wild west .
The American bison plunged from an estimated 30 million to a few hundred at the opening of the 20th century .
When I read about the bison ’s demise I remember thinking , with the characteristic superiority of a child , how such a thing could never happen today , that society has , in a word , ‘ progressed ’ .
Grown - up now , the world has made me wiser : last month the international organization CITES ( Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) struck down a ban on the Critically Endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna .
The story of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is a long and mostly irrational one — that is if one looks at the Atlantic bluefin from a scientific , ecologic , moral , or common - sense perspective .
Critically Endangered bluefin tuna receives no reprieve from CITES

Dear readers , last week I was fortunate to visit the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in the heart of Madhya Pradesh .
Although I had some stunning sightings of what is easily among the most graceful , powerful and beautiful animals on the planet , this post is not about that .
It is about an amazing , true story of a tigress and a forest guard .
One of the reasons Bandhavgarh has the highest tiger density in the world is that , apart from it being well managed , compared with the tiger reserves in Rajasthan and UP , it is an ideal tiger habitat .
It abounds in tiger ’s food such as Chital and Sambhar deer , and the terrain is just what it should be .
Meadows , water bodies , a perennial water stream , hills , thick forest and caves that ensure that the tiger , if he so wishes , can perform a catwalk to delight thousands of visitors to the park , or choose to remain hidden , away from the prying eyes of man .
The last bit is of critical importance to the tigress , especially when she ’s pregnant .
Speak to those who follow tigers and they ’d tell you that one seldom gets to see the cubs till they are at least three months old .
The first glimpse of the cubs can be had only when the tigress , having shielded them from those who can harm them , is confident that they are now strong enough and ready to learn the ways of the jungle , including observing how a kill is made .
I am sharing all this so that you can better grasp the story that I am about to narrate .
Forest guard Chandar Bhan
Singh is an able man and is rated highly by his peers and superiors .
He is among the few who patrol the park on foot , keeping track of movements of animals , including those who can attack him , such as tigers , hyenas , bear , wolves , etc .
The foot patrol is also critical to check if poachers are up to some mischief .
It was during one such patrol that Chandar Bhan sighted what none in the current lot of guards had .
He saw , hidden from all in a small cave , tiny tiger cubs .
Now , when Chandar Bhan saw the cubs , their mother too saw that this human had seen where the cubs were .
( Forest guard Chandar Bhan Singh )
Full of excitement and eager to win brownie points , Chandar Bhan sprinted back to tell his boss , who too was excited and said they must go and take a look .
Since it was evening , they postponed the trip to the next morning .
In the morning when the two went looking for the cubs , they realised that the tigress , having sensed that the hideout had been exposed , had moved them somewhere else .
Initially , Chandar
Bhan ’s boss pooh - poohed his claim that he had seen the cubs , but then they decided to look around , assuming that it could n’t be too far away considering there were two .
By evening , the two found the new hideout .
Once again , the tigress noticed the duo who were on the lookout for her cubs , and one of them was Chandar Bhan .
This time , the eager and excited boss thought it was his turn to earn some brownie points , so he went and informed his superior , who in turn got excited and expressed a desire to see the cubs .
So , the next day , Chandar Bhan , his boss and the boss ’s boss all went together to the point where the tigress had hidden the cubs .
But no , the tigress was smarter and had moved location again .
The desperate trio , against all norms of forestry and acceptable behaviour towards wild animals , thought they must find out where the cubs had been hidden and decided to comb the area .
About 70 guards stood in a line , at a distance of not more than five metres apart , and started combing the area where they thought the tigress might have hidden the cubs .
Within minutes , out of nowhere emerged an enraged tigress , and she came straight at Chandar Bhan and pinned him down .
She used her hind legs to make his legs immobile , put her formidable paws on his chest and growled at him , looking straight into his eyes .
Chandar
Bhan recalls that not once did he feel she was going to sink her canines into him .
She just growled to express her extreme displeasure at his temerity to endanger the lives of her cubs .
While the others stood around , shocked and astounded at the sudden happening , Chandar Bhan , whose hands were still free , waived the small stick he was carrying in his hands .
The tigress parried the stick and in the process the paw scratched his face .
The tigress then disappeared as quickly as she had appeared .
A shaken Chandar Bhan sat up , dazed , till others gathered around and told him that one of his eyes had fallen out of the socket .
While they quickly moved him to a hospital and even shifted him to Sankar Nethralaya in Chennai , the eye could n’t be saved .
But the point of this tale is not that Chandar Bhan lost his eye , but the tigress ’s behaviour .
No one can deny that Chandar Bhan , his bosses and others acted most irresponsibly in not respecting the privacy of a immensely shy animal .
Instead of being benefactors of tigers , they were behaving like petulant kids .
This was in sharp contrast to the tigress ’s behaviour .
The sharp power of observation that she showed she possesses is amazing .
She recognised that the common thread across the three attempts to locate her young cubs was this man , and she had the ability to single him out of the 70 - odd and pin him down .
Even more importantly , something that Chandar Bhan himself admitted and which vouched for by all those who witnessed the attack , not once did the tigress show she wanted to harm him .
Her intention was to merely give him a stern warning , to lay off and not endanger her cubs .
And having done that , she disappeared in the bushes .
If anything , the tigress displayed traits that should otherwise be considered human while the real humans displayed all the weaknesses of mankind – temptation , greed , impatience , easy way out .
And the guards certainly seem to have learned their lesson .
While Chandar Bhan , a much wiser man , proudly displays the scratch marks on his chest and vows never to let anybody mess with the tiger ’s personal space , the others too seem to understand the onerous task they have at hand .
Ultimately , they all realise , and I hope this feeling grows , that while a mobile company or others can do all that they wish to raise awareness , it is people like them on whom the real responsibility lies .
I noticed first hand the seriousness with which the park administration , led by a very able director , takes its task .
They entertain absolutely no request that is illegal .

An extract from a plant known in the US as “ the vine that ate the South ” may help reduce alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers , a small - scale study suggests .
Previous research has shown that kudzu plant extract has helped reduce alcohol drinking in rats and hamsters , but this is the first study to show the effect in humans .
The plant was introduced to the US to combat soil erosion but has now become a persistent weed .
In the study , people who were given kudzu extract for seven days drank about one beer less in a monitored 1.5 - hour drinking session than people who took the placebo , say researchers at McLean Hospital , Harvard Medical School and New England Research Institutes in Massachusetts , US .
Those treated also drank more slowly .
The 14 subjects were all heavy drinkers , consuming an average of 25 alcoholic beverages per week , but none of them were alcohol dependent or had a family history of alcoholism .
The experimental group took two 500 - milligramme kudzu capsules three times a day .

Then they came into a laboratory which simulated a living room , with a television , stereo and bookshelf .
A small kitchen was stocked with their favourite beer .
Between swigs , the subjects were required to put their beer onto an end table with a built - in scale so researchers could track exactly how much beer they were drinking .
Long drink
All of the subjects reached for the first drink in the same amount of time .
But after having the first beer , people taking kudzu took a longer time to get up and get another drink and an even longer time to finish it .
Chinese herbal medicine has long used kudzu to reduce drinking and cure hangovers .
Researchers believe that an isoflavone called puerarin is the active ingredient .
The kudzu used in the study had far more puerarin than the supplements found at health food stores , about 25 % compared to just 2 % .
Earlier studies have reported that people who take the kudzu supplement said they felt more tired and intoxicated after having one alcoholic drink .
“ We suspect the kudzu treatment is causing the alcohol to get into the brain more quickly , ” Scott Lukas , at McLean Hospital , told New Scientist .
But researchers are unsure of the mechanism involved .
He adds that after four weeks of treatment , the subjects did not show any side effects .
J C Garbutt , a psychiatry professor at the University of North Carolina , US , is interested by the findings but says more work is needed to determine whether the treatment is effective when used by alcoholics .
Lukas envisions kudzu being used alongside group therapy to treat alcoholism and would like to test it on college - age students – a group prone to binge drinking .

Photographers have their own version of sleight of hand , manipulating images to make us believe the final product is a representation of reality .
The latest version of Photoshop , the flagship image - editing application in Adobe 's Creative Suite , adds a new stack of cards to the photographer 's trick deck .
Wired.com was shown demos of new tools – such as the new Content Aware Fill and HDR – in Photoshop CS5 that we expect will amaze and please photographers with the tools ' ability to bend pixels with absolute precision .
Photoshop CS5 will arrive as part of Adobe Creative Suite 5 , the company 's package of 14 productivity apps for visual designers , photographers and publishers .
Creative Suite 5 will ship mid-May , according to Adobe .
Prices for the suite range between $ 1,300 and $ 2,600 , depending on which package you buy , with upgrades priced from $ 500 to $ 1,500 .
Photoshop CS5 alone will cost $ 700 , or $ 200 for an upgrade .
Photoshop CS5 Extended , which has some additional tools , will cost $ 1,000 , or $ 350 for an upgrade .
This year marks the 20th anniversary of Photoshop 's arrival , and there are certainly several " wow " features in Photoshop CS5 that achieve a level of technological advancement most of us could n't have even dreamed of 20 years ago .
Most impressive is the new Content Aware Fill brush , a mind - bending tool that can remove large objects from photos , altering the background to make it realistically appear as though the object were never there .
It can zap tourists , delete power lines and otherwise alter photos with click - and - drag ease .
This video shows it most plainly .
Fast forward to about the halfway point if you want to see the really crazy stuff .
( When this video first started making the rounds in March , some thought it was a hoax .
It 's not :
This is a real feature of Photoshop CS5 . )
As with any new tool in Photoshop , expect Content Aware Fill to be overused : A surfeit of tourist - free images of Machu Picchu will soon be littering Flickr .
But beyond the novelty , it 's a truly useful touch - up tool that turns what used to be hours of work into a simple drag of the brush .
Speaking of brushes , all of the painting features in Photoshop – neglected since the release of Photoshop 7 – have been rewritten .
The app now features much more realistic interactions .
If you use a digitizer tablet , you 'll find that your brushes are considerably more responsive .
The angle of the stylus now controls the edge of the brush and the new paint - mixing tools control color blending , wetness and bristle length , making for a very lifelike painting experience .
Another bit of Photoshop trickery that 's become popular lately is high - dynamic - range imaging , or HDR .
The Flickr crowd is crazy for it , and Adobe has responded by improving Photoshop 's Merge to HDR tool , which helps you create HDR images .
The new HDR tool now has fourteen HDR presets which can save considerable effort when hand - toning an image .
The HDR presets shipping with Photoshop range from the cartoonish to the fairly realistic , and should satisfy all but the pickiest of HDR enthusiasts .
Composing a real HDR image requires multiple photos taken with multiple exposures , but now you can fake it .
Photoshop CS5 has a new set of tools to create what Adobe calls " single- image HDRs . "
The results will never quite match a true HDR with multiple images , but the new single - image HDR - toning dialogue lets you get pretty close using just one file .
Also incredibly helpful for HDR fans is the new Remove Ghosts tool in the HDR dialog , which makes it simple to eliminate ghosting and artifacts caused by differences between your layered HDR images .
With Photoshop CS5 , you can simply outline a ghosted area ( say , for example , a flower that moved in the breeze between shots ) and select a single layer for that portion of the image .
Mini Bridge :
You can now embed the Bridge file browser into a Photoshop palette .
Photoshop CS5 is n't just new brushes .
There 's been plenty of attention to performance – the Mac OS X version is now fully 64 - bit native , the same enhancement the Windows version got in in CS4 .
That means that you could , in theory , throw as much as 128 GB RAM at Photoshop .
This update further deepens Photoshop 's integration with Bridge , Adobe 's file - browsing tool .
Bridge can now be embedded in a palette within Photoshop ( known as Mini Bridge ) .
You can quickly navigate through your images using the familiar Bridge interface without needing to leave Photoshop .
Interestingly , the UI metaphor for Mini Bridge seems influenced by the iPhone – when you navigate through folders , the interface slides left and right .
Photoshop CS5 also gets the same massive overhaul to the Camera Raw engine that we 've seen in the forthcoming Lightroom 3 .
Camera RAW in both apps offers much better sharpening and noise reduction , which is impressive not so much for its ability to remove noise , but to retain detail while doing so .
Photoshop CS5 also has a few tricks designed to make designers ' lives easier , particularly the new Puppet Warp tools , which allow you to make path - like selections and bend , warp , shorten , lengthen and twist an object .
Wired.com was shown a demo by Photoshop product manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes .
He took an image of an elephant with a straight trunk and , with just three selection points , he bent and curled the trunk back so the elephant appeared to be eating .
Photoshop 's new Puppet Warp tool in action : before and after
Puppet Warp introduced almost no distortion into the finished image .
Puppet Warp also provides a much easier and faster way to straighten tilted horizons .
We were also impressed with the new Lens Correction tool , which fixes distortion and other lens artifacts , using profiles tailored to correct specific camera lenses ( the lens type is determined by embedded EXIF data , so Photoshop can determine that automatically ) .
Most of the other smaller features that make this release of Photoshop a must - have are user - suggested features and workflow improvements .
Adobe solicited user suggestions , filtered through the ideas , picking some three dozen ideas and making them a part of Photoshop CS5 .
Photoshop has several outstanding new features – it's probably worth the price of the upgrade just for the new Content Aware Fill tool , the 64 - bit boost and the improvements to Camera RAW – but what really sells this release is amount of time it promises to save you .
Among our favorite workflow improvements :
You can now adjust the opacity and fill percentages on multiple layers simultaneously , the Save for Web dialog is available in 16 - bit mode ( and handles downsizing to 8 - bit automatically ) , and Photoshop has the ability to save layer styles as a default behavior that even persists across sessions .
Adobe has done an impressive job of focusing not just on the whiz - bang features , but on how photographers , designers and digital artists spend their time using Photoshop , and how making small changes can speed up their workflows .

Having a baby ?
Do n't believe the false promises , says Emily Woof .
The gulf between natural birth and the medicalised approach puts mothers in an impossible situation .
And she should know
I remember being at a party when I was eight months pregnant with my first child .
I got into conversation with three experienced mums .
They looked at my round belly , and smiled conspiratorially as they unleashed their birth stories .
They divulged everything – the baying , the blood , the fear , the chaos , the agony .
They seemed to want to outdo each other 's horror and as they talked they were transformed into electrified , possessed creatures .
I was terrified .
The adrenaline rush sent my baby into back flips inside me .
I have never talked about the births of either of my two children .
There are plenty of reasons .
Most of them are pragmatic .
Birth pitched me into motherhood .
Suddenly there was no time , certainly not for dwelling on the past .
The births were behind me , the children ahead .
At least it's what I tried to tell myself .
I had given birth twice .
Each had produced a beautiful , healthy boy .
Why linger on them ?
People went through far worse .
It seemed churlish to brood , especially when so many women were unable to conceive .
But my experience remained locked inside me , refractory and unexamined .
If birth came up in conversation , I would stay mute hoping the subject would move on .
I knew that writing this article would be hard .
I would have to face raw memories and all the old unanswerable questions .
Above all , it would mean describing the actual births .
I wondered whether the article should have a subtitle : not to be read by expectant mothers .
I asked my mother about her births and she said she never talked about them to anyone .
She said the reason was obvious ( my mother 's second pregnancy ended with a stillbirth , and the unspoken grief still lives inside her after 50 years ) : birth was so dreadful that it had to be forgotten , or no one would go through it more than once .
I do n't believe women forget their birth experiences .
I certainly have n't forgotten mine .
Many women do talk about their births .
Plenty of my friends recount them openly , especially if they went well , and I 've noticed that even among those who had difficult births , talking about it can be a way of coping with the trauma .
There are a multitude of responses , but mine , like my mother 's , has been silence : not because of how dreadful the births were , but because at some level I could n't acknowledge my feelings about them .
I felt ashamed .
I felt I had failed because both of them went " wrong " .
It was the due date for my second child .
The birth of my first had been by emergency caesarean , and I was keen to try for a natural birth .
We had chosen a female obstetrician with a good reputation and discussed Vbac ( vaginal birth after caesarean ) , which she was confident I could have .
My husband and I arrived at her surgery for a cervical sweep , whereby a doctor or midwife uses a finger to stretch the cervix to stimulate labour .
My consultant cheerfully inserted a finger .
" Push against me , " she said .
I did .
It hurt .
It hurt a lot .
" Ah , " she said , smiling , " I 've broken your waters ! "
She pulled out her hand .
Her face went pale with shock .
My skirt was drenched in bright red blood .
I could n't understand where it had all come from .
" It 's frank blood , " she said .
" Where 's your car ? "
We ran red lights all the way to the hospital .
I was put in a birthing room and strapped up to various monitors .
The bleeding subsided .
A slow flow of clear fluid ran between my legs .
It was amniotic fluid , my consultant reassured me – a good sign .
She went back to her surgery to see more patients .
When she returned four hours later , I had started to have mild contractions .
She asked me to stand up and move around the room .
As I stepped from the bed , I suffered a huge loss of blood .
I had been haemorrhaging internally since the sweep .
The blood had merely collected inside me .
The clear fluid was not amniotic fluid but serum from still , separating blood .
I remember a blur of green gowns , a drip in my arm , the hospital corridor rushing past , my husband 's terrified face , the bright coldness of the operating theatre , the mask going over my nose and mouth .
My husband waited in the corridor .
After five minutes , a nurse emerged with a baby .
He put it under his jumper to keep it warm and waited for three long hours .
The memory still makes him cry .
The doctors were too busy to tell him what was going on .
He remembers someone rushing out and shouting , " We need blood ! " .
He thought I was dying .
I suppose I was .
Only a massive transfusion saved me .
I have struggled with hundreds of questions about it ever since .
Why did it happen like that ?
Looking back , I can also see that I had put myself under enormous pressure to have a normal delivery .
Why ?
Why did n't I choose an elective caesarean ?
The answer is that in having one with my first child , I felt I had somehow let myself down .
On the internet , women chatter anxiously about every aspect of birth , from pain relief to whether an epidural can affect the baby 's brain , from cultural differences in birth methods to whether having a caesarean can save your sex life .
The voices seem uncertain : dismayed by choice , and fraught with the worry about getting it right .
The previous generation had no such choice .
My mother 's first birth was a lonely and scarring experience .
My father was not allowed to be present .
She was strapped to a bed on her back , her feet hoisted into stirrups .
She was given ether for the pain and the baby was yanked out of her birth canal with metal forceps .
Her vagina ripped badly , and she felt alone , ashamed and frightened .
She said she was treated like an animal .
Her baby was taken away to a separate room and only brought back to her when the staff deemed it necessary .
It is not surprising that after such experiences the natural childbirth movement sprang up .
Women wanted control .
Birth was a natural process , they said , and a joyous one .
They wanted the sense of community that could surround a woman giving birth : midwives , partners , doulas .
The hospitalised degradation our mothers had suffered was a thing of the past .
Birth should be a positive experience .
Ten years ago and pregnant with my first baby , I found myself caught up in that idealisation of birth .
My friends were the same .
We practised squatting , breathing , and massaging .
We were encouraged to indulge our bodies .
It was a special time .
Not least because we felt we were discovering a new faith ; in nature , and in ourselves .
My husband and I sat on bean bags in the National Childbirth Trust ( NCT ) class , taking copious notes on an A4 pad .
We learned that drugs could harm the baby .
They could make it sluggish , and slow to feed .
We heard horror stories about epidurals .
We learned that the increasing rates of caesareans were due to doctors fitting them into their shifts .
Birth had become over - medicalised and modern women were becoming " too posh to push " .
The NCT offered an attractive alternative .
Birth was not just a matter of having a baby , it was about remaining in control .
I made my birth plan .
No pain relief , it said .
The teacher took my husband to one side .
" Make sure she sticks to her plan , " she told him .
" When she 's screaming for drugs , it 's not what she really wants , it 's what they want . "
He dutifully made a note of it .
We were both suggestible .
I was hormonal .
We became so convinced of the evils of hospital we decided to side - step them altogether and opted for a home birth .
We paid for an independent midwife .
She came to the house and showed me a video of a Brazilian woman giving birth .
The woman got down on her haunches by a tree and pushed .
The head of the baby crowned between her legs and it slipped out , easy as a pea from a pod .
I am relatively small in stature and my bump was enormous .
" I 'm worried my baby is too big , " I said .
" You must trust in nature .
Babies cannot be too big , " the midwife retorted , as though I had dared question the faith .
We had candles , mood music , a birthing pool .
We knew how to breathe .
We had massage oils .
We were ready .
My waters broke at night and I went into labour .
My contractions were fierce .
I was soon 10 cm dilated .
The contractions came every 30 seconds , pain grinding down my lower back .
I felt I would crack open .
My baby did not slip out like the Brazilian woman's .
I laboured for 36 hours .
There is no describing the agony .
The midwife put her hand inside me to turn the head , but still the baby did not come .
I did n't want candles or massage or music .
I just lay on the bathroom floor and wanted to die .
My husband told me that the midwife had stood in the kitchen at a loss .
By midnight on the second night , he insisted we went to hospital .
Within three minutes of arriving , I had been given an epidural .
Fifteen minutes later , the duty doctor told me that the birth was not progressing and I was exhausted .
He would deliver the baby by emergency caesarean .
The independent midwife did n't stay .
This would not be a natural birth .
Following standard procedure , the surgeon cut my skin through to the layer of fat until he reached the fascia , the shining inner skin that supports the abdomen .
He made a small incision and widened the cut .
He parted my muscles underneath and pushed through a sheet of tissue using his finger .
He stretched the hole open and cut carefully into my womb , just enough to allow the baby 's head through .
The sight of my baby suddenly lifting above the curtain and screaming loudly with flailing limbs , is scored into my memory like a sunrise .
I reached for him , despite the surgeon telling me to lie still .
The nurse laid him on to my breast , and the instant he touched my skin he was quiet and still .
Lying in the hospital ward afterwards , my body swollen with fluids , and the pain in my abdomen severe , I became deeply depressed .
I was in a busy ward .
My husband was not allowed to stay .
I remember staring at my baby in the clear plastic tub next to me .
I wanted to lift him but I could n't move .
A nurse reprimanded me .
Why had I not bothered to put a nappy on baby ?
I was disoriented and could barely understand her .
She stormed off and got a nappy and wipes .
She dumped them on the bed beside me and passed me my son , streaked with meconium .
I cleaned the molasses - like excreta from his perfect skin and cried through the night .
Perhaps with birth experiences like these it's not surprising that I wrestle with the idea that birth is one of the most natural things we do .
I was told afterwards that my first son had the umbilical cord wrapped tightly around his neck .
If he had come out normally , he would have been strangled .
He would have died or suffered severe brain damage .
I had always prided myself on being in tune with my body , fit and strong , and this felt like a dire failure .
I 'm not sure whether birth is comparable to other " natural " things that we do .
Unlike other mammals , our babies do not have a straight trajectory into the world .
Evolution dictated that our pelvises became narrow in order for us to walk upright , but at the same time our craniums were growing larger to accommodate our burgeoning brains .
For a baby to be born , it must turn as much as 40 degrees so that its large head can squeeze through the birth canal .
It is a difficult manoeuvre .
I recently read a book about the Piraha people in the Amazon .
There was a description of a woman going into the forest alone to give birth .
The baby got stuck and she cried out in agony all night long .
No one went to help her .
She was found lying dead by the river , the next day , her baby still inside her .
The book says that no one mourned her .
I 'm not sure I can believe that , but it certainly seems true that for the Piraha , death in childbirth is simply an unavoidable fact of life .
Death has always shadowed birth .
In the 1600s , if the baby did n't emerge , doctors drilled into their heads to make their bodies easier to extract , piece by piece .
In the 19th century , women preparing for birth were routinely told to pray and beg forgiveness in readiness for death ; 19th - century novels are littered with mothers dying in childbirth .
I am deeply grateful that I live now , when medical intervention has kept me and my children alive .
I also know how important it is that the NCT and similar organisations exist to support and empower women .
But in my experience , the division between health practitioners who advocate the natural way , and those who encourage a more medicalised route presents its own danger .
It carries with it a sense of good and bad , a gulf in which women can get caught .
It is part of our culture to want choice and to be in control , but with birth , this is probably impossible .
My friend Georgia , who was pregnant at the same time as me , was induced three weeks early because of pre-eclampsia .
Her cervix did not dilate and she was forced to have an emergency caesarean .
I asked how she felt about the whole experience .
She said she was fine , just happy to have a healthy baby .
From the start she had never expected the birth to be anything but a nightmare .
Sceptical by nature , she had stopped going to her antenatal classes because she disliked all the false promises about perfect births .
She chose not to make any kind of plan .
As a result , when things went wrong she did not feel any disappointment .
It made me realise that , in some way , my silence was about mourning the birth experience I had wanted so much but was unable to have .
No doctor can predict how a birth will turn out .
It 's hard to know how best to prepare .
To misquote another novelist , there are as many different birth experiences as there are babies .
It has taken a long time for me to understand that it was not that my births that were wrong , but my expectations .
My birth stories are extreme but they are part of who I am .
It is good to acknowledge them but I still feel drawn to silence .
I do n't know why , exactly .
It is not about shame or feelings of failure any more but perhaps because ultimately birth , like death , is so intimate , so ordinary and yet so epic that it is beyond our expression .

Editor 's note : Ali Abunimah is the author of " One Country : A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli - Palestinian Impasse , " and is a frequent speaker and commentator on the Middle East .
( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's Monday speech to America 's leading pro-Israel lobby took on added significance in light of the spat between the U.S. and Israel over the expansion of Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem .
It indicated the Obama administration blinked in the face of continued Israeli defiance , but that Israel likely faces more trouble down the road .
The row began when Israel announced 1,600 new Jewish - only homes on occupied Palestinian land on March 9 , the very day Vice President Joe Biden was in the country to launch indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
In an angry phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Clinton reportedly demanded that Israel rescind the decision , among other " confidence - building measures , " to get the U.S. - brokered talks back on track .
At AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , Clinton stood by the administration 's criticism but could not point to any substantive Israeli concessions .
Netanyahu , she said , had responded to her demand for concrete steps with specific actions Israel is prepared to take .
But halting settlement expansion was not one of them .
Indeed , before leaving Israel for Washington where he was scheduled to meet President Obama on Tuesday , Netanyahu stressed that construction anywhere in Jerusalem was the same as construction in Tel Aviv and would continue as normal .
This is a replay of the administration 's earlier cave - in .
Almost a year ago , Obama sought to correct America 's long - standing , pro-Israel tilt by demanding Israel stop building West Bank settlements , which have consumed much of the land on which a Palestinian state was supposed to be established .
But bowing to pressure from Israel 's powerful U.S. lobby , the administration dropped the demand .
Israel announced a fictional 10 - month settlement freeze , excluding Jerusalem .
Then Obama pressured Palestinians to return to the same merry - go - round of endless talks -- and still , Israel pursues settlements unrestrained .
In unusually stark language , Clinton warned that Israel needed a peace deal because " the status quo is unsustainable for all sides . "
She pointed to the " inexorable mathematics of demography , " a reference to projections that Palestinians will soon be the majority population in the area controlled by Israel .
Only a two - state solution , Clinton asserted , could preserve Israel as a " Jewish and democratic state . "
The problem is that the administration 's plan to get to its objective of " two states for two peoples living side by side in peace " looks less credible today than ever .
On the Palestinian side , the U.S. refuses to engage with Hamas , without which no credible deal can be struck , and the anemic U.S. vision of a Palestinian mini-state cannot hope to meet the aspirations or restore the rights of millions of Palestinian refugees .
And , after two embarrassing defeats at the Israel lobby 's hands , chances that Obama will use America 's massive financial aid to Israel as leverage are close to nil , especially as midterm elections approach .
The administration 's dependence on the goodwill of the lobby was highlighted by the fact that AIPAC 's new president , Lee Rosenberg , was a key member of the national finance committee for Obama 's presidential campaign , and another AIPAC national board member , J.B. Pritzker -- who got a shout - out in Clinton 's speech -- was national finance chair of Citizens for Hillary .
In the closely watched race for Obama 's former Illinois Senate seat , the National Republican Senatorial Committee accused Republican Mark Kirk 's Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias -- and by extension Obama , who is a close Giannoulias friend -- of being " anti-Israel . "
This may foreshadow a national GOP strategy to make unconditional support for Israeli policies more than ever a litmus test in American elections .
In this poisonous atmosphere , real progress is unlikely -- the best the Obama administration can hope for is to avoid a serious blowup until it can pass the problem to the next administration .
But the situation on the ground will not wait for the United States to come to its senses ; in Jerusalem and the West Bank , popular resistance is growing , in the form of nonviolent protests , to Israel 's land confiscations .
Israel 's violent response , including the arrests of civil society leaders , may cause some Palestinians to react in kind .
Globally , Israel faces a growing campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions just like apartheid South Africa did in the 1980s .
A leading Israeli think tank , the Reut Institute , warned the government recently that this campaign " possesses strategic significance , and may develop into a comprehensive existential threat within a few years . "
It also stated that a " harbinger of such a threat would be the collapse of the two - state solution as an agreed framework for resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and the coalescence behind a ' one - state solution ' as a new alternative framework . "
With its aggressive settlement expansion plans , Israel has in effect chosen a one - state instead of a two - state solution -- but it is indeed an apartheid state .
While the United States looks on impassively , or continues to tout a charade of a peace process , Palestinians , pro-democracy Israelis and their allies will intensify what is rapidly turning into a struggle for equal rights and citizenship for everyone who inhabits the narrow land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Abunimah .
" When they cut off my nose and ears , I passed out , " 19 - year - old Bibi Aisha of Afghanistan says with chilling candor .
Her beauty is still stunning and her confidence inspiring .
It takes a moment for the barbaric act committed against her to register in your mind and sight .
Wearing her patterned scarf and with roughly painted nails she shares her story .
" It felt like there was cold water in my nose , I opened my eyes and I could n't even see because of all the blood , " she remembers .
It was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband 's family .
This story began when Aisha was just 8 years old .
Her father had promised her hand in marriage , along with that of her baby sister 's , to another family in a practice called " baad . "
" Baad " in Pashtunwali , the law of the Pashtuns , is a way to settle a dispute between rival families .
At 16 , she was handed over to her husband 's father and 10 brothers , who she claims were all members of the Taliban in Oruzgan province .
Aisha did n't even meet her husband because he was off fighting in Pakistan .
" I spent two years with them and became a prisoner , " she says .
( Watch more of the interview with Aisha )
Tortured and abused , she could n't take it any longer and decided to run away .
Two female neighbors promising to help took her to Kandahar province .
But this was just another act of deception .
When they arrived to Kandahar her female companions tried to sell Aisha to another man .
All three women were stopped by the police and imprisoned .
Aisha was locked up because she was a runaway .
And although running away is not a crime , in places throughout Afghanistan it is treated as one if you are a woman .
A three - year sentence was reduced to five months when President Hamid Karzai pardoned Aisha .
But eventually her father - in - law found her and took her back home .
That was the first time she met her husband .
He came home from Pakistan to take her to Taliban court for dishonoring his family and bringing them shame .
The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off .
An act carried out by her husband in the mountains of Oruzgan where they left her to die .
But she survived .
And with the help of an American Provincial Reconstruction Team in Oruzgan and the organization Women for Afghan Women ( WAW ) , she is finally getting the help and protection she needs .
Offers have been pouring in to help Aisha , but there are many more women suffering in silence .
The United Nations estimates that nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan 's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse .
This in a country where there are only about eight women 's shelters to provide sanctuary from the cruelty they face .
And all of the eight are privately run .
" Bibi Aisha is only one example of thousands of girls and women in Afghanistan and throughout the world who are treated this way - who suffer abuses like this , like this and worse , " says board member for WAW , Esther Hyneman .
In 2001 , the situation of Afghan women and Taliban brutality received plenty of attention .
Now organizations like WAW say the international community is strangely silent on the issue .
Hyneman says not enough is being done to help the women in Afghanistan and that feeds into the hands of the insurgency .
" When you have ... 50 percent of a population on their knees , it 's very easy for extremists , tyrants to take over a country , " she adds .
" They have a ready - made enslaved population . "
Aisha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror .
But there still times she can laugh .
And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice .

We were assigned topics about environmental issues and asked to use surrealism as a method .
I was given ' Planned Obsolescence , ' the concept of engineering products to become obsolete before they should so consumers have to buy more .
I struggled with this for a long time , but the image I finally settled on shows a cell phone inside of an hourglass turning to sand , floating in a stormy ocean .
I 've considered putting trash in the ocean to link it to pollution but I like the simplicity of the image in its current state .
The final project will be an illustration of this image in colored pencil and acrylic .

“ In a row with a certain individual , the individual killed him , ” Mr. Bereket said .
“ What they are trying to do is search for casualties and label them Arena .
They are not into constructive engagement . ”
A different opposition parliamentary candidate was beaten in Tigray on Sunday by members of the Ethiopian Army , and he was hospitalized , said Negasso Gidada , a former president of Ethiopia who has now joined the opposition .
Like the man who was killed , the beating victim , Ayalew Beyene , had previously been arrested for attending opposition meetings or distributing campaign literature , he added .
“ It is very bad news , ” Mr. Negasso said .
“ My fear is such incidents may be intensifying . ”
Government security forces killed at least 193 demonstrators during unrest after the country ’s 2005 federal elections , which the opposition said were rigged .
Birtukan Mideksa , widely considered to be the country ’s most charismatic opposition figure , remains in prison , serving a life sentence issued in the aftermath of the disputed elections .
Both the ruling party and the opposition have accused each other of seeking to foment violence around this year ’s vote .
In local elections in 2008 , opposition parties won just 3 of 3.6 million seats — virtually none of the huge number of local and by - election seats being contested — after two of the major groups boycotted the elections , citing intimidation and harassment , according to the State Department ’s human rights report on Ethiopia .
Mr. Bereket , the government minister , who is also a senior official in Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ’s Ethiopian People ’s Revolutionary Democratic Front , said that the candidate beaten on Sunday had been pressuring a student who was not aligned with the ruling party to read opposition campaign literature and that the two had fought as a result .

BBC documentary proves Israeli army murdered Rachel Corrie
by Christopher Bollyn
T he BBC has released a remarkable film about the killing of three international peace activists by the Israeli army in the occupied Gaza Strip .
Documentary evidence provided in the film strongly suggests that the American Rachel Corrie - and two British activists - were murdered .
Last spring , within a period of seven weeks , one British and one American peace activist were killed by the Israeli army in Rafah , a Palestinian town at the southern end of the occupied Gaza Strip .
A second Briton was shot in the head leaving him brain - dead .
In two of the cases the Israeli army is being blamed for murder ; the third is considered " attempted murder . "
An Israeli military bulldozer crushed the 23 - year - old American peace activist Rachel Corrie , who was the first to die on March 16 , as she tried to prevent it from demolishing a Palestinian doctor 's home .
British photographer Tom Hurndall , 22 , was left brain dead after being shot in the head by an Israeli soldier on April 11 .
British cameraman James Miller , 34 , was shot by an Israeli sniper as he left a house with two other journalists on May 2 .
A recently released 50 - minute " hard - hitting " program produced by the British Broadcasting Corp. ( BBC ) investigated the three killings and provides crucial video evidence .
" That 's murder , " an Israeli soldier said after viewing footage from the film , When Killing is Easy .
When Killing is Easy was shown 4 times to a worldwide audience on the commercial BBC World television network on November 22 and 23 .
Some cable television viewers in the United States would have been able to view the program .
The three international observers died , or nearly died , at the hands of the Israeli military between the middle of March and the first week of May .
Hurndall was shot in the head as he took a Palestinian toddler , who had frozen under Israeli fire , into his arms .
Today , Hurndall is brain - dead and is kept alive on life - support equipment .
Tom 's father , Anthony , is a lawyer in the City of London .
After six weeks of investigation , Hurndall has come to the conclusion that the shooting of his son by Israeli forces is " a case of attempted murder .
If Tom dies , and that is a likelihood , then it will be murder , " he said .
Jocelyn Hurndall wrote to The Guardian after an Israeli government check for about $ 12,000 , sent to the Hurndall family to pay for " a fraction of the expenses incurred , " bounced .
When the check finally arrived after five months of negotiations with the Hurndall family , the Israeli government check was not " honored " by the Bank of Israel , Hurndall wrote .
" Insufficient funds ' was the reason given .
According to evidence provided in Sweeney 's film , the IDF report on the shooting of Hurndall is completely wrong about where he was , what he was wearing , and what he was doing when an Israeli soldier shot him in the head .
" It is a mind - numbing task to understand the morality and to use the logic of the Israeli government , " Hurndall wrote .
" What hope do Palestinians have when such profound disregard and disrespect is shown to humanity , collectively and individually ? "
SILENCED WITNESSES
T he BBC film was produced by John Sweeney , whose article on the killings , " Silenced Witnesses , " was published in The Independent ( UK ) on Oct. 30 .
" Making our film , When Killing is Easy , has been the most harrowing ordeal of my professional life , " Sweeney wrote .
" But it is vital that it is evidential - and that is really tough when the Israeli government and the Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) have refused to speak to us . "
Rachel Corrie , the first of the three to die , was using her body to defend the home of Dr. Samir Nasser Allah from an American - made bulldozer used by the Israeli army to demolish the homes of Palestinians .
Corrie was a member of the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) .
ISM members stand between the Israeli bulldozers and the homes that the IDF wants to flatten .
Israeli bulldozers have razed thousands of Palestinian homes in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank .
The bulldozers are primarily made by the Illinois - based Caterpillar company .
Tom Dale , an ISM eyewitness , had a clear view of the incident : " He [ the driver ] knew absolutely she was there .
The bulldozer waited for a few seconds over her body and it then reversed , leaving its scoop down so that if she had been under the bulldozer , it would have crushed her a second time .
Only later when it was much more clear of her body did it raise its scoop . "
" MY BACK IS BROKEN "
" M y back is broken , " Rachel told Alice Coy , a fellow ISM activist who was with her .
An Israeli pathologist , Dr. Yehudah Hiss , noted that Rachel appeared to have been run over by the bulldozer , Sweeney wrote .
Hiss found the cause of death to be " pressure to the chest . "
Her shoulder blades had been crushed ; her spine was broken in five places and six ribs broken .
Her face was apparently slashed by the bulldozer blade .
The IDF produced a report that says , " Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle . "
It added , " for good measure " Sweeney says , that Corrie was " hidden from view of the vehicle 's operator . "
The footage seen in the BBC film proves these statements to be false .
The family of Rachel Corrie believes the IDF report to " be a blatant fabrication , " Sweeney wrote .
The British cameraman James Miller was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he left a house in Rafah with two other journalists on the night of May 2 .
An Associated Press TV News ( APTN ) cameraman filmed the entire scene .
One of the three journalists held a white flag ; Miller was shining a light on the flag and a third journalist held up her British passport .
There was no shooting and the area was quiet as the audio track of the film clearly proves .
The three had walked about 60 feet toward an Israeli armed personnel carrier to request safe passage to leave the area when the first shot was fired .
" We are British journalists , " Saira Shah cried out into the darkness .
" Then comes the second shot , which killed James , " Sweeney wrote .
" He was shot in the front of his neck .
The bullet was Israeli issue , fired , according to a forensic expert , from less than 200 meters [ 600 feet ] away . "
The IDF maintains that Miller was shot during crossfire , although no shooting is heard on the APTN tape apart from the two shots fired from the Israeli military vehicle .
When the APTN tape was shown to an Israeli soldier , who is shown in the film , he said the television team did not look like Islamic terrorists and concluded : " That 's murder . "

On April 9th , 1948 , a month before Israel declared independence , just over one hundred residents of Deir Yassin were massacred by members of two militant Zionist groups – Lehi and Irgun – as part of an effort to cleanse the area of its Arab population .
The next day , Albert Einstein wrote the following passionate letter to Shepard Rifkin , a New York - based representative of Lehi who had recently written to Einstein in the hope of garnering some high - profile support for the group ’s efforts .
His belief that Einstein – a man who publicly backed the creation of a Jewish homeland in the British Mandate of Palestine , but by different means – would agree to such a suggestion was clearly misplaced .

L4D2 , TF2 , Portal And Steam Coming To Apple In April
After much speculation and some not - so - subtle hinting , Valve has officially announced a Mac version of popular gaming service Steam coming in April , and its bringing Left 4 Dead 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Counter - Strike , Portal and the Half - Life series with it .
While rumblings of Steam coming to the Mac platform have been stirring for quite some time , the first solid indicators came last month , when Mac - specific graphics were found in the beta test files for the new Steam service .
Then Valve took things a step further , teasing Mac users with a series of images featuring popular Valve games integrated with Mac themes .
“ As we transition from entertainment as a product to entertainment as a service , customers and developers need open , high - quality Internet clients , ” said Gabe Newell , President of Valve .
“ The Mac is a great platform for entertainment services . ”
The Mac version of Steam will include all of the features of its PC counterpart , as well as a new feature called Steam Play , which allows customers who purchase the game on one platform to download and play it for the other at no additional charge .
While it remains to be seen how many third - party developers will jump on board the Mac train , Valve is full - steam ahead on supporting the platform , eschewing popular emulation techniques to deliver native Mac games , day and date with the PC versions from here on out .
“ We looked at a variety of methods to get our games onto the Mac and in the end decided to go with native versions rather than emulation , ” said John Cook , Director of Steam Development .
“ The inclusion of WebKit into Steam , and of OpenGL into Source gives us a lot of flexibility in how we move these technologies forward .
We are treating the Mac as a tier - 1 platform so all of our future games will release simultaneously on Windows , Mac , and the Xbox 360 .
Updates for the Mac will be available simultaneously with the Windows updates .
Furthermore , Mac and Windows players will be part of the same multiplayer universe , sharing servers , lobbies , and so forth .
We fully support a heterogeneous mix of servers and clients .
The first Mac Steam client will be the new generation currently in beta testing on Windows . ”
Valve ’s first simultaneous release for Mac and PC will be Portal 2 , announced earlier this month .
And now Mac users will be able to experience the joy of a large Steam release .
I ca n’t wait to share that with you guys .

ED Balls has condemned children 's commissioner Dr Maggie Atkinson for using her years of professional experience in forming an opinion .
The schools secretary has called for an inquiry into how a qualified person with qualifications qualifying them to do their job could qualify their statements on matters they are qualified to comment on .
Balls said : " Responsible governance is not about taking the advice of proper experts , it 's about Jamie Oliver making a nice salad or asking that large television nanny to dictate childcare policy even though she does seem to limit herself to houses with steps . "
Julian Cook , professor of public policy at Reading University , said : " The public is often caught between highly trained experts who have studied a subject in depth and actually know what they are talking about and the bastard , son of a bitch whores we call politicians who spend their entire lives with the throbbing penis of the editor of the Daily Mail lodged firmly inside their filthy , lying mouths .
" It 's difficult to know who to trust . "
Meanwhile Dr Atkinson 's statement – that children are qualitatively different from adults and should perhaps be treated as such – was condemned by members of the public who did not understand most of the words in it .
Nikki Hollis , a female thing from Carlisle , said : " This woman is basically saying that all children under 12 who are possessed by the devil should be given a loaded machine gun .
" If I see her round here I 'll set my evil dog on her . "
Teeth care is particularly important in pregnancy Successful treatment for gum disease cuts the risk of pregnant women giving birth early , US research suggests .
The preliminary research showed those whose gum disease was not treated successfully were three times more likely to give birth before 35 weeks .
The study of 160 women was presented to the annual conference of the American Association for Dental Research .
UK experts said the finding was " controversial " but advised pregnant women to take care of teeth and gums .
Doctors have previously established that severe gum infections cause an increase in the production of prostaglandin and tumour necrosis factor , chemicals which induce labour , to be produced .
The study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania enrolled women who were between six and 20 weeks ' pregnant .
This paper adds to the growing evidence around links between gum disease and pre-term babies
Dr Nigel Carter , chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation
All of the volunteers had gum disease .
These women were given treatment , which was successful in one third of the cases .
The researchers found a " strong and significant association " between successful treatment and full - term births .
Those whose treatment did not work were " significantly more likely " to give birth before 35 weeks .
' Controversial area' UK experts warned that this was a small study and further research was needed .
Professor Iain Chapple , from Birmingham Dental School , said this was a " controversial area " , and that while some previous studies had shown an association between gum disease and early births , others had shown no association .
He said the results " could reflect behavioural differences in the successfully treated group versus the unsuccessfully treated group " such as " poorer diets , smoking status , alcohol intake and many other issues " .
But Dr Nigel Carter , chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation , said : " This paper adds to the growing evidence around links between gum disease and pre-term babies .
" It is further strong evidence that pregnant women should take care of their periodontal health and receive appropriate treatment during their pregnancy to reduce as far as possible their chance of a pre-term birth . "
' Only one clue '
This advice was echoed by the pregnancy research charity Tommy's .
Its consultant midwife , Annette Briley , said : " Women in the UK do get free dental care during pregnancy and for a year after the baby 's birth .
" It is therefore good to go to the dentist early in pregnancy and ensure that your mouth , teeth and gums are as healthy as they can be .
" However , the causes of preterm birth are multifactorial and many women with no periodontal disease may still have their babies early , this is only one clue to one cause . "

Google AppEngine - Easy free file hosting
As StationRipper has grown , the installer size has gotten bigger .
A quick download with a installer less than 1 MB has gone to almost 3MB .
I have good hosting through ActiveHost , but they are n't really set up to be a major file - serving site ( or at least , I 'm not willing to pay the cost to put the entire server on a direct 100 MB backbone connection ) .
People are impatient - doubly so on the internet .
So the 60k / sec users were getting is no longer very good - I assume a fair number get bored and move on :)
I 've looked at drop.io , which I 've seen get up to 800 MB / sec on , but that is n't a direct file link ( the user needs to click through ) .
Plus , last week they randomly disabled my drop ( still not sure why ) , so I do n't find that to be a viable solution .
I 've been learning Google AppEngine , and it occurred to me that I could create a app that JUST serves my installer .
That could serve as a mirror or the main download area , as I could create a direct download link to the file .
It actually took a while to figure out how to do this , mainly because of something non-obvious ( if you have a catch all , like url : /.* before other handlers , you 'll end up using the catch all instead .
I originally was just trying to get this working on a bigger project , and stuck the static handler at the end of the app.
yaml - and it did n't work , because of the catch all )
If you do n't have it already , get Python and the AppEngine SDK ( general info here ) .
Download and install Python 2.5 Download and install the AppEngine SDK
Create your app directory
Create a directory under it called static
Create your app.yaml file in the main directory .
It should look like :
application : yourappname
version : 1
runtime : python
api_version : 1
handlers :
- url : /(.*\.( gif|png|jpg|exe ) )
static_files : static/\1
upload : static /(.*\.( gif|png|jpg|exe ) )
The static file handler will handle gif , png , jpg , and exe in the above .
Add whatever else you need .
Copy your static files to the static directory ( in my case , I only have one exe ) Change yourappname to whatever your app is called ( you 'll need to get that set up on AppSpot before deploying ) Deploy it .
If you do n't have it already , get a AppEngine account Create a new Application ( should be the same what you used for " yourappname " )
I deploy with the AppEngine Laucher - run it , go to File -> Add Existing Application , and point it to your main directory .
Then click on that app and go to Control -> Deploy
Here 's a direct link to the installer on my AppSpot :
http://stationportal.appspot.com/StationRipperInst.exe.
I 'm not exactly sure how fast it is ( as it 's SO fast ) - what takes a couple of minutes on my domain is n't even showing as downloading , it 's so blazingly fast .
I have briefly seen 1,500 / MB sec show .. so it 's FAST !
You get 1GB of file transfer for FREE every 24 hours .
So I 'll get about 350 downloads a day for free .
Additional costs 12 cents per GB , which is fairly cheap as long as I do n't get Slashdot 'd or on the Digg front page ( last time I had that happen I hit 210,977 downloads in a month , so I 'd end up paying some for this )
Under " Billing Settings " you can add a CC for overages - and under " Change Budget " from that page you can put the entire budget to Bandwidth Out .
There are two things you need to understand – the dam has broke and there will be no end of Ghostbusters inspired t- shirts .
This is a good thing .
Also , “ Shirt City ” is a tongue twister – say it three times fast .
Go ahead .
Shirt City has a variety of movie and TV inspired t- shirts , many revolving around beloved cars , so it should be no surprise to find the Ecto - 1 in there somewhere .
The shirt comes in a variety of colours , though the print uses the shirt colour as its black , so unless it ’s on a dark or black t- shirt , it looks a little odd .
Still , as boring black tees go , this is pretty awesome .
Thanks to Tim , who posted this over at Dan and James ’s Ghostbusters rejected pitch page .
STATEN ISLAND , N.Y . -- A 9 - year - old New Dorp boy earlier today learned there is no wiggle room in the Department of Education 's " no toy gun " policy -- even if the toy gun is just two inches long .
Patrick Timoney , a fourth - grader at PS 52 , South Beach , was nearly suspended after playing with LEGOs during his lunch period because one of the action figures was carrying at toy machine gun .
He and his friends had planned a playdate with their respective toys , and were sitting around the cafeteria table when the principal walked in and saw the action figure carrying the fake gun .
While the action figure was a standard LEGO policeman figure , the brand of the gun could not be determined .
" She took him into her office in the middle of the lunch period and he was crying , " said the boy 's mother , Laura Timoney .
" He was afraid . "
The principal called Ms. Timoney and said she considered the toy suspension - worthy , and that she was going to double - check with a security administrator from the city Department of Education .
According to Ms. Timoney , the administrator said the toy should be confiscated and returned to the parents at the end of the day , and that no other action was necessary .
" It 's crazy , " Ms. Timoney said .
" He 's missing class time , all for silly toys .
The boys are just trying to relax .
If there 's a real threat , why not call the Police Department ? "
She pointed out that another child had an action figure that was holding an ax , but that only Patrick was reprimanded .
" When are we going to take responsibility for common sense and logic ? " Ms. Timoney said .
The DOE 's discipline code says that all imitation weapons are prohibited , but , before considering suspension , it is up to a principal to decide whether a fake gun looks realistic , by evaluating the color , size , shape , appearance and weight .
A message left for Principal Evelyn Matroianni was not returned .
However , Margie Feinberg , a spokeswoman for the DOE , said there is a no- tolerance policy when it comes to fake guns because they are considered harmful to the school community .
" Toy guns are not allowed in schools , " she said , adding that a conference was held among the principal , the parents and the student about the topic .
" The issue was resolved , " Ms. Feinberg said .
" The child will not be bringing the toy gun into school . "

Deep Auriga

Explanation :
The plane of our Milky Way Galaxy runs right through Auriga , the Charioteer .
A good part of the ancient northern constellation 's rich collection of nebulae and star clusters is featured in this expansive , 10 degree wide skyscape .
Bright star Elnath lies near the bottom right , linking Auriga to another constellation , Taurus , the Bull .
Three open star clusters , Charles Messier 's M36 , M37 , and M38 line up in the dense star field above and left of Elnath , familiar to many binocular - equipped skygazers .
But the deep exposure also brings out the reddish emission nebulae of star - forming regions IC 405 , IC 410 , and IC 417 .
E. E. Barnard 's dark nebulae B34 and B226 just stand out against a brighter background .

The bankruptcy of Lehman Bros. in September 2008 is widely seen as the event that kicked the financial meltdown into high gear .
So it makes sense that the report released last week by Lehman ’s bankruptcy examiner should stand as the one indispensable analysis of how Wall Street almost brought the U.S. economy crashing down .
The uncompromising report should put to rest the self - serving claims by Lehman ’s ex-Chairman Richard S. Fuld that the firm was destroyed by rumors , short selling , stock manipulation and an unwarranted loss of confidence by clients and trading partners .
In 2,200 pages , the examiner , Anton R. Valukas , lays out the truth in all its ugly glory : Lehman ’s fall was 100 % its own fault .
Not that there were n’t accessories to the crime .
Every institution tasked with overseeing Lehman ’s management and performance got hoodwinked .
Credit rating firms , outside auditors , board members and Fuld ’s cheerleaders at CNBC all bought into a corporate strategy animated by greed and stupidity .
In March 2008 , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve placed full - time teams at Lehman to keep an eye on its financial condition ; yet they missed what was bubbling under the surface .
The examination by Valukas , a former federal prosecutor , expert in white - collar crime and chairman of the Chicago law firm Jenner & Block , was ordered by the Bankruptcy Court to determine whether there was any fraud or other wrongdoing before Lehman ’s bankruptcy filing and whether there ’s any money to be recovered from its executives or business partners .
Valukas found not much of the latter and plenty of the former .
He also determined that a government rescue of Lehman , a la Bear Stearns or AIG , was never in the cards -- the firm could n’t find a willing buyer as Bear Stearns had , and unlike AIG it lacked the assets and collateral needed to fund a government bailout loan .
His report points to the necessity of meaningful oversight of big financial institutions by the federal government , something that needs to be preserved in the regulatory reform bill introduced by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
Let ’s take a quick tour of the Lehman inferno , with Valukas in the role of Dante .
We ’ll leave aside , for the moment , his disclosure of how Lehman used a clever accounting device to conceal its true fiscal condition .
The broader story is its mistimed bet on high - risk lending .
Lehman was not alone on Wall Street in deciding in 2006 to shift out of its old business model of making loans for sale to other investors and into making investments for its own books -- a change Valukas describes as going from the “ moving ” to the “ storage ” business .
But it was acquiring exactly the sort of assets that would be hard to unload in a downturn , such as low - quality mortgages , commercial real estate investments and loans to overleveraged companies .
The downturn arrived in 2007 .
The spread of the subprime virus prompted other investment banks to flee those assets , but Lehman ’s brass doubled down , telling the board that with everyone else rushing for the exits , Lehman was poised to reap “ substantial opportunities . ”
Just as business was shrinking , Lehman ’s net assets soared to about $ 400 billion , an increase of nearly 50 % from the beginning of 2006 through the first quarter of 2008 .
This gives the lie to the argument that Lehman ’s officers and directors are being blamed unfairly for overlooking problems visible only in hindsight :
They saw the train coming but chose not to get out of the way .
As Valukas tells the tale , directors ’ most common explanation boils down to this :
It seemed like a good idea at the time .
Lehman had rules and procedures to ensure that it did not take on more risk than it could safely manage .
These included limits on the size of individual deals and on total holdings of certain assets .
But when the constraints threatened to dampen the party , Lehman simply rolled over them .
The firm subjected its portfolio to regular stress testing , which means calculating its potential losses from a range of bad - case scenarios ; but it excluded its riskiest real estate and private equity investments from the tests .
When the level of its risky holdings exceeded its risk limits , it simply raised the limits .
This resembles trying to lose weight by counting calories but leaving cupcakes and ice cream out of the calculation , and fitting into your wardrobe by buying bigger clothes .
Of course , it defeats the purpose of having any risk limits at all .
As Lehman found itself stuck with a unmarketably toxic portfolio during the credit freeze of 2007 , an executive lectured a colleague in an e-mail reproduced in the report : “ In case we ever forget ; this is why one has concentration limits and overall portfolio limits .
Markets do seize up . ”
When the reckoning arrived , Lehman resorted to sleight of hand .
Pressured by investors and regulators to sharply reduce its leverage -- that is , the size of its ( very risky ) investment portfolio compared with its capital -- the firm became addicted to a form of repurchase agreement known as Repo 105 .
Repurchase agreements , or repos , are common enough on Wall Street as a device for short - term financing .
You borrow against an asset , subject to an agreement to repay the money , plus interest and a fee , and take the asset back from the lender a few days hence .
But the asset remains on your balance sheet .
Repo 105 was different .
Lehman booked these deals as sales .
This enabled it to take the assets off its balance sheet , making it look smaller and sharply reducing its reported leverage .
In 2007 and 2008 , Lehman executives sharply escalated their use of Repo 105 , especially near the end of each quarter when the heat was on to show reduced leverage .
A few days after quarter ’s end , of course , the assets were back on its books .
Insiders knew that Repo 105 had no economic purpose but was used solely for window dressing : “ It is another drug we r on [ sic ] , ” an executive complained in an internal e-mail .
A whistle - blower told Lehman ’s auditing firm , Ernst & Young , about the extraordinary popularity of Repo 105 , but the auditors did n’t look into the claim , which Valukas believes may constitute “ professional malpractice . ”
( E&Y says it did its auditing properly . )
Dick Fuld crowed to Wall Street about Lehman ’s success in reducing leverage , as if it had done so by selling hard - to - market assets as investors and regulators wanted .
He and other top executives told Valukas that they were n’t aware how Repo 105 was used .
Valukas makes it quite clear that he thinks they ’re lying , but says the truth is up to a court to decide .
His report points to several important lessons .
One is the folly of relying on self - discipline and self - regulation in the financial markets .
The credit - rating firms were utterly useless in appraising Lehman ’s true condition .
Ernst &
Young ’s dereliction seems so extreme that it deserves harsh punishment , maybe even extinction ( “ to obliterate , to punish and to discourage others , ” John le Carre wrote in another context ) .
And I ’d love to hear an argument for allowing any of Lehman ’s independent directors , who seem seldom to have asked a penetrating question , ever to serve on a corporate board again .
As I write , those 10 directors , who pulled down better than $ 100,000 cash a year to sit jointly in the driver ’s seat for Lehman ’s race to disaster , still boast at least 15 company directorships among them .
Does this make you confident that corporate America is in good hands ?
Me neither .

A friend of mine who went to a Catholic school was recently reminiscing about her sex education as a teenager : it involved a video of two dogs … mating .
As a young woman she was terrified , and who can blame her ?
I 'm sure her school was n't the only one to resort to such methods .
Sex education for young people will probably always involve some discomfort .
And this is England ; we remain famous for our prudishness .
Last year Sheffield NHS trust tried something new and published a booklet called Pleasure .
Its aim was to make sex education more approachable .
The authors took a holistic view , so sex and sexual pleasure is described as forming part of our general wellbeing , like exercise and eating apples .
Pleasure tries to go beyond the normal formula of embarrassed exposures of the nuts and bolts of physical reproduction .
Masturbation is encouraged , and – shock horror – the clitoris is mentioned .
A multi-denominational Christian group , the Maranatha Community , has recently derided the booklet , claiming that it is " a form of child abuse . "
In their eyes the leaflet promotes promiscuity and they even claim that NHS Sheffield has been " morally irresponsible . "
These are strong criticisms , but they are not surprising .
Christians are obsessed with sex .
Is it because we are afraid of it ?
Or is it that we feel that sex should be undertaken out of a sense of duty ?
Finding comfort and joy in our bodies makes many uncomfortable and yet it is a key aspect of the Christian faith .
Faith should enrich our enjoyment , not diminish it .
Sex can or even should be fun .
Like life itself our bodies are gifts from God , not embarrassing burdens .
Sex ought to be a celebration of our bodies and a testament to the power of love .
What a terrible impact the misunderstanding of the events in the Garden of Eden has had .
The Roman Catholic stance still stands : sex is for married people only and its end is mainly procreation .
Try telling that to a 16 - year - old boy on the Old Kent Road .
It might even be fair to guess that those who make a decision to only have sex within marriage is as rare – in some communities at least – as the vocation to celibacy .
Some form of sex education is necessary .
There were 55,000 teenage pregnancies in the UK last year , far outstripping all other European countries .
The abortion rate here is higher than anywhere else in Europe too .
So something is n't working .
In a survey of 20,000 teenagers more than half of those questioned felt that their sex education was inadequate .
Maybe flashing the mating dogs as a last resort is still going on in some places .
The children , schools and families bill will for the first time make sex education compulsory in primary schools .
Unfortunately faith schools will be able to opt out ( though Ed Balls has denied this ) .
They will be able to disparage homosexuality and condone female submission to men .
Hopefully the bill , currently at its third reading in the House of Commons , will be changed and a stop put to this .
Faith schools should not exist to indoctrinate .
Education should be about widening children 's view of the world , not narrowing it .
There are other ways to teach children about sex and relationships , such as developing art projects or creating safe and encouraging spaces where young people can ask questions and learn from each other .
Another option maybe to ask children to write their own sex education booklet .
That way we can see what they do n't know or understand by what is missing .
Whilst it is important to encourage children to feel comfortable about their sexuality , we should never be blase about it in this age of sexual emancipation .
Sex is not a right .
Neither is having good , safe sex the same as having a new mobile phone .
Within faith communities people should be encouraged to think carefully and creatively about their bodies , relationships and future .
Why can't the church lead the way and provide balanced sex education opportunities for young people ?
Instead of pointing the finger at those who have made brave attempts , we should be embracing new methods of approaching this tricky subject .

McLaren , Mercedes GP and at least two other teams will have to make modifications to their diffuser designs in time for the Australian Grand Prix , AUTOSPORT has learned , after the FIA told them that it is clamping down on a loophole being used by the outfits .
Discussions took place between the FIA and representatives from four teams over the season - opening Bahrain Grand Prix weekend about the size of starter motor holes in their diffusers .
The size of their starter motor holes was believed to be excessively wide , which , although not in breach of the regulations , was reckoned to be going against the spirit of the rules .
F1's technical regulations state that a hole can exist in the diffuser to allow access for an engine starter motor - although there are no strict dimensions laid down .
Article 3.12.7 states : " A single break in the surface is permitted solely to allow the minimum required access for the device referred to in Article 5.15 .
[ supposed to refer to starter motor , although this is Article 5.16 ] . "
There is no specific definition of what the ' minimum ' size is though - so some teams have been using exotically shaped starter motors to allow themselves to feature wide - shaped holes in the diffusers .
This concept was pioneered by Brawn GP in 2009 .
Such a hole in the diffuser helps create another tunnel for air to flow through - which as well as helping to produce more downforce , also ensures such downforce is more consistent throughout a lap - especially under braking , when the rear of the car rises up and the airflow can stall .
The FIA inspected the diffuser designs in Bahrain and promised to issue a clarification about the matter after the weekend had finished .
AUTOSPORT understands that the FIA has duly sent a note to all teams , laying down strict dimensions for not only a maximum diameter for the holes but also for a maximum projected area .
It is believed that McLaren , Mercedes and two other teams - believed to be Renault and Force India - will now have to make modifications to their diffuser designs in this area prior to the next race in Melbourne .
McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh said in Bahrain last weekend that his team was one of many that was under investigation over the matter .
" There are holes in the diffuser for the starter , the hole in ours is no bigger than the one on the championship winning car last year , " he said .
" And also no bigger than it is on about four other cars . "
The wage bill makes up 80 % of spending for police
The pay bill of police officers and staff in England and Wales should be frozen to protect frontline services , business organisation the CBI has said .
The recommendation - one of a series in a report on policing - would help maintain the fight on crime at a time of shrinking budgets , it says .
The CBI also echoed suggestions in a government White Paper that savings could be made by pooling resources .
The Police Federation questioned the group 's expertise on police finances .
Performance - related pay
The government White Paper published last year said police should save £ 100 m this year , rising to £ 545 m annually by 2014 .
The police wage bill currently accounts for 80 % of spending in the 43 forces .
At present , pay is negotiated nationally , with salary levels depending on length of service and seniority .
The CBI says an officer 's pay should be performance - related , linked to the outcome of their annual review .
But to create a climate in which such reforms could be introduced , it suggests freezing the overall police pay bill .
Some officers would still be awarded pay rises , but the costs would have to be offset elsewhere .
' Doubled - edged sword '
The report , A Frontline Force : Proposals For More Effective Policing , also looked at how savings could be made in administrative tasks such as human resources , and in IT , equipment procurement and the use of private staff in custody suites .
There is considerable scope for the police to find savings without compromising frontline policing
John Cridland , CBI CBI deputy director - general John Cridland said : " The public sector investment boom of recent years is coming to an end just at a time when our police forces are facing increasing pressure to fight terrorism and sophisticated computer fraud .
" There is considerable scope for the police to find savings without compromising frontline policing .
But this will require a major rethink of what we expect the police to do . "
The Police Federation , which represents 140,000 officers , said policing could not be treated like an ordinary business .
It pointed out that bonuses and special payments suggested by the CBI were already available to some officers .
Chairman Paul McKeever said : " This CBI report is a double - edged sword .
On the one hand it contains many sensible recommendations for improving efficiency that we have been calling for , such as improved collaboration , joint procurement and rationalising backroom functions .
" Yet on the other hand it contains several ill - informed suggestions focused purely on cost - cutting - namely , hiving off parts of the service for the benefit of private companies that the CBI represents and not for the greater good of the public . "

Here we have another reason to be disgusted with our own government .
In their defense of Islam , the Democracy , Human Rights and Labor division , of the US State Department has scolded some of our European allies for the conflict with Islam across the pond .
I am not calling for violence against Muslims in Europe , but of course non-Muslims are starting to turn against Muslims in Europe , and that is because Muslims have come there , shown the cultures of Europe no respect , and are constantly pushing to takeover , with no concerns for the beliefs of anyone else .
Below the article are three videos from Europe which show us how Islam is slowly devouring Europe .
For once our government needs to mind their own business .
Hat tip to Bare Naked Islam .
U.S. scolds Europe for Muslim discrimination
WASHINGTON –-
The discrimination Muslims face all across Europe is alarmingly on the rise , the U.S. said in a damning report on human rights , warning of a deteriorating rights situation worldwide , mainly due to raging conflicts .
“ [ We see ] discrimination against Muslims , including hate crimes , in Europe , ” Michael Posner , Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy , Human Rights and Labor , said Thursday , March 11 , announcing the release of the annual report on human rights .
The report , titled “ Country Reports on Human Rights Practices ” , drew a grim picture of bias against Muslims in many countries across Europe in 2009 .
It specifically highlighted the most recent case in Switzerland , where a constitutional amendment was passed to ban the construction of mosque minarets .
In Austria , the report said , there were excessive use of force by police and societal discrimination against Muslims , in addition to anti-Muslim tone in election campaigns .
It grilled Germany for a series of anti-Muslim trends , including preventing Muslim organizations from their right to represent their community , and court rulings against veiled Muslims working in schools .
“ A debate continued in Lower Saxony ’s state parliament over police security checks in mosques , ” the report added .
It also slammed two key allies , France and Britain , for their human rights records with respect to their Muslim minorities .
The annual report underlined the banning of Muslim face - veils in public in France , home to Europe ’s biggest Muslim minority , as one of the most blaring evidences .
“ Members of the Arab Muslim community continued to experience acts of harassment , particularly against immigrants of North African origin . ”
The human rights report also cited anti‑Islamic attacks against persons and property in Britain .
“ There were numerous incidents of violence against individuals and property , as well as a number of rallies and public gatherings with anti-Muslim messages . ”
Alarming
The wide - ranging report asserted that other rights abuses remained widespread across the world .
“ Often these violations relating to the integrity of the person are in countries where conflicts are occurring , ” said the report , which covers 194 countries .
It noted that 2009 was a year in which ethnic , racial and religious tensions triggered violent conflicts and serious human rights violations and fueled or exacerbated more than 30 wars or internal armed conflicts .
“ There still are an alarming number of reports of torture , extrajudicial killings , and other violations of universal human rights . ”
The US report focused on Iran and China accusing them of cracking down on opponents and increasing restrictions on the internet and other forms of information .
It particularly criticized Beijing for continued crackdowns on the Muslim Uighur minority and Tibetans .
“ The Chinese government ’s human rights records remain poor and worsening in some areas , including increased cultural and religious repression of ethnic minorities , ” said Posner , the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy , Human Rights and Labor .
He said they found that Iran ’s rights record “ degenerated ” during 2009 , with repression of protesters who took to the streets following the controversial presidential polls .
“ An already poor human rights situation rapidly deteriorated after the June elections .
“ It is a place where we are continuing to see severe repression of dissent and are continuing to pay great attention , ” said Posner .
The annual report also cited other countries , including Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and Sri Lanka , for worsening human rights situations .
US Record ?
The US , which has compiled human rights reports on other countries for the past 34 years , was quick to fend off criticism to its own rights record .
“ We hold every government , including our own , to a single universal standard , ” Bosner said .
But the fact is that the US is not reviewed in the State Department ’s annual report on human rights abuses .
The Obama administration is facing criticism over failure to shut down the notorious Guantanamo detention in Cuba , drone attacks in Pakistan and Somalia and civilian deaths in Afghanistan .
“ We ’re leading in some ways with this report but , by all means , others should feel free to say what they want about us , ” said Bosner .
America ’s rights situation will come under scrutiny this fall at the United Nations Human Rights Council .
“ We are also committed … in this year , to doing the first - ever universal periodic review report to the UN Human Rights Council , ” said Bosner .

Geert Wilders says his party is ready to find the middle ground A party that calls Islam a backward religion , wants a ban on headscarves in public life and has compared the Koran to Hitler 's Mein Kampf has made major gains in local elections in the Netherlands .
Geert Wilders ' Freedom Party ( PVV ) has become the biggest party in the medium - sized city of Almere , and the second biggest in the political capital of the Netherlands , The Hague .
Mr Wilders was visibly buoyed by the results , but was also combative in his reaction , and called the results the first step in the upcoming campaign for parliamentary elections .
" The national campaign begins today .
Today , in Almere and The Hague , tomorrow in all of the Netherlands On 9 June , we 'll conquer the Netherlands , " he said .
The question remains whether the party will be able to join local government in those two cities .
Dutch politics features a plethora of parties , and compromise is necessary to form coalitions .
Geert Wilders has said his party is ready to find the middle ground , but now he will be tested .
Other Dutch parties are loath to work together with the PVV because of its outspoken standpoints .
Controversy fuels popularity
These elections are seen as an important indicator as the country prepares for parliamentary elections in June .
The Labour Party 's withdrawal from the Dutch cabinet on 20 February , causing the cabinet to fall , is just the opportunity Geert Wilders has been waiting for .
Anti-Wilders protesters have donned headscarves in sympathy with Muslims Since releasing the anti-Islam film Fitna two years ago , and being refused entry into the UK last year , Mr Wilders has been riding high in the opinion polls .
His party has consistently polled as one of the biggest in the country .
The fact that he has been charged with fomenting hatred and discrimination has , if anything , only served to increase his popularity , at home and abroad .
The trial is currently on hold after two preliminary hearings , but will resume in the summer , and ultimately Wilders could face two years in prison if convicted .
But this , too , seems to have worked in the politician 's favour , with many seeing him as a champion of the right to free speech .
Mr Wilders is also riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment .
Many Dutch voters are tired of politics - as - usual .
That is reflected by the relatively poor showing in these municipal elections by the two major parties that formed the recent governing coalition , the Labour Party and the Christian Democrats .
Other parties which did well were the liberal D66 and the left - wing Green Left party - the two parties that have been most vocal against Geert Wilders .
The Dutch voters are split , but it is clear the established parties are struggling to stay in touch with them .

Founded in 2005 by two diehard beer lovers and homebrewers , we provide startup and established craft brewers with vital funding to help them launch , grow and flourish .
We have a deep understanding of the craft beer trade and a devout commitment to its success .
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - The head of the U.N. World Health Organization on Wednesday praised U.S. healthcare reforms signed by President Barack Obama this week as a breakthrough , stepping into a sharp domestic political debate .
“ The people in this country and their leaders are courageous .
That ( healthcare reform ) is an unprecedented achievement , ” WHO Director General Margaret Chan said .
She was speaking to reporters after a lecture in which she argued that unrestricted market forces were limited as a means of redressing imbalances in global health care .
The reforms of the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare sector passed by Congress after months of heated debate will extend health insurance to 32 million Americans who currently have none .
It will also bar insurers from refusing coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions , expand the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and impose new taxes on the wealthy .
Conservatives and other critics argue that it will send the U.S. budget deficit soaring and slow economic recovery , but also that it represents unwarranted federal intrusion into the freedom of individuals to make healthcare choices .
Chan has made clear her view that governments and global organizations such as WHO should make a case for market regulation to deliver more equitable health benefits .
“ Market forces , all by themselves , will not solve social problems .
That is why public health needs to be concerned , ” said Chan in a lecture at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ The hardest thing ... is persuading world leaders or ministers ... that health concerns can , in some instances , be more important than economic interests .
Economic growth is not , after all , the be-all , end - all , cure - all , ” said Chan , whose organization is based in Geneva .
She cited pharmaceutical companies which she said would not by themselves conduct costly research to deliver cheap drugs to combat preventable diseases that largely affect the poor .
It may soon be possible to walk on walls like Spider - Man with American researchers claiming to have invented a device that could lead to development of shoes or gloves which would stick and unstick to walls and also bear loads .
Researchers at Cornell University have created a palm - sized device that uses water surface tension as an adhesive bond , journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported .
According to lead researcher Paul Steen , the device , using rapid adhesion mechanism , could lead to such development of the shoes or gloves that stick and unstick to walls , or post - it - like notes that can bear loads .
The team took inspiration from a beetle native to Florida , which can adhere to a leaf with a force 100 times its own weight , yet also instantly unstick itself .
The device consists of a flat plate patterned with holes , each on the order of microns ( one - millionth of a meter ) .
A bottom plate holds a liquid reservoir , and in the middle is another porous layer .
An electric field applied by a common 9 - volt battery pumps water through the device and causes droplets to squeeze through the top layer .
The surface tension of the exposed droplets makes the device grip another surface -- much the way two wet glass slides stick together .
" In our everyday experience , these forces are relatively weak .
But if you make a lot of them and can control them , like the beetle does , you can get strong adhesion forces , " Steen said .
For example , one of the researchers ' prototypes was made with about 1,000 300 - micron - sized holes , and it can hold about 30 grams -- more than 70 paper clips .
They found that as they scaled down the holes and packed more of them onto the device , the adhesion got stronger .
They estimate , then , that a one - square - inch device with millions of 1 - micron - sized holes could hold more than 15 pounds .

The socialist agenda that some conservatives see lurking around every corner , hidden in everything from health insurance reform to stimulus spending to President Obama 's policies , exasperates Louisvillian Fred Hicks .
As the leader of a local socialist group , Hicks says the use of the " S - word " as a political smear is a gross mischaracterization that ignores the reality that socialism remains a lonely movement , with his 40 - person group struggling to get more than a dozen people to attend a meeting .
And yet while the term 's recent popularity irks Hicks , the retired professor says it 's also beginning to have an unexpected result :
It 's bringing newfound interest and attention to his cause .
" Suddenly there are more people who want to know what it actually is , " said Hicks , head of the Committee of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism , whose members seek more government regulation of business , health care and wages .
Nationwide , the Democratic Socialists of America partly credits the term 's usage with a 64 percent rise in memberships between 2008 and 2009 .
The party now has nearly 7,000 U.S. members , and the 1,000 - member Socialist Party USA has seen new chapters pop up in Kansas and Oklahoma .
Marvin Williams , who heads the Central Indiana chapter of the DSA , said that at a November convention , he noticed an increase in younger attendees , some drawn by " red- baiting " tactics , the practice of accusing people of being communist or socialist because of their liberal views .
" In my age group , I 've seen a dramatic rise in the number of people who understand and agree with socialism , " even though " getting people to actively participate is tough , " said Edward Elam , a 26 - year - old computer trainer who started a Young Democratic Socialists chapter at Jefferson Community College in 2007 that has since disbanded .
Elam said socialism does n't carry the same negative Cold War connotations it did 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , while interest has been further piqued by the recent banking crisis .
" This is a wonderful gift the Republicans are giving us , " said Frank Llewellyn , the national director of the DSA .
" We 've had more attention in the last 12 months than in the last 12 years .
But most people do n't have a clue what socialism is . "
Indeed , there 's been no shortage of socialist name - calling , from John McCain 's presidential campaign saying that Obama 's policies resembled socialism , to the Republican National Committee 's resolution calling on Democrats to " stop pushing our country toward socialism " to right - wing radio hosts equating the U.S. economic stimulus program to that of communist Russia .
Catherine Fosl , who directs the Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research at the University of Louisville - and who describes herself as a democratic socialist - said the term is still a " powerful epithet " because of nearly a century of anti-communist rhetoric in the United States .
" It 's being used by the right to discredit very minor reforms that involve using government , " Fosl said .
" Obama 's positions are less socialistic than FDR's Social Security plan . "
Socialism in Kentucky has never gained much of a foothold , despite its history of having strong immigrant - backed branches in Northern Kentucky in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
The Socialist Party of Louisville in the early 1900s was known for political campaigns , lectures and pamphleteering .
But it was crippled after its Jefferson Street headquarters was raided in 1920 by federal officials during a national crackdown on radicals .
No member was ever elected to a major office , and the movement further lost steam in the era of McCarthyism .
In 1954 , Louisville activist Anne Braden , who had ties to leftist groups , was charged along with her husband with sedition after segregationists claimed communists seeking publicity had bombed a house she helped buy for a black family to protest Jim Crow housing practices .
It was never proved , and the charges against Anne Braden were eventually dropped .
The Cold War , President Ronald Reagan and the demise of communism in the Soviet Union led many activists to splinter into issue - specific social justice groups , said Fosl , who studies left - leaning political movements .
Bryan Reinholdt , a 29 - year - old Louisville elementary school teacher , said it was the economic inequalities he noticed in the United States after serving in Iraq in 2005 with the Army that led him to read about , and join , the socialists .
" Socialism can be a dirty word , because it 's never been done right .
Some people just think of Stalin and totalitarian regimes , " he said .
Out of 2.9 million registered Kentucky voters , only 36 were affiliated with the Socialist Workers party .
Indiana does not track voter affiliations .
Today , Elam , Hicks and others say they 're fielding more questions than ever before as the term re-enters America 's political lexicon .
" The question you get is , what is socialism , or is Obama a socialist ? " said Billy Wharton , co-chairman of the Socialist Party USA .
" People like to say Obama 's a socialist , but he is n't anything close . "
There 's no precise definition , but Wharton 's group wants a $ 15 minimum hourly wage , 30 - hour workweeks , guaranteed employment , single - payer health care , community ownership of corporations , more graduated taxation and state - owned banks .
Some socialists say they do n't want to destroy markets or nationalize everything , but they want less - stagnant wages , more regulation , and taxes that fund everyone 's health care , education , unemployment insurance and job training .
Fosl said she 'd like to see higher minimum wages , guaranteed family - leave time and more government subsidies for housing and higher education .
But many view socialism as a perspective , rather than a system they ever see being enacted .
" Here 's the thing about socialism , " Hicks said .
" You can't march on city hall and demand socialism .
You can demand single - payer health care , but socialism is n't on the table .
And I do n't see any point in voting for a third party that gets half a percent of the vote . "
Still , he hopes the issues socialists view as important will now get more attention and begin to change people 's views .
A recent Rasmussen Reports poll found that 53 percent of Americans thought capitalism was better than socialism ; 20 percent preferred socialism ; and 27 percent were uncertain .
" There 's a mistrust of government in this country , so people do n't want the government taking charge of health care , banking or even schools , " Hicks said .
" But hopefully with what 's going on nationally , we can keep the idea of real socialism alive . "

( CNN ) --
A man serving eight years for vehicular homicide because of a fatal crash involving his Toyota Camry is hoping for exoneration amid concerns over unintended acceleration in some of Toyota 's vehicles .
Koua Fong
Lee has always maintained his innocence in the 2006 crash .
Then 29 years old , he was driving home from Sunday services with his pregnant wife , father , daughter , brother and niece in his 1996 Toyota Camry .
Lee told investigators that he pumped the brakes as he exited I - 94 in St. Paul , Minnesota , and approached an intersection , his lawyer , Brent Schaefer , said .
But Ramsey County prosecutors claimed Lee had his foot on the gas as he approached cars waiting at a red light .
The car was moving at between 70 and 90 mph when it struck two other vehicles .
Javis Adams , 33 , and his 10 - year - old son , Javis Adams Jr. , were killed instantly .
Another passenger , 6 - year - old Devyn Bolton , was left paraplegic .
She testified in a wheelchair at Lee 's trial and later died from her injuries .
Two mechanical engineers examined the car before trial on behalf of the state and the defense , Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said .
Both concluded the brakes were operating and there were no problems with the acceleration , she said .
Although the throttle was found set open at 15 percent , which is unusual , the abnormality was attributed at the time to damage from the crash , she said .
" Bottom line , two experts -- one for each side -- said there was nothing wrong with the car , " she said .
A jury convicted Lee of criminal vehicular homicide and he was sentenced to eight years in prison .
But he continues to maintain his innocence .
" I know that lives were lost that day , but I did everything within my power to try to stop that vehicle , " Lee said in a recent prison interview with CNN affiliate KARE .
" I never intended for this to happen . "
The 1996 Camry is not a part of Toyota 's recall .
Relatives of the victims , who asked the judge to give him the maximum sentence , now support him , said Bob Hilliard , a Texas lawyer who is preparing a lawsuit against Toyota on the family 's behalf .
" I am passionate about getting him out and suing Toyota , " Hilliard told CNN .
He said the family feels " betrayed " by the evidence that led to Lee 's conviction .
" It was all smoke and mirrors , " Hilliard said .
" I hope to get to the bottom of it and find the truth , " Quincy Adams , who survived the crash but lost his son , told KARE .
" I feel that the boy [ Koua Fong Lee ] is innocent . "
Lee 's accident is among the first of a growing number of cases getting a second look since Toyota announced a recall , acknowledging that problems with sudden acceleration were more extensive than originally thought .
In testimony last week before Congress , company executives apologized for underestimating the problem .
Complete coverage of the Toyota recall
A search of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's online complaint database revealed 526 incidents listed for the 1996 Toyota Camry .
Among the complaints concerning air bags , tires , steering and visibility were at least two dozen related to " vehicle speed control , " some dating back to 1997 .
" The contact states that while driving at 65 mph when placing her foot on the brake and slowing down , the vehicle accelerated on its own , " an October 17 , 2009 , report states .
" By putting extreme pressure on the brake , she was able to pull over and turned off vehicle . "
In a July 26 , 2003 , incident , a 1996 Camry waiting at a red light lurched forward into oncoming traffic , where it was struck by a car and a motorcycle .
The complaint states that the motorcyclist died five years later of injuries caused by the accident .
" With Toyota in the news , found reports of other 1996 Camry 's [ sic ] with sudden acceleration so filed this complaint , " the incident summary states .
Not all the entries for " vehicle speed control " complain of sudden acceleration .
" On several occasions the vehicle failed to respond when the accelerator was depressed , " a February 25 , 1998 complaint says .
Toyota recalled more than 8 million vehicles , prompting Lee 's attorney to seek a re-examination of the vehicle in the 2006 accident .
" This never seemed right .
A man with his family in the car -- his pregnant wife -- goes on a suicide mission ?
Then , the recalls started , and the complaints sounded just like what happened to Mr. Lee , " lawyer Brent Schaefer said .
" It sounds just like a case of unintended acceleration . "
Schaefer says he has filed paperwork with the court stating his intention to retest the car , which remains in a vehicle impound .
" We plan to employ experts familiar with the '96 Camry and the components that make up car to show that rapid acceleration is to blame for the accident , not Mr. Lee accidentally stepping on the accelerator , " he said .
Gaertner said her office is willing to cooperate with the examination and see where the results lead .
" We have no interest in an innocent man being behind bars .
Accordingly , we are very open to considering evidence that might show that in fact he was n't guilty , " Gaertner said .
" If we 're going to disturb a conviction we need evidence . "

TEL AVIV — Dubai 's police chief said it will enforce an entry ban on Israeli dual nationals , the first sanction by the emirate following its allegations Israeli intelligence agents murdered a top Hamas leader there in January .
Though the countries have no diplomatic ties , Israeli dual nationals , mostly business people , have entered the United Arab Emirates relatively unhindered under second passports .

Never let it be said that TVSquad.com is guilty of burying the lede .
Earlier today , the site posted an interview with comedian David Cross , largely about his new stand - up special ( David Cross : Bigger And Blackerer ) and a new British series he 's doing .
But right up front , interviewer Joel Keller excerpts the part most people will be most interested in : Cross ' opinion that the Arrested Development movie is dead in the water .
Granted , that 's entirely speculation on his part , based not on speaking to anyone involved , but just general circumstance :
How many times have you had to answer questions about the reunion movie at this point , by the way ?
Including today ?
Um , I would guess like somewhere between six and seven hundred times .
Is there anything going on with that at this point ?
I think what I will tell you , it 's not going to happen .
It 's not official , but I just do n't think it 's going to happen .
Way too much time it 's been ( since the show ended ) .
I mean , there 's so many people involved .
Everyone 's doing their own thing , you know .
And everybody 's aged .
It 's just not going to happen .
I 'm sure I speak for everybody when I say we'd love for it to happen , we 'd love to work on it , but just I do n't think … not going to happen .

Cross also goes on to talk about why he thinks it'd be weird to see those characters on the big screen , and how he'd rather see some sort of one - off TV special reunion instead .
Which further emphasizes that this is all opinion , and not based on any formal announcement or decision .
Nonetheless , it 's all over the web , so brace yourselves for further frenzied speculation .
While that 's going on , feel free to read the rest of the interview , which is full of that same weird inverted language ( " way too much time it 's been ? "
Has Cross been taking Yoda diction lessons ? ) but is generally informative and interesting , and touches on issues ranging from details of the new special to Cross ' personal political disillusion .
All of which frankly seems a little solider than his general speculation on AD 's future .

ANOTHER week , another massive drug bust .
This one was on Thursday in Hinchinbrook , where the police found a drug laboratory said to be capable of producing $ 10 million worth of ecstasy .
Sigh .
All power to the courageous men and women of the NSW Police Force who do this stuff but , truly , hands up who thinks all this effort will make a blind bit of difference in the long run , any more than it ever has ?
Hands up who thinks there is any way around the laws of supply and demand , which state that when you make a bust like this , you simply push up the profits even more for the human scum who push the drugs and , thus , more and more of them rush in ?
Good .
While your hands are up , give yourself an uppercut .
The only sane approach is to put all of our resources into education programs to highlight the health risks of drugs , normalise the drug laws and free the police and the prisons alike from being bogged in a war that can never be won .
Oh , do stop squawking .
Sane policy is to deal with the world as it is , not the way we wish it was .
Laws of prohibition on products that millions of people like never have worked , and never will work .
Flagging concerns
Like Ariane Sherine , I was born and brought up in the UK , am of mixed ethnicity , and am often asked the question : " Where are you from ? "
( It may not be racist , but it 's a question I 'm tired of hearing , 3 March ) .
I would , however , offer a slightly different take to her on that question 's significance .
Much depends on the spirit in which the question is asked .
When I 've sensed that my belonging in this country is being challenged , I 've certainly found that objectionable , and responded with a curt " Dartford " , and a look that says : " What of it ? "
However , Sherine says that her " reluctance to enter The Conversation is n't due … to fear of any dubious ulterior motives " .
She believes ( and I agree ) that the question is mostly asked simply out of curiosity .
She objects to this partly through exasperation " at people thinking I 'm less British than them because I 'm brown " .
Though my own experiences are different from Sherine 's , my sense is that most people do not think I am " less British " because I am brown , but can simply see from the colour of my skin that I am British in a different way .
If that provokes a genuine , friendly and natural curiosity , then not only do I not object , I absolutely welcome it .
At one level , this is merely part of two people getting to know each other .
But it also means that instead of being defensive and rejectionist about ethnic difference , people are embracing it positively ( the question may be phrased a little clumsily sometimes , but we can easily understand why ) .
The difference between the confrontational and the welcoming spirit of the question goes right to the heart of what it means to live in a country coming to terms with multiculturalism .
I want to live in a society where people take a generous and open - minded approach to social difference .
Sherine also asks why she should be any more interested in India than anywhere else , simply because of her background .
" It 's an odd misconception that you should somehow feel connected to a far - flung country because your ancestors lived there centuries ago , " she says .
My own maternal family left India over 150 years ago , yet in spite of that I feel a personal connection toward that country and its culture which is illogical in the narrow sense yet undeniably deep and instinctive .
" It 's not that I 'm embarrassed about my ethnic background , " says Sherine .
" I do n't think about it much . "
But I feel a particular duty to be aware of , and learn about , my heritage – both Indian and British – and derive great fulfilment from doing so .
These feelings of affinity are quite common among diaspora .
Clearly these are personal feelings .
I merely suggest that Sherine should not be surprised by them .
Acknowledging the contradictory , sometimes irrational and yet deeply held feelings that we have in respect of our complex identities is probably the best response we can give to simplistic " cricket tests " and cliched talk of " Britishness " .
These conversations are well worth having .
Denial Of Service Attack Kills Ubisoft DRM
The downtime that plagued PC gamers trying to play Assassin ’s Creed II yesterday was the result of a denial - of - service attack , causing one of Ubisoft ’s new DRM - servers to become unreachable .
But hey , at least no one has hacked the game yet .
Ubisoft ’s controversial new digital rights management solution went gone live for both Assassin ’s Creed II and Silent Hunter V this weekend , only to go dead for a large number of users shortly thereafter .
The DRM system requires users be connected to the internet while playing the game in order for it to function , and many players reported not being able to connect to Ubisoft , which meant they were not able to play .
Yesterday Ubisoft community managers were telling people that the downtime was due to high demand .
Now Ubisoft ’s Twitter tells a different story .
Apologies to anyone who could n’t play ACII or SH5 yesterday .
Servers were attacked which limited service from 2:30 pm to 9 pm Paris time
So while there was indeed strong demand , it was artificial demand , created via a denial - of - service style attack that affected at least one of Ubisoft ’s servers .
From the Twitter :
95 % of players were not affected , but a small group of players attempting to open a game session did receive denial of service errors
Hacking attacks on Ubisoft ’s new DRM system were hardly unexpected , considering it has already been attacked on a regular basis by fans and critics .
While it may still be alienating players , at least the DRM is getting the job it was intended to perform done , as Ubisoft ’s Twitter proudly proclaims .
We ’re happy to say ACII & SH5 are withstanding the efforts to crack them .
We see the rumours but still confirm no valid cracked versions exist
I ’m sure all of the people who were desperately trying to play Assassin ’s Creed II yesterday are pleased as punch .
McAllister 's efforts still need to be verified by official referees from video games authority Twin Galaxies before his score is recognised as a new world record .
He was unable to pause the game by playing , and had to accrue enough extra lives to ensure he could abandon the console for long enough to take lavatory breaks .
Bra !!
Bra is about to say :
1. Bra !!
Another Pepsi , Broheim !!
2. Bra !!
You see this chick I ’m bangin ’ with , yo ?
3. Bra !!
Dig my star tat , bra !!
4. Bra !!
Did Nietzsche really posit a Godless universe , or simply a universe of moral absolution ?
Almost 65 years after his death it 's still difficult to conduct a reasonable discussion that includes references to Hitler .
Most of the blame lies in too much reductio ad Hitlerum , namely in taking anything Hitler did and using that to try to draw a comparison to a modern figure .
Hitler gave good speeches too !
Hitler was elected too !
are two of the most common .
On the other hand though , there is also a tendency to overly refer to Godwin 's law whenever the subject comes up , suddenly changing the conversation into a meta discussion on discussion itself instead of the previous subject , even if a comparison is valid .
So let 's go over a bit of background that may help in finding out whether a comparison with him really is warranted or not , as well as the guilt or lack of it among those that met and worked with him .
X met with Hitler
In addition to Hitler himself , comparisons are often drawn to people before and during WWII that met with Hitler , the insinuation being that they agreed with him and thus resemble Hitler to a certain extent .
Here 's one .
Uh oh , it 's a member of the Vatican with Hitler , so the Vatican must be like Hitler .
Well , not from this picture alone .
The reason why is that it 's from 1934 , well before WWII started , and even before the 1936 Berlin Olympics .
In fact , President Hindenburg also only died in 1934 .
So pictures from early Hitler rule in Germany need to be substantiated with other proof ( Nazi membership , statements on white supremacy , etc. ) in order to make the case that Person X is like Hitler .
Regarding world opinion , this was the general trend :
Beerhall Putsch - late 1920s : Ha ha , that 's that guy that had the failed Putsch .
Up to 1930 : That 's the guy that leads the Nazi party , but they 're just one party .
1930 - 1933 : That 's the guy that leads the Nazi party and they 're the largest party in parliament , but they still do n't have a majority of seats .
1933 - 1936 : That 's the new chancellor / that 's the guy that rules Germany / uh oh , that 's the guy that rules Germany and has outlawed all other parties and ( depending on the person ) that 's the guy that restored the German economy and presided over the Olympics .
One of the first events that gave a clue as to Hitler 's motives being less than peaceful was the remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936 .
Before that Germany had begun to rebuild its military , but agreements like the 1935 Anglo - German Naval Agreement gave the appearance of a willingness to work with the rest of the world in doing so and keep its military strength to a modest level .
And while Germany 's reentry into the Rhineland was sudden and unexpected , it was also largely ignored since many thought Germany had gotten a raw deal from the Treaty of Versailles anyway and they were just taking back what had been theirs .
It was only around 1938 that Hitler 's bullyish nature became extremely clear , as demands were made on Austria and its chancellor Schuschnigg to instate Nazis in various parts of the government , and free those that had been imprisoned .
Schuschnigg attempted to hold a plebiscite among the Austrian people on whether they wished to be independent but this was prevented by threats from Germany as well .
Eventually they succeeded in making Schuschnigg resign and Austria a part of Germany .
Now , keep in mind that at this point it had become obvious that Hitler was a bully .
What was n't obvious yet was that he was going to turn into a genocidal maniac .
Even with the Anschluss of Austria the world was n't interested in going to war with Germany , and though more disappointment followed after the annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia , the world was n't interested in going to war .
Europe was almost out of patience at this point though .
In fact , if Hitler had suddenly died of a stroke in October 1938 and Göring had taken his place ( who was opposed to most of Hitler 's decisions to wage war , though he followed them faithfully after the decree had been made ) he probably would have been remembered as one of Germany 's greatest leaders .
This naturally does n't mean that there were n't very good reasons to oppose Hitler before 1938 , as he made his views very clear time and time again .
However , opposition to Hitler would have been based on ideology ( what he said he would do ) compared to what he had done , and many assumed his anti-Semitism to be more of a way of appealing to voters than a heartfelt conviction of his .
For example , after Kristallnacht Hitler gave the impression that he knew nothing about it ( from John Toland 's biography ) :
On all sides Germany was assailed as a barbarous nation .
Many Germans agreed and other party officials beside Himmler joined in the condemnation of Goebbels .
Göring complained directly to the Führer that such events made it impossible for him to carry out his mission .
" I was making every effort , in connection with the Four - Year - Plan , " he later testified , " to concentrate the entire economic field to the utmost .
I had , in the course of speeches to the nation , been asking for every old toothpaste tube , every rusty nail , every bit of scrap material to be collected and utilized .
It would not be tolerated that a man who was not responsible for these things should upset my difficult economic tasks by destroying so many things of economic volue on the one hand and by causing so much disturbance in economic life on the other hand . "
Then Hitler , according to Göring 's account , " made some apologies for Goebbels , but on the whole he agreed that such events were not to take place and must not be allowed to take place . "
Hitler was already giving the impression that he knew nothing of Crystal Night and added his own complaints .
" It is terrible , " he told Gerdy Troost , widow of the architect Professor Paul Ludwig Troost , whom Hitler admired above all .
" They have destroyed everything for me like elephants in a china shop ... and much worse .
I had the great hope that I was about to come to an understanding with France .
And now that ! "
But Fritz Hesse , summoned to Munich from London for a special press conference , claimed he overheard otherwise from Hitler 's own lips the very night Crystal Night was set into motion .
At dinner the Führer was boasting how he had bluffed the English and French at Munich when an adjutant whispered something to Goebbels .
He turned and muttered to Hitler .
At first Hesse could n't hear what was said , but when the others at the table lapsed into silence it became clear that the Propaganda Minister was explaining a mass attack which he and the SA were going to launch against the Jewish shops and synagogues in a few hours .
There was no doubting the Führer 's approval , recalled Hesse .
" Hitler squealed with delight and slapped his thigh in his enthusiasm . "
" the world will yet come to see a very great man – mystic in Hitler . [...]
I cannot abide in Nazism – the regimentation – cruelty – oppression of Jews – attitude towards religion , etc. , but Hitler , him – the peasant – will rank some day with Joan of Arc among the deliverers of his people . "
Small countries
Bullying , ultimatums , inconsistent statements
Dahlerus pointed out that England and France also had greatly improved their armed forces and were in good position to blockade Germany .
Without answering , Hitler paced up and then suddenly stopped in his tracks , stared and began talking again ( Dahlerus recalled ) , this time as if in a trance .
" If there should be a war , then I will build U - boats , build U - boats , build U - boats , build U - boats , U - boats , U - boats . "
It was like a stuck record .
His voice became more and more indistinct .
Abruptly he was orating as if to a huge audience , but still repeating himself .
" I will build airplanes , build airplanes , airplanes and I will destroy my enemies ! "
In consternation , Dahlerus turned to see how Göring was reacting .
But the Reichsmarschall appeared not at all perturbed .
Dahlerus was horrified : so this was the man whose actions could influence the entire world !
Even Hitler might not have resembled Hitler
So to make a long point short , if we 're talking about a person from around 1936 to 1938 saying something nice about or associating with Hitler , without extra evidence of a common ideology there is a good chance that said person just was n't perceptive enough .
Even the Canadian prime minister at the time saw little wrong with Hitler upon meeting him in 1937 : Small countries have a special place in WWII , because with their extremely limited clout and the impression until the war that the rest of Europe was n't all that willing to risk sticking its neck out for countries like Austria and Czechoslovakia , there was little reason for other countries to publicly oppose Nazi Germany or Italy .
When assessing the actions of a government of a smaller ( populationwise ) country , one therefore needs to take a look at actions beyond that of simply allying oneself with Germany or not .
Finland for example was attacked by the Soviet Union during the Winter War , and saw Operation Barbarossa ( Germany 's invasion of the Soviet Union ) as a good opportunity to retake the land they had lost and there was cooperation between the two countries .
However , Finland never subscribed to Nazi ideology and this can be seen by the treatment of Jews in Finland during WWII .
The way a country treated its Jewish minority as well as how democratic it was overall is a much more accurate way to assess a country 's character during WWII than simply looking at official military treaties or cooperation .
This is probably the best way to draw an accurate comparison to Hitler among world leaders , since this was his style of diplomacy with other countries .
His most common ultimatum before invading a country was to complain that the German minority was being abused and needed his help , while in order to disguise this he would come across as ready for a peace treaty one day , then bellicose and frightening the next .
Negotiations between Germany and Poland around the time of the Dahlerus Mission are a good example of this , with Hitler promising a peace treaty one day and then threatening to smash Poland into the dust the next .
Too much of this , however , and even Chamberlain stopped trying to believe that peace could be achieved .
On the night of August 30 Dahlerus presented Chamberlain with a message from Hitler about a magnanimous offer ( grosszügiges Angebot ) for Poland that would solve everything , but " Chamberlain himself was now so determined to resist Hitler that he never even asked the Poles if they would submit to the time limit and by the time Dahlerus was back at 10 Downing Street negotiation seemed impossible .
" One more account from Dahlerus shows another characteristic that marked Hitler , his psychological instability .
This is tough to find in current world leaders though , because most are very good at covering up private details such as this , which often only surface years later in biographies .
It 's important to remember that it 's possible to resemble Hitler , but not to have the authority or opportunity to carry out the same acts .
Hitler might have been born in a tiny country like Albania instead of Austria next to Germany , or he could have been accepted to art school and become a professional artist , he could have been assassinated during one of the early attempts on his life .
Without the economic and political instability after World War I there would have been much less fear among the populace .
The short - lived Bavarian Soviet Socialist Republic shows that fear of communism among many was based on a very real threat .
His mother could have lived to a ripe old age too .
The negative characteristics that probably most resembles Hitler though are : 1 ) a continuous reference to battling an enemy that must be destroyed at all costs , and 2 ) a tendency to become too excited , fly off the handle and make rash decisions at a moment 's notice .
Put these together in the hand of someone who controls a country and you have a recipe for disaster .
Well , this has been a pretty long post .
Let 's finish it up with a good rule of thumb .
If someone is comparing World Leader X to Hitler , simply steer the topic toward more clarification .
Which Hitler ?
When he was running in elections in the early 1930s ?
When he invaded Poland ?
When he wrote Mein Kampf in jail ?
When he invaded Russia ?
When he stopped eating meat ?
Doing that will let one know whether the comparison is valid , and if the person making the comparison even knows the first thing about Hitler in the first place in order to make it .
His story is simply too complex for " man , that guy 's just like Hitler " to really mean anything , and turning the topic away from internet memes and back toward specifics of history can only improve the discussion .
Two new demos of PlayStation Move , shot by us today , show some of the coolest things that Sony 's Move motion controllers can do .
Two weeks ago , we saw Move control games .
Today , Move moved windows and made the Eiffel Tower .
Kotaku shot these demos in New York City , just hours before Sony was allowing the public its first hands - on with the new Move controller .
The new controller , which works with the already - released PlayStation Eye camera , is Sony 's attempt to one - up the technology of the Wii Remote .

The demos here were whipped up since the Move was unveiled earlier this month .
The first is a Move take on the kind of motion - controlled interfaces guessed at in the movie Minority Report .
( Which is cooler than the motion - controlled cross - media - bar interface I saw two weeks ago . )
The second shows a whole new way people could make levels in a game like Little Big Planet .

Marks and Mikhailov are two of Sony 's senior developers on the Move project .
The PlayStation Move will be released this fall for the PlayStation 3 .
Recall during your college days back when you ’re in kindergarten if you ’d color images that are outlined with wax crayons ?
You began drawing on your own images and using pens , instead of simply coloring .
You ’re invited to change out of oil pastels after attaining school .
If you picked it as an optional and were interested in this topic , you attempt several mediums to broaden your horizons , then would use watercolors , acrylic paints .
What ’s the artistic medium ?
A medium denotes the sort of substance used to make a work of art , be it sculptures , paintings , and all things between .
When you see art galleries , you will encounter paintings having a display card saying the medium used to create that sculpture or painting , the artist title , as well as the name of this painting .
A painting may have a record ‘ acrylic on canvas ’ , ” even though a sculpture may be made from steel or marble .
The expression ‘ moderate ’ was used especially 90 years later it was said by Lessing in 1861 in an informative article .
The artwork was explained concerning the material mixed to generate paint .
By way of instance , water and petroleum are all various mediums .
The word “ moderate ” is utilized to express exactly what substance artwork is made from .
Various mediums utilized in artwork
Oil paints
When you consider oil painting , a painting understood by nearly everyone on Earth is your Mona Lisa from Leonardo Da Vinci .
Oil painting is just one of the mediums .
It was used by other musicians , from Picasso to Botticelli .
As its name implies these paints are all both oil - based and blended with eucalyptus or turpentine oil .
Oil paintings require because they are not oil - based , a great deal of time to wash , if you are a person , therefore begin with this mild !
These paintings ’ worth is determined by these paintings ’ time and also how old it really is .
Oil paintings era such as wine –the better , the elderly !
Watercolors
Watercolors are tough to work around , as when the paint is still on paper , it is small you can do to alter it .
As soon as you learn it , then there are benefits .
Watercolors are cheap .
Because the paint is combined with plenty of water to make its trademark effect 1 tube of color goes away .
Watercolor paintings are translucent , which means you can see the texture .
Watercolor enables light to ward off the newspaper and provide its impact to the color instead of rebounding the paint off .
This provides clarity to paintings that are this type .
Watercolors are utilized to paint abstract bits landscapes or even subtle topics which do n’t require an excessive amount of precision .
A few watercolor techniques consist of wet on color lifting , wet , and washes .
Acrylic Paints
This is the medium that was grown in 1940 and employed in the artwork .
In comparison to acrylic paints and watercolors , acrylics have a lot of benefits .
It dries very quickly .
It ’s also durable and quite flexible .
Furthermore , in the event that you spill it to the ground , it generates less clutter and maybe scraped off ; it may be peeled off the other hand !
This moderate was used by pop artists such as Andy Warhol in their own creation of this ‘ Campbell Soup Can ’ .
Wish to generate art with no artist ?
Would be ‘ Acrylic Pour ’ .
The pour is a method of pouring layers of acrylic colors on a canvas .
You have to combine it with a medium that is pouring to create its inconsistency .
To have fun , you also may add the following and then also silicone oil washing , use a milder or heating .
You will realize that the paint different from petroleum ( because acrylics are water - based ) and shape beautiful bubbles onto the painting .
Even though it ’s a very simple method , the painting depends upon the colors you ’ve layered and how that you pour .
Graphite Pencil
“ Paint me enjoy one of the French women … ”
If you have seen Titanic you understand what landscape that quotation comes from .
Jack utilized graphite pencils to parade Rose because blockbuster that was epic .
These pens are similar to pens , but they are indifferent intensity levels .
Even the ‘h ’s are the lightest , whereas the pens signify such as 6 b or 4b would be the sweetest .
Pencils are less cluttered to use than just simply paints and employed by kids since they are the form of a pen .
Mastery of the medium requires blending , shading , and sketching .
Comparable to graphite pencils are charcoals .
Charcoal needs hand management , cannot be erased , and is darker in color .
Charcoal comes in 2 different kinds — buttery for sketching and gentle charcoal for mixing .
Charcoal can be used for sketches and drawing characters .
Pastels
Pastels come in 2 kinds — chalk pastels , that can be much like charcoal , and even oil pastels , that are used by kids for coloring , but they are available in all colors .
Pastels are perfect for layering and mixing .
Cut , the trick , and side can be utilized to make textures .
Beauty comes in all dimensions , as most of us know , and it ’s no surprise it comes from a variety of mediums because art is a kind of beauty .
There ’s not any medium for a specific sort of painting , so it is dependent upon which an artist is familiar with , whatever you enjoy , accessibility , and your funding .
And remember the best thing about art can be found in the beholder ’s eyes !
[ In this postmortem taken from the December 2009 issue of Game Developer magazine , iconoclastic developer Double Fine Productions outlines the complex and at times daunting process of developing its action / strategy rock god epic Brütal Legend , taking in everything from legal troubles with Activision to tool development and everything in between . ]
If the adage " go big or go home " applies to any software development effort , it applies to the making of Brütal Legend .
As we did previously with Psychonauts , Double Fine once again bet it all on innovating -- this time on a game borne from the Full Throttle side of Tim Schafer 's mind .
Brütal Legend is a molten , balls - forward , third person , open world , strategic action - adventure interactive ride into the very soul of heavy metal .
The development story started out simply enough .
After shipping Psychonauts , Double Fine created a collection of concept work , a pitch document and a game trailer intended to capture the spirit of Brütal Legend .
Most publishers we spoke to were interested in the game concept , but their questions commonly indicated that they did n't understand where we were headed with it .
Questions were posed to us , such as " Why heavy metal ?
How about rock , or country , or hip hop instead ?
Why would you want to play as a roadie ?
How about playing as a rock god ? "
One publisher , Vivendi Universal Games , did not ask these questions in the pitch meetings -- or in any meetings .
They understood the game for what it was , and signed it for what they knew it could become .
We started development by focusing first on the multiplayer mode of the game -- our thinking was that since we'd never made a multiplayer game before , figuring that out would be our top priority .
It took 16 months to do so .
In Rocktober 2006 , we delivered a fully playable Ironheade vs. Tainted Coil skirmish to our publisher .
At Vivendi's request , we then focused on the single player campaign , expanding its scope well beyond the initial design .
This is the period in which we added the voices of Jack Black and a host of other celebrity talent to the game , as well as other enhancements that solidified the vision for the campaign experience that we ultimately shipped .
In June 2007 , we delivered the first meaningful portion of the single player game and also promptly admitted that all of the changes we had made to the game content put us way behind schedule .
Our first schedule revision extended the project by ten months , the second by another seven .
Initially scheduled to be released in May 2008 under the Vivendi Universal Games / Sierra banner , Brütal Legend finally shipped on October 13 , 2009 , published by Electronic Arts .
Double Fine encourages innovation , but that drive also means we can't always rely on previous experience to predict how a feature or an approach will turn out .
On Brütal Legend , the practice of continuous iteration and concept refinement led to a number of prototyped ideas , many of which survived to ship in the final game , but just as many of which were left to digitally fossilize in the annals of Perforce .
Whittling down to ten the list of things that went right and wrong during the development of Brütal Legend presented a considerable challenge .
Here are some lessons that were the most surprising or impactful .
What Went Right
1. Pushing Creative Limits
Brütal Legend was to be the interactive amalgamation of the over - the - top ridiculous ( yet deadly serious ) world of heavy metal .
We were reverent fans of the genre and felt it would be an honor to bring that world to life .
Brütal Legend began with a simple list -- a game that embodied everything that could be found on a heavy metal album cover : chrome rivers , pools of blood , volcanoes , caves , fire - breathing metal beasts , laser panthers , bladehenge and beerhenge , dominatrices , latex and chains , disembodied undead heads ...
To that we added the core gameplay .
We wanted to make a brawler adventure game , where the player was a heavy metal roadie who evolves into a rock god over the course of the game .
Brütal Legend on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 would have the brawn of an action game and the elegance of an RTS .
We learned early on in our relationship with Vivendi that RTS was a naughty word in the console space , so we stopped calling it by that name and , by extension , so did Electronic Arts -- positioning the game largely as an action title in the marketplace .
We wanted our RTS to exploit the consoles ' advantage ; putting the player in the center of the action .
We wanted to give the player intuitive control of a character that could perform a variety of badass movements and abilities and also allow the player to personally bond with that character .
And we wanted that character to command dozens of masterfully - dialogued troops simultaneously .
One of our biggest challenges in solving the RTS accessibility issue was squad orders .
It took numerous attempts and countless focus tests , but we ultimately decided on a simple unification of the orders interface , wherein the AI behaved as the player would want them to on the battlefield .
The player would have four orders :
1 ) " Follow , " where Eddie gives his troops commands to move to a specific location and possibly attack , allowing the order to be given only within " shouting range , " a relatively large distance around Eddie that did not encompass the entire map -- solving the forced ( ignore path enemies / obstacles ) and non-forced ( engage enemies along the way ) issue by making the " follow " order non-forced when Eddie was near his troops and forced when Eddie was far away .
2 ) " Defend , " where Eddie could command his army to stop moving and hold position , aligning them in the most advantageous manner ( melee up front , ranged behind , support in the rear ) facing the camera .
3 ) " Move , " where the migration would be forced until the army is close to its destination , at which point it would engage nearby foes .
4 ) " Charge , " a non-forced move to the enemy that is closest to the average position of all nearby enemies if your army was not attacking , and a forced move to the attack position even if that meant disengaging from their current activity if your army was attacking .
The Double Fine incarnation of a console RTS occurred to us not in an early pre-production meeting , but over years of painstaking iteration and reinvention and rework .
We tested our progress in periodic " Mandatory Hour of Fun " sessions , where the entire team played the latest build and then met as a group to discuss what was working well and what was frustrating or could be made better .
This open forum for the exchange of ideas as well as the momentum for continuous iteration fueled profound changes to the core game mechanic over the course of development .
FEBRUARY 12 --A Florida first grade student was briefly committed to a mental health institution after police were twice called to her school this week after she threw violent tantrums , which included the six - year - old striking the school 's principal , who is eight months pregnant , in the stomach .
According to these St. Lucie County Sheriff 's Office reports , officers were first summoned to Parkway Elementary School last Monday when Haley Franklin became out of control .
During an hour - long tantrum -- which was apparently triggered when the girl 's teacher asked her to do something -- the child kicked walls and threw items ( a calculator , electric pencil sharpener , telephone , etc. ) across the principal 's office .
The 37 - pound offender , pictured at left , was briefly handcuffed as a sheriff 's deputy sought to get her under control .
The following day , when the child again caused a disruption , which included throwing things and striking the principal , a sheriff 's deputy responded to the school and transported Haley to the New Horizons mental health facility .
A Florida state law ( known as the Baker Act ) allows law enforcement personnel to involuntarily commit individuals .
Along with threatening to punch a deputy , the girl called a school administrator " an old bat " and told the woman , " I am going to go home and make a kick me sign and put it on your back . "
While Haley 's parents acknowledge that their child has a temper problem , they said she has no history of mental illness , and blasted school officials and sheriff 's deputies for overreacting .
The sheriff 's report notes that , prior to last week 's incidents , school officials repeatedly sought to discuss Haley 's behavior with her mother and father .
But the parents never showed up for the scheduled meetings .
Additionally , both parents were arrested last year for failing to appear for a court - ordered truancy hearing about " their children not attending school on a normal basis . " ( 9 pages )
Individual Pink Floyd songs will soon disappear from online music stores .
The British High Court has ruled against EMI , the band 's record label , saying that the band 's contract requires EMI to " preserve the artistic integrity of the albums . "
In this case , that means keeping all the tracks together and in the order they were meant to be in , leading some to worry whether Pink Floyd 's music will disappear from popular online music stores altogether .
When Pink Floyd signed with EMI back in the late ' 60s , its members probably did not imagine an age when we would be ditching physical media en masse in favor of cherry - picked songs on a series of Internet tubes .
It 's unsurprising then that the contract stipulated for the label to maintain the artistic integrity of the album itself — back then ( and today as well , but perhaps to a lesser degree ) , musicians spent painstaking amounts of time crafting the entire album as a whole artwork .
Those who only listened to select tracks were totally missing out .
Indeed , as EMI has discovered , that still appears to be the case , at least when it comes to Pink Floyd .
The High Court ordered EMI to pay £ 40,000 in court costs with the possibility of future damages and EMI may have to pull Pink Floyd 's individual offerings from places like the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 .
( As of this writing , the albums with per-track purchases were still available .
Get 'em while they 're hot . )
In addition , EMI must pay Pink Floyd an undisclosed amount in royalty payments .
This does n't mean they would n't become available again as full - album purchases , though — iTunes , for example , regularly offers albums that have one or two tracks that only come with a full album purchase .
We would n't be surprised to see Dark Side of the Moon come back to iTunes with every track marked " Album only . "
A partial map of the distribution of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , going out to a distance of 7 billion light years .
The amount of galaxy clustering that we observe today is a signature of how gravity acted over cosmic time , and allows as to test if general relativity holds over these scales .
Score one more for Einstein .
A new study has confirmed histheory of general relativity works on extremely large scales .
The study was one of the first rigorous tests of this theoryof gravity beyond our solar system .
The research found that even over vastscales of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the equations of generalrelativity predict the way that mass pulls on other mass in the universe .
The new work also helps rule out a competing theory ofgravity that seeks to do away with the need for bizarre concepts like darkmatter and darkenergy that have irked some scientists .
This research indicates those peskyideas may be here to stay .
What is relativity ?
General relativity rocked the world of physics when Einsteinfirst published his paper on the subject in 1915 .
The theory built on thetraditional idea ofgravity based on Isaac Newton 's laws , but added fundamentally new conceptslike the notion that mass deforms the shape of space - time .
This means thatobjects and even light that move through space near a large mass will travel ona curved path .
Furthermore , it means that mass can stretch or shrink time aswell .
For example , someone watching a black hole from a distance would observea person falling into that black hole to fall extremely slowly .
To test this theory over distances up to 3.5 billion light - yearsfrom Earth , researchers analyzed a survey of about 70,000 galaxies .
Thescientists combined three different measurements .
First , they calculated theweak gravitational lensing caused by the galaxies ?
that is , they measured howmuch the galaxies ' mass was bending light from other galaxies around them bynoting the average distortion of the surrounding galaxies ' shapes .
Then , they combined this data with measurements of thegalaxies ' velocities to learn how the galaxies were moving toward and away fromone another .
Finally , the astrophysicists calculated how clustered the galaxieswere together over various distances .
All of these measurements combinedcreated a system to test theories of gravity independent of particularparameters in the theories .
The scientists found that general relativity is consistentwith their observations of the universe at large scales .
They also tested two competingtheories ?
the tensor - vector - scalar gravity ( TeVeS ) idea , and anothercalled f( R ) ( pronounced " f of r " ) .
The quantities predicted by f( R ) were somewhat differentfrom those observed , but still fell within the margin of error of themeasurements , so this theory is still a possibility .
TeVeS , however , madepredictions that fell outside the observational error limits , so scientiststhink they can probably eliminate this theory from consideration .
" It was n't clear at the outset that our errors would besmall enough to be able to rule out other models ?
it was a nicesurprise , " said study leader Reinabelle Reyes , a graduate student atPrinceton University in Princeton , N.J .
TeVeS was already looking doubtful based on recentobservations of a pair of colliding galaxy clusters called the bullet cluster , which offered strong evidence for the existence of dark matter , Reyes said .
Thenew research offers another nail in its coffin .
Solid support
While general relativity was already pretty well acceptedamong physicists , the new findings offer more solid support for the theory .
" It 's good to know that general relativity isconsistent , " Reyes told SPACE.com .
" Now we have something to hold onto saying the universe really works that way . "
The study was detailed in the March 11 issue of the journalNature .
To further judge between Einstein ' stheory and other ideas , including f( R ) , research on more galaxies will benecessary to reduce the margins of error on the data .
" Reyes and colleagues ?
measurements are significant notjust because they are consistent within error with general relativity , but alsobecause they point the way to future high - precision tests that will betterdistinguish between general relativity and some variant models , " physicistJ .
Anthony Tyson of the University of California , Davis , wrote in anaccompanying essay in the same issue of Nature .
Tyson was not involved in thestudy .

I thought I would post about morels next but good things come to those who wait .
In the meantime we have a bad thing with ( at least one ) good solution .
Ever heard of Atrazine ?
It ’s in the news right now for altering the reproductive systems of frogs : CNN , Reuters , Fox , BBC
It ’s now infamous and controversial .
Atrazine has a reputation for groundwater pollution , human health problems , and wildlife damage .
It ’s also one of the most common herbicides used in the United States .
If you ’ve ever come in contact with golf courses , Christmas trees , food containing corn , or drinking water , you could have been exposed to it .
It also stays around for a while ( from Extoxnet ) :
“ Atrazine is highly persistent in soil .
Chemical hydrolysis , followed by degradation by soil microorganisms , accounts for most of the breakdown of atrazine .
Hydrolysis is rapid in acidic or basic environments , but is slower at neutral pHs.
Addition of organic material increases the rate of hydrolysis .
Atrazine can persist for longer than 1 year under dry or cold conditions [ 21 ] .
Atrazine is moderately to highly mobile in soils with low clay or organic matter content .
Because it does not adsorb strongly to soil particles and has a lengthy half - life ( 60 to > 100 days ) , it has a high potential for groundwater contamination despite its moderate solubility in water [ 20 ] .
Atrazine is the second most common pesticide found in private wells and in community wells [ 16 ] . ”
Personally , I think the best solution to this problem is organic gardening and farming practices .
Barring that , what if there was a mushroom that would eat it ?
When I was visiting Tradd and Olga at Mushroom Mountain last week ( and I wrote about How to Kill Fire Ants , Carpenter Ants , and Termites with Mushrooms ) I also took photos of an experimental oyster culture acclimated to consume various concentrations of Atrazine .
Tradd and Olga found this mushroom ( when Olga tripped over the Clemson , SC stump it was growing on ) during freezing temperatures this past January .
Since oysters usually prefer slightly warmer temps , Tradd collected the hardier specimen for cold weather bioremediation purposes .
He now has it growing on petri dishes containing the labeled usage rate for Atrazine as well as concentrations 2 x and 3 x the recommended application rate .
This mushroom has adapted quickly to its new toxic food source .
Pending tests to determine the mushroom ’s efficiency at degrading Atrazine ’s active compounds , it will be a remarkable tool for removing Atrazine buildup in the soil .
Tradd tells me this fungus is available for experimentation now if you ’d like to contact him through the Mushroom Mountain website .

The R&D Prototyping team has recently built an internal prototype for BBC Vision called the Mythology Engine .
It 's a proof - of - concept for a website that represents BBC drama on the web letting you explore our dramas , catch up on story - lines , discover new characters and share what you find .
Most TV drama on the web is either deep and detailed fan - produced sites or visually rich but shallow sites from the broadcasters .
We believe there is a middle way and it seems like there 's a space for something here .
Something that expresses the richness and depth of the stories that the BBC creates .
Somewhere that will be the default place to find out about our stories and somewhere that people will link to and share with their friends .
So we built a prototype based around the stories of Doctor Who .
Theo Jones , Creative Director for Prototyping talks us through the prototype in this video :
In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed .
Visit BBC
Webwise for full instructions .
If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content .
That 's a taste of what this prototype can do .
Like I said , it 's a proof - of - concept that we 're using within the BBC and we 're not planning on launching it .
That said , do tell us in the comments if you like the idea .
We are using Doctor Who as an example because it is a high - profile brand with a large archive and is particularly narratively complex in places - time travel is hard !
The rest of this post will look a bit deeper into the project and talk about some of the thinking behind the prototype and the process used to build it .
What should it do ?
Our objectives for this project were to build something that would demonstrate how you could express stories in a form tailored for the web , to show how this would allow people to explore BBC dramas and unlock the archive , and to create a reusable framework that could apply to all dramas and stories .
The prototype should let you :
Catch up on stories you 've missed
Explore stories and characters and help you understand plots and relationships
Find the stories you are looking for and share your favourite moments or characters
Luckily there is some previous work to look to in this area .
Several years ago the BBC looked at representing Eastenders in RDF , my Radio Labs team built a prototype for a similar concept around the Archers a couple of years ago and Paul Rissen , one of our information architects has done a lot of thinking about narrative on the web as have various academic projects like Ontomedia .
Because there are always issues around the rights of distribution of programmes we designed it to work with and without short video clips , as these seemed relatively realistic to have .
There is no long form video in the prototype for this reason , and also because it 's not designed as a replacement for iPlayer .
It should be complimentary to existing BBC sites .
One way of thinking about this that I 've found helpful is to imagine the story existing in the writer 's head before the scriptwriting and production creates the broadcast programme .
The viewer then watches this , understands it and reconstructs the story .
The Mythology Engine is designed to assist in this process ; to let the audience explore complex plots or catch up on episodes they missed or stories they remember .
Modelling stories
By designing the Mythology Engine to take advantage of architecture of the web with unique pages per concept and interconnecting links everywhere , we increase the findability and sharability of our content .
To do this we used a domain - driven modelling approach and this is a simplified version of our data model .
A story can actually be several things ; a single episode ( like most current Doctor Who ) or a multi-episode story ( like classic Doctor Who ) or a long - term , ongoing story arc ( like Bad Wolf arc ) .
Stories are then collections of events , where an event is a specifically chosen , significant thing that happens in a story .
This could be anything , but the important thing is that it is editorially chosen to tell the story .
And then , pretty obviously , events occur in places and feature characters , who have relationships between each other and can belong to groups .
And there are things , a catch - all term for everything else that might affect the plot - the murder weapon , a sonic screwdriver , things like that .
This picture shows how the story concept in our model maps back onto a programme as it appears on TV or radio .
The story , consisting of events , is represented as scenes in the programme .
Often an event will correspond exactly with a single scene in a programme , or maybe a scene will portray more than one event .
And sometimes an event can be portrayed in several scenes , maybe to build tension or to show it from different characters ' perspectives .
And events might not even occur in the " correct " chronological order within the programme , it 's all about telling the story and building suspense and that 's what the prototype needs to support .
Building it
The site was built in Rails , principally by Duncan Robertson , assisted by Chris Bowley for the Flash visualisations .
It uses a simple Rails - based Content Management System called Typus with some small customisations to the interface to enter data .
Our approach to building prototypes is agile and iterative so we modelled the data , got running code as soon as possible and then did some ad - hoc user testing with some colleagues .
The main feedback from this was that we should make stories and time more obvious , have more clarity around your current context in the page and the site , try to increase the interlinking and to focus on the quality of content .
Craft your data
We think this last one is particularly important .
Having the model is not enough , you also need to bring to life the things and the connections between the things in a compelling way .
So for this project we hired a freelance Doctor Who writer and he created all the data and relationships and wrote all the descriptions that are in the prototype ; five whole stories ( some classic and some contemporary ) , a couple of story arcs and about forty characters and thirty places .
Representing time
In the story " Blink " there is lots of time - travel .
Whenever a character is touched by one of the statues they are thrown back in time .
We model all of this as ordered events with timestamps so you can imagine there are various timelines that we could present - how things happened in linear time ( i.e. earliest first ) , how things happened from a character 's perspective or how the story was presented on screen .
In the end we decided to show the timeline as it was presented on screen , which makes it relatively straightforward and is what the storytellers intended .
You can see how it jumps between the present day , 1920 and 1967 .
It 's not just Doctor Who
Having completed the Who prototype we wanted to show that the framework was re-usable for another drama .
So we re-deployed the code to a new server , wiped the database and set up an Eastenders Mythology Engine in a couple of days , reskinning it and creating a small number of stories and characters .
There are some things we would have done differently if we 'd started with Eastenders .
We would have concentrated less on timelines and more on relationships and characters , but ultimately we think it works across the brands .
What next ?
We think this is a really exciting concept , the prototype is done , and hopefully we 've contributed some original thinking along the way .
Having built the Mythology Engine there are several interesting research projects that we 've been thinking about :

As a child when I came down with pneumonia my parents did not rush me to see a policeman , a cattle rancher , or a local businessman .
Instead they took me to see a medical doctor — someone who had studied that science for at least twelve years — and I was quickly given injections and put on antibiotics .
Thanks to my parents ’ ability to tell the difference between experts and non-experts , I survived .
Today , I have learned that same lesson .
As an environmental reporter when I want information on the Critically Endangered Sumatran rhino , I do n’t email a herpetologist ( someone who has spent years studying reptiles and amphibians ) or an ichthyologist ( someone who studies fish ) , instead I e-mail a mammologist , more specifically someone who has worked with the Sumatran rhino .
You can probably see where this is going , but in the same light when I would like scientific information about the issue of climate change , I contact people who have been studying the science for decades .
There are literally thousands of them and they are everywhere .
As well , they include experts in a number of different fields : sometimes I ’ll hear from a botanist who is studying how trees are migrating in the Amazon due to warmer temperatures , or a geologist looking at what the latest ice cores in Greenland show about past climates , or a marine biologist looking at acidification in the oceans .
Except for a leveling off between the 1940s and 1970s , Earth ’s surface temperatures have increased since 1880 .
The last decade has brought the temperatures to the highest levels ever recorded .
The graph shows global annual surface temperatures relative to 1951 - 1980 mean temperatures .
As shown by the red line , long - term trends are more apparent when temperatures are averaged over a five year period .
Image credit : NASA / GISS .
But I do n’t email James Inhofe or his staff .
Not because I do n’t respect that the Senator can have his own views on climate change , even if they are mostly based on non-experts .
I simply do n’t email him because as a journalist I like to hear the facts from the experts and , no offense to Senator Inhofe , but I ’m sure even he would admit he ’s not a climatologist .
Just like my parents did n’t drop off their pneumonia - stricken son with a florist , so I do n’t seek climate change facts from senators who clearly have political ( not scientific ) agendas .
I also do n’t email Al Gore , in case you ’re wondering .
Other people I wo n’t contact : Donald Trump ( businessman ) , Glen Beck ( TV personality ) , George Will ( a journalist never seeks out other journalists , especially ones prone to so many mistakes ) , or some dude I just met in a coffee - shop who tells me that the end of the world is in 2012 , so who cares anyway right ?
As an environmental journalist I have the responsibility to give readers the best , most up - to - date information on any topic , whether it is the birth of a baby Sumatran rhino or the warmest decade on record , incidentally 2000 - 2009 .
What ’s interesting to me is how many media outlets are reporting that recent climate ‘ scandals ’ — such as the hacked emails , the mistake on Himalayan glaciers , and snowstorms in the United States — have undercut the science of climate change completely .
Yet , when I hear from experts , I hear the exact opposite .
The Himalayan glaciers error was unfortunate , but it was a human error in a report that spans thousands of pages from ten - of - thousands of scientists ; ( even scientists , like medical doctors , make mistakes from time to time ) the hacked emails , also unfortunate , but largely taken out of context and blown - up by talking heads ; and those snow storms ?
Both hemispheres have warmed significantly over the last hundred and thirty years .

Well , even if we want to ignore the fact that the science of climate change has long predicted heavier precipitation events — i.e. big snow dumps — due to increased evaporation , one could also point out that regional weather is not global climate .
For example , while it was frigid in London and Tulsa in January ; the Arctic and Canada were unseasonably warm .
NOAA — an expert organization — has found in preliminary data that this was the fourth warmest January on record ( i.e. from 1880 ) .
Still , I ask researchers , what about the overall science of climate change ?
See now , I ’m getting to the big question .
I tell them that I heard it was dead .
I heard that it has been demolished .
I heard that it was proven to be a conspiracy .
In fact someone told me it was crushed by the sensible nature of mankind and media who could n’t conceive of global warming when it was cold outside .
No , no , they say , the science of climate change is as stable as it ever was , which means it is always evolving , but the backbone — the fact that the world is warming and that in high probability greenhouse gas emissions are causing a good chunk of that — has n’t changed one iota .
As with any large scientific endeavor ( and climate change is huge ) there remain details to uncover , more data to be collected , more research to be done , but all - in - all the science of climate change does n’t just evaporate because of human impoliteness ( e- mails ) or human error ( IPCC report ) .
This is what the experts tell me , so this is what I report .
If one day scientists began publishing papers saying that they discovered that climate change was actually not occurring ; that experts had found holes in the data the size of elephants ; and in fact , if anything , the world was cooling or just staying mildly temperate , then I will take a deep breath , grin widely because my children wo n’t have to deal with the onslaught of a warmer , unstable world , and set to work on an explosive article regarding these new findings .
But until such data comes from a good number of actual experts ( i.e. people trained for years on how to collect , analyze , and communicate complex data )
I ’ll refrain from reporting rumors , innuendos , and fairytales .
However , if I ’m doing a story about the politics of climate change then all bets are off and I have no problem with hearing from James Inhofe , Glen Beck , Al Gore , or that guy in my coffee - shop .

Despite a colder than normal January on the east coast of the United States and in Europe and Russia , the rest of the world was generally warmer .
According to preliminary data from the NOAA this was the fourth warmest January since 1880 and the warmest ever for the southern hemisphere .

Record - breaking snow across the US and climate change
( 12/26/2009 )
Over the past few weeks the United States has been pounded by a number of big snow storms .
A week ago Washington DC received 18 inches of snow , setting a number of records .
Over Christmas , the middle of the country , from Texas to Minnesota was also hit by record amounts of snow .
While snow fall over the East Coast and middle of the country in the United States in December is hardly unusual , a number of record amounts of precipitation may point to a larger shift in the climate .
Scientists say that higher temperatures causes more water evaporation , which increases the chances of heavy precipitation events , such as floods and snowstorms .

While this rise in sea levels would take hundreds of years to fully occur , inaction this century could lock the world into this fate .
• Company behind club failed to settle debts with HMRC • Cardiff and Southend given more time to pay their debts
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The debt - ridden company behind Chester City FC has today been wound up , the club have confirmed .
Chester City FC 2004
Ltd failed to settle its debts with HM Revenue & Customs resulting in the adjudication at the high court in London this morning .
In January , the company was given six weeks to finalise proposals for a Company Voluntary Arrangement ( CVA ) aimed at enabling the club , which was formed in 1885 , to clear their immediate debts – £ 26,125 of which is owed to the taxman .
They , however , failed to do that and so today succumbed to a compulsory winding up order .
But supporters have vowed to resurrect Chester , which was expelled from the Blue Square Premier division last month .
Speaking outside the high court , supporting creditor David Evans , who is on the board of City Fans Ltd , said : " It 's quite emotional but it means a fresh start .
It means we can have our club back .
We hope we will now be a reformed club . "
Fellow fan Sue Choularton added : " In a way it is very sad , but we are planning on starting up a ' phoenix club ' to start again , possibly in Unibond League One .
We have already got 1,000 members . "
The registrar 's ruling means the club 's affairs will effectively be handed over to an Official Receiver .
His job is then to do his best to ensure that debts are paid off by selling any assets available and then bringing business to a close .
A Football Association spokesperson said : " The FA notes today 's decision of the High Court in relation to Chester City .
The winding up of any club is a loss to the game and in particular to the supporters of that club .
" In order to maintain a senior football club in the city of Chester , the FA will welcome applications if the club wishes to reform .
Any such applications will be considered by the FA 's Leagues Committee . "
Meanwhile , Cardiff City have been given 56 days and Southend 35 days to settle their own winding - up orders .
Both clubs were given more time by a High Court registrar to make a " full and final " payment to HM Revenue and Customs of VAT and PAYE debts .
Matthew Smith , representing HMRC , told Mrs Registrar Derrett that both clubs were insolvent and Cardiff was " robbing Peter to pay Paul " in order to stay afloat .
He said the Championship side owed around £ 1.9 m and League One Southend £ 411,000 .
Lawyers for Southend agreed staff at the club had not been paid but this would be settled on Monday .
The registrar was told that Southend will receive funds soon , including £ 800,000 from season ticket sales .
Elaine Palser , representing Cardiff , said a " third party " investor would be providing the club with £ 6 m in funds and the tax debts would be paid .
She said the company was not insolvent and had substantial assets including £ 30 m worth of players and the problems had been caused by a " temporary cash flow difficulties " .

BBC News
Sir Tim Berners - Lee was hired to work on the project in June 2009 Countries should be judged on their willingness to open up public data to their citizens , the inventor of the world wide web has told the BBC .
He said " openness of data and the neutrality of the network " should be considered as important as free speech .
Sir Tim Berners - Lee is an advisor to a UK project - data.gov.uk - that offers reams of previously hidden public sector data for anyone to use .
Open data could now be considered a basic right of citizens , he added .
" I think obviously there are more fundamental ones , but within a democratic society if the democracy is going to work you have to have an informed electorate , " he told the BBC .
He said this was of particular importance for developing countries .
" The openness of governments is one of the things which makes investors decide whether to invest , " he said .
" When you make the government open , when they can see what 's happening , they 're much more likely to bring their money and companies into your country . "
' India 's gift '
Many groups around the world are now using open public data to hold public bodies to account .
In Brazil a website that tracks the published wealth of politicians has created many political casualties .
A season of reports exploring the extraordinary power of the internet , including : Digital giants - top thinkers in the business on the future of the web Mapping the internet - a visual representation of the spread of the web over the last 20 years Global Voices - the BBC links up with an online community of bloggers around the world
What is SuperPower ?
Journalist Fernando Rodrigues built the online database Politicos do Brasil which contains details of the campaign finances of 400,000 politicians .
The site was started in 2000 , but as the information becomes more complete , its power increases .
He told the BBC that he believed it had contributed to the removal from office of hundreds of politicians after the 2008 local elections .
" Only six months after the election , 343 mayors and legislators had already lost their jobs because so much data was available about them and it became easy to identify wrongdoings during the electoral process , " he said .
Other countries are less forthcoming with publication of data , but allow their citizens to access it in other ways .
In India , for example , the 2005 Right to Information Act has been met with great enthusiasm .
So far , around two million requests for information have been made .
Yamini Aiyar , director of the accountability initiative at the country 's Centre for Policy Research , said that the Indian public have a strong sense of ownership about the act .
Lack of web access is not a brake on government transparency . "
" People are monitoring the act , looking out for it constantly , questioning the government , " he told the BBC .
" That kind of public ownership is the biggest lesson I think India can give to the world . "
Even lack of internet access is not a barrier for some determined groups .
Indian freedom of information group MKSS , based in Rajasthan , monitors government payments to rural workers .
The group has been a major force pushing for greater openness in government in India .
It collates the information , which may have originally been stored digitally , and then go into villages and paint the results on walls .
" The wall presents a kind of web wall because anyone can come and read that information , " said Nikhil Dey of the group .
' Just beginning '
In both India and Brazil campaigners would like to see more government data proactively published .
But even where data is unavailable , people are proving that the internet can be used to hold people to account .
I think it 's incumbent on those who believe in a positive and healthy society to get off their bums and produce fantastic services that are positive
Tom Loosemore Lacking detailed information on politicians ' incomes , campaigners in Vietnam have started publishing pictures of legislators homes online .
The idea is that the size of a home gives an indication of the wealth of a politician .
" It 's a way to promote transparency , " said Duy Hoang of Viet Tan ( Vietnamese Reform Party ) .
But while there is clearly a demand for open government worldwide , some in the UK and US warn that publishing public data alone is not a panacea .
" There 's a danger in assuming that all we need are these ever increasing volumes of information , " said Nathaniel Heller of non-profit group Global Integrity , which monitors corruption trends worldwide .
" Personally , I think it needs to be matched with other reforms . "
Tom Loosemore , head of 4iP , which funds many of the new websites that make use of the UK government data released under Sir Tim 's scheme , also warned that just publishing data in itself was n't enough .
" I think it 's incumbent on those who believe in a positive and healthy society to get off their bums and produce fantastic services that are positive , " he said .
Websites such as Wheredoesmymoneygo.org have already leading the charge in the UK But Mr Loosemore said there was still a long way to go in fully harnessing the power of public data in the UK .
" There 's an awful lot to play out , but the dam has been breached , " he said .

The gated community in Hemet does n’t seem like the best place for Eddie and Maria Lopez to raise their family anymore .
Vandals knocked out the streetlight in front of the Lopezes ’ five - bedroom home and then took advantage of the darkness to try to steal a van .
Cars are parked four deep in the driveway next door , where a handful of men rent rooms .
And up and down their block of handsome single - family homes are padlocked doors , orange “ no trespassing signs ” and broken front windows .
It was n’t what the Lopezes pictured when they agreed to pay $ 440,000 for their 5,000 - square - foot house in 2006 .
The 427 - home Willowalk tract , built by developer D.R. Horton , featured eight distinct “ villages ” within its block walls .
Along with spacious homes , Willowalk boasted four lakes , a community pool and clubhouse .
Fanciful street names such as Pink Savory Way and Bee Balm Road added to the bucolic image .
Young families seemed to occupy every house , throwing block parties and holiday get - togethers , and distributing a newsletter about the neighborhood , Eddie Lopez recalled .
“ We loved how everything was family - oriented -- all our kids would run around together , ” said Lopez , a 41 - year - old construction supervisor and father of seven .
“ Now everybody ’s gone . ”
Home foreclosures have devastated neighborhoods throughout the country , but the transformation from suburban paradise to blighted community has been especially stark in places like Willowalk -- isolated developments on the far fringes of metropolitan areas that found ready buyers when home prices were soaring but then saw an exodus as values crashed .
Vacant homes are sprinkled throughout Willowalk , betrayed by foot - high grass .
Others are rented , including some to families that use government Section 8 vouchers to live in homes with granite countertops and vaulted ceilings .
When the development opened in 2006 , buyers were drawn to the area by advertising describing it as a “ gated lakeshore community . ”
Now , many in Hemet call Willowalk the “ gated ghetto , ” said John Occhi , a local real estate agent .
There are dozens of places like Willowalk , and they are turning into America ’s newest slums , says Christopher Leinberger , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution .
With home values at a fraction of their peak , he said , it no longer makes sense to live so far from the commercial centers where jobs are concentrated .
“ We built too much of the wrong product in the wrong locations , ” Leinberger said .
Thanks to overbuilding , demographic changes and shifts in preferences , by 2030 there could be 25 million more suburban homes on large lots than are needed , said Arthur C. Nelson of the University of Utah .
Nelson believes that as baby boomers age and as younger generations buy real estate , the population will abandon remote McMansions for smaller homes closer to shops , jobs and the other necessities of life .
Whatever their number , the presence of unwanted or abandoned homes stands to be a burden on local governments for years to come , as cash - strapped cities and counties have to spend precious resources to patrol the neighborhoods and clean unkempt yards and abandoned houses .
“ There are cities saying to us , ‘ I used to have eight code enforcement officers , and now I have one , ’ ” said Bill Higgins , a staff attorney for the League of California Cities .
About 80 California municipalities are striking back , enforcing ordinances that fine lenders up to $ 1,000 a day for not maintaining properties that have been foreclosed , Higgins said .
But most cities do n’t have the resources to force absentee owners or renters to keep up their properties .
In Hemet , city officials have simply boarded up homes in some troubled neighborhoods .
Plywood covers the windows of dozens of apartments on Valley View Drive ; resident David Hall says it keeps prostitutes and drug dealers out .
Willowalk presents a different challenge .
The development promised a Tiffany neighborhood for what was then something closer to a Target price .
“ Leave the world behind as you unwind by our picturesque lakes , ” cooed one advertisement , which touted “ intimate botanical gardens and walking trails , tranquil lakes ” and other attractions .
At first , the reality matched the come-ons .
Maria Lopez , a stay - at - home mother , recalls gazing at the mountains in the distance as her children played with groups of neighbors their own age .
The community pool was just a few blocks away , and she says she used to let her older children , ages 13 and 14 , go there by themselves .
Now she accompanies her children to the pool -- though it has been closed of late -- because the people who now hang out there “ have no class , ” she said , and she sits out front with her children if they play in the yard .
“ My next - door neighbors -- there are so many people living there , I do n’t know who they are , ” she said .
Walking through the development , there is not much evidence of the well - kept yards and friendly families Maria Lopez fondly recalls .
Many of the people answering a knock say they are renters , and wo n’t open their doors more than a crack to see who is on their doorstep .
Red - and - white “ for sale ” signs dot the neighborhood , clashing with the golds and browns of the homes .
The contrast between occupied and empty houses is evident on one block , where high grass in weedy clumps gives way to a neatly mowed lawn with handwritten signs pleading “ Please do not let your dog poop on our yard . ”
Homeowner Norma Hernandez , one of the few people outside on a recent sunny afternoon , can point out which families are permanent on her block .
“ Rented , owned , rented , rented , rented , ” she said , gesturing at the gargantuan houses across the street , one after another .
“ It ’s bad , ” she said , shaking her head .
Nacho Gomez is paid by absentee owners to look after their rental properties .
Currently , he ’s taking care of 17 .
Doing a check of the homes on a recent Thursday , he left his van ’s engine running as he inspected a shattered window in one property .
“ A lot of them ca n’t pay the rent , and they leave the house a mess , ” Gomez said , referring to tenants .
He has had to fix holes punched in walls and replace refrigerators , dishwashers and other appliances -- even ovens -- stolen by renters on their way out .
Those tenants appear to be the exception , and the renters provide at least one benefit :
Without them , there would be even more vacant homes .
Even so , their presence has fundamentally changed the character of what was once sold as an exclusive community .
The Willowalk Homeowners Assn. is trying to recapture some of the community ’s lost spirit .
In recent months , it launched a trash committee -- members pick up rubbish in the park -- and started a neighborhood watch group to keep an eye on residents ’ homes .
But it was n’t enough for Angelica Stewart and her family , who are leaving the $ 318,000 home they bought in 2006 .
To Stewart , living in a gated community is absurd when drug busts are a regular occurrence .
“ It ’s not worth it for us to live in this neighborhood , ” she said .
The Lopez family plans to stick it out , knowing they ca n’t sell their house for anywhere near the $ 440,000 they paid for it .
Based on comparable prices in the neighborhood , the place is probably worth about $ 170,000 now , and maybe less .
They ’re petitioning their bank for a loan modification .
Despite the financial loss and the fact that Eddie Lopez ’s hours at work were cut because of the construction slowdown , the family holds out for a brighter future .
They ’re hoping that Willowalk will someday become the idyllic neighborhood they once knew , nearly as perfect as advertisements had promised .
“ When we moved in , everybody was homeowners , now everybody ’s renting them out , ” Eddie Lopez said .
“ But I have to stay .
There ’s nothing I can do . ”

A mother in small town America was last night struggling to understand how her daughter had been swept up in an alleged international plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist who angered Muslims by depicting the Prophet Mohammed as a dog .
The case of Jamie Paulin - Ramirez , a trainee nurse from Leadville in Colorado , who was arrested in Ireland last week , comes on the heels of charges against another American woman , Colleen LaRose from Philadelphia , who called herself " Jihad Jane " .
Their twin stories are forcing the US to confront the reality of home - grown fundamentalism , and the ease with which individuals can be sucked into an online network of intolerance and violent conspiracy .
And in Leadville over the weekend , the parents of Ms Paulin - Ramirez , 31 , were in no doubt that – despite the absence of official confirmation from investigating authorities in the US or Ireland – it was " Jihad Jane " who had recruited their daughter into the alleged plot to murder Lars Vilks .
" These terrorists came into my home through the internet , uninvited , and have ripped my family apart , " Christine Mott told reporters .
Last night , it appeared that Ms Paulin - Ramirez had been released from custody in Ireland , and her family were seeking news of her six - year - old son with whom she travelled across the Atlantic last year , a few months after converting to Islam .
The Algerian man she travelled to marry was believed to be among three of the seven detainees still in custody .
Growing up , Ms Paulin - Ramirez was " the kid in the class everyone picked on and made fun of , " Ms Mott told the Associated Press .
She was married three times before she left for Ireland , and her first husband used to beat her , she said .
Her second husband , the six - year - old 's father , was an illegal immigrant from Mexico and was deported years ago .
" I 'd yell at her , ' Get off the computer , do something with your son ' , " Mrs Mott said , adding that her increasing extremism led to her estrangement from the family .
" We were enemies .
We could n't even speak to each other .
She lost her mind . "
The Algerian man was Ms LaRose 's " main contact " in Europe , Ms Paulin - Ramirez 's parents claimed .
They had been able to speak regularly with their grandson , Christian , on the phone until the arrest last Tuesday , and had become increasingly angry with their daughter as he was taught how " Christians are going to burn in hellfire " .
His mother had changed his name to Walid after her conversion .
The images of America 's latest homegrown Islamist terror suspects have shaken widely - held beliefs : both Ms Paulin - Ramirez and Ms LaRose are the picture of the all - American blonde .
According to prosecutors , Ms LaRose said she thought her blonde hair and blue eyes would help her move freely in Sweden to carry out an attack .
A 25 - year - old musician was turfed off a South West Trains service after security operatives objected to his " suspicious " set list , The Portsmouth News reports .
Bassist Tom Shaw was putting together the list for his band The Magic Mushrooms , and ill - advisedly included the word " killers " as shorthand for These Things That I 've Done by The Killers .
He explained : " I got on at Fratton and there were two people who looked like they were in luminous Transport Police jackets .
I sat down and they were looking over my shoulder .
" After a couple of minutes they told me I 'd have to get off the train .
When I asked why , they said they 'd speak to me more on the platform . "
He continued : " They made me get out at Fareham and when I asked what was wrong they told me to show them the piece of paper I 'd been writing on .
They said I 'd been behaving suspiciously .
I could n't understand it .
It seemed very strange , as it was just a list of songs .
" We had a gig coming up , so I was writing out what we could play .
They made me explain song by song . "
The other offending items included Franz Ferdinand 's Take Me Out and Cigarettes and Alcohol by Oasis , but the single word " killers " evidently set alarm bells ringing , since security staff told Shaw he'd been targeted " because there had been a ' number of arrests ' nearby including one man who had killed his wife " .
A South West Trains spokeswoman offered : " We employ highly - professional rail community officers who work closely with the British Transport Police in protecting the security of passengers on the rail network .
" During a routine high - visibility patrol , they spoke with a passenger on the platform at Fareham station .
The team clarified the nature of the individual 's business , were satisfied with his explanation and the man went on his way . "
She concluded : " We would like to thank him for his co-operation and understanding of the need to be vigilant in the current environment . "
The The Portsmouth News has snaps of Shaw and his sinister set list right here . ®

Steven Stewart , Director of Corporate Communications of the Stagecoach Group , got in touch this afternoon following publication of this article .
He wrote :
I am writing in connection with the above story , which makes an inaccurate reference to an individual being " turfed off " a train .
Please note that his is completely untrue .
He was politely asked to step off the train by our rail community officers , which he was happy to do .
The train was extremely busy and this was intended to protect Mr Shaw 's privacy whilst we asked him a few questions .
I would appreciate if your story was amended to reflect the true position .

Avatar is in contention for an Oscar because it dominated its field , both technologically and financially .
But another cinematic player was even more dominant last year : Apple .
In the 44 films in 2009 that topped the box office for at least one weekend , an Apple logo or device could be seen in at least 18 of them .
( That ’s almost 41 % . )
In some , Apple products even eclipsed their human scene partners .
This high appearance rate does not include the heap of mass - market films from 2009 that did not own a weekend but also featured Apple product placement .
Just to name a few of those ?
That list includes Drag Me to Hell , Orphan , I Love You , Man , Duplicity , Crank 2 : High Voltage , Ghosts of Girlfriends Past , Imagine That , Sorority Row , Answer Man , Post Grad , I Love You Beth Cooper , All About Steve , Hurt Locker , New York , I Love You , It ’s Complicated , Road Trip : Beer Pong , Law Abiding Citizen , Fantastic Mr. Fox , Funny People and Couples Retreat .

These numbers also do n’t include the mountain of other films and TV shows , from Macs on Regis and Kelly and Jimmy Fallon ’s desks to the Mac grotesquerie of The Office and 30 Rock .
Fruity logo out front , advertisement aglow .
For one month in 2009 , product placement tracking service Nielsen IAG noted 62 total “ occurrences ” of Apple products , more than any other brand , including AT&T ( 59 ) , Coca - Cola ( 55 ) or Ford ( 41 ) .
Playboy , even with a whole show crafted around its brand name , logged a comparatively paltry 21 occurrences .
This is a downturn from 2008 , when Apple appeared in exactly half of the 40 # 1 films .
This achievement comes at the end of a decade - long climb for Apple .
Last year , Apple ’s product placement plan finally topped the heap as well - with Apple appearing in more # 1 films than any other brand , including Ford and Pepsi , which had held the most appearances for every year going back to 2001 ( except 2003 , when the # 1 was Cadillac ) .
Brandchannel.com ’s weekly product placement tracking feature Brandcameo shows that Apple has appeared in 102 of the 302 weekly number one U.S. box office films from 2001 to 2009 - more than 33 % of them .
Apple ’s number is actually higher when period and fantasy / scifi films , in which Apple could not appear , are removed ( the Lord of the Rings trilogy , Star Wars
prequels 3:10 to Yuma , etc. ) .
Measured against Apple ’s real market share , there is a deeply inauthentic nature to many of Apple ’s appearances , particularly films set in administrative hells where the brand is rarely found , whether hospitals ( Scrubs ) or government offices ( 24 , Law Abiding Citizen ) .
Apple ’s “ accomplishment ” is made all the more extraordinary considering how automobile brands , like Ford , so easily and inconsequentially appear in a film ( taxis in films are almost always Fords ) .
Meanwhile , Apple products have to be very deliberately placed by a set designer .
Hamish Purdy , the assistant set decorator for Watchmen ( which featured an Apple “ Easter egg ” ) explains , to some degree , how this happens .
“ One thing we often have to deal with is ‘ clearance ’ to use a product on a set .
If the item has been ‘ product placed , ’ clearance is inherent .
Apple has always been willing to provide product for sets without too much hassle . ”
Yeah , just so that is clear : Apple does not pay for any of this exposure .
As for how Apple products in scenes do n’t always lend realism , Purdy said , “ With shows like CSI , the number one place people â€˜learn ’ about FBI work and police stations , the truth of it is horribly and inaccurately dramatized .
Because the public feels this is what a police station looks like , other shows have to at least take a page from that design so that it registers with the public .
We have created our own monster .
A real police station would just look too boring and even ‘ fake . ’ ”
Apple products have become so expected onscreen that things have gotten bizarre .
The 2007 hit film Wild Hogs featured a character getting an Apple logo tattoo despite an earlier scene with him not even using an Apple computer .
The television show Worst Week attempted to pass off an iPod Touch as an iPhone and when the show Knight Rider went out of its way to use a no - brand prop phone ( clearly a Sony Xperia ) the show was criticized : “ Knight Rider Clones the iPhone , Poorly . ”
That is to say , a show that did not use an Apple product was disparaged for not just using an Apple product .
Even the latest Star Trek , which features no Apple products , had some calling the starship design a “ super duper Apple store , ” an “ internal Apple store of tomorrow , ” “ looks like the SS Apple Store , ” “ an Apple Store 10 years in the future , ” and “ Would you like a tour of the iBridge ? ” [ all sic . ]
( Interestingly enough , in 1999 , Star Trek director J.J. Abrams told Entertainment Weekly of his then - hit show Felicity ’s many Mac placements , “ For me , this is strictly a cultural phenomenon .
There ’s something human and friendly and optimistic about Macintosh . ”
Apple ’s rich history of product placement reaches back to the Mac ’s original era of market dominance , appearing in many 1980s films like Short Circuit and Real Genius .
The 1990s saw Apple make a active effort to highlight its film roles , openly advertising its Mission Impossible and Independence Day tie-ins .
Apple was also hyper - aggressive , with product placing legend Suzanne Forlenza pushing Mac infiltration into television shows such as Veronica ’s Closet , Seinfeld , Ally McBeal , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Dharma & Greg , Felicity , The Drew Carey Show , X - Files , Real World and Just Shoot Me and films You ’ve Got Mail
( obviously ) and Jurassic Park .
So it ’s notable that Apple now makes the same active effort to not draw attention to its outlandish level of product placement .
The brand recently even disabled its official “ Starring Apple ” webpage that highlighted the Apple ’s many cinematic achievements .
In character , Apple declined to comment for this piece or about the fate of that page .
Apple is essentially like Hollywood itself , beautiful , expensive and not at all representative of reality .
And just like disbelief is suspended when Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt portray normal people , Apple product placement is dismissed as creative license .
So the greater question is , how does all this product placement benefit Apple ?
Does it at all ?
Apple computer sales have spiked in recent years .
The reasons for this range from “ people are learning the truth ” to a halo effect created by the iPod and the iPhone .
Comparing Apple ’s product placement numbers since 2001 with its sales and market share , there appears to be an overall increase , though certainly nothing concrete .
If anything , initial data show the increase in Apple onscreen placements ( the vast majority of which are computers ) to be linked to the explosion of the iPod , which also happened to be the explosion of Apple ’s Q Rating .
Tim Aikin , founder and CEO of Boxwish , a site that creates a community of product placement spotters who solve the great quandary of how products can take advantage of their placements , says that as the Apple brand , having always polarized consumers , “ has grown its market share from niche player to mass producer , thanks to the iPod , Intel - based Macs , iTunes and now the iPhone , they need to soften this polarization without losing their core audience and still maintaining a certain sense of exclusivity . ”
Aikin said that Apple ’s product placement is a success because it counteracts the boring sameness inherent in becoming a mass - market leader .
“ Apple is able to keep the brand â€˜cool ’ by having the stars of the movie use the products most overtly and then also throw in the â€˜Easter eggs ’ to maintain a connection with the core audience that gave Apple so much success in its early years . ”
As you can tell , product placement is notorious for having no solid criteria to benchmark success .
Like the Brandchannel and Nielsen IAG numbers , most product placement data cite “ occurrences ” and few results outside the pathetically overly - cited , such as E.T. and Reese ’s Pieces .
A 2009 study of household computer ownership found that “ approximately 12 percent of all U.S. computer owning households own an Apple computer , up from 9 percent in 2008 . ”
While 12 percent representation in the real - world is nowhere near its 50 percent onscreen rate , it still possible that , in conjunction with iPhone and iPod halo effects , all of the free Apple product placement benefits the brand .
It ’s essentially the Head On “ apply directly to the forehead ” approach of repetition ; see Apple after Apple after Apple after Apple after Apple after Apple after Apple in everything everywhere onscreen and a person becomes much more open to considering one of those Macs he ’s hearing so much about .
Then there are the brain scans .
For his latest book , Buyology : Truth and Lies About Why We Buy , Martin Lindstrom conducted scanning to investigate unconscious brain activity in response to marketing , including product placement .
When it comes to Apple and product placement , Lindstrom says Apple is maybe the most sophisticated player in the market : “ What we know today is that a cognitive link between the storyline and the actual brand often scares the consumers away ; it simply is too much â€˜in your face . ’
Non-conscious links therefore will be the future .
The best example of such synergy is what we witness in Wall - E where the Apple logo never is present . ”
Lindstrom says that even though the Apple “ brand ” is rare in Wall - E , audiences make an unconscious value transfer from the movie to the brand .
“ Such value transfer is , according to the Buyology study , most prominent when the viewer is n’t aware of the product placement at the rational level in the brain and only at a non-conscious level . ”
More odd is that Apple ’s increasingly conspicuous product placement dominance draws few complaints when compared to the lesser efforts of brands like Pepsi , General Motors , or Starbucks .
The full spectrum of product placement oppositionists , from those who reject the practice because it “ compromises art ” to those who see it as manipulative marketing , seem to be far more upset about the occasional McDonald ’s placement than a brand that has appeared in more than one third of all box - office hits since 2001 .
A great illustration of this phenomenon is the show 30 Rock , which has been taken to task for its product placements , especially its McDonald ’s McFlurry episode , even while the same show ’s pornographic Mac and iPhone appearances passes with little comment .
About Apple ’s Teflon status , Aikin says that Apple ’s placements are often used in context , such as fulfilling an action in a movie , and are n’t “ just an overt Pepsi truck going through a scene . ”
He also says : “ The products look good .
The increasing popularity of our site serves to show that many movies act almost like a how - to guide to being contemporary and relevant .
Our audience wants to be inspired by movies and Apple , arguably an inspirational brand , fits this well . ”
Leander Kahney , author of Inside Steve ’s Brain , The Cult of Mac and The Cult of iPod and author of the blog Cult of Mac , says of Apple product placement : “ Apple revels in this kind of thing .
Apple has always been overrepresented in movies and TV shows .
Its profile far exceeds its market share .
But there ’s never been a backlash and there never will .
People are more likely to aspire than revolt . ”
Buyology
study might nail the reason why Kahney is right .
Lindstrom points to how preconceived notions about the Apple brand lend it a cloak of immunity against criticism .
“ You ’re left second guessing if Apple had paid for the placement or not .
Apple is not perceived as one of the bad guys - brands such as BP , McDonald ’s and Microsoft often are , either because they ’re seen as being the companies destroying the environment , being unhealthy or greedy . ”
And sure enough Buyology showed that part of what makes Apple ’s product placements immune from criticism is that it is n’t seen as a product at all .
“ Apple has steered clear of this reputation because the brand is more a religion than anything else , ” said Lindstrom .
“ [ The study ] showed a clear correlation between the brand Apple and the faith of Christianity .
And due to such status , people rarely will question the presence of the brand , just as they would n’t question why various religions are featured in movies . ”
But how long will audiences , and especially prop managers , continue to think different about Apple and its product placement ?
As Apple becomes more mass market it may find its culture role increasingly difficult , which in turn may endanger all of its free onscreen exposure .
There is evidence this is already happening .
In small increments , Apple product placement that might have been is being stifled by producers camouflaging the glowing fruit with any number of tricky set props .
A pencil jar here ; a yellow stickie note there .
Apple ’s product placement pace will remain strong in 2010 , with Apple placements already confirmed in the films Book of Eli , When in Rome , Kick Ass , Chloe , The Killers , Wall Street 2 , City Island , She ’s Out of My League , The Joneses , The Spy Next Door , Percy Jackson : Lightning Thief , Valentine ’s Day , The Bounty Hunter and Toy Story 3 .
But the fat years of being a film darling may be on the decline .
Even Madonna eventually got married and had kids .
Coming soon :
The top ten most important Apple product placements of all time .
Abe Sauer ca n’t stop seeing Apple logos everywhere now .
If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s speech to the AIPAC conference is n’t a reason for the US to declare – finally – that they ’ve had quite enough of the " special relationship , " then nothing is .
After ambushing the Vice President of the United States with an announcement that new " settlements " are in the works , the Prime Minister then took his anti-American jihad to the enemy ’s very gates , in Washington , D.C. , where he invoked what Cato policy analyst Justin Logan trenchantly described as " the fallacy of ’ 39 " :
" Seventy - five years ago , many leaders around the world put their heads in the sand .
Untold millions died in the war that followed .
Ultimately , two of history ’s greatest leaders helped turn the tide .
" Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill helped save the world .
But they were too late to save six million of my own people .
The future of the Jewish state can never depend on the goodwill of even the greatest of men .
Israel must always reserve the right to defend itself . "
It ’s always 1939 for Israel ’s amen corner , and the Holocaust is always invoked as justification for whatever atrocities they ’re whitewashing at the moment , but , really , one has to ask , if the Israelis are so damned independent - minded , why do n’t they start " defending " their state all by their lonesome selves ?
That means we can pull the billions we send them – both economic " stimulus " and military aid , not to mention generous loan guarantees – or , better , yet , let the Israelis send those billions back .
Then we ’ll see how much actual substance is behind all the bluster , the boasting , the heroic posturing – exactly nil .
Referring to Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program , Netanyahu averred that " Today an unprecedented threat to humanity looms large . "
Unprecedented ?
Really ?
Yet he ’s old enough to remember the cold war well , a time when the Soviet Union and the United States faced off in a nuclear stalemate that nearly erupted into a hot war .
Has he forgotten ?
I doubt it .
The Soviet Union possessed thousands of nukes : Iran , on the other hand , has yet to produce a single nuclear weapon , and , according to our CIA , they abandoned their nukes program in 2003 .
While they could restart at any time , presumably – albeit not without encountering the technical problems that seem to perpetually bedevil them – this is hardly the equivalent of the US - USSR nuclear standoff .
Yet we ’re quite used to the hyperbolic language the Israelis routinely employ to describe the threats – real and imagined – faced by the Jewish state .
To hear them tell it , a reincarnated Hitler is fiendishly planning a replay of the Holocaust , and the " existential " threat to Israel is imminent and unstoppable except through acts of war ( sanctions , regime change , military action ) .
If this is true , and if Israel can only depend on itself for its defense , then what is holding the Israelis back ?
Why do n’t they attack Iran on their own ?
They do n’t do it because they are completely dependent on the US , and such an attack would not only endanger US troops in Iraq but also plunge the entire Middle East into a war that would decimate American interests in the region and signal the end of the " special relationship " – a relationship based on mutual trust and understanding .
That trust would be gone if the Israelis went after Iran without a green light from Washington – and the Israelis , who know what side their bread is buttered on ( and who ’s paying for the butter ) , would much prefer that someone else fight their battles .
After all , it ’s a strategy that ’s worked so far .
Contra Netanyahu , the Israeli survival strategy has been the complete opposite of defiant independence and military self - sufficiency : they have been joined at the hip to the US military machine since the Reagan years , and they depend on us to keep their socialist economy from falling apart at the seams .
In return for such unusual generosity , Netanyahu and his fellow ultra-nationalists of the Likud party and its extremist allies are spitting in our faces , very publicly humiliating our public officials , and launching an all - out political attack on the interests of the very country they depend on for their survival .
This goes way beyond mere ingratitude – it indicates a very large gap between the values of the givers and those of the takers .
We hear much about the common aims and culture of the US and Israel , the mutual commitment to " democracy , " and the many links that tie our two nations together , .
Yet all this is suddenly swept aside when the characteristically Middle Eastern touchiness and hysteria of the Israelis is provoked – and it takes very little to provoke them .
As the Israeli Prime Minister put it in his speech : " Nothing is rarer in the Middle East than tolerance for the beliefs of others . "
Even rarer , however , is Israeli tolerance for the interests of their American patrons : we are expected to self - sacrificially put Israel first .
American presidents have gone along with it for decades – and so no one should be surprised when they pull a stunt like the Biden ambush .
The Israelis are like spoiled children who ’ve been coddled and indulged way beyond the limits of reason .
If they do n’t get what they want the outcry is deafening – and their agents and apologists are numerous , vocal , and well - placed enough in the US to make quite a bit of noise .
Senators McCain and Lieberman likened the dispute between Washington and Tel Aviv to a " family quarrel , " and advanced the view that the dispute should never have become public .
Aside from the fact that it was the Israelis who went public by blind - siding Biden , is n’t it long past time to apply a little " tough love " to our adopted child in the Promised Land – and maybe even cut off his allowance if he persists in what can only be described as the equivalent of juvenile delinquency ?
As it stands now , the US is subsidizing and supporting the expansion of the Jewish state at the expense of the Palestinians , while Israel is doing its best to drag us into a war with Iran , and ignite the whole region .
The ensuing chaos would give cover to complete the goal of the extremist Likud - far right alliance : the establishment of a " Greater Israel . "
This is a mission the United States should have nothing to do with , and the Obama administration knows it .
Their response to Israeli intransigence is a good first step , but in order to make it stick they must go beyond mere rhetoric .
The Israeli government can’t build settlements if we stop paying for them : they ca n’t threaten their neighbors , oppress an entire people , and maintain a working alliance with the West unless it ’s with our active cooperation .
Cut off their funding – and see how quickly they ’ll turn , because they know their survival is at stake .

" By three methods we may learn wisdom : First , by reflection , which is noblest ; Second , by imitation , which is easiest ; and third by experience , which is the bitterest . "
- Confucius -
It 's a fair question .
When was the last time you really thanked a race volunteer for giving of their time and experience to help make your race experience wonderful ?
I know that racing can be stressful for a lot of runners .
I , myself , get really nervous , especially if it's a race for which I have high hopes of a PR .
A lot of times , I 'm completely focused on myself , looking for a parking spot , finding the shortest porta - potty line , wanting my bib with plenty of time to warm - up , and staying in the groove until the gun goes off .
Then , once you 're racing , you 're often working too hard to really demonstrate your appreciation for that much - needed glass of water or helpful hand pointing you to stay on the course .
But try to imagine the race day from the eyes of a volunteer :
They arrive hours before the first runner and start the day with heavy lifting - literally .
Volunteers who set up a race have to unload boxes of t- shirts , goody bags , food , banners and signs , and let 's not forget gallons and gallons of water .
Next comes registration .
While most runners are going to be friendly and zip through registration or packet pick - up quickly , there are always things to correct : this runner is registered as a male but is actually female - that 's an error that could have a major impact of race results .
Or this runner wants to transfer from the 10 k to the 5 k - better make sure that information gets to the timer !
Out on the course , it 's not just " stand there and clap " for race volunteers .
Rain or shine , cold weather or beating sun , volunteers often have to manage their position for hours on end .
Aid station volunteers get splashed with water and sticky energy drink , and their job is n't done until they 've picked up every single Gu wrapper and crushed paper cup .
Traffic volunteers are key .
Not only will they keep you on course , but they 'll handle the occasional jerk who thinks their right to the roads is more important than runner safety .
True story - I once had to confront a man who was trying to drive up the Portland Marathon Course by Montgomery Park to get to the hospital .
He was irrational - his father had been taken by ambulance - but he was ready to jeopardize hundreds of runners rather than listen to me .
( Fortunately , a large group of spectators and other volunteers soon helped me prove my point and the man drove around . )
Another true story - I was waiting to take pictures at the start of the Shamrock Run in 2008 when a driver berated a teenage traffic volunteer because Naito was closed and he wanted to drive over the Hawthorne Bridge .
( That time , a traffic policeman intervened and the driver left before getting a ticket . )
Finish line volunteers are champs too .
Tearing tags for finish order - which is the standard at most races either for timing or as a back - up to chip timing - sounds fun and easy ; but have you ever tried to rip the tag off a sweaty , hunched over runner why has pinned it to their shorts a little too close to their , um , private areas ?
When more than a few runners finishes together , it becomes a challenge to keep runners in order for accurate results and keep everyone moving .
Besides taking care of these tasks , they have to keep an eye out for that finisher that look like they might regurgitate their pre-race breakfast !
After the runners have collected their finisher medals and had their fill of bananas and energy drink , volunteers still have a lot of work to do .
Pack everything back up , handle lots and lots of trash , and leave the venue looking better than when they got there !
All of this work by volunteers makes races possible .
Some events are able to compensate volunteers by letting them raise funds for a non-profit organization ; Oregon Road Runners Club gives each volunteer at each of their events " ORRC bucks , " which can be used towards ORRC race registrations , membership or merchandise .
However , many smaller - town events are n't able to do that and rely 100 % on the generosity of volunteers .
So next time you 're at a race , whether it 's letting a volunteer direct you to a parking spot , help you pick up your bib and race shirt , or stopping traffic for the participants , make sure you say thank you .
And better yet , sign up to be a volunteer at a race this year .
It 'll make a huge difference to our running community .
Well i can't write a critique because my account type does n't permit it But here are my thoughts : I love these three DC chicks ( with Ivy and Catwoman being my particular favourites ) .
I admire anyone who can give an extra edge to their characters ; one that we have not previously seen .
You 've definately done thisthey each have a very different looks upon their faces , even though they are all in the same scene , and I feel that it is these looks that help to define their characters further .
Perspective is gorgeous and the background detail is just gorgeous !
( Short but sweet ! )
If i were to pick at something , it would be making the characters pop out a little more from the background .
Also , I would make Harley have a large smirk on her face !
Overall , 9/10 Love it !

For the last three months , I ’ve been traveling around Australasia , visiting New Zealand , traveling in Fiji , and roadtriping around Australia ( for the second time ) .
During my travels here , I ’ve noticed something interesting — a lot of the travelers I see are young ( 18 - 24 ) gap year kids on a RTW trip , and most never consider leaving “ the beaten track . ”
It ’s only the older travelers that seem to even want to venture somewhere different .
They want to get out of the party hostels , visit little towns , head west , and , really get to know the culture .
Do n’t get me wrong —
I am happy to see people traveling at all ages .
Whether by tour , cruise , car , or foot , taking the first proverbial step is a feat in itself .
If you ask me , travel has the power to change the world .
The very fact that someone made the effort is amazing .
Not enough people do it .
However , it ’s frustrating to see so many young travelers sticking to the same places , never leave the hostel , get drunk , and just do touristy stuff .
Popular places are popular for a reason , and there is nothing wrong with going to them .
I go to them too .
But , when you have nothing but time , you do n’t really have an excuse to skip the lesser - known destinations .
The majority of long - term travelers always seem to want to stay in the big , popular places .
They never even try to see or experience something different .
Even when I prod them and try to convince them to step off the tourist trail , they seem uninterested .
They just want to follow everyone else because “ that ’s where everyone else is . ”
What ’s the point of travel if you ’re just going to get drunk somewhere ?
You could do that back home .
Take Western Australia , for example .
Not a lot of backpackers travel there .
Almost all the travelers I speak to say they do n’t have enough time to fit it in , even if they are spending months in Australia .
Many just have no real answer as to why they are n’t going .
Yet Western Australia is one of the most beautiful parts of the whole country .
Even Aussies will tell you that if you want to see the “ real ” Australia , head west .
It ’s a lot less developed than the east and incredibly beautiful .
However , most travelers I speak to never even consider it .
They just stick to the highly touristy and overrated Sydney - to - Cairns route .
I see this pattern a lot in other places too .
In New Zealand , travelers follow the backpacker buses and hardly ever head out of the major tourist centers .
In Fiji , they just go to the Yasawa Islands .
In Laos , travelers go tubing , get drunk in Vang Vieng , and then declare that they have seen Laos .
There have always been travelers who just stick to the beaten path .
Some people just do n’t want to make the effort to find something new — they just want to go meet other travelers , have a good time , and get drunk .
But if you only came away to get drunk in another country , what ’s the point of going away ?
Stay home and get drunk cheaper .
And , based on the conversations I ’ve had with people in tourism , this trend in travel seems to be growing .
Backpacking seems to have become an “ industry ” in this part of the world .
Everything seems to be geared toward doing everything for the traveler .
There are special backpacker buses .
Hostels will pick you up from anywhere .
There are special activities , special dinners , and tours .
And hostels even have their own bars to keep you in one place .
Overall , it seems to always be about taking the work out of long - term travel and making it more like a long holiday .
It ’s cheap pre-packaged tourism .
Backpacking has always been about being independent .
I love how you have to figure it all out for yourself .
You find your way and , in the process , you find out about yourself .
You need to figure out trains , languages , and moving from point A to B .
There ’s a journey involved .
In Australia , New Zealand , and Fiji , everything is done for you .
I feel like it ’s becoming more like a guided tour that has you staying in hostels instead of hotels .
It ’s all easy .
You just need to show up , and your hand is held for you .
But travel is more than just going somewhere .
In my world , travel is about going to destinations to experience new things , people , and places .
It ’s about gaining insights into new cultures , trying local food , and , yes , getting drunk at the local waterhole while locals teach you slang and curse words in their native language .
Travel is n’t simply about getting on the Greyhound , being dropped off at a hostel , and then getting shuffled onto a backpacker tour and then a backpacker bar .
It ’s not about always staying on the beaten path or always having your hand held .
Travel is a personal development tool .
It ’s a way to learn new skills , and to grow and connect with new people and new places .
But the more I see these young travelers simply accepting this type of travel , the more I get discouraged .
Is this really what traveling is about ?
I started traveling when I was 25 .
I do n’t think being young is an excuse .
I just think travelers have gotten a bit lazy and have lost that adventurous spirit a bit .
It feels like it ’s not about learning about the world but more a thing to check off your life bucket list .
Then again , maybe I am an old fuddy duddy lamenting about an idea about travel that only existed in my head .
Either way , I wish that idea of travel was more widespread .
Maybe it will change some day .
One can hope .
Editor ’s Note :
My goal here was not to disparage people who travel a certain way .
As I say here , all travelers are equal .
It does n’t matter how you travel .
However , that does n’t mean I do n’t wish people saw something different or lament the fact that backpacking has become more of an industry than an adventure in solo travel .
Everyone has their own opinions .
Just remember that popular destinations are great , but they are n’t the only things that exist .
Most people on an extended trip have the time to see a mix of places .
Book Your Trip : Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight
Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo .
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned .
Book Your Accommodation
You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory .
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel , use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels .
I use them all the time .
Do n’t Forget Travel Insurance
Travel insurance will protect you against illness , injury , theft , and cancellations .
It ’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong .
I never go on a trip without it as I ’ve had to use it many times in the past .
I ’ve been using World Nomads for ten years .

… Any cook daring enough to experiment with variety meats is almost always pleasantly surprised .
The choices are many :
The term encompasses both the innards of an animal , such as its liver , heart and kidneys , and the extremities — head , feet , ears and tail .
And each kind of meat can bring unique flavor and texture to a multitude of delectable dishes .
Images from the book Variety Meats , published by Time Life , 1982 .
Former Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland routinely shredded copies of weekly reports about sexual abuse by priests , according to formerly sealed testimony turned over to Milwaukee County 's district attorney on Thursday .
In a 1993 deposition , Weakland admitted destroying copies of the reports in his office , according to a partial transcript of the deposition released by Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
Peter Isely , SNAP 's Midwest director , turned over the partial transcript , as well as portions of the logs to which Weakland was referring , to Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm and asked him to review them for any possible criminal violations .
Chisholm accepted the records and promised a thorough review .
The 16 - year - old deposition documents have come to light during the discovery process in more than a dozen civil fraud lawsuits filed against the Milwaukee archdiocese .
SNAP made the announcements at a news conference Thursday morning outside Chisholm 's office at the Milwaukee County courts complex .
Julie Wolf , communications director for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee , said Thursday she had not seen the documents SNAP released and could make no comment on them for the archdiocese .
In the deposition , Weakland explains that he got copies of the weekly logs made by vicars in the archdiocese about ongoing problem priests .
He said he would read them , then shred them because he did n't want to keep them in his office .
He would " try to remember anything that is quite serious and important , " and later discuss the matters with the vicar .
SNAP also released portions of logs kept on two abusive priests , Siegfried Widera and Franklyn Becker .
Widera killed himself in 2003 after police cornered him in Mexico ; Becker has been removed from the priesthood .
Isely said not all portions of all vicar logs have been released yet as part of the civil litigation .
Isely said SNAP also will ask Archbishop - designate Jerome Listecki to censure and discipline Weakland and anyone else who may have been involved in covering up sex abuse by clergy .
He said Listecki has refused to say whether he would review why the Diocese of La Crosse , where he is bishop , has cleared more clergy accused of abuse than most dioceses .
Listecki told Wisconsin Public Radio that he did not have enough time left in his term as bishop in La Crosse and that , besides , it was the holiday season .
IONIA --
To the little boy 's mother , it was just a 6 - year - old boy playing around .
But when Mason Jammer , a kindergarten student at Jefferson Elementary in Ionia , curled his fist into the shape of a gun Wednesday and pointed it at another student , school officials said it was no laughing matter .
They suspended Mason until Friday , saying the behavior made other students uncomfortable , said Erin Jammer , Mason 's mother .
School officials allege Mason had displayed this kind of behavior for several months , despite numerous warnings .
" I do think it 's too harsh for a six - year - old , " said Jammer , who was previously warned that if Mason continued the practice he would be suspended .
" He 's six and he just likes to play . "
Jammer says her son is n't violent , and there are other , more effective ways of teaching him not to make a gun with his hand .
" Maybe what you could do is take his recess away , " suggested Jammer , adding her son does n't have toy guns at home .
" He 's only six and he does n't understand any of this . "
Law was jailed in 2002 for the manslaughter of his brother A rail passenger has been found guilty of grabbing and racially abusing a ticket inspector in Hertfordshire .
Charles Law , 50 , of Stratfield Road , Borehamwood , denied racially - aggravated assault at Elstree and Borehamwood station on 29 July 2009 .
A jury at St Albans Crown Court found him guilty and he was remanded in custody by Judge Stephen Warner on the grounds that he could reoffend .
The court then heard that Law had killed his brother in 2002 .
' Tirade of abuse ' Judge Warner called Law " volatile " and said he was considering " a custodial sentence . "
During the trial the court heard Law told Hilton Materke " you are a black man and should not ask a white man for a ticket " .
Geoffrey Porter , prosecuting , told the jury Law was " seeking to avoid payment " when he attempted to follow other passengers through a barrier .
Giving evidence , Mr Materke said : " I asked him if he had a ticket .
He said 'ah yes , that 's a problem . '
" Then he went into a tirade of abuse at me .
He said ' you are a black man and should n't ask a white man for a ticket ' . "
He said he had put his hands up to stop Law going through the barrier when Law swore at him .
" I was a bit upset he would not keep quiet .
In the heat of the moment I said ' If you do n't stop I will kill you . '
" I would n't want to kill anybody .
It was the intensity of the moment .
I wanted to keep him quiet . "
Law denied making any attempt to leave the station and said that he did not have a ticket because he had lost his bag .
" Foolishly I said : ' Negro do n't touch me . '
I said it twice .
I did not believe he had the right to touch me , " said Law Following the jury 's verdict Mr Porter told the court that Law had been jailed for four years in 2002 for stabbing his brother to death .
Law will be sentenced at a later date .

Last year , Jackie Siddall described in a blog post how a message she received on Twitter prompted her to buy a folding kayak for around $ 1,900 .
The vessel was one of about just 600 sold in 2009 by Folbot Inc. , a small retailer in Charleston , S.C. " You ca n't buy that exposure , " says the firm 's co-owner , David AvRutick , who claims the incident speaks to the value of using social media for marketing .
But Mr. AvRutick 's experience may be the exception , rather than the norm .
In its short lifetime , social media — services like Facebook and Twitter — have become popular marketing tools for small firms due to the low cost and easy - to - use format .
Some entrepreneurs say they 're highly effective , but new evidence suggests otherwise .
" The hype right now exceeds the reality , " says Larry Chiagouris , professor of marketing at Pace University 's Lubin School of Business .
Last year , social - media adoption by businesses with fewer than 100 employees doubled to 24 % from 12 % , says a survey released in January of 2,000 U.S. entrepreneurs from the University of Maryland 's Smith School of Business and Network Solutions LLC , a Web - services provider in Herndon , Va .

The mega - data center has become a staple of our global technology infrastructure , serving as the backbone of the digital economy .
The growth of the Internet is driving an enormous appetite for network capacity and data storage , creating a new class of data centers that can scale along with the Internet .
So who has the world 's largest data center ?
We 've seen a lot of huge data centers in our travels , and have identified 10 that we believe are the largest found anywhere .
These data fortresses range between 400,000 and 1.1 million square feet .
We should note that there are many apples vs. oranges comparisons in the data center world .
For this list , we 've considered single - building facilities that are dedicated to data center use .
We have not included multi-facility campuses or mixed - use buildings where data center space co-exists with large amounts of third - party office space ( i.e. big - city carrier hotels ) .
We also have not included facilities that are not yet open for business .

Implementation Requires Python >= 2.6 .
Stores a flattened version of the fasta file without spaces or headers and uses either a mmap of numpy binary format or fseek / fread so the sequence data is never read into memory .
Saves a pickle ( .gdx ) of the start , stop ( for fseek / mmap ) locations of each header in the fasta file for internal use .
Usage >>> from pyfasta import Fasta >>> f = Fasta( ' tests/data/three_chrs.fasta' ) >>> sorted ( f.keys ( ) ) [ ' chr1 ' , ' chr2 ' , ' chr3 ' ] >>> f[' chr1 ' ] NpyFastaRecord ( 0..80 )
Slicing # get full the sequence : >>> a = str(f [' chr1 ' ] ) >>> b = f['chr1 ' ] [ :] >>> a == b True >>> f [' chr1 ' ] [ : 10 ] ' ACTGACTGAC ' # get the 1st basepair in every codon ( it 's python yo ) >>> f[' chr1 ' ] [ ::3 ] 'AGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGT
' # can query by a ' feature ' dictionary ( note this is one based coordinates ) >>> f.sequence ( {' chr ' : ' chr1 ' , ' start ' : 2 , ' stop ' : 9} ) ' CTGACTGA ' # same as : >>> f[' chr1 ' ] [ 1:9 ] ' CTGACTGA ' # use python , zero based coords >>> f.sequence ( {' chr ' : ' chr1 ' , ' start ' : 2 , ' stop ' : 9} , one_based =False ) ' TGACTGA ' # with reverse complement ( automatic for - strand ) >>> f.sequence ( {' chr ' : ' chr1 ' , ' start ' : 2 , ' stop ' : 9 , ' strand ' : '- '} ) ' TCAGTCAG ' Key Function
Sometimes your fasta will have a long header like : “ AT1G51370.2 | Symbols : | F- box family protein | chr1:19045615-19046748 FORWARD ” when you only want to key off : “ AT1G51370.2 ” .
In this case , specify the key_fn argument to the constructor : >>> fkey = Fasta( ' tests/data/key.fasta ' , key_fn=lambda key : key.split( ) [ 0 ] ) >>> sorted ( fkey.keys ( ) ) [ 'a ' , ' b ' , 'c ' ]
Numpy
The default is to use a memmaped numpy array as the backend .
In which case it ’s possible to get back an array directly … >>> f[' chr1 '] . as_string = False >>> f [' chr1 ' ] [ : 10 ] # doctest : + NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
memmap ( [ ' A ' , ' C ' , ' T ' , ' G ' , ' A ' , ' C ' , ' T ' , ' G ' , ' A ' , ' C ' ] , dtype= ' | S1 ' ) >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array ( f ['chr2 ' ] ) >>> a. shape [ 0 ] == len( f[ ' chr2 ' ] )
True >>> a [ 10:14 ] # doctest : + NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
array ( [ ' A ' , ' A ' , ' A ' , ' A ' ] , dtype= ' | S1 ' ) mask a sub- sequence >>> a [ 11:13 ] = np.array ( ' N ' , dtype= ' S1 ' ) >>> a [ 10:14 ].tostring ( ) ' ANNA '
Backends ( Record class )
It ’s also possible to specify another record class as the underlying work - horse for slicing and reading .
Currently , there ’s just the default : NpyFastaRecord which uses numpy memmap
FastaRecord , which uses using fseek / fread
MemoryRecord which reads everything into memory and must reparse the original fasta every time .
TCRecord which is identical to NpyFastaRecord except that it saves the index in a TokyoCabinet hash database , for cases when there are enough records that loading the entire index from a pickle into memory is unwise .
( NOTE : that the sequence is not loaded into memory in either case ) .
It ’s possible to specify the class used with the record_class kwarg to the Fasta constructor : >>> from pyfasta import FastaRecord # default is NpyFastaRecord >>> f = Fasta( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta ' , record_class=FastaRecord ) >>> f[' chr1 ' ]
FastaRecord ( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta.flat ' , 0..80 ) other than the repr , it should behave exactly like the Npy record class backend it ’s possible to create your own using a sub-class of FastaRecord .
see the source in pyfasta / records.py for details .
Flattening
In order to efficiently access the sequence content , pyfasta saves a separate , flattened file with all newlines and headers removed from the sequence .
In the case of large fasta files , one may not wish to save 2 copies of a 5GG + file .
In that case , it ’s possible to flatten the file “ inplace ” , keeping all the headers , and retaining the validity of the fasta file – with the only change being that the new - lines are removed from each sequence .
This can be specified via flatten_inplace =
True >>> import os >>> os.unlink ( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta.gdx ' ) # cleanup non-inplace idx >>> f = Fasta( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta ' , flatten_inplace=True ) >>> f[' chr1 ' ] # note the difference in the output from above .
NpyFastaRecord ( 6..86 ) # sequence from is same as when requested from non -flat file above . >>> f[' chr1 ' ] [ 1:9 ] ' CTGACTGA ' # the flattened file is kept as a place holder without the sequence data . >>> open ( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta.flat').read ( ) ' @flattened@ '
Command Line Interface there ’s also a command line interface to manipulate / view fasta files .
the pyfasta executable is installed via setuptools , running it will show help text .
split a fasta file into 6 new files of relatively even size : $ pyfasta split -n 6 original .
fasta split the fasta file into one new file per header with “ %( seqid ) s ” being filled into each filename . : $ pyfasta split –header “ %( seqid ) s.fasta ” original .
fasta create 1 new fasta file with the sequence split into 10K - mers : $ pyfasta split -n 1 - k 10000 original .
fasta 2 new fasta files with the sequence split into 10K - mers with 2 K overlap : $ pyfasta split -n 2 - k 10000 -o 2000 original .
fasta show some info about the file ( and show gc content ) : $ pyfasta info –gc test/ data/three_chrs.fasta extract sequence from the file .
use the header flag to make a new fasta file .
the args are a list of sequences to extract .
$ pyfasta extract –header –fasta test/data/three_chrs.fasta seqa seqb seqc extract sequence from a file using a file containing the headers not wanted in the new file : $ pyfasta extract –header – fasta input .
fasta –exclude –file seqids_to_exclude.txt extract sequence from a fasta file with complex keys where we only want to lookup based on the part before the space .
$ pyfasta extract –header – fasta input.with.keys.fasta –space –file seqids .
txt flatten a file inplace , for faster later use by pyfasta , and without creating another copy .
( Flattening ) $ pyfasta flatten input.fasta
cleanup ( though for real use these will remain for faster access ) >>> os.unlink ( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta.gdx ' ) >>> os.unlink ( 'tests/data/three_chrs.fasta.flat ' )
Testing there is currently > 99 % test coverage for the 2 modules and all included record classes .
to run the tests : $ python setup.py nosetests
How to Pickup Girls with your Buddy
Guest post by Rob Judge
One of the more unfortunate terms in the PUA lexicon is “ the wingman ” .
The term reduces potential friendships to pure utility .
Whenever you call someone your “ wing , ” it connotes “ man-acquaintance for picking up chicks ” rather than “ cool guy I ’d consider a friend ” .
Even more unfortunate , when guys go out with a wingman , or with a fleet of wingmen , the vibe is super creepy and predatory , rather than fun and laid back .
Obviously , such a zero-sum mentality makes meeting and attracting women much more difficult , and much less fun .
When I first started going out to learn to attract beautiful women , I was fortunate enough to have met my charismatic wing , Zack Bauer .
Lucky for us , we become fast friends instead of simply founding our relationship on “ sarging . ”
When Zack and I first started , we both pretty much sucked .
Now , however , all those “ sucky nights ” make for hilarious jokes and funny memories that only strengthen our friendship .
If you saw Zack and I on Mehow ’s Infield Insider , you probably know we use our inside jokes and fun vibe to suck girls into our party , rather than try to creepily snake our way into their party .
As such , here are some simple tips that will make sure you treat your “ wingman ” more like a buddy and less like a creepy pickup accessory .
The Buddy System
Always remember that your wingman is your friend first !
While lots of male friendships form around getting girls , make sure your friendship is win-win .
If your buddy wings you one night , you should be ready to wing him next time .
If your wing hooks you up with a cute girl , you should try to return the favor .
The Vibe Starts Here
Cultivate a friendship with your wing away from meeting girls , as well .
Even if it ’s just grabbing dinner and joking around before going out , the vibe always starts before you guys go out to meet women .
Your wingman should be someone you are proud to call a friend .
You and your wing should generate fun together and keep each other positive and motivated .
Sometimes wingmen help each other by distracting jealous guys , neutralizing spiteful people , or even hooking up her less desirable friend ( commonly called “ jumping on a grenade ” ) .
The Introduction
Whenever you bring your wing into an interaction , simply introduce him .
“ Hey guys , meet my friend Zack , ” is a perfect introduction .
Avoid big , over the top introductions .
If your wing is cool , he can demonstrate it himself .
You do not need to sell him like an infomercial .
Friends and cool people do not act like that .
Tactical Tact
Whichever of you begins the interaction with a group of girls , the wingman can enter about 30 - 40 seconds later .
When he does , he should engage the rest of the group by being friendly .
A common mistake is for the wing to come in and run game on your girl ’s friend or friends .
Your wing you should NOT double game the group .
Since the group already likes you , your wing will automatically benefit from the second - hand attraction .
Most of the time , the friend of your girl will actually game your wing .
As long as he carries a decent conversation , he ’s good to go .
Handling Pains in the Ass
Sometimes , however , a friend will not “ play ball ” with your wing .
Maybe she ’s jealous of her friend , has a serious boyfriend , or simply is not in the mood to meet guys .
Regardless , your wing should read the situation and back off .
He should try to minimize the resistance your girl ’s friend may exert on you and your girl .
He can do this by saying something like , “ Hey look , I think you ’re a cool girl , but I can see we ’re not as into each other as our friends .
So let ’s just hang out and not feel awkward or feel like we need to be all over each other .
But also , let ’s give our friends space to get to know each other , too .
They really seem to like each other .
How long have you known your friend for ? ”
From there , your wing should casually drop in some details that let ’s her friend know you are a normal , safe guy ( e.g. he should mention your job , education , where you live , your relationship with your family , etc. ) .
One of the nice things about this job is that I ’m meeting lots of interesting startups who are doing mobile apps .
My fave so far is Bump .
The idea is simple : I bump your phone with mine , and the result is that I transfer something to you ; say , a phone number , or a picture , or , of course , money .
A good place to start getting the picture would be their FAQ .
This is the kind of technology I like ; a simple effect , instantly understandable , that requires rocket science under the covers to pull off .
Bump and Android ·
There ’s good news and bad news .
The good news is that they ’re running on Android ( very nicely ) and shipping an Android API .
You can bump an iPhone and an Android together and it Just Works , no problemo .
In fact , there are a couple of things they can do in Android that are harder on other platforms ; for example , because of the Android Intent feature , you can register Bump to , for example , share pictures .
Of course , nothing ’s perfect .
The Bump guys had run across a couple of issues which were causing them extra work at release time , and really should n’t have .
So I visited them to look at the source code so we can figure out how to set things up so that particular bug does n’t bite anyone else .
Any other startups reading this , I ’d be happy to get pitches .
But I probably wo n’t write you up here unless I ’m actually going to use your app myself .
Discovering Urbit : Functional programming from scratch
C. Guy Yarvin recently published a project in language and systems design .
His own writing about his work is entertaining but verbose , so I will attempt to explain it in my own words here .
Nock , Urbit , Watt
First there is Nock , “ a tool for defining higher - level languages – comparable to the lambda calculus , but meant as foundational system software rather than foundational meta­mathe­matics . ”
Its primitives include positive integers with equality and increment operators , cons cells with car / cdr / cadr / etc. , and a macro for convenient branching .
Nock uses trees of integers to represent both code and data .
Nock is aggressively tiny ; the spec linked above is just 33 terse lines .
Next , Yarvin provides the rationale for Nock .
In short , he asks how a planet - wide computing infrastructure ( OS , networking , and languages ) would look if designed from first priniciples for robustness and interoperability .
The answer he proposes is Urbit : a URI - like name­space distributed globally via content - centric networking , with a feudal structure for top - level names and cryptographic identities .
Urbit is a static functional name­space : it is both referentially transparent and monotonic ( a name , once bound to a value , cannot be un- or re-bound ) .
Why does this require a new formal logic and a new programming language ?
In Urbit , all data and code are distributed via the global namespace .
For interoperability , the code must have a standard format .
Nock 's minimal spec is meant to be an un­ambiguous , unchanging , totally standardized basis for computation in Urbit .
Above it will be Watt , a self - hosting language that compiles to Nock .
Urbit itself will be implemented in Watt , so Nock and Watt are designed to treat data as code using metacircular evaluation .
The code
A prototype implementation of Watt is on GitHub .
It is not yet self - hosting ; the current compiler is written in C .
Watt is a functional language with static types called “ molds ” and a mechanism for explicit lazy evaluation .
( I was suprised to find I had accidentally created an in­com­patible lazy dialect of Nock – despite its goal of unambiguous semantics – just by implementing it in Haskell . )
The code is not fully documented , but the repository contains draft specs for both Watt and Urbit .
Beware : the syntax and terminology are a bit unconventional .
Yarvin has offered a few exercises to help get started with Nock and Watt :
The Nock challenge : Write a decrement operator in Nock , and an interpreter that can evaluate it .
Basic Watt : Write an integer square root function in Watt .
Advanced Watt :
How would you write a function that tests whether molds A and B are orthogonal ( no noun is in both A and B ) ?
Or compatible ( any noun in A is also in B ) ?
Are these functions NP - complete ?
If so , how might one work around this in practice ?
If you want to learn more , start with these problems .
You can email your solutions to Yarvin .
Will it work ?
I find Urbit intellectually appealing ; it is a simple and clean architecture that could potentially replace a lot of complex system software .
But can we get there from here ?
Yarvin imagines Urbit as the product of an ages - old Martian civilization :
Since Earth code is fifty years old , and Martian code is fifty million years old , Martian code has been evolving into a big ball of mud for a million times longer than Earth software .
( And two million times longer than Windows . ) …
Therefore , at some point in Martian history , some abject fsck of a Martian code - monkey must have said : fsck this entire fscking ball of mud .
For lo , its defects cannot be summarized ; for they exceed the global supply of bullet points ; for numerous as the fishes in the sea , like the fishes in the sea they fsck , making more little fscking fishes .
For lo , it is fscked , and a big ball of mud .
And there is only one thing to do with it : obliterate the trunk , fire the developers , and hire a whole new fscking army of Martian code - monkeys to rewrite the entire fscking thing .
…
This is the crucial inference we can draw about Mars : since the Martians had 50 million years to try , in the end they must have succeeded .
The result : Martian code , as we know it today .
Not enormous and horrible – tiny and diamond - perfect .
Moreover , because it is tiny and diamond - perfect , it is perfectly stable and never changes or decays .
It neither is a big ball of mud , nor tends to become one .
It has achieved its final , permanent and excellent state .
Do Earthlings have the will to throw out the whole ball of mud and start from scratch ?
I doubt it .
We can build Urbit but no one will come , unless it solves some problem radically better than current software .
Moldbug thinks feudalism will produce better online reputation , but feudal reputation does not require feudal identity ; it is not that much harder to build Moldbug 's reputation system on Earth than on Mars .
I still have not figured out the killer app that will get early adopters to switch to Urbit .
Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
||| DAVID NUTT var formann for ACMD , Storbritannias vitenskapelige råd i rusmiddelspørsmål .
Da myndighetene klassifiserte hasj som mer skadelig og alvorlig enn før , påpekte han at dette var uten faglig grunnlag .
Sammen med en artikkel der han sammenlignet risikoen for akutt skade ved hesteridning ( 1 per 350 ) med tilsvarende for ecstasybruk ( 1 per 10 000 ) , var det nok til at innenriksministeren ga ham sparken sent i 2009 .
- En rådgiver for myndighetene , sa ministeren , - kan ikke samtidig motarbeide myndighetenes politikk .
GITT DE FUNN forskere har gjort , kan dette snus på hodet :
Kan en vitenskapelig rådgiver her la være å motarbeide politikken som føres ?
Her er noen studier som illustrerer poenget .
1. AVKRIMINALISERING har liten effekt på bruk .
Forskerne MacCoun og Reuter studerte konsekvensene av ulike typer avkriminalisering , fra lisensiert salg i coffeeshops til å gi bøter snarere enn fengsling og strafferegistrering .
Artiklene ( en av dem i prestisjetunge Science ) fant at avkriminalisering — enten det var Nederland , Australia eller stater i USA — hadde liten innvirkning på omfanget av cannabisbruk .
Senere forskning peker i samme retning , som vist av en større kunnskapsoppsummering fra Beckley Foundation i 2008 : Frykten for en brukseksplosjon er ubegrunnet .
2. ØKT HASJBRUK vil gi få nye narkomane .
Stasjonssjef Kåre Stølen ved Grønland politistasjon forsvarte hardere innsats mot hasjkjøpere ved å si : « Spør de slitne brukerne utenfor Oslo S hvor de begynte .
Alle begynte med hasj og svakere stoffer ! »
Bent Høie ( H ) , leder i helse - og omsorgskomiteen på Stortinget , brukte samme argument for å avfeie tidligere høyesterettsdommer Ketil Lunds tanker om avkriminalisering .
Dette er « trappetrinnshypotesen » : Hasj leder til tyngre stoffer .
Ett problem med dette er at vi vet det er en overopphopning av ungdom på skråplanet blant dagens hasjbrukere .
Sosiale vansker , personlighetstrekk , miljø og gener påvirker bruk av både hasj og andre stoffer , og blåser opp den tilsynelatende effekten .
Når forskere kontrollerer for slike forskjeller faller effekten dramatisk — og blir raskt mer enn halvert .
En gruppe ledende forskere konkluderte i Beckley - rapporten med at spørsmålet fremdeles må sies å være uavklart , men at indisiene tyder på en reell , men liten effekt .
Et annet problem er at trappetrinnseffekten ikke er uavhengig av forbudet :
En avkriminalisering kan skille hasjmarkedet fra hardere stoffer , skjerpe normskillet mellom hasj og hardere stoffer ( det virker for eksempel som om effekten er svakere i Oslo , der hasj også er mer normalisert ) , og gjøre det lettere å rette arbeid mot unge ( effekten ser ut til å falle kraftig med alder ) .
Betydningen av trappetrinnseffekten avhenger av styrken på den , og den ser ut til å være svak .
Selv om en avkriminalisering mot erfaring skulle øke antallet hasjrøykere med ti prosent , tyder norske data på at økningen i antallet som bruker hardere stoffer ville ligge et sted mellom ubetydelig og noen titalls personer per årskull .
3. EFFEKTEN PÅ schizofreni er liten .
Risikoøkningen for schizofreni blant hasjrøykere har tidligere vakt oppsikt , men igjen avhenger betydningen av styrken på effekten : Resultater fra fagbladet Addiction i fjor tyder på at vi må unngå nærmere 3000 mannlige ( eller 5 500 kvinnelige ) tunge cannabis - brukere i aldersgruppen 20 - 24 ( alderen der effekten er størst ) for å forvente ett unngått tilfelle av schizofreni .
Årlig er det rundt 450- 650 nye tilfeller av schizofreni i Norge .
Selv om antallet hasjbrukere mot all erfaring skulle dobles av en avkriminalisering , ville dette tallet øke med en til to prosent , røft regnet .
4. DEN TOTALE risikoen ved bruk av lette , illegale rusmidler er lav .
Når vi vurderer et stoff er det viktig å sette helheten av skadeeffekter i en forståelig sammenheng : I verdens kanskje mest prestisjetunge medisinertidsskrift fikk over nevnte
Nutt fagpersoner til å vurdere en rekke legale og illegale stoffer etter klare , omfattende kriterier .
Tunge stoffer som heroin og kokain var klart farligst — men lettere stoffer som hasj , khat og LSD var klart mindre skadelig for samfunn og individ enn både alkohol og tobakk .
SIRUS - forsker Hilde Pape har uttalt lignende : « Etter alt å dømme er cannabis mindre farlig enn alkohol .
Det finnes to solide internasjonale publikasjoner som peker entydig i den retning .
Både når det går på helseskader , avhengighetspotensial og psykososiale problemer kommer alkohol ut som klart farligere enn cannabis . »
5. STRAFFEN SKADER mer enn hasjen .
Kriminalisering av cannabis tar ressurser fra mer alvorlig kriminalitet i politi og rettsapparat , og kan ha klare negative konsekvenser for ellers lovlydige mennesker : I Australske delstater som reagerte på hasjbruk med siktelse , var det blant førstegangsovertredere betydelig flere negative konsekvenser i forhold til jobb , romantisk partner , bosituasjon , og senere kontakt med rettsvesen , enn det var der statene bare ga bøter .
Hvor mange gjelder dette i Norge ?
Det gjøres 10 000 beslag av cannabis i året , stort sett knyttet til « bruk og besittelse » .
Politiet fører ikke statistikk etter type stoff , men dette gir et øvre tall , og fra andre land vet vi at cannabis utgjør en stor andel av alle arrestasjoner for stoff : 75 prosent i Australia , 60 prosent i Tyskland .
Ser vi på lignende arrestrater per hasjbruker som Storbritannia , Østerrike , Frankrike , Tyskland , Australia og USA tilsier det at mellom to og fem tusen tas for hasjbruk i Norge årlig .
At straffen er verre enn det vi straffer for , bidro til at straffelovskommisjonen , professor Willy Pedersen , tidligere nevnte Ketil Lund og avdøde jussnestor Johs .
Andenæs fremmet forslag om avkriminalisering .
Ønsker noen i det hele tatt at alle som har kjøpt eller brukt cannabis skulle vært straffet og registrert — en gruppe som ville inkludert statsminister Jens Stoltenberg , SV - politiker Inge Marte Thorkildsen , tidligere narkotikasjef i Oslopolitiet Christine Fossen , og en tredjedel av alle unge voksne mellom 21 og 30 ?
VI KAN VEKTE ulike hensyn på forskjellig måte , men bør alle forholde oss til det samme saksgrunnlaget : Forbudet har høye kostnader i form av ressursbruk og konsekvenser for ellers lovlydige brukere .
En avkriminalisering vil neppe føre til betydelig bruksøkning , og skulle den gjøre det , er skadene få .

The Large Hadron Collider , the world 's biggest physics experiment , has broken its own particle beam energy record .
On Friday morning , the machine created two beams of protons , each with an energy of 3.5 trillion electron volts .
The effort breaks the prior record , set by the LHC in December , of just over a trillion electron volts in each beam .
The LHC will now aim to smash those two beams together , hoping to create new particles that give insight into the most fundamental workings of physics .
The experiment , housed in a 27 km - long tunnel under the outskirts of Geneva in Switzerland , has only been back online since November 2009 .
A breakdown and helium leak in 2008 , shortly after the machine was first switched on , took some 14 months to repair .
" Getting the beams to 3.5 TeV is testimony to the soundness of the LHC 's overall design , and the improvements we 've made since the breakdown in September 2008 , " said Steve Myers , director for accelerators and technology at the Swiss laboratory Cern , where the LHC is based .
The LHC 's experiments create showers of particles " It 's a great credit to the patience and dedication of the LHC operation team . "
Since coming back online , the machine has exhibited performance that was " remarkable " , according to Cern director general Rolf Heuer .
In an announcement of the 3.5 TeV result , he congratulated the LHC team and stressed the cutting - edge nature of its work .
" We must not lose sight of the fact that the LHC is new , and it was n't bought off the shelf , " he wrote .
As with all particle accelerators , the LHC will be periodically shut down for maintenance , but LHC officials recently decided to significantly lengthen the shutdown period .
This is in part because the machine takes so long to reach and return from the low temperatures required for its experiments .
But the shutdown scheduled for late 2011 will also address an issue with the joints between the machine 's superconducting magnets , which must be strengthened before the LHC can run at even higher energies .
" It is a state of the art prototype that is pushing the limits of technology across a wide range of disciplines , and as such it needs to be treated with the greatest respect , " Professor Heuer wrote .
" It takes time , but as we 've seen this week , patience pays dividends . "

I am growing more and more tired of seeing what appears to be a very " helpful " algorithm running in the SPY .
I am using the term " helpful " very lightly .
I relate this algorithm to a jumper cable , your car will run once you get the jump if your battery is running low right ?
Now lets say volume in our market is equivalent to a discharged but not quiet a dead battery yet .
Symptoms of the market being a " dead battery " are sluggish movement through key pivot levels on a daily 1 min chart , along with violent price spikes within the 1 min candle .
So how do we fix a market which does not have the Umph it needs to stay liquid and trade while not remaining flat all day after the initial 30 min opening volatility ?
A quant algo of course !
First a little background on why the SPY would be a good target for some undercover manipulation .
As you may or may not know ETF 's run our retail markets .
The S&P depository Trust buys and sells individual components of the S&P 's based on movement within the index .
Simple right ?
Well if you say , " Screw it , I am purchasing the 500 S&P components via the SPY ETF .
Now i can buy little pieces of the components without laying out the cash to buy them individually . "
GREAT !
If you are a buy and hold investor looking to leverage your hard earned dollar .
Now lets think about how the normal operation of the SPY can cause manipulation ...
* If there is a huge buyer day in and day out of the SPY whom has no interest in holding for a long period of time how would this affect the components ?
The direct affect of SPY purchasing would cause the cash market ( individual stocks , not futures ) to trade in a much more liquid manner in whatever direction the purchaser is leaning .
Now for the juicy stuff ... For months now i have been watching a specific algorithm push our markets around with great ease .
It looks like this algo is giving the SPY a little push through support and resistance levels with massive size executed in seconds .
Sometimes the push is tens of thousands of shares , the size all depends on the natural volume around the level which the SPY is trading at the time it may need a " Jump " .
For instance if the market is oversold on a 1 min time frame and is trying to break higher off lows but just cant get the party going on its own , the algo will come in and take offers until day traders , scalpers , swing traders jump in and chase the market higher .
Once the price gets " jumped " the algo just sits and waits till natural buyers and sellers are few and far between and it either dumps or takes in more .
Usually the program will reset itself after a trade , then will wait till it senses low volume once again .
For some concrete evidence of this action i have done a quick illustration , which includes Time & Sales which only display prints on the exchange the algorithm does business on .
This exchange is used because of its very nice rebate structure , and it allows the algo to exploit the SOES , meaning it cannot trade in blocks larger than 10000 shares per order .
So what does it do , it takes blocks almost 10,000 shares multiple times a second , this price action causes the market to lift violently .
This is not small money , remember small money follows big money .
The algo in question starts buying at 110.04 with one block of 9999 shares , followed by 60 k more shares all bought in under two minutes .
You can see from the chart how the SPY reacted , it violently moved higher all the way up to 110.55 , where the algo dumped just about all of the shares , you can see the prints in the " dump " prints window , again only showing the print from the exchange the algo does business on .
The algo did its job , the cash market snapped back , the components again caught a bid and moved higher through resistance .
I.E. they look alive and well ...
Natural buyers came in above the 110.55 level chasing the market up another 50 cents or so before they left and the SPY fell again because the volume was not there to support the massive run up which took place over 15 minutes .
As you can see the algo works in two capacities , it manipulates the market to the upside along with keeping S&P500 components trading in a liquid orderly " non flat " fashion .
The 650,000,000,000 $ question now is ..
What would our markets look like if this " jump starting " was not taking place every day ?
I think you know the answer .
Twenty years ago Nelson Mandela walked free from prison .
His release was followed by the end of apartheid and his election as the country 's first democratic president .
James Robbins reports .
December 11 , 2009 .
New York , NY - Today , U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon granted a preliminary injunction against the United States for unconstitutionally withholding funds from ACORN .
In its decision , the court found that there is a likelihood the plaintiffs will be able to show that Congress ’ targeted defunding of ACORN violates the Constitution ’s prohibition against Bills of Attainder , legislative acts which single out a specific person or group for punishment .
The Court ’s ruling stated , “ The plaintiffs have raised a fundamental issue of separation of powers .
They have been singled out by Congress for punishment that directly and immediately affects their ability to continue to obtain federal funding , in the absence of any judicial , or administrative , process adjudicating guilt ...
The public will not suffer harm by allowing the plaintiffs to continue work on contracts duly awarded by federal agencies ... ”
After the preliminary injunction was granted , Bertha Lewis , ACORN ’s Executive Director , said , “ The court 's decision is a victory not only for the many dedicated citizens who work with ACORN to improve their communities and promote responsible lending and homeownership , but for the Constitution and the rights of all Americans . ”
According to Jules Lobel , CCR Vice - President and Cooperating Attorney : “ This historic decision by the Court affirms the fundamental constitutional principle that the Congress cannot be judge , jury , and executioner . ”
CCR Legal Director Bill Quigley added , “ This ruling protects not only ACORN but all other organizations or individuals that Congress unfairly targets .
The clearly partisan push by the far right to punish those it politically disagrees with has ended here . ”
See CCR's ACORN v. U.S.A. webpage for more information on this case .
The fallout between Infinity Ward and Activision has taken yet another dramatic turn , as a large number of IW employees — both current and former — have filed a class - action lawsuit against the publisher for between $ 75 million and $ 125 million in unpaid bonuses .
The report comes via G4tv.com , which has obtained a copy of the lawsuit being filed by 38 people referring to themselves as the Infinity Ward Employee Group .
The suit alleges that Activision breached a contract by not paying the entirety of the royalties due to employees after the success of Modern Warfare 2 .
According to the report , Activision has paid $ 28 million in royalties so far , but still owes $ 54 million for 2009 , as well as other bonuses based on the first quarter of 2010 .
The group is also seeking $ 75 million to $ 500 million in punitive damages .
" Activision owes my clients approximately $ 75 million to $ 125 million dollars , " attorney Bruce Isaacs told G4 .
" Activision has withheld most of the money to force many of my people to stay , some against their will , so that they would finish the delivery of Modern Warfare 3 .
That is not what they wanted to do .
Many of them .
My clients [ are ] entitled to their money .
Activision has no right to withhold their money — our money . "
Employees continue to leave
Up until now , a total of 26 employees have left Infinity Ward , which means that at least 12 members of the Employee Group are still with the studio .
Previously , Activision spokesman Dan Amrich said that employees who leave the studio would be giving up their bonus , and that " the more people that leave , the bigger the bonus gets for the people who stay . "
In light of allegations that the money was being held as a kind of ransom to get employees to stay , those statements look rather damning .
Many of the departed Infinity Ward developers have found a new home at Respawn Entertainment .
Activision , for its part , believes it has done nothing wrong .
" Activision believes the action is without merit .
Activision retains the discretion to determine the amount and the schedule of bonus payments for MW2 and has acted consistent with its rights and the law at all times .
We look forward to getting judicial confirmation that our position is right , " the company responded in a statement .

A researcher from The University of Western Ontario has helped solve a 37 - year old space mystery using lunar images released March 15 by NASA and maps from his own atlas of the moon .
Phil Stooke , a professor cross appointed to Western 's Departments of Physics & Astronomy and Geography , published a reference book on lunar exploration in 2007 entitled , " The International Atlas of Lunar Exploration . "
On March 15 , images and data from NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) were posted .
The LRO , scheduled for a one year exploration mission about 31 miles above the lunar surface , will produce a comprehensive map , search for resources and potential safe landing sites and measure lunar temperatures and radiation levels .
Using his atlas and the NASA images , Stooke pinpointed the exact location of the Russian rover Lunokhod 2 , discovering tracks left by the lunar sampler 37 years ago after it made a 35 - kilometre trek .
The journey was the longest any robotic rover has ever been driven on another celestial body .
As soon as the NASA photos were released , scientists around the world , including Stooke , began work to locate the rover .
Stooke set up a searchable image database and located the photograph he needed , among thousands of others .
" The tracks were visible at once , " says Stooke .
" Knowing the history of the mission , it 's possible to trace the rover 's activities in fine detail .
We can see where it measured the magnetic field , driving back and forth over the same route to improve the data .
And we can also see where it drove into a small crater , and accidentally covered its heat radiator with soil as it struggled to get out again .
That ultimately caused it to overheat and stop working .
And the rover itself shows up as a dark spot right where it stopped . "
The find , he adds will mean that older maps published by Russia will now need to be revised .
Stooke says that NASA scientists have used his atlas in both preparation and data recovery .
His next project is a similar volume on Mars exploration which will include the best maps of the moons of Mars .
Brian Kruth StoryJust one year ago , David Ryan was an international banker with HSBC .
He had done stints in Bahrain , China , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Turkey , and London over the course of 17 years .
However , by the time Ryan had landed in New York City two and a half years ago , he says , " the buzz for me was gone . "
Exciting as a two - decade spin around the globe once was , Ryan says , his chosen profession was simply , " not as exciting as it had been . " Ryan entered into what he calls , " a pretty long period of reflection " regarding his career path and future .
Like many suffering from job ennui , Ryan was ready to do something new , the question was how to do it .
Having nursed a lifelong love of dogs , Ryan realized that he was interested in potentially moving in that direction but was unsure of how exactly he could turn his passion into a sustainable career .
Enter a two - year - old Portland ( Ore. ) - based company called Vocation Vacations , a business that gives people the opportunity to " test drive " their dream jobs .
Creating temporary but intense mentor / apprenticeship experiences , Vocation Vacations enlists professionals from a variety of fields -- everything from winemakers and makeup artists to architects and sword makers -- and pairs them with people who fantasize about leaving their day jobs and want spend a few days in a profession that they had previously thought beyond their reach .
Last April , Ryan signed up to do a two - and - a - half - day vocation working with a doggie day - care provider in Massachusetts .
The following month , he spent three days working with a dog trainer in Oregon .
Fairly quickly , Ryan figured out that he preferred training to day care and was confident that he could start his own business in the field .
Moreover , Ryan says the experience helped him to realize that he did n't have to abandon the skills he developed as a banker .
Rather , he says : " It became obvious to me that there were a lot of kennels and trainers that were very good with animals , but business was not their specialty .
"
In June , Ryan resigned from HSBC and enrolled in a dog- training school in Missouri for five months to get certified .
In January , he launched Beyond Dog Training in Rye , N. H. " It really sounds weird , " he says .
" But that two - to three - day experience has really been a lynchpin .
" Vocation Vacations was started by Brian Kurth in 2004 after he made the leap from unhappy employee to dream - job entrepreneur .
At the time , Kurth says he was burnt out working for Ameritech in Chicago and logging in three hour commutes .
" I did n't hate corporate life , or my job or my boss , " he says .
" But I hated the lifestyle .
I wanted to do something more fulfilling .
I was tired of going to dinner parties [ where ] people would talk about their exciting lives as architects or photographers and I worked at the phone company .
People 's heads hit their spaghetti plates when I told them .
Nobody cared , and neither did I .
" So in 2000 , Kurth quit his job .
In quick succession , he worked for a dot - com , got laid off when the economy imploded , and then sold his house and spent six months driving across the country , eventually settling in Portland .
That city did n't have much in the way of industry and was in the midst of a recession , so he ended up working on a vineyard doing product marketing and sales for a family winery .
Kurth found that there was something immeasurably rewarding about stepping outside of his routine and trying something new .
Inspired , he came up with the concept and business plan for Vocation Vacations .
The idea is relatively simple .
Participants pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand ( transportation , lodging , etc. , are n't included ) to experience life as , say , a chocolatier , a fashion designer , or a race - car driver .
The time spent immersed in their fantasy job allows them to get a 360 - degree perspective without the risk of quitting their own jobs or investing heavily in a new career .
Laura
Thomas says she 's " miserable " in her job as a business - operations developer for a government contractor in Alexandria , Va .
" My boss knows I 'm not happy , and he 's looking for something else [ for me at the company ] , but there is n't a lot of opportunity for growth .
"
Not quite ready to quit altogether , Thomas recently took a turn through Vocation Vacations , shadowing a hotel concierge and a hotel general manager for two days .
" It was really great .
I got to be completely immersed in the environment .
I got to see the good , the bad , and the ugly . "
And best of all , she says : " I really got to see it firsthand before taking the plunge and quitting my job .
" Kurth , something of a dream - job rainmaker , has created a niche industry built on the hopes and aspirations of people like Thomas .
Catering to the unhappily employed , Kurth has discovered an untapped market .
Indeed , according to a survey by the Conference Board , a management and marketplace information nonprofit agency based in New York , less than half of all Americans say they 're satisfied with their jobs .
Taken in 2002 , the survey reveals the highest level of discontent since they first conducted the study in 1995 -- with job satisfaction dropping from 60.9 % then to 47.2 % presently .
To date , Vocations Vacations has placed hundreds of people in the U.S. and Britain in occupations ranging from brewmaster and art - gallery director to music producer and cattle rancher .
" We 're on our way to thousands , " says Kurth .
The company has doubled the number of its available mentors to 500 , with another 40 to 50 new possibilities in the works in such fields as Broadway producer , meteorologist , and zookeeper .
Kurth attributes much of his success to listening to prospective clients and addressing their areas of interest with relevant mentors and programs .
Recently , there has been a growing demand and interest in marine biology , aquarium managers , and voiceovers .
However , Kurth says there 's a limit to the types of career vocations he will pursue .
For instance , he says he recently turned down an offer from a pornography producer who wanted to become a mentor .
Kurth himself is expanding his own dream .
He just signed a deal with Warner Books for a how - to vocational lifestyle book .
On April 27 , the Travel Channel is debuting a new series based on his " vocationers " called This Job 's a Trip , chronicling the vacationing adventures of his clients .
Kurth is also working on what he calls " ancillary products , " such as DVDs , T - shirts , and a possible magazine .
He says his expansion is all based on the " vacationing " lifestyle -- no longer daydreaming but living the dream .
Just ask David Ryan , who has had to hire additional trainers for his fast - growing business .
" I get a lot of broad smiles when I tell people that I went from a million - a- year banker to a dog guy , " he says .
No doubt he 's smiling back , all the way to the bank .
