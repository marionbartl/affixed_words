– Riki Ott , PhD , has written two books on the Exxon Valdez oil spill impacts on people , communities , and wildlife , including the recently released Not One Drop : Betrayal and Courage in the Wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill .
Any views expressed here are her own . –
I remember the words , “ We ’ve had the Big One , ” with chilling clarity , spoken just over 21 years ago when a fellow fisherman arrived at my door in the early morning and announced that the Exxon Valdez had run aground in Alaska ’s Prince William Sound and was gushing oil .
For the small fishing community of Cordova , Alaska , where I lived and worked as a commercial fisherma’am , it was our worst nightmare .
That nightmare is reoccurring now with BP ’s deadly rig blowout off the Gulf Coast – with haunting parallels to the Exxon Valdez .
I was not at all surprised when officials reported zero spillage , then projected modest spillage , and then reported spill amounts five times higher than their earlier estimates .
As the spill continues , I imagine that even the newly reported amounts will continue to vastly underestimate the actual spillage .
Underreporting of spill volumes is common , even though lying about self - reported spill volume is illegal – and a breach of public trust .
Still , penalties are based on spill volume : Exxon likely saved itself several billion dollars by sticking with its low - end estimate of 11 million gallons and scuttling its high - end estimate of 38 million gallons , later validated by independent surveyors .
Sadly , it ’s a foregone conclusion that BP ’s promise to “ do everything we can ” to minimize the spill ’s impact and stop the oil still hemorrhaging from the well nearly one mile under the sea off Louisiana ’s coast will fade as its attention turns to minimizing its liability , including damaged public relations .
BP will likely leverage the billions of dollars it will spend on the cleanup to reduce its fines and lawsuit expenses , despite later recouping a large portion of the cleanup cost from insurers or writing it off as a business expense as Exxon did .
Such tactics saved Exxon billions of dollars in the civil settlement for damages to public lands and wildlife ( in which damages were estimated at up to $ 8 billion ; but for which Exxon paid just $ 900 million ) and in the class action lawsuit filed by those whose livelihoods were curtailed by the spill ( for which the original jury awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages ; but which Exxon fought for 20 years until the Supreme Court lessened its burden to just $ 507 million ) .
That Supreme Court decision strictly limited corporate liability and essentially removed the ability of future oil spill victims to hold corporations accountable to the people and the law .
A friend in New Orleans is concerned about the oil fumes now engulfing the southern part of town .
He says it “ smells pretty strong –stronger than standing in a busy mechanics shop , but not as bad as the bus station in Tijuana . ”
State health officials are warning people who are sensitive to reduced air quality to stay indoors , but anyone who experiences the classic symptoms of crude oil overexposure–nausea , vomiting , headaches , or cold or flu - like symptoms –should seek medical help .
This is serious :
Oil spill cleanups are regulated as hazardous waste cleanups because oil is , in fact , hazardous to health .
Breathing oil fumes is extremely harmful .
After the 2002 Prestige oil spill off Galicia , Spain , and the 2007 Hebei Spirit oil spill in South Korea , medical doctors found fishermen and cleanup workers suffered from respiratory problems , central nervous system problems ( headaches , nausea , dizziness , etc. ) , and even genetic damage ( South Korea ) .
I have attended two international conferences the past two years to share information with these doctors .
During the Exxon Valdez spill , health problems among cleanup workers became so widespread , so fast , that medical doctors , among others , sounded warnings .
Dr. Robert Rigg , former Alaska medical director for Standard Alaska ( BP ) , warned , “ It is a known fact that neurologic changes ( brain damage ) , skin disorders ( including cancer ) , liver and kidney damage , cancer of other organ systems , and medical complications –secondary to exposure to working unprotected in ( or inadequately protected ) –can and will occur to workers exposed to crude oil and other petrochemical by - products .
While short - term complaints , i.e. , skin irritation , nausea , dizziness , pulmonary symptoms , etc. , may be the initial signs of exposure and toxicity , the more serious long - term effects must be prevented . ” [ 1 ]
Unfortunately , Exxon called the short - term symptoms , “ the Valdez Crud , ” and dismissed 6,722 cases of respiratory claims from cleanup workers as “ colds or flu ” using an exemption under OSHA ’s hazardous waste cleanup reporting requirements . [ 2 ]
Sadly , sick Exxon cleanup workers were left to suffer and pay their own medical expenses .
I know of many who have been disabled by their illnesses – or have died .
I have repeatedly warned Congress in letters and in person to strike that loophole because it exempts the very work - related injuries–chemical induced illnesses –that OSHA is supposedly designed to protect workers from .
Remember the “ Katrina Crud ” and the “ 911 Crud ? ” Standby for the “ Gulf Crud ” because our federal laws do not adequately protect worker safety or public health from the very real threat of breathing oil vapors , including low levels typically found in our industrial ports , our highways during rush hour traffic , and our urban cities .
Oil is not only harmful to people , it is deadly to wildlife .
I am sickened to think of the short - term destruction and long - term devastation that will happen along America ’s biologically rich coastal wetlands – a national treasure and a regional source of income .
In Alaska , the killing did not stop in 1989 .
Twenty - one years later , buried oil is still contaminating wildlife and Prince William Sound has not returned to pre-spill conditions – nor , honestly , will it .
The remnant population of once - plentiful herring no longer supports commercial fisheries and barely sustains the ecosystem .
While local efforts to boom Louisiana ’s fragile coasts to keep the oil out will help people feel productive and empowered ( and this is important ) , it is an unfortunate truth that the booms have limited utility and effectiveness .
In even mild sea conditions , oil will wash over and under boom .
Further , underneath the visible oil slick , there is an invisible cloud of toxic oil dissolved into the water column and this dissolved oil is deadly to shrimp and fish eggs and marine life .
Still , the Gulf spill has one advantage over the Alaska spill – hot weather and the relatively warm ocean will speed the work of bacteria to degrade the Louisiana crude .
Even so , the initial toxic hit is likely to harm generations of wildlife , similar to what happened in Prince William Sound .
The oil industry has had over 40 years – since the 1967 Torrey Canyon tanker spill in England – to make good on its promise to cleanup future oil spills .
This latest spill highlights the harsh truth that the industry has failed to live up to its promise .
It is time for Americans to demand of our leaders accountability and closure of fossil fuel industries – as we transition to new energies .

A new study reports some not - so - surprising findings , which anyone who went to school with a considerable Greek system probably knew anyhow : Sorority girls have " bulimic attitudes . "
Not that I 've ever heard bulimia referred to as an " attitude . "
Advertisement
According to the study , " Undergraduate women who join a sorority are more likely to judge their own bodies from an outsider 's perspective ( known as self - objectification ) and display higher levels of bulimic attitudes and behaviors . "
The study hinges on this self - objectification business - which is exactly what it sounds like .
But what the study does n't do , is delve into where the self - objectification comes from .
Rather , it 's all about the nasty , acid - reflux - ridden endgame .
So where might this all start ?
I do n't think it 's completely about having to look at pretty " sisters " all day .
I was in a sorority — I had a good experience .
Some of those girls are now my best friends .
But I spent four years in the Greek system , and this obviously qualifies me to offer some completely subjective , totally unscientific theories .

In any large , popular house , there 's an underlying current of competition .
The catch is , I sensed it not so much amongst the girls within a single house as across the Greek community as a whole .
And that 's where the " self - objectification " business comes into play .
My off - the - top - of - my - head " theory " is this : Big , popular houses want , naturally , to remain big and popular .
So there was competition during rush to convey how fun and cool and attractive the members of a house were in order snag the most desirable rushees / pledges , who would then make the house seem all the more fun and cool and attractive to the next year 's rushees .
And the pretty beat went on .

Meanwhile , there was another competition : competition for attention from the most desirable frat guys ( in hindsight , an epic oxymoron ) .
Because hey , who does n't want to be desired by a dude wearing a white hat and with a gift for flip cup ?
Nevertheless , if a couple of girls from a given sorority are casually dating dudes from the crop of cute brothers at Tau Beta Bong , it 's all the more likely TBB will ask that sorority to be party partners .
Which is , of course , something that makes that sorority seem so fun and cool and desirable to wide - eyed rushees !
So with these elements of competition , surely it 's hard not to look at oneself — or the house 's collective " self " — from an outsider 's point of view .
It was the perspective of everyone but yourself that , at times , really seemed to matter .
But hey , it 's only for four years , right ?

WHAT is the most efficient shape for randomly packing things into a container ?
Physicists at New York University and Virginia
Tech have carried out a series of experiments and , among all the shapes they have tested so far , the tetrahedron ( a pyramid with four triangular sides ) takes some beating .
The researchers poured tetrahedral dice into containers which they shook until completely full .
A magnetic - resonance imaging scanner was then used to see how tightly the dice packed themselves ( pictured above ) .
To quantify the packing efficiency , the researchers poured water into the containers to measure the amount of space between the dice .
They report in the latest issue of Physical Review Letters that the tetrahedra filled roughly 76 % of the available space in a large container , whereas experiments with spheres typically filled only 64 % of the available volume .
The physicists say the data will be useful when calculating , for example , how liquids seep through soils of different densities .
They think the work might also have some use in packaging consumer products .
Watch out for tetrahedral tomatoes .
Special By By Salim Jiwa Oct 28 , 2009 in Crime A seventh foot inside a Nike running shoe has been recovered in Metro Vancouver .
Police are already dealing with six other mystery feet in shoes that have surfaced at various coastal locations around B.C.
The latest find was made on a beach in Richmond .
Coroner Jeff Dolan , chief of operations for the B.C. Coroner 's service told Digital Journal he is unable to solve the mystery and has looked around at other places in the world to see if similar things are happening but has not found another instance of mystery feet .
" The first one that was discovered was associated to a deceased male , " said Dolan .
" The individual identified in the first 2007 case was identified as being from British Columbia , although the rest of his remains were not found . "
Dolan said two female feet found separately in Richmond were identified as belonging to one female through DNA testing .
But authorities still do n't know who she was .
Two male feet found separately on two islands were also identified as coming from one male person but his identity remains a mystery , he said .
So a total of five feet have been matched to individuals but only one has been positively identified as a B.C. man .
" We have looked at various high profile aviation or marine incidents in the hope of matching these to anyone lost at sea and none of those match the DNA profile , " said Dolan .
" The similarities are that it is a foot that is disarticulated from the body and it is an athletic shoe in all cases , " he said .
" I use the term running shoe - but they are all athletic shoes . "
" It certainly is a sequence of events that we have n't see around here before and we 're learning from contacts from around the world that this is the first time anywhere this is happening , " he said .
" The latest is a foot inside a running shoe , " said Dolan . "
It is a size 8.5 Nike . "
Cpl. Annie Linteau said the latest find was made on Tuesday by two people walking on a beach in Richmond .
“ Yesterday evening , two men were walking on the beach and located what appeared to be a foot in a white Nike running shoe , size 8.5 .
Members of the Richmond RCMP , the Forensic Identification Section and the General Investigation Section attended the scene , and seized the shoe and its contents , ” said Cpl. Annie Linteau .
“ There has been no evidence to date to support foul play in relation to these discoveries and it appears that all remains separated from the body , dis-articulated , through a natural process , ” said Linteau .
“ Investigators are continuing with their efforts to identify the remains in all these cases , ” she said .
VANCOUVER .
B.C. – Another mystery foot in a shoe has turned up on a Vancouver area beach , making this the seventh foot to be recovered since the remains began turning up in mid-2007 .

The Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas , Graphs , and Mathematical Tables ( better known as Abramowitz and Stegun ) is a much - storied book .
Not that it ’s a book full of stories ; truth is , there ’s not much of a narrative thread running through those formulas , graphs and mathematical tables .
But it ’s a book with a story behind it .
The story began in the late 1930s , when the Mathematical Tables Project was launched in a factory building on the West Side of Manhattan .
Supported by the Works Progress Administration , the Tables Project had dual aims : first , preparing high - quality tables of trigonometric functions , logarithms , and the like ; and , second , providing work for unemployed New Yorkers .
The 450 human computers hired for the project were chosen more on the basis of need than skill , and the work was done on a kind of numerical assembly line .
According to David Alan Grier :
Each group was taught to perform a single arithmetic operation .
One group knew how to add positive numbers , a second to subtract , and the third to multiply single digits .
The last and most sophisticated group did long division .
I have to admit there ’s a certain nightmare aspect to this scene .
Working in a numbers factory sounds no more appealing than stamping sheet metal all day , although there was less danger of getting a finger crushed in the machinery .
A few years later , the Tables Project was swept up in war work ; then , afterward , many of the key personnel moved to the National Bureau of Standards ( now NIST , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ) .
There they conceived the Handbook .
Apparently the initial plan was a greatest - hits album of tables , but by the early 1950s the future of table - making was looking pretty dim .
And so the project changed course and put more emphasis on the mathematical functions that lay behind the tables — familiar functions such logarithms , more specialized ones such as Bessel functions and some more recondite topics such as Mathieu functions and orthogonal polynomials .
There were still tables listing numeric values of functions , but the Handbook also presented the mathematics you would need to evaluate ( or approximate ) the function for yourself .
The editors in charge of the Handbook were Milton Abramowitz and Irene Stegun , both veterans of the New York table office .
They recruited about 30 young mathematicians to write chapters .
In 1958 Abramowitz died suddenly ; Stegun saw the project through to publication in 1964 .
The Handbook seems an unlikely best - seller , but the U.S. government has distributed more than 150,000 copies , and editions from other publishers are estimated to bring the total copies in print to something near a million .
( As a product of government work , the Handbook is not covered by copyright ; there are scanned versions on the web . )
Announced last week is a new Handbook , officially retitled the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions .
The ink - and - paper version , which I have not yet seen , is published by Cambridge University Press .
Perhaps even more interesting is the web edition , called the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions ( DLMF ) , which I have just begun to explore .
It is recognizably the same book as Abramowitz and Stegun , with the same terse style of presentation .
But much has changed .
The hundreds of pages of tables are finally gone ; this is not the place to look up the sine of 23 degrees .
But there are handsome color graphics now , and a new emphasis on methods of computation , including pointers to recommended software .
And the selection of topics has expanded somewhat .
For example , there are new chapters on the Painlevé equations and on functions whose argument is a matrix .
Elsewhere , the Lambert W function ( a personal favorite of mine ) is a newcomer to the chapter on elementary functions .
Apart from the content , the DLMF is interesting as an experiment in presenting mathematics on the web .
It ’s the most ambitious project I ’ve seen based on MathML , and it seems to work well , at least when viewed in recent versions of Firefox .
( In other browsers I ’ve tried , MathML gets garbled , but the equations can be displayed as images and are still quite readable in that format — even with an ancient version of Internet Explorer . )
Here ’s part of a page as seen in Firefox :
Mousing over the “ i ” icon at the right margin provides access to encodings of the equations in MathML or TeX and as PNG images , as well as definitions , cross-references and such .
Very slick .
The editor in chief of the new Handbook is Frank W. J. Olver of the University of Maryland College Park and NIST , whom I have mentioned before both here at bit-player and in American Scientist .
As a young mathematician , half a century ago , Olver wrote one of the Handbook chapters on Bessel functions .
( As an even younger mathematician , in the 1940s , he worked with Alan Turing at the National Physical Laboratory in Britain . )
There are three more principal editors : Daniel W. Lozier , Ronald F. Boisvert and Charles W. Clark , all of NIST , as well as a long roster of associate editors and domain experts .
It ’s too soon to say whether some combination of these names will eventually replace the moniker “ Abramowitz and Stegun . ”

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Hair and fur stuffed into tights are the latest tool in the Deepwater Horizon clean - up .
The hairy booms wo n't plug leaks on the seabed , but will be floated off beaches to mop up oil washing towards shore .
Why ?
Making one of the oil spill hair booms
How 's your hair - shower - fresh , or a bit greasy around the roots ?
We wash our hair because it collects the oils our bodies produce .
And it's this property of hair - and fur and wool - that means it will be used to help tackling the oil spewing from BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico .
It 's adsorbent rather than absorbent , meaning oil clings to the many tiny scales on each strand of hair .
" Each follicle [ strand ] of hair has an enormous amount of surface area .
It 's not soaking up the oil , it 's not blowing up like a sponge - the oil is coating the outside , " says Lisa Gautier , founder of the ecological charity Matter of Trust , which runs an international Hair for Oil Spills programme to collect off - cuts from hair salons and pet groomers , sheep farmers and individuals .
The donated hair and fur is then stuffed into nylon tights to make sausage - shaped booms to string out along beaches , as officials have said there are not enough manufactured booms to protect the coastline from the looming oil slick .
THE ANSWER
Oil coats surface of each strand of hair or fur
This is because hair is adsorbent , not absorbent like a sponge
Hair used to soak up US oil slick
How big is the gulf oil spill ?
" Hair is an extremely efficient material for taking in all kinds of oils including petroleum - it clings to the hair because it 's spiky , " says Ms Gautier .
The technique has been tested and approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency .
It was used in past disasters , such as 2007's Cosco Busan oil spill in San Francisco Bay and in the Philippines in 2006 , when prisoners shaved their heads and chests to donate hair to the clean - up effort .
And in the first Iraq war in 1991 , when retreating Iraqi soldiers released million tonnes of oil into the Persian Gulf , New Zealand sent booms filled with sheep 's wool that could soak up 40 times their weight in oil to help with the clean - up .
At the time , Malcolm Fox , a chemist and visiting professor at Leeds University , studied the use of low - grade wool in oil spill clean - ups .
" An oil company sent me a drum of the crude oil / water emulsion and we tried soaking it up with mats of the wool .
It was reasonably successful and we recycled the wool mats by putting them through an old washing mangle to recover the oil , which could also be used again . "
Human hair , however , proved more effective - in part because the wool had been processed and so lost its lanolin coating , which naturally repels water and holds grease to keep sheep warm .
" Human hair grease acts as a spreading agent , to help the oil form a film on the surface . "
DIY slick
The idea of using human hair to mop up oil spills dates from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 .
Watching the unfolding disaster on television , Alabama hair stylist Phil McCory noticed how hard it was for volunteers to clean oil from otters ' fur , and thought to himself : " If animal fur can trap and hold spilled oil , why can't human hair ? "
Prisoners in Manila bagged up their hair for a 2006 oil spill
So he staged a home oil spill to test this theory , pouring a gallon of used motor oil into his son 's paddling pool .
He then dunked in a pair of his wife 's pantyhose stuffed with clippings from his salon .
Within two minutes , the DIY boom had sucked up all the oil .
He then parlayed this brainwave into a business making oil spill mats from hair purchased in China .
For the past 10 years , his company has worked with the Matter of Trust charity to establish a hair recycling system to find a use for the all the hair and fur cut off by stylists and pet groomers each day .
The charity 's figures suggest this amounts to 370,000 pounds of hair , and 300,000 pounds of fur , a day in the US alone .
While fur , horse hair and feathers are also used in the booms , the charity says human hair seems to be most effective as it has less natural oil and so more capacity to catch spilled oil .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
To make a hair boom , first cut the legs off a pair of tights , and fit the open end over a wide plastic pipe - this makes it easier to feed the hair and fur into the stocking .
Once it 's full , tie off the end and cover the resulting sausage in a strong mesh .
While the charity welcomes all donations , there are a few caveats - it prefers freshly - washed hair and fur , and hair to be from the head only .
This is because each boom is hand - made , and its volunteers are unlikely to want to handle filthy - or intimate - off - cuts .
But what happens to all the oil - soaked hair ?
Among the options tried by the charity include feeding the whole mess to worms to break down into fertiliser .

JavaScript Semicolon Insertion
Everything you need to know
Friday , May 28 , 2010
Automatic semicolon insertion is one of JavaScript 's most controversial syntactic features .
There are also many misconceptions surrounding it .
Some JavaScript programmers use semicolons at the end of every statement , and some use them only where strictly required .
Most do something in between , and a few even intentionally add extra semicolons as a matter of style .
Even if you use semicolons at the end of every statement , some constructs parse in non-obvious ways .
Regardless of your preferences in semicolon usage , you must know the rules to write JavaScript professionally .
If you remember a few simple rules , all of which are explained here , you will be able to understand how any program you might encounter will be parsed , and will be an expert on JavaScript automatic semicolon insertion , or ASI .
Where Semicolons are Allowed
In the formal language grammar given in the ECMAScript specification , semicolons are shown at the end of each kind of statement in which they can appear .
Here is the do - while statement :
do Statement while ( Expression ) ;
Semicolons also appear in the grammar at the end of var statements , expression statements ( such as " 4+4 ; " or " f ( ) ; " ) , continue , return , and break statements , and throw and debugger statements .
The empty statement is just a semicolon by itself , and is a legal statement in JavaScript .
For this reason , " ; ; ; " is a valid JavaScript program ; it parses as three empty statements , and runs by doing nothing three times .
Sometimes empty statements are actually useful , at least syntactically .
For example , to write an infinite loop , one can write while ( 1 ) ; , where the semicolon is parsed as an empty statement , which makes the while statement syntactically valid .
If the semicolon was omitted , the while statement would not be complete , because a statement following the loop condition is required .
Finally , semicolons appear in for loops of the form for ( Expression ; Expression ; Expression )
Statement , and of course they may appear as themselves inside strings and regular expression literals .
Where Semicolons May be Omitted
In the formal grammar used in the ECMAScript specification , the semicolons are included , as described above .
However , the specification prose then gives rules which describe how the actual parsing differs from the formal grammar .
These are described as though semicolons are inserted into the token stream while parsing , though this is just a specification convenience ; in practice , parsers do not need to generate fake semicolon tokens , but can instead regard semicolons as optional in specific places in the grammar ( for an example see this parser expression grammar for ECMAScript , particularly the Statement , EOS , EOSnoLB , and SnoLB rules ) .
Where the specification says that a semicolon is inserted , this simply means that the statement currently being parsed is ended .
These semicolon insertion rules are specified in section 7.9 of ECMA - 262 [ pdf ] .
The section gives three basic rules , followed by two exceptions .
The rules are :
When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar , then a semicolon is inserted if ( a ) there is a line break at that point , or ( b ) the unexpected token was a closing brace .
When the end of a file is reached , if the program cannot be parsed otherwise , then a semicolon is inserted .
When a " restricted production " is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation " [ no LineTerminator here ] " , then a semicolon is inserted .
Approximately , these rules state that a statement can be terminated without a semicolon either ( a ) before a closing brace , ( b ) at the end of the program , or ( c ) when the next token cannot be parsed otherwise , and furthermore that there are certain places in the grammar in which , if a line break appears , it terminates the statement unconditionally .
The practical effects of these rules are discussed below .
The exceptions are that a semicolon is never inserted as part of the header of a for loop of the form for ( Expression ; Expression ; Expression ) Statement , and a semicolon is never inserted if it would be parsed as an empty statement .
What do these rules and exceptions mean in practice ?
Firstly , a semicolon is optional only where there is a line break , a closing brace , or the end of the program .
Semicolons are not optional between statements appearing on the same line .
Additionally , a semicolon is not implied at the end of a line if the first token of the subsequent line can be parsed as part of the same statement .
42 ; " hello ! " is a valid program , as is 42
" hello ! " ( with the "
" representing an actual linebreak ) , but 42 " hello ! " is not ; the linebreak triggers semicolon insertion but linear whitespace does not .
Also valid is " if ( x ) {y ( ) } " .
Here " y ( ) " is an expression statement , which can be terminated by a semicolon , but since the next token is a closing brace , the semicolon is optional even though there is no linebreak .
The two exceptions , for loops and empty statements , can be demonstrated together :
for ( node=getNode ( ) ; node.parent ; node=node.parent ) ;
This for loop takes the parent of a node repeatedly until a node is reached which has no parent .
All of this is done in the header of the for loop , so we have nothing left for the statement inside the for loop to do .
However , the for loop syntax requires a statement , so we use an empty statement .
Even though all three of the semicolons in this example appear at the end of a line , all three of them are required , since a semicolon is never inserted in a for loop header or to create an empty statement .
Restricted Productions
Restricted productions are those in which a line break cannot appear in a particular position , so if a line break appears there , it will prevent the program from parsing in that way , though it may still parse another way .
There are five restricted productions in the grammar , they are the postfix operators ++ and -- , continue statements , break statements , return statements , and throw statements .
Break and continue statements have an optional identifier which may be used to break or continue a particular labelled loop in which the statement appears .
If this feature is used , the identifier must be used on the same line as the break or continue token .
The following is a valid program :
var c , i , l , quitchars quitchars= [ 'q ' , 'Q' ] charloop : while ( c=getc ( ) ) { for ( i=0 ; i<quitchars.
length ; i++) { if ( c==quitchars [i ] ) break charloop } /* ... more code to handle other characters here ... */ }
If getc ( ) reads a character from an input device and returns it , then the program will read characters , test each one of them to see if it is in quitchars , and if it is , break the input loop .
Note that the labelled break statement is necessary to escape from the outer while loop and not only the inner for loop .
The following program , differing only in whitespace , will also parse , but will not give the same result :
var c , i , l , quitchars quitchars= [ 'q ' , 'Q' ] charloop : while ( c=getc ( ) ) { for ( i=0 ; i<quitchars.
length ; i++) { if ( c==quitchars [i ] ) break charloop } /* ... more code to handle other characters here ... */ }
Specifically , in the latter case , the charloop token is not part of the break statement .
Since the break statement is restricted , the linebreak at that position terminates the break statement .
The charloop token simply parses as a reference to a charloop variable , which will never be reached , and the break statement will terminate the inner loop , not the outer loop as was intended .
Here are examples illustrating the other four restricted productions :
// PostfixExpression : // LeftHandSideExpression [ no LineTerminator here ] ++ // LeftHandSideExpression [ no LineTerminator here ] -- var i=1 ; i ++;
This is a parse error , it does not parse as " i++ " .
A line terminator cannot appear before the postfix increment or decrement operator , so a " ++ " or " - - " token at the start of the line will never parse as part of the preceding line .
i ++ j
This is not a parse error : it parses as " i ; ++j " The pre-increment and - decrement expressions are not restricted , so a linebreak can occur between the " ++ " or " - - " token and the expression which it modifies .
// ReturnStatement : return [ no LineTerminator here ]
Expression opt ; return {i:i , j:j}
This parses as an empty return statement , followed by an expression statement which will never be reached .
The following all parse as intended :
return { i:i , j:j} return ( {i:i , j:j} ) return {i:i , j:j}
Note that return statements can contain linebreaks within the expression , just not between the return token and the start of the expression .
When semicolons are intentionally omitted , it is convenient that the return statement is a restricted production , as it allows the programmer to write an empty return statement without accidentally returning the value of the next line :
function initialize ( a ) { // if already initialized , do nothing if ( a.initialized ) return a.initialized = true /* ... initialize a ... */ }
Continue and throw statements are similar to break and return :
continue innerloop // correct continue innerloop ; // incorrect
// ThrowStatement : throw [ no LineTerminator here ]
Expression ; throw // parse error new MyComplexError( a , b , c , more , args ) ; //
Unlike the return , break , and continue statements , // the expression after " throw " is not optional , // so the above will not parse at all .
throw new MyComplexError( a , b , c , more , args ) ; // correct throw new MyComplexError ( a , b , c , more , args ) ; // also correct //
Any variation with ' new ' and ' throw ' on the same line is correct .
Note that indentation has no effect in parsing ECMAScript programs , but the presence or absence of line breaks does .
Therefore , any tool that processes JavaScript source code may remove leading whitespace from lines ( outside of string literals ! ) without changing the semantics of the program , but line breaks cannot be indiscriminately removed or replaced with spaces or semicolons .
A minification tool that changes the semantics of valid programs is a broken tool , and the only way to write a correct tool is to use a complete and correct parser .
Line breaks following return , break , and continue or preceding ++ and -- tokens can affect parsing .
Since the productions above are the only restricted productions in the language , this implies that whitespace including linebreaks can be freely added anywhere else as desired to improve readability .
In particular the logical , arithmetic , and string concatenation operators , the ternary or conditional operator , member access using the dot or bracket notations , function calls , and while loops , for loops , switch statements , and the rest of the control structures , can all be written with linebreaks freely used throughout .
As the specification says :
The resulting practical advice to ECMAScript programmers is : A postfix ++ or -- operator should appear on the same line as its operand .
An Expression in a return or throw statement should start on the same line as the return or throw token .
A Identifier in a break or continue statement should be on the same line as the break or continue token .
The most commonly cited programmer error related to restricted productions is to put the return value on the line after the return token , especially common when the returned value is a large object or array literal or multiline string .
Line break errors with postfix operators , break , continue , and throw statements are rarely seen in practice , for the simple reason that the erroneous line breaks look unnatural to most programmers and so are unlikely to be written .
The final subtlety of ASI arises from the first rule , which requires that the program contain a token which is not allowed by the formal grammar , before a semicolon will be inserted .
When writing code with optional semicolons omitted , it is important to keep this rule in mind so that required semicolons are not inadvertently omitted as well .
This rule is what makes it possible to extend statements across multiple lines , as in the following examples :
return obj.method( ' abc ' ) . method ( 'xyz ' ) . method ( ' pqr ' ) return " a long string
" + " continued across
" + " several lines " totalArea = rect_a.height * rect_a.width + rect_b.height * rect_b.width + circ.radius * circ.radius * Math .
PI
The rule considers only the first token of the following line .
If that token can parse as part of the statement , then the statement is continued ( even if parsing fails a little further on : the language syntax is designed to only require one token of lookahead in the parser ) .
If the first token cannot extend the statement , then a new statement begins ( which the spec describes by saying a semicolon is inserted ) .
The potential for error arises whenever there is a pair of statements A and B such that both A and B are valid statements standing alone , but the first token of B can also be accepted as an extension of A .
In such cases , if a semicolon is not provided , the parser will not parse B as a separate statement , and will either reject the program or parse it in a way that the programmer did not intend .
Thus when semicolons are omitted , the programmer must beware any such statement pair separated by a linebreak as :
A B
Where B begins with a token that would be accepted by the parser if it had appeared at the end of line A .
The majority of JavaScript statements begin with an identifier , and the majority of the remainder begin with a keyword such as " var " , " function " , or " if " .
For any such statement B beginning with a keyword or identifier , as well as any beginning with a string or number literal , there is no valid complete statement A such that the first token of B would be accepted by the parser as extending A . ( The verification of this from the grammar is left as an exercise for the reader . )
A function f( x ) {return x*x} // for any statement A , without any terminating semicolon , // all of these examples will parse as intended A f( 7 ) A " a string " .
length
Unfortunately , there are five tokens that can appear both at the start of a statement , and as an extension of some complete statement A .
These tokens are the open parenthesis " ( " , open square brace " [ " , slash or solidus " / " , and " + " and " - " .
Of these , the first two are problematic in practice .
This means it is not always the case that a line break can replace a semicolon between statements .
The spec gives the following example :
a = b + c ( d + e ) .print( ) is not transformed by automatic semicolon insertion , because the parenthesised expression that begins the second line can be interpreted as an argument list for a function call : a = b + c(d + e ) .print ( )
The spec goes on to suggest , " In the circumstance that an assignment statement must begin with a left parenthesis , it is a good idea for the programmer to provide an explicit semicolon at the end of the preceding statement rather than to rely on automatic semicolon insertion . "
A more robust alternative where semicolons are intentionally omitted is to include the semicolon at the beginning of the line , directly before the token that introduces the potential ambiguity :
a = b + c ; (d + e ) .print ( )
Statements beginning with open parentheses or square braces are somewhat rare , but do arise in practice .
Examples involving open square braces are more common now that " functional " operations such as map , filter , and forEach are common on arrays .
It is often convenient to use an array literal with a forEach call which is evaluated for its side - effects , as in the following :
[ [' January ' , 'Jan ' ] , [' February ' , 'Feb ' ] , [' March ' , ' Mar ' ] , [' April ' , 'Apr ' ] , [' May ' , ' May ' ] , [' June ' , ' Jun ' ] , [ ' July ' , ' Jul ' ] , [' August ' , 'Aug ' ] , [' September ' , ' Sep ' ] , [' October ' , 'Oct ' ] , [' November ' , ' Nov ' ] , [' December ' , ' Dec ' ] ]. forEach ( function ( a ) { print ( " The abbreviation of " +a [ 0 ] + " is " + a [ 1 ] + " . " ) } ) ['/ script.js ' ,'/style1.css ' ,'/style2.css ' ,'/page1.html ' ].forEach ( function ( uri ) { log( ' Looking up and caching ' +uri ) fetch_and_cache( uri ) } )
In cases where array literals are used for their value in an assignment expression , or are passed to a function , they will not appear as the beginning of the statement , so an opening square brace as the first token is rare , but does occur .
The final troublesome token is the slash , and this one can be highly counterintuitive .
Consider the following example :
var i,s s=" here is a string " i=0 /[a-z]/g.exec(s )
On lines 1 - 3 we set up some variables , and on line 4 , it appears , we construct a regexp literal / [ a - z ] / g which will globally match a-z , and then we evaluate this regexp against the string with the exec method .
Since the return value of the exec ( ) call is not used , this code is not very useful , but we might expect it to compile .
However , the slash can not only appear at the beginning of a regexp literal , but also serves as the division operator .
That means that the leading slash on line 4 will actually be parsed as a continuation of the assignment statement on the previous line .
The entirety of lines three and four parses as the single statement " i equals 0 divided by [ a - z ] divided by g.exec ( s ) " .
This issue almost never arises in practice because there is seldom a practical reason to begin a statement with a regexp literal .
In the example above , the value of the exec ( ) call would usually be passed to a function or assigned to a variable , and in either case the line would no longer begin with a slash .
One possible exception is , again , with the forEach Array method , which could be usefully used on the return value of an exec ( ) call directly .
The operators " + " and " - " can be used as unary operators , to convert a value to the Number type and in the case of " - " to reverse the sign .
If used at the beginning of a statement with semicolons omitted , these can be interpreted as the corresponding binary operator , as a continuation of the previous statement .
Even when semicolons are intentionally omitted , this is rarely a problem , as a leading unary operator is even less likely than a regexp literal to occur as the first token of a statement ( and it does not look self - contained in the way that a parenthesized expression does ) .
As with regexps , if the programmer wanted to coerce a value to a Number , it was probably to do something with that Number value , such as assign it to a variable or pass it to a function , and in either case the unary operator would not be the first token of the statement :
var x , y , z x = +y ; // useful y = -y ; // useful print ( -y ) ; // useful +z ; // useless
In all such cases , when semicolons are omitted , the safest practice with lines beginning with an open parenthesis or square brace is to precede the token with a semicolon on the line itself .
This advice also applies in the unlikely case of statements beginning with an arithmetic operator " + " , " - " , or " / " .
In this way , even when semicolons are not used elsewhere , the line will be protected from misparsing regardless of how the line previous to it may change over time .
Misconceptions
Many new JavaScript programmers are advised to just use semicolons everywhere , and expect that if they do not intentionally use the semicolon insertion rules , they can safely ignore the existence of this entire language feature .
This is not the case , because of the restricted productions described above , notably the return statement .
When becoming aware of the restricted production issue , programmers may then become overly wary of linebreaks , and avoid them even when they would increase clarity .
It is best to be familiar with all the rules for ASI so as to be able to read any code regardless of how it is written , and to write code that is as clear as it can be .
Another misconception is that bugs in browser JavaScript engines mean that using semicolons everywhere is safer , and will protect the developer from compatibility issues between browsers .
This is simply not the case .
All extant browsers implement the specification correctly with regard to ASI , and any bugs that may have existed are long since lost in the mists of early Web history .
There is no reason to be concerned about browser compatibility in regard to semicolon insertion : all browsers implement the same rules and they are the rules given by the spec and explained above .
Conclusion
Should you omit optional semicolons or not ?
The answer is a matter of personal preference , but should be made on the basis of informed choice rather than nebulous fears of unknown syntactical traps or nonexistent browser bugs .
If you remember the rules given here , you are equipped to make your own choices , and to read any JavaScript easily .
If you choose to omit semicolons where possible , my advice is to insert them immediately before the opening parenthesis or square bracket in any statement that begins with one of those tokens , or any which begins with one of the arithmetic operator tokens " / " , " + " , or " - " if you should happen to write such a statement .
Whether you omit semicolons or not , you must remember the restricted productions ( return , break , continue , throw , and the postfix increment and decrement operators ) , and you should feel free to use linebreaks everywhere else to improve the readability of your code .
Emotions ranged from disbelief to despair to downright anger Friday as 15,000 San Francisco city workers received pink slips .
But Mayor Gavin Newsom reiterated that his controversial plan to rehire them under shortened workweeks would wind up saving thousands of jobs .
Newsom ordered the layoff notices be sent to most of the city 's 26,000 workers and said the overwhelming majority of them will be hired back within two weeks to work 37.5 hours a week instead of their current 40 - meaning they 'll see a 6.25 percent cut to their paychecks .
The plan will save $ 50 million in the city 's general operating fund , which has a $ 522 million deficit for the 2010 - 11 fiscal year .
It will save another $ 50 million in departments that do n't receive general fund money like the port and airport .
Bob Muscat , head of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 21 , also is chairing the Public Employee Committee , comprised of many unions working together to come up with a counterproposal .
Muscat said that one idea is to reduce the city 's outsourcing of labor and that the group wants to present its plan to Newsom next week .
He said the unions will file a lawsuit if no compromise is reached .
" If he continues on this plan , then I think we 'll be left with no choice , " Muscat said .
City workers were irate Friday , commiserating as they showed each other their layoff notices .
Some wore pink in protest .
" People are very upset .
Many were in tears , and some were very , very angry , " said Sin Yee Poon , the incoming chief elected officer of Service Employees International Union Local 1021 .
" There is a lack of fairness . "
Many unions , including the SEIU , gave back raises last year to help balance the city 's budget .
Certain workers safe
Many say it 's unfair that some city workers are being laid off while others - including police officers , firefighters , Muni drivers , attorneys and a host of managers and department heads - are not .
At an impromptu news conference Friday morning , Newsom tried to quash those complaints by saying he 'll be asking for a 6 to 6.25 percent pay cut from all unions , even those whose members will continue to work at least 40 - hour weeks for staffing reasons or because their work hours are enshrined in the city charter .
But those unions will have to agree to the pay cuts .
In 2007 , Newsom gave police officers and firefighters a 23 percent pay raise spread over four years , which his critics said was an overly generous package intended to win their support as he ran for re-election .
Both unions are due a 6 percent wage increase next year .
John Hanley , head of the firefighters union , said his group is open to meeting with the mayor to talk about givebacks but would not pledge to forgo their coming raises .
" A labor group would never promise that , " he said with a laugh .
The police and firefighters ' unions both agreed to givebacks last year : 5 percent over two years for police and 5.75 percent over 2 1/2 years for fire .
Still , the mayor 's office will be asking them for more .
Muni operators due 7 % raise
In addition , the Transport Workers Union representing Muni operators is due a 7 percent raise .
That group recently rejected a package of contract concessions .
The heads of TWU and the Police Officers Association did not return calls for comment .
Newsom said he and his chief of staff will continue to take the 15 percent pay cut they took this year .
" Unlike the headlines you guys write , my trust fund does n't exist , " the mayor said .
" I 've been looking around for it . "
He added that everybody in his office earning more than $ 100,000 a year will continue to take 10 percent pay cuts .
He said he 's also asked his department heads to take 10 percent pay cuts .
" We 're all in this together , " he said .
Another concern among workers is how the layoffs will affect their benefits and pensions .
Their health benefits and vacation and sick leave will not change , though their pensions will be impacted because they are based on wages .
The mayor has said he hopes it encourages some workers to retire .
Many workers also are concerned because Newsom has said not everyone will be rehired .
He said Friday his attorneys have advised him not to reveal the number who wo n't be rehired .
" I 've been lawyered up , guys , " he told reporters .
" And you can quote me on that . "

On the morning of May 16 , a Detroit police officer fatally shot 7 - year - old Aiyana Stanley - Jones in the throat during a police raid on her home .
The police were looking for a homicide suspect .
They found him in the apartment above the one where Stanley - Jones was shot , where he surrendered without violence .
In response , Detroit Mayor Dave Bing cautioned last week not to put the blame squarely on police .
Bing is right .
We should also put a good deal of the blame on him .
Or , to be fair , on his predecessor , since Bing only recently took office .
We should also blame the Detroit city council and the city 's police chief .
It is the politicians who set the policies that guide the actions of police officers , and it is they who are responsible for overseeing those officers .
Even allowing for the fact that the police and the Stanley - Jones family disagree about what happened that morning , there were a number of bad policies that may have directly contributed to the little girl 's death .
Among them :
The use of the SWAT team .
According to the Detroit Free Press , the police say they had information that their suspect , 34 - year - old Chauncey Owens , was armed .
He was a suspect in a homicide .
If Owens were on a killing spree , knowingly fleeing police , or holed up in the house with hostages , it may have justified using a SWAT team to apprehend him .
But it does n't appear that Owens presented that sort of imminent threat .
Police had spotted him earlier in the day outside of the house .
It 's difficult to understand why the police did n't confront him then or the next time he left .
Instead , they waited until the middle of the night to conduct a volatile raid on a duplex , putting everyone inside the property in jeopardy .
Geoffrey Feiger , the attorney for the Stanley - Jones family , alleges the police were n't even aware the building was a duplex , and only obtained a warrant for the upper apartment after the raid .
The Stanley - Jones family says the police should have known there were four children in the building .
They say there were toys strewn about the yard , and that a cousin warned the police shortly before the raid after seeing police approach the house .
I 'm not sure it matters if the police knew or not .
If they did n't , they should have .
And if they did , they should n't have used the aggressive tactics .
SWAT teams are at their best when they 're defusing already violent situations , not when they 're creating new ones .
There may also be a history here of Detroit turning to SWAT and its heavy - handed tactics as the first option , rather than the last .
The same SWAT team is currently facing several lawsuits .
One of them deals with a case where the police were looking for evidence against an armed robbery suspect .
They battered their way into a home and fired several rounds at two dogs .
According to the lawsuit , the rounds were fired near an infant .
The suspect was n't there .
In the raid that killed Stanley - Jones , the suspect was in the upstairs apartment .
The police secured the lower apartment first .
If Owens had been heavily armed and predisposed to kill , he'd have had plenty of warning to prepare .
So the use of SWAT and early - morning " dynamic " entry escalated the volatility and risk associated with this arrest .
The facts also do n't add up .
The Detroit police first claimed that Stanley - Jones ' grandmother had an " altercation " with Officer Joseph Weekley , who then accidentally discharged the bullet that struck the girl .
The police then claimed Weekley had incidental contact with the grandmother .
Attorney Geoffrey
Feiger now says video footage of the raid shows the bullet was fired from outside the home , though a state police investigation apparently has turned up no support for that allegation .
I 'm not sure it matters exactly what happened .
Whether Weekley fired out of panic or accidentally discharged his weapon , whether he tripped over Stanley - Jones ' grandmother or Stanley - Jones ' grandmother thought he was a criminal intruder and confronted him , the panic and confusion reveal just how little margin for error exists during these raids .
And the result — Stanley - Jones ' death — shows why they should only be used as a last resort .
The use of " flashbang grenades . "
Though touted as " non-lethal , " flashbang grenades have caused a number of deaths and serious injuries .
The devices set off a wave of intense light and sound designed to stun everyone inside of a building long enough for police to enter and secure the premises .
They 're indiscriminate .
Their intended effect is to cause injury to everyone near them .
That means they 're effectively a form of punishment on people who have yet to be convicted of any crime .
And that includes innocent bystanders as well as suspects .
And they are explosives , which means there is a very real risk of injury and destruction .
Flashbangs have caused second - and third - degree burns , and ignited fires that have consumed houses .
The night of Aiyana Stanley - Jones ' death , police shot a flashbang grenade through the window of her home .
Her family says it landed on the couch where she was sleeping , ignited the blanket laying over her , and set off flames that began to burn the girl just before she was shot .
( The autopsy has n't yet been released . )
According to the Detroit Free Press , another Detroit - area police department is facing a lawsuit from the elderly couple Leonid and Arlene Marmelshtein , who say police battered into their home and detonated two of the devices during a 2004 marijuana raid .
( Police found a small amount of the drug in an adult son 's sock drawer . )
According to the Free Press , a police spokesman in that case called the use of the devices " entirely appropriate . "
In allowing the lawsuit to go forward , U.S. District Judge Julian Cook disagreed , writing , " No reasonable law enforcement officer would have considered a confused elderly couple to be capable of producing the kind of tense and rapidly evolving uncertain situation which would require 10 police officers to make split - second decisions , including the use of two flash - bang devices . "
The presence of TV cameras .
It 's generally a good thing to record SWAT raids on video .
Video footage can clear up any confusion or disagreement about what really happened .
Video also tends to nudge police into employing best practices — we 're all on our best behavior when we know we 're being watched .
But the raid on Stanley - Jones ' home was being documented by cameras from A&E's First 48 , a show themed around the axiom that most homicide cases are solved within 48 hours of the killing or they are n't solved at all .
There are now legitimate questions about whether the presence of the show 's cameras and producers may have pushed the police into conducting a TV - friendly raid without first doing an appropriate investigation of the home they were raiding .
First 48 is one of dozens of bread - and - circus reality cop shows across cable and network TV .
Despite police assertions that SWAT raids are reserved for the most violent of criminal suspects who require precise , direct , and overwhelming force , there seem to be a large and growing number of police departments who have no problem bringing TV crews along for the ride .
Or celebrities .
In one infamous mistaken raid in Denver that claimed the life of immigrant and father - of - eight Ismael Mena , the police had invited Colorado Rockies second basemen Mike Lansing along for the raid .
In a mistaken 2006 child porn raid in Virginia , police brought along NBA star Shaquille O'Neal .
With many of these shows , the police department gets veto power over what footage makes it on the air .
So you wo n't be seeing footage of many mistaken raids .
That said , A&E should air the footage of this raid to show that the violent tactics these shows repeatedly glamorize can and do have tragic consequences .
If the network has any guts at all , it will make sure the same episode looks at the possibility that the presence of its own cameras contributed to the death of a little girl .
Radley Balko is a senior editor for Reason magazine .
He wants urgently to rewrite the rulebook of the euro zone to prevent any such crisis happening again , and at the same time to revive the momentum of international negotiations on tougher regulation of financial markets .
He has returned to the idea of an international financial transaction tax , to make financial institutions share in the costs of the crisis , even if it can be agreed only inside the European Union .
He admits that the greatest problem affecting the markets is one of trust in the ability of the EU , and especially the 16 members of the common currency area at its heart , to bring their debt and deficits under control as they have promised .
“ That is the task we must perform , ” he tells the Financial Times aboard his Luftwaffe Challenger jet bound for Berlin .
“ But that does n’t alter the fact that financial market regulation is also necessary .
“ I ’m convinced the markets are really out of control .
That is why we need really effective regulation , in the sense of creating a properly functioning market mechanism . ”
Mr Schaeuble ’s sense of urgency is compounded by his own state of health .
Just 10 days ago , the 67 - year - old survivor of a mentally disturbed would - be assassin was rushed to hospital with an allergic reaction to a new antibiotic as he arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting of EU finance ministers called to agree on the 750 billion euro rescue package .
In his first newspaper interview since returning to work , he is adamant he is up to what is often seen as the toughest job in the German government .
“ I am quite clear about what I can be responsible for and what I cannot .
It is my decision and my responsibility .
I feel fine . ”
The euro zone crisis was triggered by fears of a debt default in Greece , in spite of a massive joint rescue package by the EU and the International Monetary Fund .
Market speculation switched to the sovereign debt of Portugal and Spain , causing a slump in the value of the euro on foreign exchange markets and sparking angry criticism across Europe of massive market speculation .
Mr Schaeuble ’s return from Brussels on Tuesday came just hours before it was announced that Germany was to ban naked short - selling – selling securities without either owning or borrowing them – in euro zone sovereign bonds and credit default swaps as well as in the shares of 10 leading German financial stocks .
The move was in line with the minister ’s thinking about the danger of disconnection between financial transactions and real economic activity .
“ A market does not function properly if the risks and rewards are completely unbalanced , ” he says .
“ We need transparency .
Given the complexity of modern technology , the individual needs a chance to judge what he is doing .
That ’s why we need standardization of products .
And we need transparency for all market participants .
“ We must regulate over - the - counter transactions , and we must also focus on the ratio of financial transactions to the real exchange of goods and services .
They bear no relationship to each other .
I understand that we need new financial instruments to cope with the huge financial tasks that we face .
But , forgive my saying so , minimum profits of 25 per cent are simply unimaginable in the real economy .
It is n’t healthy . ”
Mr Schaeuble fears momentum has gone out of the international negotiations on financial regulation , and he is determined to recover it .
That view , shared in Washington , was now “ getting very strong in Europe ” .
But the EU needed to speed up its complicated decision - making process .
Although the idea of a global financial transaction tax appears to have been dismissed both by the US and the IMF , Mr Schaeuble says the Group of 20 leading industrial and developing nations “ will have another look [ at it ] in an unbiased way ” .
He admits it is “ very likely ” that there would be no agreement at the G20 summit in Canada in June and “ then the debate will take off again to see if it is possible to do it in Europe .
If we get a Yes , that is good .
If we get a No , then we will once again work intensively to see if we cannot have a transaction tax at a European level . ”
Mr Schaeuble ’s financial regulation agenda was seized on yesterday by Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , in her government declaration at the first reading in the Bundestag of legislation permitting Germany to play its part in the newly agreed euro zone stabilization fund .
Both tighter market regulation and forcing financial institutions to contribute more to the cost of the crisis – through a bank levy that the cabinet has already approved and a possible financial transaction tax – are popular in Germany but providing credit guarantees to weaker economies is not .
By linking the two , the government clearly hopes to defuse a backlash .
The euro zone deal would commit Berlin to providing guarantees of up to 150 billion euros , as its share of the total 440 billion euros to come from all the euro zone member states .
The rest would come from the IMF and the European Commission .
What German citizens fear is that Germany becomes responsible for the entire burden of debt guarantees .
They have coined the term “ transfer union ” to describe an EU that simply moves money from thrifty German taxpayers to extravagant ones in Greece , Spain or Portugal .
Bild Zeitung , the mass - circulation Euroskeptic newspaper , has run a shrill campaign condemning any such action .
Planet of the Apes is one of those films just about every sci- fi fan is in love with .
Personally I loved the entire series , but my favorite of the 5 film franchise was Conquest of the Planet of the Apes .
So when Fox announced they were remaking that and calling it Caesar ( the main character ) I was ecstatic .
Fast forward about 5 years later and this film is finally getting into full swing with a new name and a very new plot .
As proof that things are finally getting in gear on this film Fox has announced that John Lithgow and Freida Pinto have been signed on to be in the upcoming film , now called Rise of the Apes .
Rupert Wyatt is taking the helm on this one and prequel centers around a scientist who is searching for cure to Alzheimer’s .
He begins testing the cure on an ape named Caesar ( good to see they are keeping some things ) .
In the end the scientist tries to take Caesar home to protect him and keep him safe from others .
But we all know how this ends .
Caesar becomes more sentient and leads a revolt against the humans , which results in the Planet of the Apes .
If only the PotA remake had been as cool as their posters …
Lithgow is set to play the scientist ’s father who is suffering from Alzheimer ’s and Pinto is going be playing the lead female role in this film who is a primatologist .
While I ’m not terribly excited about the massive changes they ’re making from the original , I ’m still eager to see how this will work out .
Let ’s face it we need another Apes film to erase the memories of the last remake from our minds .

It ’s clear you are having some PR issues with the changes you ’ve made to Facebook .
Folks like Leo Laporte deleted their accounts .
Jason Calacanis is making page view budgets because of these problems .
Jeff Jarvis is taunting you on Twitter .
People are posting your supposedly private texts from when you were a teenager ( I do n’t even know if those are real , but they are getting reported as if they are ) .
You can ignore these issues .
They will go away , especially next week when Google gets aggressive at its I / O event and releases a ton of stuff that shifts the pundits attention back to Google ’s real market power .
The ones you ca n’t ignore ?
The common feeling that we ca n’t trust Facebook anymore .
See , I do n’t have that problem .
I never + did + trust Facebook , especially after your systems deleted my account a couple of years back .
I knew then that we were buying into a system that was not trustworthy .
Or , at least , not trustworthy in the way we ’ve come to trust software and companies in the past .
That said , I still use Facebook .
Most of the people I ’ve friended over the years are still using it .
And I keep putting more data into it .
400 + million people do .
And more , I bet , are coming every day .
Here ’s what I would do :
1. Split Facebook into two pieces : one private , one public .
We already sort of have that .
My private Facebook account is at http://facebook.com/robertscoble while my public one is at http://facebook.com/scobleizer
2 . Make the private piece much easier to understand and setup .
The New York Times actually exposed something gone very wrong at Facebook : you have too many privacy settings and too many choices .
Boil them down to a few choices .
3 . Put a third party in charge of “ verifying ” that privacy settings actually work .
For instance , I ’m pretty sure you are getting bashed for privacy in some areas wrongly .
But the market simply does n’t believe you on privacy , so get someone who can verify for us that when you set something to be seen only by your mom that it , indeed , is only viewable by your mom .
4 . Do a better job of explaining why you are putting more and more emphasis on the public part of Facebook .
I know that you get a lot of cool new features when you share your life with people , but most people do n’t understand that because most people have never lived in public view before .
So , SHOW THEM and show them better than you have been to date .
For instance , what happens if you click “ like ” on a restaurant on Yelp ?
What does that enable ?
Or , what happens when you listen to music on Pandora and let your friends see that ?
5 . Use video to explain what Facebook is .
Video is harder to read , yes , but it ’s more emotional and it ’s easier for you to explain and show some of these features .
It ’s amazing to me that you have n’t been in the public view since you ’ve made these announcements .
Get onto Techcrunch TV .
Have lunch with Kara Swisher and Om Malik Invite me over your house .
Demonstrate that you are public yourself and willing to stand up for the changes you ’ve made .
VentureBeat is giving you some similar advice .
Or , well , you can just ignore them all .
I do n’t think it will slow down Facebook at all .
Most of the people I ’ve talked with really do n’t care about this issue or have already figured out what they are going to do about it ( I handled it by changing all my privacy settings to as public as possible , others by deleting their accounts , yet others , like my wife , carefully went through the privacy settings and changed them to what they wanted ) .
Anyway , good luck , I ’ll be in Omaha interviewing Matt Mullenweg about the future of WordPress at the Big Omaha conference and maybe I ’ll ask him what his advice for you is .
It found that 85.5 per cent of pupils had their own mobile phone , compared with 72.6 per cent who had their own books .
Among children in Key Stage 2 – aged seven to 11 – 79.1 per cent had a mobile compared with 72.7 per cent who had access to books .

​ The D.C. Council on Tuesday approved amendments to a medical marijuana law first passed in 1998 by 69 percent of District voters .
Congress had blocked implementation of Initiative 59 for more than a decade , until it lifted its ban last year .
With Tuesday ’s vote , the District of Columbia joins the 14 states across the country which already allow qualified patients to use medical marijuana without fear of arrest .
“ Today marks a long overdue victory for D.C. voters and potentially thousands of chronically ill residents who will benefit from legal access to medical marijuana , ” said Karen O’Keefe , director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project
​” It has taken nearly 12 years , but the District will at last have a law that recognizes the mounting scientific consensus that , for many conditions , marijuana can be safe and effective medicine , ” O’Keefe said .
“ A well - working medical marijuana program in the nation ’s capital will also provide members of Congress who have never seen such programs up close with a unique opportunity to do so , ” O’Keefe said .
“ Once they see for themselves that these laws do nothing but provide compassionate care for seriously ill patients , hopefully they will understand the need to create a federal policy that no longer criminalizes patients in any state who could benefit from this legitimate treatment option . ”
Under the District ’s law , physicians will be able to give medical marijuana recommendations to patients suffering from HIV / AIDS , cancer , multiple sclerosis , glaucoma , and other serious conditions that can be alleviated through marijuana .
Qualified patients will have access to their medicine through a limited number of dispensaries within the District .
Unfortunately the District followed the bad example of New Jersey , the most recent state to allow medical use of marijuana , by prohibiting patients from cultivating their own medicine .
Currently , 14 states have effective medical marijuana laws and more than a dozen others are considering them .
In November , South Dakotans will vote for the second time on a medical marijuana ballot initiative , and Arizona is expected to have one on the ballot as well .
Eighty - one percent of Americans support medical marijuana laws , according to a January ABC News / Washington Post poll .
I just spent some time on the phone with Veruca , a pittsburgh performer who was gay bashed in the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh last night .
Â A number of details have been emerging , not all of which are fully accurate , so I wanted to get the story , or as much as I could directly from the person who was bashed .
There is a rally this evening outside of the Pleasure Bar on Liberty Avenue at 9 PM .
Veruca and 2 other friends were in drag , and had been at the Brillo Box , another club in the Lawrenceville / Bloomfield area .
About 1:30 AM , they had driven down Liberty Ave and parked in front of the Allure shop , which is across the street from the Pleasure Bar , and were headed to the Castle .
A woman friend of theirs , Eva happened along and may have been headed to the same place .
Outside the Pleasure Bar , were 3 drunks who immediately began yelling slurs and taunts at Veruca and her friends .
Quickly it escalated from taunts to a physical altercation in the street and in front of the Pleasure Bar .
Veruca was punched and at one point fell ( heels are a bitch to stand on in a fight ) , where , on the ground she was kicked and hit repeatedly .
She does n’t remember a whole lot , and much of what she knows about the attack came from her friend Cherry who was also there .
At one point the manager came out of the Pleasure bar and pulled the three drunks off of Veruca and told them to get lost .
He refused to allow them back in the bar .
Veruca and her friends started to walk away during this , but the drunks followed them and caught up with them a bit farther down the street and began the beating all over again .
If I got this correctly , Eva , Cherry , Veruca - everyone was hit in the attack , not just Veruca .
It has been reported elsewhere , that the Pleasure Bar bouncer did nothing , but Veruca was clear with me that the manager from there was extremely helpful , and the Pleasure Bar has gay employees .
Any outrage over this needs to be directed towards stopping violence , and not against this one business establishment .
Crimes against Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual , and Transgender people happen everywhere .
It could be in the smallest most conservative place , or in the biggest gay mecca , like West Hollywood .
Yet , no matter where , violence like this is unacceptable , and the solution is for the community to rise up and demand an end to these types of happenings .
Veruca believed that Eva had called the police , but ended up on hold and so it was of no help at all .
He also believes that the Pleasure Bar manager called the cops , but that is unconfirmed at the moment .
But Veruca says , that the police frighten her .
A few years ago , she was attacked in a diner , where , when the police arrived , she was treaded as if she had been the criminal , and so she does n’t have much faith in the police .
Each and every person should be able to walk down a sidewalk and be left alone .
No one should be the target of homophobic slurs Â and angry words , let alone physical violence .
And the solution is to be out and proud .
To refuse to back down and be afraid , but willing to demand respect and to be treated as equals to everyone else .
The rally tonight is one step in that process .
Fighting for a Disabled Mother 's Right to See Her Children
After a brain injury a mother 's family fights for her to see her triplets
April 14 , 2010  -- Growing up , Abbie Dorn always dreamed of becoming a mother .
Now , at age 34 , she is the mother of three healthy toddlers .
Her home is filled with pictures of the children -- triplets named Esti , Reuvi and Yossi .
But in the four years since her children were born , Dorn has not been able to talk to them .
She can't hold them or watch them play .
That 's because Dorn endured severe brain damage following their birth .
Now , while her children run and play in their Los Angeles home , Dorn 's family -- more than 2,500 miles away in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , is locked in a legal battle with the children 's father to grant Dorn the right to see her children .
The family 's lawsuit , which could make its way to a courtroom by May , could become a landmark in defining what it means to be a parent , especially when that parent is disabled .
From Happiness to Heartbreak
Dorn 's story began happily in 2002 .
After graduating from college in Ohio and becoming a chiropractor in Atlanta , she married Dan Dorn , a devoutly religious man who shared her beliefs in Orthodox Judaism .
They settled in Los Angeles near his family , and began to plan a family of their own .
But Dorn struggled to conceive .
After turning to fertility treatments , she finally received word in the fall of 2005 that she was expecting triplets .
" She was so excited to be pregnant -- she was beginning to say , ' I do n't know if I 'll ever get to be a mother , ' " Dorn 's mother , Susan Cohen , said .
But happiness turned to heartbreak after Dorn delivered the three children .
What happened in the hospital in the hours after the triplets were born is not clear .
And the case was eventually settled out of court for more than $ 7 million .
What the family does know is that Dorn began bleeding internally .
Her injury was not caught soon enough , and after a series of missteps , Dorn 's brain was deprived of oxygen , leaving her severely brain damaged .
Since the day her three children were born , Dorn has required around - the - clock care .
She can't speak or move on her own , and she remains in bed unless one of her caretakers moves her to a chair .
Dorn spent nearly a year in hospital and rehabilitation care in California near her children .
Dorn 's parents said her husband , Dan , 33 , visited " all the time " in the days following her injury .
" He did manage to bring the children a couple of times … and I did put them in her arms so she could hold them , " Susan Cohen said .
But eventually , Dan Dorn 's visits became less frequent .
Then , on the anniversary of his wife 's injury , Dan called Dorn 's parents .
" He said , ' Well I need to move on , ' " said Paul Cohen .
Dorn 's husband eventually divorced her in 2007 .
In court documents , his attorney said he was " faced with the necessity of beginning to rebuild his life . "
Since the divorce , Abbie Dorn has been moved to her parents ' home in Myrtle Beach , where she undergoes a daily regime of therapies and rehab .
Dorn 's parents said her now ex-husband has refused to bring the children to see her .
They said he refuses to send videos or to allow Dorn to see the children via a webcam .
In court filings , Dan 's attorneys argue that exposing the children to their severely disabled mother would traumatize them .
Medical experts hired by his attorneys to review her records said she would never recover .
But Dorn 's parents believe otherwise .
They say Dan Dorn 's experts are looking at old records , and that after years of rehabilitation , it is clear she has brain function , can understand when people talk to her and can read short passages .
Having devoted the past five years to her rehabilitation , Susan and Paul Cohen believe their daughter communicates through her eyes .
They say when Dorn has one long blink it means " yes . "
When she is in pain , she cries out .
When she is happy , they say , she can smile .
Her eyes follow movements in the room .
Her caretakers say several times a day she will say " yeah " or " no " in response to direct questions .
Legal Battle Over Children of a Disabled Parent
ABC News spent a day with Dorn and watched her undergo therapy .
When asked if seeing her children was important to her , Dorn replied with a long blink .
" A mother needs to see her children , she gave them life , " Paul Cohen said .
" Her blood is in their veins .
These children need to know they have a mommy and she needs to know her children are growing . "
The family 's lawyer agrees , arguing that Dorn has rights that have been ignored .
" Abbie has a right , a constitutional , legal right to have her parents , her own representatives , to request visitation on her behalf , " Lisa Helfend , an attorney for Dorn and her parents , said .
ABC News ' requests for an interview with Dan Dorn were declined .
In a statement , Dan 's attorney , Vicki Green , said , " while the grandparents criticize the father , they denied him any footage or medical update of Abbie 's condition before opening their home to ' Good Morning America . '
This case is sad and tragic .
However , it is also legally complex , and there is no reason to try this case by public opinion . "
Dan Dorn 's medical experts argue that Abbie Dorn is " in a vegetative state with virtually no hope for recovery . "
The Cohens believe Dan Dorn is " fearful for his children " but " lacks knowledge " of the situation .
Dorn 's mother believes her daughter is still " there , " saying Dorn cries , smirks and even smiles .
" I know that Abbie is there ... it 's well beyond a mother 's love , " Susan Cohen said .
After Dorn 's injury , her mother had a painting commissioned for their daughter .
It hangs in her bedroom .
It shows Dorn walking the dunes of South Carolina , with her three laughing children .
It is the picture - perfect life her parents believe Dorn should have had , and that they refuse to give up on providing for her .
It is the image that drives their care for her , and , they say , motivates the lawsuit they have filed to give her the right to visit with her children .
" If all she can say to them is one or two words and show in her eyes how much she loves them , I think that will mean a great deal to those children , " Susan Cohen said .

Pageant organizers on Sunday night crowned a 24 - year - old Lebanese immigrant from Michigan as Miss USA 2010 .
Rima Fakih was born in Lebanon , moved to the United States as a baby and was raised in New York City , where she attended a Catholic school .
She told pageant organizers her family celebrates both Muslim and Christian faiths .
Her family moved to Michigan in 2003 , where she later became Miss Michigan USA .
Pageant officials told The Associated Press that pageant records were not detailed enough to show whether Ms. Fakih was the first Arab - American , Muslim or immigrant to win the Miss USA title .
The pageant started in 1952 as a local swimsuit competition in Long Beach , Calif .
Ms. Fakih is from Dearborn and is a graduate of the University of Michigan , where she earned her bachelors degree in economics with a minor in business administration , the pageant said in a release .
She said she planned to attend law school after completing her term as Miss USA .
Fans in her state celebrated after learning that she had been crowned at the event held in Las Vegas .
“ This is unbelievable , ” Rami Haddad , 26 , of Livonia told The Detroit Free Press on Sunday night .
Mr. Haddad said he was one of Ms. Fakih ’s biggest supporters .
“ It ’s a dream come true .
I ca n’t express my feelings . ”
During the pageant , Ms. Fakih nearly fell in her evening gown because of the length of its train , but she recovered .
During the interview portion she was asked whether she thought birth control should be paid for by health insurance .
She said she believed it should because it is expensive .
“ I believe that birth control is just like every other medication even though it ’s a controlled substance , ” Ms. Fakih said .
Miss Oklahoma USA , Morgan Elizabeth Woolard , was first runner - up .
She was asked about Arizona ’s new immigration law , and said she supported the law , which would make the failure to carry immigration documents a crime and give the police broad power to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally .
She also said she was against illegal immigration but against racial profiling .
Donald Trump owns the pageant with NBC , which aired the event live .
Update : A Facebook campaign in support of Arizona ’s immigration law — “ Stand With Arizona ( and Against Illegal Immigration ) ” — posted this video of the pageant ’s runner - up being asked about the subject , introduced by this comment :
Five years ago , the Sikorsky UH - 60 Black Hawk helicopter got a digital cockpit and fly - by - wire controls .
Starting in 2011 , the US Army would like it to perform missions without pilot at the helm .
In a 140 - page " Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap " released earlier this month , the Armed Forces reveal that the UH - 60 , AH - 64 , CH - 47 and OH - 58D whirlybirds will all be part of a new aircraft category called Optionally Piloted Vehicles ( OPV ) -- meaning in future , the flick of a switch will turn them into giant UAVs .
If an unmanned Apache gunship makes your boots quake , you 're not alone , but you wo n't truly have reason to fear until 2025 .
That 's when the government estimates half of all Army aircraft will be OPV , and those bots will learn the more deadly behaviors , like swarming .
Sikorsky says the unmanned UH - 60 M will fly later this year ; read the full roadmap PDF at our more coverage link .

Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) has been ordered to pay out almost £ 19,000 after a cockroach was found eating a chip in one of the busiest branches in Britain .
The culprit up close .
Photograph : Westminster council / PA
The cockroach was seen on a food dispensing counter near takeaway boxes and tongs used to serve chicken by an environmental health officer in a restaurant in the West End of London .
City of Westminster magistrates court heard that during an inspection at the Leicester Square branch the officer also saw a mouse , flies and dried blood on the floor .
There was no handwash in dispensers in the food preparation area .
" There was no soap in the ground - floor food preparation room so , on the day of the inspection at least , it was not possible for food preparation staff to wash their hands properly , " said Michael Goodwin , prosecuting .
KFC admitted breaching five hygiene rules after the inspection in August 2008 .
Goodwin said that four months before the inspection the branch had received a " specific warning " from the council about its hygiene .
David Whiting , for KFC , said the company took the inspection " very seriously " .
" KFC accepts the condition that has been described to you , " he said .
" They fell below their own high standards and below legal standards . "
Whiting said that after the inspection , KFC 's pest control contractor at the time had its agreement with KFC terminated across the UK .
The Coventry Street outlet employs 65 people and operates from 10 am to 3 am .
It has since been refurbished .
District judge Howard Riddle fined KFC £ 11,000 and ordered it to pay £ 7,927.80 in costs and a victim surcharge of £ 15 .

Mark Webber had to turn his engine down on the lap that Sebastian Vettel tried to pull a move on him for the lead , Red Bull Racing has confirmed , but the team insists that was still no excuse for its drivers colliding .
Mystery surrounded the exact circumstances of what happened on lap 40 , when Vettel closed in on Webber and drafted past him on the back straight before they crashed into each other .
Suspicions that all was not straightforward surfaced immediately after the race when Webber told journalists in the post - race press conference that they should ' dig more ' to find out what had really happened .
Although the team initially believed that both its drivers were running exactly the same engine settings during their battle for the lead , the post - race debrief on Sunday night revealed that Webber had needed to save fuel and turn his engine down on lap 40 - while Vettel was still able to run at full power .
Even though such an order may not have come directly from the pits via the radio , a readout on Webber 's dashboard would probably have told him that he needed to begin conserving fuel .
Vettel had been able to save fuel when running behind other cars early on , and he had enough extra petrol on board to be able to run one more lap at full power before he too would have had to turn his engine down .
That meant his only realistic chance of getting past Webber was on lap 40 , when he would have enjoyed a brief car advantage over his team - mate .
Speaking in the Istanbul paddock on Sunday night , team principal Christian Horner said that he was finally aware of what had happened in the race .
" We now have all the facts , " he said .
" Mark had changed down into a fuel saving mode that cost him a little bit of performance on the straights , which also explains how Sebastian got a very clear run on him .
" The large mistake remains that not enough room was given , and the explanation is there on how Sebastian had managed to get into the tow .
He had managed to save an extra kilogramme of fuel - as both cars start the race with the same amount of fuel .
" Effectively he had one more lap of the optimum engine mode , but we could n't back him off because he was under pressure from Lewis Hamilton behind . "
He added : " The frustrating thing is we have given away 28 points today and it should have been a 1 - 2 .
Both drivers have also lost points .
From a team point of view it does n't matter which way around they are , but the priority is to finish 1 - 2 and that is exactly what we should have done today . "
Horner did not feel either driver was any more responsible than the other for the crash - but said that he was disappointed they had not given each other enough room .
" I think Mark put Sebastian on the dirty side , gave him just enough room and Sebastian came across obviously quite aggressively - but he was quite a long way down the side .
" So , it was very , very frustrating .
We saw the McLarens racing each other and giving themselves a bit more room , we 've seen drivers racing each other previously in Malaysia - which springs to mind as a recent race and they are usually very , very good at giving each other room .
Today , for whatever reason , that did n't happen . "
Horner was confident , however , that there would be no lingering hard - feeling between the drivers over the crash - and that Red Bull Racing would be able to shift its focus on to winning the next race on the calendar in Canada .
" Absolutely .
This will be dealt with before we go to Canada .
I 've spoken to both drivers .
They are both grown ups , they are both big boys , they are both competitors , and the most important thing is that we have given away a load of points today .
It must not happen again .
They must learn from it .
" It is right to let the drivers race .
We saw McLaren today letting their drivers race , but when drivers are in the same team it is important that they give each other a bit more respect and concede if one has got a run on the other . "
Horner also denied suggestions that the Turkish Grand Prix provided any evidence that Red Bull Racing favoured Vettel over Webber .
" Both our drivers are treated absolutely equally , " he said .
" They both have the same equipment , they both have the same opportunity .
That is a policy we operate and that is the way that the team is - he managed to save a bit more fuel because he was in a slipstream for some of the race and he took advantage of that - as is his right to do .
" He [ Vettel ] was under a lot of pressure from Hamilton behind , which got him into a position to pass Mark .
Our priority at that stage is that we want to win the race .
Even if the cars wanted to change position we were still first and second , and it is still 43 points for the team and both drivers were pulling away from McLaren in the championship . "
No , that is n’t a typo it ’s called the “ Bik.e ” although we ’re unsure how you would pronounce that out loud .
It ’s made by Volkswagen ( XETRA : VOW.DE ) and it folds up in a remarkably clever and efficient manner ( read : German manner ) into something that fits into the spare tire well of your car .
The Bik.e features a nifty in - frame lithium - ion battery pack that powers a hub motor on the rear wheel .
The range is 12.5 miles and the top speed is , wait for it , 12.5 miles .
The lack of pedals would be an issue for me , anything over 12.5 miles and you ’d be left slapping your feet on the ground for forward momentum like Fred Flintstone , although this could be quite fun it would get unfun as soon as you need to go uphill .
The Bik.e is designed to charge whilst in your car so you do n’t have to worry about pulling it out every night and looking for a free socket .
I ’m assuming it is aimed at people who work or study on large campuses and need a way to zip around during the day without breaking a sweat .
No official word on a production run from Volkswagen ( there is a hint of it in the video ) although we think they should at least make a few , I ’m sure Jonathan Ive would pick one up for a start .

Kickboxing for self - defense concentrates on its version of punches , knees , and kicks : fast - paced , distracting , and aimed at all available openings .
If the attacker has a knife or gun , and is within arm ’s reach , he will use the weapon .
The defender is thus armed with more weapons , hands , feet , knees , elbows , head .
Simply walk toward the attacker ( who has any weapon but a gun ) , and throw a front kick straight up against his chin as hard as possible .
Kickboxing thrives on this sort of move , and teaches the practitioner to execute it with such extreme speed , faster than the attacker can react , that it virtually rules out the risk of “ fancy kicks . ”
Do it correctly and it will almost always break his jaw , crush his larynx , shatter his teeth , force him to bite off his tongue , etc .
He will not fight after this .
This sort of kick is well trained to the point that it can , in fact , be delivered efficiently , that is , quickly and powerfully , without being telegraphed .
Alternatively , step to the side , grab the attackers weapon arm , and sling your forehead into the his nose .
This will not hurt you nearly as much as you think .
The attacker ’s nose , on the other hand , will shatter like a firecracker .
Well trained kickboxers practice something called “ combat qi ” , which is the physical conditioning of any part of the body through repeated damage , until it no longer sends sufficient pain signals to the brain to bother the person .
Kickboxers will roll a baseball bat handle up and down the shin firmly enough to cause aching , for about an hour a day for 2 years .
The tibia is repeatedly damaged and rebuilds itself stronger and thicker .
Eventually , the kickboxer can kick the baseball bat in half with his or her shin , and not feel pain .

9 Karate
Here , special emphasis is placed on attack deflection .
Most punches or knife lunges are performed straight toward you , not in an arc .
Few fighters are stupid enough to try a looping haymaker .
Thus , step to the side , creating a lateral line toward the attacker ’s arm , strike the attacker ’s punch or knife hand , then quickly strike his lower side , belly , or back with your other fist .
This is very difficult to defend against , and most likely he will not be able to .
Push forward and throw a knee into his quadriceps .
This hurts like crazy .
Strikes to the face and head are important , but the attacker will expect them , so instead , block his right - handed attack with your left fist ( or vice versa ) , and punch with your other hand straight into the soft spot below his sternum as hard as possible , twisting the hips .
This target is the solar plexus , and will incapacitate him as effectively as a strike to the groin .
Or , if he charges forward , snap a front kick straight up with the ball of the foot planted as hard as possible into his stomach or solar plexus , not the groin .
If one of the former targets is struck , the attacker will be forced back in agony , by means of his center of gravity .
He is leaning forward while charging , and a kick to his groin will cause him to lunge into you .
8 Aikido
An interesting art that is immediately recognizable .
It does have a few striking moves in it , but for the most part , it is based on the principle that when an attacker strikes , he leaves some part of his defense vulnerable .
If you , the defender , do not attack him , you remain defensively invulnerable .
Do not resist his attack .
Use its momentum against him .
Steven Seagal is the most famous Aikido practitioner in the Western world .
He may be a horrible actor , but he is a genuine 7th degree black belt in Aikido , and his signature move is absolutely essential to any self - defense arsenal : the kote gaeshi , or “ forearm return . ”
The attacker steps forward and throws a straight punch .
You sidestep , snatch hold of his wrist , and twist around in time with his punch .
Do it right , and it will fling him completely off balance , using his own momentum , while you whirl around , and twist his wrist toward the outside .
He probably will not flip over like the classic theatrics in a Seagal film , but his wrist may well break .
He ’s unlikely to fight anymore after that .
Most critics of this art point out that it is nearly impossible for the average black belt to catch a person ’s punch and turn fast enough to perform this move , but that ’s not true .
It ’s actually a very easy move to learn and perfect .
Aikido thrives on joint locks , which do not require much speed to perform , compared to the kote gaeshi , and are extremely effective in immobilizing and incapacitating an attacker .
7 Wing Chun
Wing Chun Kung
Fu is the art that Yip Man taught to Bruce Lee , and which Lee rebelled against as too slow and formal for self - defense .
That ’s quite misleading .
He meant that it was insufficient for him when fighting against professional martial art experts , like Wong Jack Man , with whom he fought a famous duel .
Lee invented his own version of Wing Chun , which became entry # 5 , because of the inadequacies he noticed in Wing Chun .
With this method , he defeated Wong in 3 minutes , when almost any other fighter in the world would have needed a lot more time , and would have suffered much more injury .
He won by delivering Wing Chun ’s signature punches : they do not use the hips , but are instead , very fast , rapid - fire left , right punches to the attacker ’s chest , not the belly , not the throat , but the sternum or solar plexus .
You block the opponent ’s attack with one hand and respond with the other fist straight into his chest , following with the other fist , again and again , walking into the attacker as you punch .
The forward motion of your whole body adds power , which , coupled with the arm strength of the average 100 pound woman , results in about 300 pounds of force rammed repeatedly into the attacker ’s chest .
The only thing left is to practice your speed in doing this .
15 punches before the attacker can react are not unheard of .
These punches also have the advantage of keeping the elbows close to the sides , preventing the attacker from grabbing the punching arm .
Then there ’s the centerline defense versus looping attacks , like a haymaker or roundhouse kick .
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line , so instead of picking up extra power by swinging around and twisting the hips , you block the attacker ’s strike and simultaneously throw a front kick straight forward into his belly .
This will take almost anyone off his feet the first time , if you kick as hard as possible .
The closer range of this method favors a shorter person , like a woman defending herself against a would - be rapist , etc .
The closer the two people are , the easier it is for the shorter person to invade the reach of the larger person , effectively penetrating his defense .

6 Jiu-Jitsu
This is the most universal style on this list .
It is a true hybrid , incorporating elements of grappling , hard striking , eye gouging , choke holds , biting , joint locks , as well as the awareness of the defender ’s center of gravity versus the attacker ’s center of gravity .
You throw your attacker by lowering your center of gravity under his , and jerking him over you , or around you .
It ’s simple and effective .
If he attacks with a weapon , you trap this arm , then deliver a knife - hand strike to his collarbone , while shoving him backward and down , locking the weapon wrist and breaking it .
If he throws either a front or roundhouse kick of any kind , he must stand on the other leg .
You sidestep his kick , trap the leg , and deliver your own kick into his standing knee , breaking it backward , then whipping him around by his raised leg .
He will go down and will be unlikely to be capable of much retaliation .
If he charges forward and grabs your shirt , you do not move backward .
You move forward and bend down , ram your hip into his midsection , grab one of his shoulders with one hand , and with the other grab him around his back , and whip him over your own shoulder , shoving upward with both legs .
A 100 pound woman can do this very easily to a 250 pound man .
You can then trap one of his arms and lock one of its joints while he is down .
5 Jeet Kune Do
Bruce Lee envisioned “ a style without style , ” which seems nonsensical .
But try to understand the concept of adaptation .
Lee emphasized this above all : “ the worst thing you can do is to anticipate the outcome of a fight .
You ought not to be thinking of anything but his attack and your response .
Clear all other thoughts from your head , or they will slow you down . ”
Thus , you use one stance , the western fencing “ en garde ” stance .
Remain bouncing on the toes in order to switch from left forward to right forward foot , to retreat or to advance , to be able to kick with either leg .
Footwork is all - important in a real fight , as it determines how far you are from the attacker .
Elements of Wing Chun include close - quarters trapping of hands and feet ; no kicks higher than the waist , since kicking higher than this leaves the groin and standing leg vulnerable ; and simultaneous attack / defense ( see # 1 ) .
Elements of Jiu- jitsu include body throws and strike deflection .
Emphasis is placed on the speed of strike combinations , and well trained practitioners can strike the attacker ’s throat up to 10 times in one second .
4 Western Boxing
You ’ve heard stories of would - be muggers picking the wrong old man to mug .
The fight typically ends with one swing .
That ’s all a boxer needs .
In fact , boxers have been imprisoned ( wrongfully , in my opinion ) for defending themselves from muggers , murderers , bank robbers , etc. , on the grounds that their hands are lethal weapons .
Boxers throw punches faster , harder and more accurately than any other trained fighter on the planet .
This is because boxers train on average for 4 years to do just that : punch properly .
They are not allowed to kick , so their hands are all they have .
Consider that Rocky Marciano knocked out Rex Layne with an off - balance , out - of - reach right hand , covered with a 16 - ounce leather glove .
This punch knocked Layne ’s mouthpiece 10 feet across the ring , out of clenched jaws , and sheared off four of his teeth at the gumline .
Boxers also toughen their bodies religiously , every day , to strengthen their muscles for endurance and durability .
They do n’t look as hulkingly large as bodybuilders , but their muscles are as powerful and hard as a farmer’s .
They punch , block , bob and weave going forward , and punch , block , bob and weave going backward .
They are drilled relentlessly with the maxim , “ Always protect yourself ” .
The hands stay on both sides of the head , the posture crouched so that the whole body is ready for explosive power , and that the front of the torso is protected by the forearms .
Your target is the side of the chin , which will wrench the attacker ’s head sideways and shut off his brain by pinching the spinal cord in the neck .
His strength and rage do not matter .
He will black out instantaneously .
3 Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
This hybrid mixes Jiu- jitsu ’s standing throws and strikes with ground fighting , which emphasizes joint manipulation and overall control of the opponent , effectively ending a fight very quickly .
The larger the attacker , the more easily he can be grappled off his feet , using his center of gravity against him , and forcing him to submit ( or pass out ) .
Once on the ground , the first thing Brazilian jiu - jitsu teaches is to seize a limb and break it at a joint : kneebars for snapping knees or ankles , armbars for snapping elbows and wrists , chokeholds and the use of the powerful legs to immobilize the attacker ’s torso while the defender ends the fight with fists or elbows to the face .
2 Keysi Fighting Method
You ’ll see it in Chris Nolan ’s Batman films .
It was developed by Justo Dieguez and Andy Norman , based on Dieguez ’s street fighting experiences in Spain .
Batman ’s method of fighting is understood from the comic books to require the utmost efficiency , because Batman is a genius at fighting crime , and will not waste time or effort in putting criminals away .
Ten or twenty bad guys at a time routinely attack him , and Dieguez and Norman have developed the style to defend against this many people .
It sounds impossible , but after 6 or 7 years of training in it , which is not too terribly long , anyone can perform all the necessary moves .
You become a self - defense machine .
Nolan looked around for a style of fighting never depicted on screen , something fast - paced , close - quarters , but quick , dirty and brutal .
Classical Tae Kwon
Do is beautiful to watch , but terribly inefficient in terms of the street fight , in which there are no rules .
The Keysi Method has almost no kicks of any kind .
It thrives on extreme close - quarters combat using every weapon the body can quickly wield in such a small space : fists , head , knees , and especially the elbows .
There is only one stance to know , and when you see it one time , you can do it : “ the thinking man , ” with the hands clasped on the head , and the elbows raised to protect the head , neck and upper chest .
It looks like a man holding his head while deep in thought .
It is designed to strike with the sharp elbows , and lots of hammer fists , which are MUCH more powerful and devastating than straight punches , because they employ the entire upper body in bringing the firm , outside muscle , from the root of the little finger to the wrist , down like a hammer against the target .
This is a hybrid style , using elements of grappling from Jiu-jitsu and Aikido , ground fighting from Brazilian Jiu-jitsu , close strikes and centerline defense from Wing Chun , and trapping from Jeet Kune Do .
The Keysi Method teaches its practitioners to defend themselves against any number of attackers , 5 , 10 , 20 and even more , with a 360 degree range of aggression , and to observe all objects in the vicinity for their potential as weapons .
1 Krav Maga
It is Israel ’s national martial art , developed largely by Imi Lichtenfeld , and dedicated to no-holds - barred incapacitation for the purpose of street survival .
No quarter is expected or given .
It incorporates Western boxing punches , Karate kicks and knees , Greco - Roman wrestling , Brazilian Jiu- jitsu ground fighting , Jiu-jitsu throws and grappling , and most importantly , “ bursting , ” adapted from Wing Chun .
This is a simultaneous defense / attack : instead of blocking an attack and then delivering a response , you block the attack and deliver a response at the same time , i. e. , block with the left arm and push forward with the legs , striking with the right fist to the throat , all simultaneously .
Also stressed are attacks to vulnerable body parts : the eyes , throat , and groin .
Attackers can expect testicular ruptures .
Emphasis is also placed on disarming attackers with both knives and handguns , and turning these weapons on the attacker .
It also exclusively trains hand - eye coordination , until defense becomes second nature and does not require thought .
And a good Krav Maga instructor can teach all of this to anyone , regardless of athletic prowess , in only 3 to 6 months .
bonus Firearms
It ’s something of a joke , and out of regard for the popular definition of “ martial arts , ” firearms were left off the list .
They are , however , by far the most efficient method of self - defense .
Bruce Lee carried a .357 magnum everywhere once he became famous as the guy no one could beat in a fight , because there are always stupid jerks who want to prove that wrong .
He had no intention of risking injury .
Chuck Norris is well known as a pro-gun advocate , and in response to a reporter ’s ironic question , “ If someone broke into your house , would you use your roundhouse kick ? ” he replied , “ No , I ’d use my 10 gauge . ”
The ranking of most of the entries on this list does not account for the length of time it takes to master the given art .
Krav Maga is # 1 largely because it can be learned proficiently in only 3 to 6 months .
But then , you can learn how to shoot the chest and head of a man - size silhouette target from 50 yards ( 46 m ) in one afternoon .
And most street violence occurs within arm ’s reach .
No caliber smaller than the .380 ( or .38 revolver ) is recommended .
Greenpeace Protesters Who Oppose Off - Shore Drilling Could Face Terrorism Charges
Seven members of Greenpeace have been arrested for painting anti-drilling slogans , in crude oil , on a drilling support ship in the Gulf .
Greenpeace says the ship is scheduled to sail to the Arctic this summer , so they rappelled down the side and painted “ Ban Arctic Drillingâ€  in oil on the side of the Shell - owned ship .
According to the New York Times , the New Orleans Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI “ is looking into the matterâ€ of whether the non-violent activists will face terrorism - related charges .
If you ’ve been to GreenIsTheNewRed before , you know “ terrorism ” laws have been recklessly used against non-violent activists for years .
The scare - mongering around this disaster has been particularly bold , though .
Just a few weeks ago , Rush Limbaugh was trying to blame the oil spill on “ eco-terrorists . ”
Now , in the wake of the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history , we are to believe it is the activists , not the oil corporations , who are the criminals ?
Phil Radford of Greenpeace put it well :
â€ œIt is outrageous that prosecutors would confront peaceful protesters with such a heavy hand while not a single BP executive has been charged for the devastation they have wrought on the Gulf of Mexico and the people and animals that depend on it…â€ 

The Serbian government today confirmed the discovery of a mass grave containing 250 bodies , believed to be ethnic Albanian victims of atrocities in Kosovo during Slobodan Milosevic 's reign .
Serbia 's war crimes prosecutor , Vladimir Vukcevic , said the grave had been discovered in the village of Rudnica , a few miles from Kosovo 's northern border .
His deputy , Bruno Vekaric , added that the bodies were buried beneath a building and car park .
Dejan Anastasijevic , an investigative journalist on the Serbian weekly Vreme , said the site belonged to a state - owned road construction company and had been built on in 1999 , soon after the Kosovo war .
" It should have aroused suspicions right away , " he said .
" Rudnica is a very remote place .
Who would want to build a company building there ? "
The Serbian authorities said that exhumations at the site would begin soon , in co-operation with Eulex , the EU mission aiming to bolster justice and law enforcement in Kosovo .
" According to witness testimonies , there are 250 bodies of Kosovo Albanians inside , " Vukcevic said .
The Rudnica site is the sixth mass grave in Serbia containing victims of Milosevic 's suppression of an ethnic Albanian separatist uprising in 1998 and 1999 , at the cost of an estimated 10,000 lives .
It led to Nato intervention , and ultimately to Kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 .
That has been recognised by the west , but not by Serbia or Russia .
Serb forces conducted mass killings in ethnic Albanian villages in 1998 and 1999 , burying most of the victims close to the site of the killing .
But when it became clear that Nato would intervene , the Milosevic government ordered the bodies to be dug up and moved elsewhere in Serbia and Serb - controlled Bosnia .
The removal of the bodies led some western commentators to doubt the accounts of mass killing from ethnic Albanian refugees .
Anastasijevic said that the " sanitation " programme , involving the removal of thousands of bodies , was carried out by Serbia 's special counter - terrorist unit , SAJ .
Nearly a thousand bodies were found near an SAJ base in Batajnica , outside Belgrade .
Rudnica represents the second biggest grave from that period , after Batajnica .
The UN and Eulex had searched Rudnica for graves over a number of years but had failed to find them .
The Kosovo media had claimed that the international investigators had been sent to the wrong location and had said several months ago that the bodies were hidden under the Rudnica car park .
Serbian and Albanian sources said that the bodies had been found as a result of a tip - off to Eulex officials .
" We have been working on this particular case for some time .
We have provided information and intelligence relating to the possible site of a mass grave in the Raška region .
But we are still waiting for confirmation if this site has indeed been located , " a Eulex statement said today .
AVANT - GARDE AND KITSCH
Clement Greenberg
This is Greenberg 's breakthrough essay from 1939 , written for the Partisan Review when he was twenty - nine years of age and at the time more involved with literature than with painting .
He came , later , to reject much of the essay -- notably the definition of kitsch which he later believed to be ill thought out ( as , indeed , it is . )
Later he came to identify the threat to high art as coming from middlebrow taste , which in any event aligns much more closely with the academic than kitsch ever did or could .
The essay has an air and assurance of ' 30s Marxism , with peculiar assumptions such as that only under socialism could the taste of the masses be raised .
But for all that , the essay stakes out new territory .
Although the avant - garde was an accepted fact in the '30s .
Greenberg was the first to define its social and historical context and cultural import .
The essay also carried within it the seeds of his notion of modernism .
Despite its faults and sometimes heady prose , it stands as one of the important theoretical documents of 20th century culture .

I
O NE AND THE SAME civilization produces simultaneously two such different things s a poem by T. S. Eliot and a Tin Pan Alley song , or a painting by Braque and a Saturday Evening Post cover .
All four are on the order of culture , and ostensibly , parts of the same culture and products of the same society .
Here , however , their connection seems to end .
A poem by Eliot and a poem by Eddie Guest -- what perspective of culture is large enough to enable us to situate them in an enlightening relation to each other ?
Does the fact that a disparity such as this within the frame of a single cultural tradition , which is and has been taken for granted -- does this fact indicate that the disparity is a part of the natural order of things ?
Or is it something entirely new , and particular to our age ?
The answer involves more than an investigation in aesthetics .
It appears to me that it is necessary to examine more closely and with more originality than hitherto the relationship between aesthetic experience as met by the specific -- not the generalized -- individual , and the social and historical contexts in which that experience takes place .
What is brought to light will answer , in addition to the question posed above , other and perhaps more important questions .
A society , as it becomes less and less able , in the course of its development , to justify the inevitability of its particular forms , breaks up the accepted notions upon which artists and writers must depend in large part for communication with their audiences .
It becomes difficult to assume anything .
All the verities involved by religion , authority , tradition , style , are thrown into question , and the writer or artist is no longer able to estimate the response of his audience to the symbols and references with which he works .
In the past such a state of affairs has usually resolved itself into a motionless Alexandrianism , an academicism in which the really important issues are left untouched because they involve controversy , and in which creative activity dwindles to virtuosity in the small details of form , all larger questions being decided by the precedent of the old masters .
The same themes are mechanically varied in a hundred different works , and yet nothing new is produced : Statius , mandarin verse , Roman sculpture , Beaux - Arts painting , neo-republican architecture .
It is among the hopeful signs in the midst of the decay of our present society that we -- some of us -- have been unwilling to accept this last phase for our own culture .
In seeking to go beyond Alexandrianism , a part of Western bourgeois society has produced something unheard of heretofore : -- avant - garde culture .
A superior consciousness of history -- more precisely , the appearance of a new kind of criticism of society , an historical criticism -- made this possible .
This criticism has not confronted our present society with timeless utopias , but has soberly examined in the terms of history and of cause and effect the antecedents , justifications and functions of the forms that lie at the heart of every society .
Thus our present bourgeois social order was shown to be , not an eternal , " natural " condition of life , but simply the latest term in a succession of social orders .
New perspectives of this kind , becoming a part of the advanced intellectual conscience of the fifth and sixth decades of the nineteenth century , soon were absorbed by artists and poets , even if unconsciously for the most part .
It was no accident , therefore , that the birth of the avant - garde coincided chronologically -- and geographically , too -- with the first bold development of scientific revolutionary thought in Europe .
True , the first settlers of bohemia -- which was then identical with the avant - garde -- turned out soon to be demonstratively uninterested in politics .
Nevertheless , without the circulation of revolutionary ideas in the air about them , they would never have been able to isolate their concept of the " bourgeois " in order to define what they were not .
Nor , without the moral aid of revolutionary political attitudes would they have had the courage to assert themselves as aggressively as they did against the prevailing standards of society .
Courage indeed was needed for this , because the avant - garde 's emigration from bourgeois society to bohemia meant also an emigration from the markets of capitalism , upon which artists and writers had been thrown by the falling away of aristocratic patronage .
( Ostensibly , at least , it meant this -- meant starving in a garret -- although , as we will be shown later , the avant - garde remained attached to bourgeois society precisely because it needed its money . )
Yet it is true that once the avant - garde had succeeded in " detaching " itself from society , it proceeded to turn around and repudiate revolutionary as well as bourgeois politics .
The revolution was left inside society , a part of that welter of ideological struggle which art and poetry find so unpropitious as soon as it begins to involve those " precious " axiomatic beliefs upon which culture thus far has had to rest .
Hence it developed that the true and most important function of the avant - garde was not to " experiment , " but to find a path along which it would be possible to keep culture moving in the midst of ideological confusion and violence .
Retiring from public altogether , the avant - garde poet or artist sought to maintain the high level of his art by both narrowing and raising it to the expression of an absolute in which all relativities and contradictions would be either resolved or beside the point .
" Art for art 's sake " and " pure poetry " appear , and subject matter or content becomes something to be avoided like a plague .
It has been in search of the absolute that the avant - garde has arrived at " abstract " or " nonobjective " art -- and poetry , too .
The avant - garde poet or artist tries in effect to imitate God by creating something valid solely on its own terms , in the way nature itself is valid , in the way a landscape -- not its picture -- is aesthetically valid ; something given , increate , independent of meanings , similars or originals .
Content is to be dissolved so completely into form that the work of art or literature cannot be reduced in whole or in part to anything not itself .
But the absolute is absolute , and the poet or artist , being what he is , cherishes certain relative values more than others .
The very values in the name of which he invokes the absolute are relative values , the values of aesthetics .
And so he turns out to be imitating , not God -- and here I use " imitate " in its Aristotelian sense -- but the disciplines and processes of art and literature themselves .
This is the genesis of the " abstract . "
(1) In turning his attention away from subject matter of common experience , the poet or artist turns it in upon the medium of his own craft .
The nonrepresentational or " abstract , " if it is to have aesthetic validity , cannot be arbitrary and accidental , but must stem from obedience to some worthy constraint or original .
This constraint , once the world of common , extroverted experience has been renounced , can only be found in the very processes or disciplines by which art and literature have already imitated the former .
These themselves become the subject matter of art and literature .
If , to continue with Aristotle , all art and literature are imitation , then what we have here is the imitation of imitating .
To quote Yeats :
Nor is there singing school but studying
Monuments of its own magnificence .
Picasso , Braque , Mondrian , Miro , Kandinsky , Brancusi , even Klee , Matisse and Cézanne derive their chief inspiration from the medium they work in .
(2) The excitement of their art seems to lie most of all in its pure preoccupation with the invention and arrangement of spaces , surfaces , shapes , colors , etc. , to the exclusion of whatever is not necessarily implicated in these factors .
The attention of poets like Rimbaud , Mallarmé , Valéry , Éluard , Pound , Hart Crane , Stevens , even Rilke and Yeats , appears to be centered on the effort to create poetry and on the " moments " themselves of poetic conversion , rather than on experience to be converted into poetry .
Of course , this cannot exclude other preoccupations in their work , for poetry must deal with words , and words must communicate .
Certain poets , such as Mallarmé and Valéry ( 3 ) are more radical in this respect than others -- leaving aside those poets who have tried to compose poetry in pure sound alone .
However , if it were easier to define poetry , modern poetry would be much more " pure " and " abstract . "
As for the other fields of literature -- the definition of avant - garde aesthetics advanced here is no Procrustean bed .
But aside from the fact that most of our best contemporary novelists have gone to school with the avant - garde , it is significant that Gide 's most ambitious book is a novel about the writing of a novel , and that Joyce 's Ulysses and Finnegans
Wake seem to be , above all , as one French critic says , the reduction of experience to expression for the sake of expression , the expression mattering more than what is being expressed .
That avant - garde culture is the imitation of imitating -- the fact itself -- calls for neither approval nor disapproval .
It is true that this culture contains within itself some of the very Alexandrianism it seeks to overcome .
The lines quoted from Yeats referred to Byzantium , which is very close to Alexandria ; and in a sense this imitation of imitating is a superior sort of Alexandrianism .
But there is one most important difference : the avant - garde moves , while Alexandrianism stands still .
And this , precisely , is what justifies the avant - garde 's methods and makes them necessary .
The necessity lies in the fact that by no other means is it possible today to create art and literature of a high order .
To quarrel with necessity by throwing about terms like " formalism , " " purism , " " ivory tower " and so forth is either dull or dishonest .
This is not to say , however , that it is to the social advantage of the avant - garde that it is what it is .
Quite the opposite .
The avant - garde 's specialization of itself , the fact that its best artists are artists ' artists , its best poets , poets ' poets , has estranged a great many of those who were capable formerly of enjoying and appreciating ambitious art and literature , but who are now unwilling or unable to acquire an initiation into their craft secrets .
The masses have always remained more or less indifferent to culture in the process of development .
But today such culture is being abandoned by those to whom it actually belongs -- our ruling class .
For it is to the latter that the avant - garde belongs .
No culture can develop without a social basis , without a source of stable income .
And in the case of the avant - garde , this was provided by an elite among the ruling class of that society from which it assumed itself to be cut off , but to which it has always remained attached by an umbilical cord of gold .
The paradox is real .
And now this elite is rapidly shrinking .
Since the avant - garde forms the only living culture we now have , the survival in the near future of culture in general is thus threatened .
We must not be deceived by superficial phenomena and local successes .
Picasso's shows still draw crowds , and T. S. Eliot is taught in the universities ; the dealers in modernist art are still in business , and the publishers still publish some " difficult " poetry .
But the avant - garde itself , already sensing the danger , is becoming more and more timid every day that passes .
Academicism and commercialism are appearing in the strangest places .
This can mean only one thing : that the avant - garde is becoming unsure of the audience it depends on -- the rich and the cultivated .
Is it the nature itself of avant - garde culture that is alone responsible for the danger it finds itself in ?
Or is that only a dangerous liability ?
Are there other , and perhaps more important , factors involved ?
II
Where there is an avant - garde , generally we also find a rear - guard .
True enough -- simultaneously with the entrance of the avant - garde , a second new cultural phenomenon appeared in the industrial West : that thing to which the Germans give the wonderful name of Kitsch : popular , commercial art and literature with their chromeotypes , magazine covers , illustrations , ads , slick and pulp fiction , comics , Tin Pan Alley music , tap dancing , Hollywood movies , etc. , etc .
For some reason this gigantic apparition has always been taken for granted .
It is time we looked into its whys and wherefores .
Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy .
Prior to this the only market for formal culture , as distinguished from folk culture , had been among those who , in addition to being able to read and write , could command the leisure and comfort that always goes hand in hand with cultivation of some sort .
This until then had been inextricably associated with literacy .
But with the introduction of universal literacy , the ability to read and write became almost a minor skill like driving a car , and it no longer served to distinguish an individual 's cultural inclinations , since it was no longer the exclusive concomitant of refined tastes .
The peasants who settled in the cities as proletariat and petty bourgeois learned to read and write for the sake of efficiency , but they did not win the leisure and comfort necessary for the enjoyment of the city 's traditional culture .
Losing , nevertheless , their taste for the folk culture whose background was the countryside , and discovering a new capacity for boredom at the same time , the new urban masses set up a pressure on society to provide them with a kind of culture fit for their own consumption .
To fill the demand of the new market , a new commodity was devised : ersatz culture , kitsch , destined for those who , insensible to the values of genuine culture , are hungry nevertheless for the diversion that only culture of some sort can provide .
Kitsch , using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture , welcomes and cultivates this insensibility .
It is the source of its profits .
Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas .
Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations .
Kitsch changes according to style , but remains always the same .
Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times .
Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time .
The precondition for kitsch , a condition without which kitsch would be impossible , is the availability close at hand of a fully matured cultural tradition , whose discoveries , acquisitions , and perfected self - consciousness kitsch can take advantage of for its own ends .
It borrows from it devices , tricks , stratagems , rules of thumb , themes , converts them into a system , and discards the rest .
It draws its life blood , so to speak , from this reservoir of accumulated experience .
This is what is really meant when it is said that the popular art and literature of today were once the daring , esoteric art and literature of yesterday .
Of course , no such thing is true .
What is meant is that when enough time has elapsed the new is looted for new " twists , " which are then watered down and served up as kitsch .
Self - evidently , all kitsch is academic ; and conversely , all that 's academic is kitsch .
For what is called the academic as such no longer has an independent existence , but has become the stuffed - shirt " front " for kitsch .
The methods of industrialism displace the handicrafts .
Because it can be turned out mechanically , kitsch has become an integral part of our productive system in a way in which true culture could never be , except accidentally .
It has been capitalized at a tremendous investment which must show commensurate returns ; it is compelled to extend as well as to keep its markets .
While it is essentially its own salesman , a great sales apparatus has nevertheless been created for it , which brings pressure to bear on every member of society .
Traps are laid even in those areas , so to speak , that are the preserves of genuine culture .
It is not enough today , in a country like ours , to have an inclination towards the latter ; one must have a true passion for it that will give him the power to resist the faked article that surrounds and presses in on him from the moment he is old enough to look at the funny papers .
Kitsch is deceptive .
It has many different levels , and some of them are high enough to be dangerous to the naive seeker of true light .
A magazine like the New Yorker , which is fundamentally high - class kitsch for the luxury trade , converts and waters down a great deal of avant - garde material for its own uses .
Nor is every single item of kitsch altogether worthless .
Now and then it produces something of merit , something that has an authentic folk flavor ; and these accidental and isolated instances have fooled people who should know better .
Kitsch 's enormous profits are a source of temptation to the avant - garde itself , and its members have not always resisted this temptation .
Ambitious writers and artists will modify their work under the pressure of kitsch , if they do not succumb to it entirely .
And then those puzzling borderline cases appear , such as the popular novelist , Simenon , in France , and Steinbeck in this country .
The net result is always to the detriment of true culture in any case .
Kitsch has not been confined to the cities in which it was born , but has flowed out over the countryside , wiping out folk culture .
Nor has it shown any regard for geographical and national cultural boundaries .
Another mass product of Western industrialism , it has gone on a triumphal tour of the world , crowding out and defacing native cultures in one colonial country after another , so that it is now by way of becoming a universal culture , the first universal culture ever beheld .
Today the native of China , no less than the South American Indian , the Hindu , no less than the Polynesian , have come to prefer to the products of their native art , magazine covers , rotogravure sections and calendar girls .
How is this virulence of kitsch , this irresistible attractiveness , to be explained ?
Naturally , machine - made kitsch can undersell the native handmade article , and the prestige of the West also helps ; but why is kitsch a so much more profitable export article than Rembrandt ?
One , after all , can be reproduced as cheaply as the other .
In his last article on the Soviet cinema in the Partisan Review , Dwight Macdonald points out that kitsch has in the last ten years become the dominant culture in Soviet Russia .
For this he blames the political regime -- not only for the fact that kitsch is the official culture , but also that it is actually the dominant , most popular culture , and he quotes the following from Kurt London 's The Seven Soviet Arts : " . . . the attitude of the masses both to the old and new art styles probably remains essentially dependent on the nature of the education afforded them by their respective states . "
Macdonald goes on to say : " Why after all should ignorant peasants prefer Repin ( a leading exponent of Russian academic kitsch in painting ) to Picasso , whose abstract technique is at least as relevant to their own primitive folk art as is the former 's realistic style ?
No , if the masses crowd into the Tretyakov ( Moscow 's museum of contemporary Russian art : kitsch ) , it is largely because they have been conditioned to shun ' formalism ' and to admire ' socialist realism . ' "
In the first place it is not a question of a choice between merely the old and merely the new , as London seems to think -- but of a choice between the bad , up - to - date old and the genuinely new .
The alternative to Picasso is not Michelangelo , but kitsch .
In the second place , neither in backward Russia nor in the advanced West do the masses prefer kitsch simply because their governments condition them toward it .
Where state educational systems take the trouble to mention art , we are told to respect the old masters , not kitsch ; and yet we go and hang Maxfield Parrish or his equivalent on our walls , instead of Rembrandt and Michelangelo .
Moreover , as Macdonald himself points out , around 1925 when the Soviet regime was encouraging avant - garde cinema , the Russian masses continued to prefer Hollywood movies .
No , " conditioning " does not explain the potency of kitsch .
All values are human values , relative values , in art as well as elsewhere .
Yet there does seem to have been more or less of a general agreement among the cultivated of mankind over the ages as to what is good art and what bad .
Taste has varied , but not beyond certain limits ; contemporary connoisseurs agree with the eighteenth - century Japanese that Hokusai was one of the greatest artists of his time ; we even agree with the ancient Egyptians that Third and Fourth Dynasty art was the most worthy of being selected as their paragon by those who came after .
We may have come to prefer Giotto to Raphael , but we still do not deny that Raphael was one of the best painters of his time .
There has been an agreement then , and this agreement rests , I believe , on a fairly constant distinction made between those values only to be found in art and the values which can be found elsewhere .
Kitsch , by virtue of a rationalized technique that draws on science and industry , has erased this distinction in practice .
Left : Repin , Cossacks ; Right : Piacsso , Woman with a Fan
Let us see , for example , what happens when an ignorant Russian peasant such as Macdonald mentions stands with hypothetical freedom of choice before two paintings , one by Picasso , the other by Repin .
In the first he sees , let us say , a play of lines , colors and spaces that represent a woman .
The abstract technique -- to accept Macdonald 's supposition , which I am inclined to doubt -- reminds him somewhat of the icons he has left behind him in the village , and he feels the attraction of the familiar .
We will even suppose that he faintly surmises some of the great art values the cultivated find in Picasso .
He turns next to Repin 's picture and sees a battle scene .
The technique is not so familiar -- as technique .
But that weighs very little with the peasant , for he suddenly discovers values in Repin 's picture that seem far superior to the values he has been accustomed to find in icon art ; and the unfamiliar itself is one of the sources of those values : the values of the vividly recognizable , the miraculous and the sympathetic .
In Repin 's picture the peasant recognizes and sees things in the way in which he recognizes and sees things outside of pictures -- there is no discontinuity between art and life , no need to accept a convention and say to oneself , that icon represents Jesus because it intends to represent Jesus , even if it does not remind me very much of a man .
That Repin can paint so realistically that identifications are self - evident immediately and without any effort on the part of the spectator -- that is miraculous .
The peasant is also pleased by the wealth of self - evident meanings which he finds in the picture : " it tells a story .
" Picasso and the icons are so austere and barren in comparison .
What is more , Repin heightens reality and makes it dramatic : sunset , exploding shells , running and falling men .
There is no longer any question of Picasso or icons .
Repin is what the peasant wants , and nothing else but Repin .
It is lucky , however , for Repin that the peasant is protected from the products of American capitalism , for he would not stand a chance next to a Saturday Evening Post cover by Norman Rockwell .
Ultimately , it can be said that the cultivated spectator derives the same values from Picasso that the peasant gets from Repin , since what the latter enjoys in Repin is somehow art too , on however low a scale , and he is sent to look at pictures by the same instincts that send the cultivated spectator .
But the ultimate values which the cultivated spectator derives from Picasso are derived at a second remove , as the result of reflection upon the immediate impression left by the plastic values .
It is only then that the recognizable , the miraculous and the sympathetic enter .
They are not immediately or externally present in Picasso's painting , but must be projected into it by the spectator sensitive enough to react sufficiently to plastic qualities .
They belong to the " reflected " effect .
In Repin , on the other hand , the " reflected " effect has already been included in the picture , ready for the spectator 's unreflective enjoyment .
(4) Where Picasso paints cause , Repin paints effect .
Repin predigests art for the spectator and spares him effort , provides him with a shore cut to the pleasure of art that detours what is necessarily difficult in genuine art .
Repin , or kitsch , is synthetic art .
The same point can be made with respect to kitsch literature : it provides vicarious experience for the insensitive with far greater immediacy than serious fiction can hope to do .
And Eddie Guest and the Indian Love Lyrics are more poetic than T. S. Eliot and Shakespeare .
III
If the avant - garde imitates the processes of art , kitsch , we now see , imitates its effects .
The neatness of this antithesis is more than contrived ; it corresponds to and defines the tremendous interval that separates from each other two such simultaneous cultural phenomena as the avant - garde and kitsch .
This interval , too great to be closed by all the infinite gradations of popularized " modernism " and " modernistic " kitsch , corresponds in turn to a social interval , a social interval that has always existed in formal culture , as elsewhere in civilized society , and whose two termini converge and diverge in fixed relation to the increasing or decreasing stability of the given society .
There has always been on one side the minority of the powerful -- and therefore the cultivated -- and on the other the great mass of the exploited and poor -- and therefore the ignorant .
Formal culture has always belonged to the first , while the last have had to content themselves with folk or rudimentary culture , or kitsch .
In a stable society that functions well enough to hold in solution the contradictions between its classes , the cultural dichotomy becomes somewhat blurred .
The axioms of the few are shared by the many ; the latter believe superstitiously what the former believe soberly .
And at such moments in history the masses are able to feel wonder and admiration for the culture , on no matter how high a plane , of its masters .
This applies at least to plastic culture , which is accessible to all .
In the Middle Ages the plastic artist paid lip service at least to the lowest common denominators of experience .
This even remained true to some extent until the seventeenth century .
There was available for imitation a universally valid conceptual reality , whose order the artist could not tamper with .
The subject matter of art was prescribed by those who commissioned works of art , which were not created , as in bourgeois society , on speculation .
Precisely because his content was determined in advance , the artist was free to concentrate on his medium .
He needed not to be philosopher , or visionary , but simply artificer .
As long as there was general agreement as to what were the worthiest subjects for art , the artist was relieved of the necessity to be original and inventive in his " matter " and could devote all his energy to formal problems .
For him the medium became , privately , professionally , the content of his art , even as his medium is today the public content of the abstract painter 's art -- with that difference , however , that the medieval artist had to suppress his professional preoccupation in public -- had always to suppress and subordinate the personal and professional in the finished , official work of art .
If , as an ordinary member of the Christian community , he felt some personal emotion about his subject matter , this only contributed to the enrichment of the work 's public meaning .
Only with the Renaissance do the inflections of the personal become legitimate , still to be kept , however , within the limits of the simply and universally recognizable .
And only with Rembrandt do " lonely " artists begin to appear , lonely in their art .
But even during the Renaissance , and as long as Western art was endeavoring to perfect its technique , victories in this realm could only be signalized by success in realistic imitation , since there was no other objective criterion at hand .
Thus the masses could still find in the art of their masters objects of admiration and wonder .
Even the bird that pecked at the fruit in Zeuxis ' picture could applaud .
It is a platitude that art becomes caviar to the general when the reality it imitates no longer corresponds even roughly to the reality recognized by the general .
Even then , however , the resentment the common man may feel is silenced by the awe in which he stands of the patrons of this art .
Only when he becomes dissatisfied with the social order they administer does he begin to criticize their culture .
Then the plebian finds courage for the first time to voice his opinions openly .
Every man , from the Tammany alderman to the Austrian house - painter , finds that he is entitled to his opinion .
Most often this resentment toward culture is to be found where the dissatisfaction with society is a reactionary dissatisfaction which expresses itself in revivalism and puritanism , and latest of all , in fascism .
Here revolvers and torches begin to be mentioned in the same breath as culture .
In the name of godliness or the blood 's health , in the name of simple ways and solid virtues , the statue - smashing commences .
IV
Returning to our Russian peasant for the moment , let us suppose that after he has chosen Repin in preference to Picasso , the state 's educational apparatus comes along and tells him that he is wrong , that he should have chosen Picasso -- and shows him why .
It is quite possible for the Soviet state to do this .
But things being as they are in Russia -- and everywhere else -- the peasant soon finds the necessity of working hard all day for his living and the rude , uncomfortable circumstances in which he lives do not allow him enough leisure , energy and comfort to train for the enjoyment of Picasso .
This needs , after all , a considerable amount of " conditioning . "
Superior culture is one of the most artificial of all human creations , and the peasant finds no " natural " urgency within himself that will drive him toward Picasso in spite of all difficulties .
In the end the peasant will go back to kitsch when he feels like looking at pictures , for he can enjoy kitsch without effort .
The state is helpless in this matter and remains so as long as the problems of production have not been solved in a socialist sense .
The same holds true , of course , for capitalist countries and makes all talk of art for the masses there nothing but demagogy .
( 5 )
Where today a political regime establishes an official cultural policy , it is for the sake of demagogy .
If kitsch is the official tendency of culture in Germany , Italy and Russia , it is not because their respective governments are controlled by philistines , but because kitsch is the culture of the masses in these countries , as it is everywhere else .
The encouragement of kitsch is merely another of the inexpensive ways in which totalitarian regimes seek to ingratiate themselves with their subjects .
Since these regimes cannot raise the cultural level of the masses -- even if they wanted to -- by anything short of a surrender to international socialism , they will flatter the masses by bringing all culture down to their level .
It is for this reason that the avant - garde is outlawed , and not so much because a superior culture is inherently a more critical culture .
( Whether or not the avant - garde could possibly flourish under a totalitarian regime is not pertinent to the question at this point . )
As a matter of fact , the main trouble with avant - garde art and literature , from the point of view of fascists and Stalinists , is not that they are too critical , but that they are too " innocent , " that it is too difficult to inject effective propaganda into them , that kitsch is more pliable to this end .
Kitsch keeps a dictator in closer contact with the " soul " of the people .
Should the official culture be one superior to the general mass - level , there would be a danger of isolation .
Nevertheless , if the masses were conceivably to ask for avant - garde art and literature , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin would not hesitate long in attempting to satisfy such a demand .
Hitler is a bitter enemy of the avant - garde , both on doctrinal and personal grounds , yet this did not prevent Goebbels in 1932 - 1933 from strenuously courting avant - garde artists and writers .
When Gottfried Benn , an Expressionist poet , came over to the Nazis he was welcomed with a great fanfare , although at that very moment Hitler was denouncing Expressionism as Kulturbolschewismus .
This was at a time when the Nazis felt that the prestige which the avant - garde enjoyed among the cultivated German public could be of advantage to them , and practical considerations of this nature , the Nazis being skillful politicians , have always taken precedence over Hitler 's personal inclinations .
Later the Nazis realized that it was more practical to accede to the wishes of the masses in matters of culture than to those of their paymasters ; the latter , when it came to a question of preserving power , were as willing to sacrifice their culture as they were their moral principles ; while the former , precisely because power was being withheld from them , had to be cozened in every other way possible .
It was necessary to promote on a much more grandiose style than in the democracies the illusion that the masses actually rule .
The literature and art they enjoy and understand were to be proclaimed the only true art and literature and any other kind was to be suppressed .
Under these circumstances people like Gottfried Benn , no matter how ardently they support Hitler , become a liability ; and we hear no more of them in Nazi Germany .
We can see then that although from one point of view the personal philistinism of Hitler and Stalin is not accidental to the roles they play , from another point of view it is only an incidentally contributory factor in determining the cultural policies of their respective regimes .
Their personal philistinism simply adds brutality and double - darkness to policies they would be forced to support anyhow by the pressure of all their other policies -- even were they , personally , devotees of avant - garde culture .
What the acceptance of the isolation of the Russian Revolution forces Stalin to do , Hitler is compelled to do by his acceptance of the contradictions of capitalism and his efforts to freeze them .
As for Mussolini -- his case is a perfect example of the disponsibilité of a realist in these matters .
For years he bent a benevolent eye on the Futurists and built modernistic railroad stations and government - owned apartment houses .
One can still see in the suburbs of Rome more modernistic apartments than almost anywhere else in the world .
Perhaps Fascism wanted to show its up - to - dateness , to conceal the fact that it was a retrogression ; perhaps it wanted to conform to the tastes of the wealthy elite it served .
At any rate Mussolini seems to have realized lately that it would be more useful to him to please the cultural tastes of the Italian masses than those of their masters .
The masses must be provided with objects of admiration and wonder ; the latter can dispense with them .
And so we find Mussolini announcing a " new Imperial style . "
Marinetti , Chirico , et al. , are sent into the outer darkness , and the new railroad station in Rome will not be modernistic .
That Mussolini was late in coming to this only illustrates again the relative hesitance with which Italian Fascism has drawn the necessary implications of its role .
Capitalism in decline finds that whatever of quality it is still capable of producing becomes almost invariably a threat to its own existence .
Advances in culture , no less than advances in science and industry , corrode the very society under whose aegis they are made possible .
Here , as in every other question today , it becomes necessary to quote Marx word for word .
Today we no longer look toward socialism for a new culture -- as inevitably as one will appear , once we do have socialism .
Today we look to socialism simply for the preservation of whatever living culture we have right now .
1 . The example of music , which has long been an abstract art , and which avant - garde poetry has tried so much to emulate , is interesting .
Music , Aristotle said curiously enough , is the most imitative and vivid of all arts because it imitates its original -- the state of the soul -- with the greatest immediacy .
Today this strikes us as the exact opposite of the truth , because no art seems to us to have less reference to something outside itself than music .
However , aside from the fact that in a sense Aristotle may still be right , it must be explained that ancient Greek music was closely associated with poetry , and depended upon its character as an accessory to verse to make its imitative meaning clear .
Plato , speaking of music , says : " For when there are no words , it is very difficult o recognize the meaning of the harmony and rhythm , or to see that any worthy object is imitated by them . "
As far as we know , all music originally served such an accessory function .
Once , however , it was abandoned , music was forced to withdraw into itself to find a constraint or original .
This is found in the various means of its own composition and performance .

2 . I owe this formulation to a remark made by Hans Hofmann , the art teacher , in one of his lectures .
From the point of view of this formulation , Surrealism in plastic art is a reactionary tendency which is attempting to restore " outside " subject matter .
The chief concern of a painter like Dali is to represent the processes and concepts of his consciousness , not the processes of his medium .

4. T. S. Eliot said something to the same effect in accounting for the shortcomings of English Romantic poetry .
Indeed the Romantics can be considered the original sinners whose guilt kitsch inherited .
They showed kitsch how .
What does Keats write about mainly , if not the effect of poetry upon himself ?

5 . It will be objected that such art for the masses as folk art was developed under rudimentary conditions of production -- and that a good deal of folk art is on a high level .
Yes it is -- but folk art is not Athene , and it 's Athene whom we want : formal culture with its infinity of aspects , its luxuriance , its large comprehension .
Besides , we are now told that most of what we consider good in folk culture is the static survival of dead formal , aristocratic , cultures .
Our old English ballads , for instance , were not created by the " folk , " but by the post - feudal squirearchy of the English countryside , to survive in the mouths of the folk long after those for whom the ballads were composed had gone on to other forms of literature .
Unfortunately , until the machine age , culture was the exclusive prerogative of a society that lived by the labor of serfs or slaves .
They were the real symbols of culture .
For one man to spend time and energy creating or listening to poetry meant that another man had to produce enough to keep himself alive and the former in comfort .
In Africa today we find that the culture of slave - owning tribes is generally much superior to that of the tribes that possess no slaves .

In a software design meeting the other day , I found myself saying “ it needs to be a little less here ” ( tapping myself on the forehead ) “ and a little more here ” ( tapping myself on the heart ) .
As a pointy - eared technical guy , I ’ve long been resistant to this type of language , knowing it to be logically meaningless .
After all , the heart is merely a muscle that pumps blood , right ?
But the heart is also a potent symbol , and I hope my meaning was clear to the programmers in the room : the software under discussion was intelligent , but lacking in emotional appeal .
Increasingly , I find that one of the things that separates software that I love from software that is merely adequate is the presence of heart ; and this is something that programming books ( and the programmers who write them ) tend to give short shrift .
We programmers will discuss speed , efficiency , maintainability , and robustness till the cows come home , but very rarely will we admit that our software needs to be more likable .
We are an army of tin men , hacking away at the thicket , with increasingly powerful hatchets , and hollow chests .
What gives software more heart ?
What makes a user have a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship with a collection of ones and zeros ?
A few things that come to mind are personal relevance , simplicity , directness , judicious randomness , pictures and sounds and above all , a little silliness .
Personal Relevance
Probably the most direct way to make software pull at the heart strings is to fill it with people that are at the center the person ’s life .
Social apps , such as those that use Facebook connect or the Flickr API , are a good example .
Simply looking at a row of faces that are familiar to me can have a strong impact , and even more so if the software finds ways to deepen my relationships with other people .
It is clear that a lot of people are aware of this simple trick , and we are now seeing a plethora of companies that seek to add personal relevance to their brands by using Facebook Connect and similar measures .
Unfortunately , not all those brands necessarily make sense in a social context , and inappropriate and ungainly attempts to add social features may actually distance users ( why does Levis want to connect me to my friends ? ) , rather than endear them .
Simplicity
To put it plainly , a simple elegant interface has more emotional appeal than an inelegant clunky one .
It is hard to love a clunky interface ( although I suppose pity can inspire love ) .
More often than not , clunky interfaces make us angry and frustrated .
Most good programmers are well aware of this counter - intuitive fact : Simple interfaces are harder to make .
When a program seems busy and complicated , it probably took far less time to make than the competing program which accomplishes the same things with fewer moving parts .
Programmers with heart work extra hard to insure that their software is as simple and direct as possible .
Their interfaces become nearly invisible , and the user is absorbed in the experience , rather than the tool .
Feature creep can make software needlessly complex and ungainly .
Some programmers are turned on by complexity , and add needless
customization features , thinking it makes the software more powerful and desirable .
The effect , more often than not , is a kind of unloveliness .
Directness
Software that directly communicates what I desire to know and does n’t hide behind a layer of abstraction tends to have a more direct emotional appeal .
The idea here is to reduce the involvement of higher reasoning and logic , so that the lower parts of the brain are more directly involved in the user experience .
For most of us , to directly manipulate objects with our fingers , using a tablet , is more satisfying and simple than to issue text commands to manipulate those objects on a command line .
Now , being a geek , I actually love the command line – but it ’s not as counter - intuitive as it seems —
I ’ve gained a degree of facility with the command line that makes it a more direct means of getting things done .
Judicious Randomness
Never avoid the opportunity to use a random number generator somewhere in a program !
I say judicious , because , obviously , you do n’t want to employ randomness in computing income taxes or rocket trajectories , but there is always an opportunity to use a little randomness as a means of adding surprise and delight .
For years , I have considered the need for randomness to be one of the most direct predictors of how much I will enjoy working on a software project .
When a program requires randomness , it is less likely to be serious and useful , and I am more likely to enjoy it .
One of my favorite examples of Judicious Randomness is the Google logo , which surprises me , every few days , by appearing completely different .
The Google corporation has engendered a huge amount of good will from that randomized logo .
Pictures and Sounds
Although they can be horribly misused , in general , pictures and sounds can make software more emotionally appealing , because they more fully involve the brain than text alone , and help to make the experience more direct .
Well chosen icons , photographs , and subtle audio feedback can greatly improve the emotional impact of software .
Example : I once traded up for a nicer cell phone .
My wife got jealous , not because of the greater utility of the phone , but because it made more pleasing bell - like sounds when the keys were tapped !
A Little Silliness
For me , injecting small amounts of playfulness is an important part of software design .
Sadly , it is something that is often scrupulously avoided by serious - minded programmers , who , seeking to make their wares appear professional and useful , carefully drain them of all possible fun .
I do n’t care how serious the intent of a piece of software is – nobody deserves to live a life devoid of humor .
Even accountants and morticians deserve a laugh or two – probably more than most !
I ’m not suggesting that everything needs to be hugely silly .
But there is a huge difference between a little playfulness , and zero playfulness .
When there is zero , I ca n’t tell that the software has a beating heart behind it .
It is software made by mindless , joyless drones .
Back in the 90s , I worked on an avatar chat client , and added a feature that removed all the “ props ” or additions to the base avatar .
I labelled the button “ Naked , ” and I still believe that little button label was one of my best ideas .
So there you have it – some random musings on software with heart .
Got any examples of your own ?
Nick Clegg today makes a bold pitch to Labour voters , claiming that the Liberal Democrats have supplanted Gordon Brown 's party to become the natural home of progressive politics in Britain .
In a Guardian interview , Clegg accuses David Cameron of having no agenda for progressive reform of the country , and says the Lib Dems and Labour come from the same historical tradition .
He says he is rejecting all talk of tactical voting and is instead " going for broke " to maximise his party 's share of the vote .
Clegg insists that the tectonic plates of politics are shifting , and the choice has distilled down to a vote for his party or a Conservative party that will " cast the country adrift " .
The Lib Dem leader appears to suggest that any post-election arrangement with the Tories would be a coalition of convenience rather than principle when he asserts :
" There is a gulf in values between myself and David Cameron , " adding : " They have no progressive reform agenda at all – only an unbearable sense of entitlement that it 's just their time to govern . "
During the two years of his leadership , Clegg has successfully maintained a position equally distant from the Labour and Conservative parties , but today he emphasises that the Liberal Democrats have shared progressive history .
His remarks go further than before in suggesting that if he feels the electorate has given him a choice , his instinct will be to form an alliance of some form with Labour .
He holds out no hope of securing electoral reform from Cameron .
He says : " What is striking is despite all the blather from Cameron over the past few weeks , he has made up his mind strategically to set his face against any profound reform of the political system .
I think this will prove to be the biggest strategic error he has ever made , because one thing you cannot do is set your face against change when the demand for that change is so powerful that it is coming from millions of people .
" In terms of its DNA , the Conservative party is now the party of entrenched vested interests of politics . "
Saying that he is now aiming for more than 100 gains on the party 's 63 MPs , and even the largest share of the vote , Clegg says : " I do n't think the choice is between Conservative and Labour – the choice is now between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats . "
Clegg 's hopes of gaining more than 100 seats were confirmed by a Harris poll of voting intentions for the Daily Mail today , which put the Conservatives on 33 % , the Lib Dems on 32 % , and Labour in third place with 24 % .
If this poll result were reflected in the election , it could give the Lib Dems 137 seats .
While many progressives are calling for anti-Tory tactical voting by Lib Dem supporters in the key 100 Labour - Conservative marginals , Clegg rejects this advice .
He argues : " In an election where the tectonic plates are moving so quickly and so radically , people have got to go with their gut instincts .
Once in a while there are elections where people should be released to do what they want , and I think this is one of those elections – I really do . "
He denies this shows he is willing to put his chance of overtaking Labour ahead of preventing a majority Tory government .
" The Tories are nowhere near getting an overall majority .
We are absolutely going for broke so far as the share of the vote is concerned . "
He also makes it hard to see the basis of a Tory - Lib Dem coalition .
" I think if you look at the debate last night , there is just a gulf between what David Cameron stands for and what I stand for – in terms of values , in terms of internationalism , in terms of fairness , in terms of progressive tax reform , in terms of political reform , in terms of simply living in denial , as does Labour , about a major problem of their creation in the immigration system . "
Asked if the same gulf existed with Labour , he says : " I have always accepted the first part of Roy Jenkins 's analysis which says that historically Labour and Liberal Democrats are two wings of a progressive tradition in British politics . "
But Clegg maintains his party cannot be an annexe of Labour , and there is a fundamental difference between the two parties over the individual and the state .
" There are some people in the Labour party that now get [ it that ] progressive politics has to be about empowerment , reducing dependency on the state , increasing social mobility through individual empowerment , releasing power from the centre politically – but it is not where the Labour party lies at heart .
Listen to Gordon Brown 's final message last night – it was : ' You 're not allowed to take a risk on anyone else . '
It 's a very dismal , cramped and depressing message .
That 's why polls are putting us ahead of Labour , and that 'll crystallise in the next few days into a two - horse race . "
Clegg insists that politics has been changed permanently by this election .
" I personally think both the Tories and Labour face profound crises of identity because they are both based on assumptions of mass support that have now evaporated .
The arrogance of both the Conservative and Labour party that it 's somehow their birthright to speak on behalf of millions of people .
That 's gone . "

The coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats pits principle against pragmatism .
It is fraught with possibilities and dangers ; for the Lib Dems the key to success is to identify and fearlessly protect the bright red lines that must never be crossed .
The landscape may have changed , but the geology has n't .
I welcomed Labour 's general election victory in 1997 , but like many people judged the moment wrongly .
I left the Labour Party on 15 August 2001 .
My resignation letter concentrated on three issues : the then government 's failure to be bold and decisive on constitutional and structural reform ; the cosying up to big money , as Labour became too intimately connected with the interests of large corporations ; and the failure to distance itself from some of the policies of the Bush administration .
That was four weeks before the 11 September 2001 attacks , before the full extent of the Bush / Blair alliance became apparent , before Labour became the party of illegal war and embroiled in allegations of complicity in torture .
After that , I started to work closely on issues of foreign policy and the rule of law , first with Menzies Campbell and then with Nick Clegg .
They were leading the Liberal Democrats to do the right things on justice , human rights and international affairs , adopting principled positions that have been shown to be right , consistent with basic values of fairness and justice .
They did not strike me as tribal , but sought instead to adopt serious , principled and progressive policies on immigration , on fair taxes , on education , on Trident , and on Britain 's place in Europe and the world .
Sham rainbow
Eventually I joined the Liberal Democrats , and from a progressive perspective saw this general election as an important opportunity to reshape the political landscape .
When my very good local Lib Dem candidate asked me to support him publicly , I was pleased to do so .
The prospect of a hung parliament did not cause alarm - quite the opposite .
For many , the governing assumption was that this would lead to a Lib / Lab coalition , perhaps with a new Labour leader untainted by the worst excesses of the past 13 years .
That did not happen .
As the post-election negotiations unfolded , many assumed that the Lib Dem dance with the Tories was a case of " going through the motions " , that the gaps would be far too great to bridge .
When our discussions with Labour opened , we thought the Tories would be furious and the rifts would grow .
But the Tories were n't furious , at least not in public , whereas John Reid and David Blunkett were , dismally and loudly .
From that moment it was clear that the numbers did n't stack up , because too many people in Labour did n't want them to stack up .
A former Labour cabinet minister told me he had pretended to support a deal with the Lib Dems but did n't want one , and was relieved by the outcome .
The rainbow coalition always was an illusion .
In reality , there were three possibilities once a hung parliament had been returned : a minority Tory government , a Tory government supported on some issues by the Lib Dems , or a fully fledged coalition between the two parties .
The advantages and dangers of each were apparent .
Under the first two options , it seemed likely that there would have been another election six months down the line .
This would very likely have given the Tories a majority to act on their own , as happened with Labour in 1974 .
Yet the coalition route risked destroying the Liberal Democrat vote in constituencies such as mine ( Hampstead and Kilburn is a three - way marginal in which Tories , Lib Dems and Labour squeezed 50,000 votes more or less equally between them ) .
Labour squeaked in by 42 votes .
The prospect of a Lib Dem - Tory coalition was not easy to accept ; it poses great risks for the Lib Dems ( as it does for the Tories , and also a Labour Party that could be consigned to a generation of irrelevance ) .
Yet I wanted to see the details of the coalition agreement before forming a clearer view .
I 'm glad I did .
It 's a decent document , with much that is positive on civil rights , the environment and constitutional and structural reform , among other matters .
David Cameron has made big concessions to enter No 10 : the Lib Dems must hold him to them .
Unleash the findings
I worry greatly about the economics and about who will pay the price for the cuts in public spending that are coming .
The test for Clegg and the Lib Dems is to ensure that those who can truly afford to pay for the economic clean - up are those who do pay , and that the most vulnerable are protected fully from the coming horrors .
The fault lines are there for all to see , on Europe , Iran , nuclear power , immigration , even electoral reform .
But are they that different from the lines that divide the Liberal Democrats from Labour ?
The Lib Dems will learn that what was easy in opposition becomes much more complex in government .
On Iraq and torture , they have been consistently right .
Now , I want Clegg to unleash the Chilcot inquiry , so that it publishes the damning documents that Labour refused to release which show the truth about the road to war in Iraq .
I want a full , judicial inquiry on allegations of British complicity in torture .
I want a cast - iron commitment to permanent protections for human rights and freedom of information and equality for all .
I 'm not starry - eyed about what may come , especially after the post - 1997 betrayals .
At home and among friends , I get grief about my contribution to " bringing in the Tories " .
Maybe I will be shown to have been wrong , but I want to look on the bright side and support the potential of this coalition agreement to deliver , provided the bright , red lines are respected .

A man who spent 13 years in prison for a murder later linked to a suspected serial killer will be paid $ 25,000 in compensation by the state , according to a State Claims Board decision released Tuesday .
The money paid to Chaunte Ott , convicted of the 1995 murder of teenage runaway Jessica Payne , is the maximum payout allowed for a wrongful conviction without a separate act of the state Legislature .
" The Board concludes that there is clear and convincing evidence the claimant was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted , " the board wrote in its decision to pay Ott .
At the time of the crime , DNA testing was n't as advanced as it is today .
A sample collected from Payne 's body initially neither confirmed nor excluded Ott .
Two other men implicated themselves and Ott in the murder , and Ott was convicted .
In 2002 , the Wisconsin Innocence Project , trying to get Ott out of prison , asked for more testing .
This time ,
Ott was excluded - though he remained in prison .
Five years later , the DNA was linked to two other dead women .
Eventually it was identified as belonging to accused serial killer Walter E. Ellis .
Ellis has been charged with killing seven women .
Prosecutors have not charged him with killing Payne because they do not have enough evidence to meet their burden of proof in that case , according to Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm .
Ott was released from prison in January 2009 .
His pending federal lawsuit against the city , two former police chiefs and several detectives claims police coerced the confessions out of the two men who implicated him .
Both men later recanted .
The Coalition for Vaccine Safety ( CVS ) calls for independent vaccine safety agency and Congressional hearings on government 's lax record on safety issues .
A three - part investigative series on Merck 's cervical cancer vaccine , Gardasil® , highlights serious conflicts of interest across agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) in the development , approval and safety surveillance of vaccines .
The series , by Mark Blaxill , Editor - at - Large for the Internet newspaper Age of Autism and a Director of SafeMinds , was posted on the newspaper 's site on May 12 - 13 ( www.ageofautism.com/mark_blaxill).
It preceded the announcement on May 14 that FDA , a DHHS agency , is allowing use of rotavirus vaccines despite their contamination with viral particles from pigs .
( http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm212149.htm)
Blaxill 's investigation found an unprecedented vaccine " public - private partnership " between drug companies and DHHS ' National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
NIH researchers developed key technology underpinning cervical cancer vaccines .
The technology was patented and licensed to pharmaceutical giants Merck and GlaxoSmithKline through the NIH Office of Technology Transfer ( OTT ) .
When new products invented at NIH clear the regulatory hurdles at FDA and reach market , OTT shares in the profits and distributes them back to NIH and its staff inventors .
Despite clinical trials lacking a true placebo , FDA approved it for use .
The CDC 's vaccine advisory committee then recommended Gardasil for universal use by girls .
The FDA and CDC jointly conduct the surveillance to decide whether the NIH - invented Gardasil is safe once licensed .
Dr. Julie Gerberding served as the Director of the CDC when it approved Gardasil .
She is now the president of Merck Vaccines .
According to Blaxill , this situation creates " an unprecedented web of conflict , one in which the same departments that are tasked with regulating the health and safety of medical products are also profiting from them . "
There have been hundreds of claims of injury or death from Gardasil .
Some of these claims are now reaching the Court of Federal Claims , where vaccine injured petitioners are required to bring claims .
Here too there are serious potential conflicts of interest as DHHS jointly administers the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and is also the defendant against the claims of vaccine injury instead of the vaccine manufacturer Merck .
" DHHS has chosen to minimize other safety issues like mercury and viral contamination in vaccines , " stated Mary Holland of CVS .
" We need a stronger vaccine safety oversight agency which is independent of DHHS . "
CVS calls on Congress , as it has in recent letters , to hold hearings to investigate the agencies responsible for the national vaccine program .
These federal agencies have failed to comply with the terms of the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation Act ( VICA ) to provide critical vaccine safety science .

It 's not the quantity of lines so much how they budgeted the time to record said lines and how they presented the lines to the actors .

All those claims about how you just ca n’t get SSDs in capacities comparable to those you can find with traditional hard drives will now have to be rethought .
OCZ has announced the Colossus LT series of 3.5 - inch SSDs that are available in capacities up to 1TB .
The catch ?
Need you ask ?
It ’s the price .
The 1TB drive will set you back $ 4,000 .
And no , that ’s not a typo .
OCZ boasts about the series ’ “ excellent ” mean time between failure ( MTBF ) rating of one million hours , and backs up the drive with a three - year warranty and dedicated technical support .
We ’ll be interested to see how ( or whether ) the new Colossus drives will change the market , and finally help nudge capacities up and prices down at a slightly faster rate .
For all but the most dedicated enthusiasts , however , we imagine the prices still have to drop a lot .
Would you be willing to pay $ 4,000 for a 1TB SSD ?
What ’s the maximum you would pay , for what capacity ?
Let us know in the comments .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama , fresh from a win on a sweeping overhaul of Wall Street regulations , on Saturday urged Congress to take up his proposal for a $ 90 billion , 10 - year tax on banks as the next step in reform .
U.S. President Barack Obama gestures prior to a 2010 G8 Summit photo with the " My Summit 2010 Youth " at the Deerhurst Resort at Muskoka in Huntsville , Canada , June 25 , 2010 .

Obama wants to slap a 0.15 percent tax on the liabilities of the biggest U.S. financial institutions to recoup the costs to taxpayers of the financial bailout .
“ We need to impose a fee on the banks that were the biggest beneficiaries of taxpayer assistance at the height of our financial crisis -- so we can recover every dime of taxpayer money , ” Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
Obama , who is in Canada to attend gatherings with leaders of the world ’s biggest economies , also used the address to welcome a deal by congressional negotiators on a historic rewriting of U.S. financial regulations .
Obama hopes to tout the changes as a model for other countries at the Group of 20 summit on Saturday and Sunday .
“ I hope we can build on the progress we made at last year ’s G20 summits by coordinating our global financial reform efforts to make sure a crisis like the one from which we are still recovering never happens again , ” he said .
The financial regulation package would set up a new financial consumer watchdog , create a protocol for dismantling troubled financial firms and mandate higher bank capital standards , with the aim of avoiding a repeat of the 2007 - 2009 financial meltdown .
The bill , marking the biggest changes to the financial regulatory structure since the 1930s , still needs final approval from both chambers of Congress .
Obama , who hopes to sign the legislation by July 4 , urged Congress to push the bill “ over the finish line . ”
With congressional elections looming in November , Obama hopes the financial reform and the bank tax idea will resonate with U.S. voters furious over Wall Street risk - taking that led to the financial meltdown and the worst recession in decades .
Some lawmakers have indicated they are receptive to the bank tax proposal but others have questioned whether it is fair to impose the tax on banks that have already repaid money from the Troubled Asset Relief Fund to make up for losses by American International Group Inc and General Motors .
Financial companies with more than $ 50 billion in assets and hedge funds with more than $ 10 billion in assets will be hit with the new levy upon enactment and lasting until 2020 .
When Computex kicks off next week , do n't expect to see any devices running Chrome OS .
Computex , held every year in Taipei , Taiwan , is one of the largest trade shows for PC makers , and you 'd think Google 's upcoming OS for netbooks would be a star attraction this year .
But Google is still racing to finish the operating system , and consumers are n't likely to see the first Chrome OS devices until late fall .
Chrome OS will also be seen only in netbooks , at least at first , since the company is n't encouraging Chrome OS for tablets .
Instead it is steering tablet makers toward Android , the first of which will be the Dell Streak that launches in the U.K. next month .
" For Chrome , we are targeting the netbook form factor , " a Google representative told Wired.com .
" The timeline for the first products is towards the end of the year . "
Google introduced Chrome OS in November as a lightweight , browser - based operating system that would boot up in seven seconds or less .
The company said at the time that the first Chrome OS netbooks would be available in the " second half of 2010 . "
Google is working with major netbook makers such as Acer , which is hoping to ship a million Chrome OS netbooks this year .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said Chrome OS netbooks will cost between $ 300 and $ 400 , coming in line with devices running Microsoft ’s Windows operating system .
Earlier this month , a report suggested Acer could show its Chrome OS netbook as early as June , but Acer has denied it .
" We have no short - term plans for such as product at Computex , " said an Acer statement on the company 's website .
" Given Google 's emphasis on Android at its developer conference , it is unlikely that we are going to see much if any Chrome activity at Computex , " said Michael Gartenberg , partner at research and consulting firm The Altimeter Group .
" Chrome is probably not ready for prime time . "
If Google does n't move forward fast enough , it may lose ground to Microsoft 's Windows operating system , particularly among tablets .
While they have n't abandoned their Android plans , MSI and Asus both recently announced Windows 7 - powered tablets .
Chrome is visibly a work in progress .
At its I / O developer conference last week , Google announced a web - based app store that will feature free and paid apps .
The app store will be a big step forward to making Chrome an attractive OS , according to Michael Cherry , vice - president of research for operating systems at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft .
" The missing piece so far has been apps and with the web - app store announcement Google is a step closer to the finish line , " said Cherry .
Apps are important for Chrome because Google has pitched it as a Linux - based , open source operating system centered on Google ’s Chrome browser .
Applications will run exclusively inside the browser .
Having easy access to those apps will be the key to the success of Chrome .
The newly announced Chrome web store would do just that .
When Google Chrome users install a web application from the store , a shortcut to quickly access the program .
Meanwhile , Google has to do a fine balancing act between Chrome and Android .
Chrome OS has been largely designed for netbooks and larger clamshell devices , while Android is aimed at smartphones .
Tablets fall somewhere in the middle , potentially causing confusion about which OS is best suited to the form factor .
For its part , Google has been telling partners to adopt the fast - growing Android for mobile devices and reserve Chrome for netbooks and laptops : machines that can actually deliver on the thin client promise .
" Chrome is an open source project so anyone can take the code on any sort of device without telling us , " says the Google spokesman .
" But we think Chrome and Android are two different approaches . "
Google would n't comment on if it will ever merge Chrome and Android .
For now , Android is racing ahead , says Gartenberg .
" Android has the resources and momentum , and it is run by Andy Rubin and his team , " Gartenberg says .
" Chrome appears to have fewer resources and no clear leader , at least from the outsider 's perception .
In the near term , Google ’s efforts are going to be Android - based . "

War — beyond good and evil Canadian Arab News
May 13 , 2010
On the subject of war , Germany does n’t exactly fare well in our culture .
In fact , anti-German sentiment is integral to our shared past and our sense of ourselves .
Every culture needs a mythic self - image to sell to its people and future generations , and our modern world defines itself by the defeat of Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler .
We associate the Germany of these men with war , injustice , destruction and cruelty .
We , the Allies who defeated them , see ourselves as the epitome of peace , justice , progress and human rights .
Each image is , of course , grossly simplistic and self - serving .
Great Britain , France and Russia — “ the good guys ” — were equally to blame for the escalating tensions that led to the outbreak of war in 1914 .
Had it not been for the greed , vindictiveness and stupidity of the future “ Allies , ” including the U.S. , during the interwar period , Hitler would likely never have come to power .
A complete , uncensored treatment of the 20th century would find plenty of blame to go around .
Such candour would go along way toward disabusing ourselves of the myth of Western democratic moral superiority , and negative German stereotypes , since there is much we can learn from the Germans about war ...
The odds of such an enlightenment happening any time soon , though , are remote since our cultural mythology requires us to pay homage to the anachronistic symbols and quasi-religious trappings of The Great Victory over “ evil . ”
The recent V–E Day commemorations in Moscow are such an example .
Nevertheless , such an enlightenment is urgently needed , because the stereotyping of Germany does more than nurture false memory syndrome ; it has fostered an irrational belief that peace can be an instrument of policy , as well it has bred a dangerous disrespect for war .
Because of its association with Hitler and the Kaiser , calculated national war has been reduced to something “ evil ” that only bad countries commit .
Yet war is not evil , and to pretend that it is forecloses any attempt to wage it properly or defend against an enemy .
Thus it is that the “ non-evil ” Western armies are committing torture and other atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq , and losing wars they do n’t know how to fight .
It was the great 19th - century general and strategist Carl von Clausewitz , who gave us the most valuable definition of war , most commonly , but superficially , translated as : “ War is the continuation of politics
by other means ”
The full quote from Book VIII of Vom Kriege ( On War ) is much more powerful : “ The only source of war is politics — the intercourse of governments and peoples ; but it is apt to be assumed that war suspends that intercourse and replaces it by a wholly different condition , ruled by no law but its own .
We maintain , on the contrary , that war is simply a continuation of political intercourse , with the addition of other means …
War in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different .
In essentials , that intercourse continues irrespective of the means it employs . ”
To this I ’ll add this quote from Book II : “ War is not an exercise of the will directed at inanimate matter …
In war , the will is directed at an animate object that reacts . ”
For Clausewitz , war had rules and served a national political purpose .
The logic and candour of this principle is lost on us modern democrats , who have anathematized the idea of war as an active instrument of politics .
All acts of national violence are now justified in the name of national defence , which means the decision to go to war — and I ’ll use that term loosely for the time being — is purely reactive , devoid of any rational political calculations .
“ The only source of war is politics — the intercourse of governments and peoples ; but it is apt to be assumed that war suspends that intercourse and replaces it by a wholly different condition , ruled by no law but its own .
We maintain , on the contrary , that war is simply a continuation of political intercourse , with the addition of other means .
… War in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entrely different .
In essentials , that intercourse continues irrespective of the means it employs . ”
— Carl von Clausewitz , Book VIII , On War , 1832 The U.S. and its coalition of the clueless are getting their asses kicked in Afghanistan for this reason .
The official story is that the U.S. bombed and invaded Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , World Trade Centre attack because the Taliban government would not surrender Osama bin Laden , whom the U.S. blamed for the attack despite having no evidence whatsoever .
The truth is that bin Laden was , and is , irrelevant .
The U.S. wanted to overthrow the Afghan government solely because it would not let a U.S. - led consortium lay a pipeline across the country .
The attack was an act of intimidation not defence .
Well , it succeeded in changing the government , but nine years on , the U.S. - led imperial invasion force is still there .
Now were told it ’s there to rebuild Afghanistan , fight the Taliban and “ bring democracy ” to the Afghan people .
Since when is that the job of an army ?!
None of these reasons resembles an army , much less an enemy , that can be defeated .
We are rebuilding a country that we destroyed ; the Taliban is only an economic enemy ; and exporting democracy is a noxious euphemism for subjugation .
We have no army to fight , and no defensible political objectives to attain .
There is no war !
Yet the killing , torture , destruction and abject stupidity continue , contrary to the national interest .
Nevertheless , the press and our governments continue to go to great lengths to present the operation as necessary for peace .
If we compare our farrago in Afghanistan to the 19th - century military expansionism of Germany — Prussia , really — I see little reason to object to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck ’s limited wars of aggression against Denmark ( 1863 ) , Austria ( 1866 ) and France ( 1870 ) to expand and consolidate Prussian power .
Our fetish with peace also inhibits our ability to recognize mistakes .
Once we wrap ourselves in the mantle of noblesse oblige , it becomes difficult to leave without tremendous loss of face .
At this point , war degenerates into an exercise in public relations fueled by delusions and sentimentality .
On April 3 , a group of relatives of Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan , appealed to the federal government not to pull out in 2011 .
“ I do n’t want him to die in vain , ” said Myles Kennedy , whose son Pte.
Kevin Kennedy died in a Sunday 2007 roadside bombing .
“ We came in to do a job .
And our job will not be complete , if [ the government ] pulls out the whole group . ”
This bereaved father would have the government send other people 's children to die in Afghanistan just so he could feel better about losing his own son .
As selfish as that sounds , it comes close to capturing the self - defeating insanity of modern warfare .
In Vietnam , the U.S. lost a 15 - year war because its motives were entirely selfish .
As I wrote in my book The Host and the Parasite — How Israel ’s Fifth Column Consumed America : “ On Nov. 6 , 1961 , Asst. Secretary of Defense John T. McNaughton sent the following summary of U.S. war aims to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara : “ ( a ) 70 percent — To avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat ( to our reputation as a counter - subversion guarantor ) .
“ ( b ) 20 percent —
To keep [ South Vietnam ] ( and then adjacent territory ) from Chinese hands .
“ ( c ) 10 percent —
To permit the people of SVN to enjoy a better , freer way of life .
Also — to emerge from crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used .
Not to ‘ help a friend , ’ although it would be hard to stay out if asked .
“ When military force becomes its own justification … a self - destructive dynamic develops :
The longer an insurgency goes on , the greater grows the threat to the U.S. ’s ego ; the greater the insult , the more violent the retaliation ; the more violent the retaliation , the greater the insurgency ; the greater the insurgency , the greater the ego investment ; the greater the ego investment , the greater the insult ; and so on . ”
We have forgotten how to fight wars , because we no longer fight armies .
We kill civilians indiscriminately , and invent invisible enemies like “ terrorism ” to justify mass murder in the name of self - defence , which brings me back to the WTC bombing .
Alan Sabrosky , former director of Studies at the Army War College , has found conclusive proof that Israel was responsible for the attack : “ I have had long conversations over the past two weeks with contacts at the Army War College and at Headquarters Marine Corps , and I have made it absolutely clear in both cases that it is 100 % certain that 9/11 was a Mossad operation … period . ”
If we need a modern analog to Nazi Germany , we need look no further than Israel , which treats Palestinians at least as cruelly as Hitler ’s Reich treated Jews , only it does it with our acquiescence .
The dichotomies — Germany , war , evil ; Allies , peace , good — are all rubbish .
A premeditated , co-ordinated attack on Israel would be an entirely justified and justifiable war .

If there were ever any truth in the esoteric tales of Umberto Eco ’s bestselling novel Foucault ’s Pendulum , it seems that the key to that knowledge has been lost .
The original pendulum , which was used by French scientist Leon Foucault to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth and which forms an integral part of Eco ’s novel ’s labyrinthine plot , has been irreparably damaged in an accident in Paris .
The pendulum ’s cable snapped last month and its sphere crashed to the marble floor of the Musee des Arts et Metiers .
In 1851 , Foucault used the pendulum to perform a sensational demonstration in the Paris Pantheon , proving to Napoleon III and the Parisian elite that the Earth revolved around its axis .
Such was its success that the experiment was replicated throughout Europe .
Thierry Lalande , the museum ’s ancient scientific instruments curator , said that the pendulum ’s brass bob had been badly damaged in three places and could not be restored .
“ It ’s not a loss , because the pendulum is still there , but it ’s a failure because we were unable to protect it , ” he said .
The circumstances surrounding the accident have raised eyebrows in France .
The museum regularly hosts cocktail parties in the chapel that houses the pendulum , and Mr Lalande admitted that several alarming incidents had occurred over the past year .
In May 2009 , for example , a partygoer grabbed the 28kg instrument and swung it into a security barrier .
Amir D. Aczel , research Fellow in the history of science at Boston University , described the news of the accident as “ saddening ” .
“ It is certainly one of the most important historical instruments of all time .
It ’s a bit like hearing that one of the statues at the Vatican has been broken , ” he said .
Foucault ’s experiment involved releasing a pendulum and watching the Earth rotate under its oscillation frame .
Dr Aczel said that it brought “ closure for Galileo ” and led the Church to accept the rotation of the Earth .
William Tobin , a retired astronomy lecturer and biographer of Foucault , said that the accident was embarrassing for the museum , and a blow for academia .
Dr Tobin helped to identify the pendulum used by Foucault from among the other similar instruments held in the museum , and said that examining old instruments in the flesh “ tells you more about the development of science than the written record can ” .
However , Thibault Damour , professor of theoretical physics at the Paris Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques , said scholars would find comfort in the fact that the legacy of Foucault ’s experiment , which asked “ fundamental questions about the nature of space and time ” , lived on in “ Einstein ’s thought and in current experiments ” .
In particular , he pointed to a recent Nasa mission , Gravity Probe B , which verified Einstein ’s theory of relativity , which explains why the oscillation plane of the pendulum does not remain fixed in absolute space , as expected by Foucault , but is slowly dragged by the presence of the rotating Earth .
BALTIMORE , Maryland - Four Filipina ex-staffers of a Baltimore City hospital have n’t gotten over the shock of being summarily fired from their jobs , allegedly because they spoke Pilipino during their lunch break .
“ Hindi ko pa rin matanggap na the basis of the termination was the language , ” nurse Hachelle Natano told ABS - CBN News .
Corina Capunitan - Yap , Anna Rowena Rosales , Jazziel Granada and Natano were fired from their jobs at the Bon Secours Hospital last April 16 .
“ I feel I was harassed and discriminated against because of my national origin , ” Natano explained .
“ They claimed they heard us speaking in Pilipino and that is the only basis of the termination .
It was n’t because of my functions as a nurse .
There were no negative write - ups , no warning before the termination , ” she added .
Last November , Bon Secours imposed for the first time an English - only language policy in the Emergency Room , the nurses said .
Many hospitals , especially those with foreign medical staff , implement the rule in trauma facilities because it ’s critical everyone understand each other as they respond to life - and - death situations .
They were asked to sign the hospital ’s “ Emergency Department Expectations ” that set the length of their lunch and snack breaks ; lays down when they can take a rest ; and directs that English should be the only language spoken while the nurses are on ER duty .
Granada was surprised when she too got the boot .
“ I was shocked .
I ’m not even a nurse .
I ’m a secretary so I ’m not involved with patient care .
It came as a big shock and I was asking myself , why I was included , ” she told ABS - CBN News .
Lawyer Arnedo Valera of the Virginia - based Migrant Heritage Commission has filed a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) .
The nurses , he pointed out , were “ arbitrarily terminated from work without due process , ” and the English - only rule violated their basic rights .
Fired because of bagoong ?
This is not the first time hospital workers have been fired or disciplined for speaking in a language other than English .
In 2005 , the EEOC led a federal law suit against the Highland Hospital in Rochester , New York on behalf of five Hispanic housekeepers .
They were sanctioned after they were overheard saying “ hasta la vista ” or goodbye as they were leaving work .
The EEOC said the English - only rule was unlawful and violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , which prohibits job discrimination based on a person ’s race , sex or national origin .
Valera believes the English - only rule at Bon Secours Hospital was too broad and so lacking in clear guidelines to be fairly and legally implemented .
“ If you speak just a single Tagalog word and someone hears you , that can be grounds for termination which is what happened to our nurses , ” he explained .
“ All it takes is just one word .
That can be a greeting , a remark or even the name of a Filipino dish .
Based on this rule , you could say ‘ bagoong ’ ( a fermented fish sauce ) and lose your job , ” Valera said .
Granada , still in the dark what Pilipino word she uttered to get the pink slip , speculates it might have been because she called a Filipino doctor in the hospital “ Kuya ” – a word of respect akin to the English " Sir . "
The Filipinas ’ plight has been aggravated , they say , by the hospital ’s inability to show any documentation of when the alleged violations took place .
Their dismissal was so abrupt it took several days for the termination papers to catch up with them .
Nurses ' rights
Valera said this incident goes deeper into the problems Filipino and other foreign nurses face in US hospitals .
" There is no business necessity , there is no rational justification or direct relationship between speaking in Pilipino to the performance of their job , ” he said .
Lured by higher pay and wider opportunities for advancement , Filipino professionals – doctors , nurses , engineers – have flocked to the US for the past 50 years .
The Philippines , India and Nigeria are the top suppliers of nurses in the US .
In the 1980s , nearly half of all foreign nurses entering the US were Filipinos .
“ America is supposed to be land of the free but in our case we were terminated because we spoke in our native language , " Rosales said .
“ It is so unfair for Filipino nurses .
I am making an appeal to nurses ’ associations that with this incident we should let them know that no patient is harmed when we speak in our native language , ” she declared .
Have we as a society grown so irrational and psychotic that we have to be reminded that there is a boundary between the reality outside our heads and the fantasies within ?
Are we in danger of drifting into a stupefied slumber where the figments of our dreams can claim the rights that we have previously reserved for concrete entities ?
The characters of fiction , written down as literature , drawn as manga or anime , expressed in the multitude of means technology has granted to us , lack independent agency .
By hijacking our mind 's ability to empathize and reason about other minds they create the cognitive illusion that they exist .
However we must remember that without sentience , without true moral agency , these mental phantasms whose pseudo - existence is purely within the mind of their hosts can make no ethical claims to the concrete world outside .
I can imagine the vilest of crimes within my head without harming a single creature of ethical consequence .
I can commit fictional atrocities whose magnitude and horror eclipse the worst tyrant 's genocide but still act and be in every way a moral , ethical contributor to society .
This fact should be obvious to every sane adult , indeed learning to distinguish between the imaginary and the real is one of the prerequisites for being an adult .
I should not need to devote three paragraphs of text to hammering this point but unfortunately I feel I must .
People have been charged , prosecuted and punished for this style of thought crime .
If such actions were mistakes of a more censorious past one could look back with the knowledge of lessons learned .
However not only are real people being prosecuted for crimes against fake people in the present , laws are being passed to make it easier to prosecute this in the future .
Everybody in New York has an opinion about what makes Yankees fans different from Mets fans .
So do we .
The only difference is that we 've got 445 pages of data to back it up .
To better understand the personal lives and psyches of New York sports fans , The Wall Street Journal tapped the polling firm Public Opinion Strategies to conduct a survey of 650 male and female fans across all five boroughs .
In the coming weeks , we 'll share the results in an occasional series we 're calling The Grand Fanalysis .
Today 's installment will attempt to answer one of the city 's most hotly debated sports questions :
What really separates men who root for the Yankees from men who prefer the Mets ?
Unsurprisingly , the Yankees are more popular : Sixty percent of the survey 's baseball fans said they followed the Bronx Bombers , compared to just 33 % who favored the Mets .
The Mets have more fans in Queens , of course , and the Yankees have an edge in the Bronx , but Manhattan is dead even at 19 % each .
It has been a slow blogging week for me .
I have been far busier than I thought completing my project – which I will be happy to tell you all about once I have the green light to promote it .
Meanwhile , here is an excellent article by Trine Tsouderos regarding OSR # 1 , which is an oral chelator being used by some to treat their kids with autism .
The marketing of OSR # 1 represents many of the problems that I and others have been blogging about for years .
OSR #1 was originally developed as a chelating agent to be used in industry – not for medical use .
It binds to heavy metals , like mercury , and therefore those in the anti-vaccine community who still cling to the discredited notion that autism is a form of mercury toxicity believe it can be used to treat autism .
Boyd Haley , a retired chemist , and apparently innocent of any actual medical training , has been selling OSR # 1 online as a treatment for autism .
Using a powerful industrial chelator to treat a disease like autism certainly sounds like it should qualify as a drug – and therefore should fall under the purview of the FDA – and the FDA agrees .
That is why the FDA is now going after Haley , and it seems that their investigation was triggered by a previous report written by Trine about unproven Autism therapies .
But Haley tried to pull a fast one , taking his lead from the supplement industry .
He actually attempted to market OSR # 1 as a dietary supplement .
Trine reports :
In the interview last year , Haley called the product “ a food ” that is “ totally without toxicity . ”
Haley said the compound had been tested on rats , and a food safety study was conducted on 10 people .
Asked to provide documentation of the research , he stopped communicating with the Tribune .
Meanwhile , Haley ’s own limited testing in animals showed that the drug can cause serious side effects , like hair loss and pancreatic damage – clearly not without toxicity .
The game Haley is playing is not fundamentally different than the one that many supplement marketers play , and are allowed to play by the lax regulations in this country and many others .
They sell drugs clearly intended for their pharmacological actions as if they were supplements so that they do not require any evidence of safety or effectiveness .
Haley ’s problem is that his drug , OSR # 1 , is blatantly not a nutritional supplement and is being used to treat a disease – an FDA no - no .
Even still it took an expose in a major newspaper to get the FDA ’s attention .
So far they have sent a letter of warning to Haley and have threatened action , but have not yet taken any direct action .
Hopefully they will soon – nothing short of shutting down Haley entirely would be appropriate .
In fact ,
It certainly seems to me that Haley is attempting to practice medicine without a license .
There was a time in this country when that meant something .
As you might expect , the Age of Autism and the anti-vaccine movement in general have embraced Haley .
Even though he is giving a toxic drug without proper testing to children , he is a hero in their eyes simply because he is backing up their unscientific beliefs about mercury .
That ’s all it takes , apparently – believe their pseudoscience and you are a hero , doubt it and you are a baby - eater .
It ’s such a stark black and white world they live in .

Orange Line regulars know the shrill blare of her voice only too well , the scream that demands people back away from the doors NOW .
For unlike other subway workers , who first tell people to stop holding a door fairly calmly before escalating into DefCon 4 mode , she is the permanently irritated throbbing nerve of every station between Forest Hills and Oak Grove .
Desiree Headley reports a new , even more severe edge to her this morning :
Nothing makes my commute more enjoyable than listening to an MBTA employee curse over the intercom .
Love it !
She screams : " Attention passengers do not hold the door ! ...
What the f**k ?? ? "
One wonders how long we have to wait before she rips open the door to her compartment , finds the evil door - holder , puts him in a headlock and begins whaling away at him .
Ergonomic pitchfork
This broadfork is what I use anytime I have a garden bed to prepare and want to loosen up the soil and add amendments before planting .
Tillers are unwieldy , destroy soil structure and vital organisms and are generally unsuitable for raised beds .
A standard pitch fork is fine but an ergonomic nightmare if you have a large area to work .
The best solution I have found is the broadfork .
It uses your body weight and two long handles for leverage and loosens a large swath .
I bought the Johnny ’s 520 Broadfork from Johnny ’s Seeds as it was large enough for my needs , although there are various sizes available .
I use it regularly and the amount of soil it can turn with a modicum of effort is remarkable .
I started using it this year and think that any serious vegetable gardener looking to avoid the roto - tiller would welcome this in the shed .

HIV - positive Indians have been campaigning for better healthcare Some 90 % of gay men in the Asia - Pacific region are denied access to HIV / Aids help because of discriminatory laws in many states , a UN - backed report says .
Almost half the region 's countries criminalise gay male sex and the report says this is worsening a situation in which infection rates are climbing .
Repressive laws " often take on the force of vigilantism " , it argues .
Governments were urged to reform legal systems and policing to ensure an effective response to the crisis .
The report , produced jointly by the UN Development Programme and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health , noted that several countries including Nepal , India , the Philippines and South Korea had brought in new laws and policies to address the problem .
" However , these are exceptional developments and action is required to improve the legal environment in all countries , " it added .
' Condoms seized '
The report said the high - risk group , which includes homosexuals and bisexuals , can potentially account for between 10 and 30 % of new HIV infections in a typical Asian country .
Nineteen out of 48 countries in the region criminalised male - to - male sex and these laws often led to abuse and human rights violations , it said .
Punishments for sex between men ranged from the death penalty in Afghanistan and north - west Pakistan to whipping in Malaysia and Indonesia 's Aceh region , the report found .
Even if punishments were not enforced , they provided the basis for extortion , harassment and violence , it said .
Police enforced public order and prostitution laws selectively against gay men in some countries , the report went on .
In Sri Lanka and the Philippines , for example , vagrancy laws were used in this way , the report said .
Another abuse reported in countries such as Thailand and India was the confiscation of condoms as evidence of illegality .
In China and Singapore , the report found , HIV education materials were censored .
" The effectiveness of the HIV response will depend not just on the sustained scale up of HIV prevention , treatment and care , but on whether the legal and social environment support or hinder programmes for those who are most vulnerable , " the UNDP 's Mandeep Dhaliwal said in a statement .

The mayor of New York has visited London to take notes on how the Tube 's CCTV network is used to fight crime and counter terrorism .
Michael Bloomberg met London Mayor Boris Johnson to view the surveillance system at Westminster Tube station .
It is believed he is considering increasing the use of surveillance cameras in Manhattan following a failed car bomb attack on 2 May .
There are currently 12,000 cameras on the London Underground network .
Mayor Bloomberg said : " I am here to learn from others , see what works best and try to fix things before they become a problem . "
We are never complacent , and there are always painful reminders that we must never let down our guard
London mayor Boris Johnson CCTV has played a prominent role in the battle against terrorist threats in London over recent years .
During the investigations into terrorist attacks on 7 July and 21 July 2005 , London Underground provided the police with more than 18,000 tapes and 300 hard drives .
Boris Johnson has said he now intends to raise the number of cameras on the Tube network by more than 2,000 over the next few years .
' Crime reduction '
Should these plans go ahead , everybody who enters the Underground network will have their face recorded .
The London mayor said : " We are never complacent , and there are always painful reminders that we must never let down our guard , but it is clear that the approach we are taking - with sustained investment in policing and CCTV - is helping us make significant strides along the road of tackling crime in our city . "
British Transport Police Deputy Chief Paul Crowther and Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy were also there to welcome Mr Bloomberg .
Mr Crowther said : " Crime is down on the Tube which shows that people are even safer when they travel .
CCTV cameras across the network are critical to achieve this year - on - year crime reduction . "
Figures released by British Transport Police suggest crime on the Tube and DLR network fell by 4 % over the past year .

Scientists at the University of Liverpool have discovered that male topi antelopes deceive their female counterparts in order to increase their chances of mating .
The study of topi antelopes in Kenya 's Masai Mara National Reserve Park found that male antelopes snort and look intently ahead if an ovulating female begins to stray from their territory .
This type of behaviour suggests to the female that there is predator danger ahead .
Typical predators of the topi include lions , cheetahs , leopards and humans .
When scientists examined the behaviour closely they discovered that the male antelope 's snort and intent look were a false call made to keep the female in his vicinity and there was no danger nearby .
Rather than risk any danger of a predator the female stays within the male antelope 's territory , which increases his chances of mating with her .
This type of intentional deception of a sexual partner has not been documented before in animals .
Previous studies have shown that animals do deceive each other but mainly in hostile situations or to protect themselves .
For example , the plover bird feigns injury in a -- `broken wing display '- in order to stop a predator finding their nest ; certain bird species use false alarm calls to distract competitors away from food sources ; male vervet monkeys use false alarms to dissolve conflicts between groups , and chimpanzees make false alarm calls to fool rivals and thereby gain access to mates .
The research , carried out by carried out by Dr Jakob Bro-Jorgensen at the University of Liverpool and Wiline Pangle at Michigan State University , studied the topi antelope over a four year period .
Dr Bro-Jorgensen said : " Our study showed that males quite frequently pull this trick on the females in heat and one might ask why females keep responding to alarms at all .
The answer seems to be that females are better off erring on the side of caution , because failing to react to a true alarm could easily mean death in a place like the Masai Mara where it is full of predators . "
" This study reveals a new weapon used by animals in the battle of the sexes : whilst it is well known that males sometimes use their superior strength to force unwilling females , it is a new discovery that they may also actively falsify signals to get their own way . "

An impressively large number of politicians , opinion makers , scholars , bureaucrats , and ordinary people hold that terrorism -- and al Qaeda in particular -- poses an existential threat to the United States .
This alarming characterization , which was commonly employed by members of the George W. Bush administration , has also been used by some Obama advisers , including the counterterrorism specialist Bruce Riedel .
Some officials , such as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff , have parsed the concept further , declaring the struggle against terrorism to be a " significant existential " one .
Over the last several decades , academics , policymakers , and regulators worldwide have developed risk - assessment techniques to evaluate hazards to human life , such as pesticide use , pollution , and nuclear power plants .
In the process , they have reached a substantial consensus about which risks are acceptable and which are unacceptable .
When these techniques are applied to terrorism , it becomes clear that terrorism is far from an existential threat .
Instead , it presents an acceptable risk , one so low that spending to further reduce its likelihood or consequences is scarcely justified .
An unacceptable risk is often called de manifestis , meaning of obvious or evident concern -- a risk so high that no " reasonable person " would deem it acceptable .
A widely cited de manifestis risk assessment comes from a 1980 United States Supreme Court decision regarding workers ' risk from inhaling gasoline vapors .
It concluded that an annual fatality risk -- the chance per year that a worker would die of inhalation -- of 1 in 40,000 is unacceptable .
This is in line with standard practice in the regulatory world .
Typically , risks considered unacceptable are those found likely to kill more than 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 100,000 per year .
At the other end of the spectrum are risks that are considered acceptable , and there is a fair degree of agreement about that area of risk as well .
For example , after extensive research and public consultation , the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided in 1986 that the fatality risk posed by accidents at nuclear power plants should not exceed 1 in 2 million per year and 1 in 500,000 per year from nuclear power plant operations .
The governments of Australia , Japan , and the United Kingdom have come up with similar numbers for assessing hazards .
So did a review of 132 U.S. federal government regulatory decisions dealing with public exposure to environmental carcinogens , which found that regulatory action always occurred if the individual annual fatality risk exceeded 1 in 700,000 .
Impressively , the study found a great deal of consistency among a wide range of federal agencies about what is considered an acceptable level of risk .
There is a general agreement about risk , then , in the established regulatory practices of several developed countries : risks are deemed unacceptable if the annual fatality risk is higher than 1 in 10,000 or perhaps higher than 1 in 100,000 and acceptable if the figure is lower than 1 in 1 million or 1 in 2 million .
Between these two ranges is an area in which risk might be considered " tolerable . "
These established considerations are designed to provide a viable , if somewhat rough , guideline for public policy .
In all cases , measures and regulations intended to reduce risk must satisfy essential cost - benefit considerations .
Clearly , hazards that fall in the unacceptable range should command the most attention and resources .
Those in the tolerable range may also warrant consideration -- but since they are less urgent , they should be combated with relatively inexpensive measures .
Those hazards in the acceptable range are of little , or even negligible , concern , so precautions to reduce their risks even further would scarcely be worth pursuing unless they are remarkably inexpensive .
If the U.S. Department of Homeland Security wants to apply a risk - based approach to decision - making , as it frequently claims it does , these risk - acceptance criteria seem to be most appropriate .
To this end , the table below lists the annual fatality risks for a wide variety of these dangers , including terrorism .
As can be seen , annual terrorism fatality risks , particularly for areas outside of war zones , are less than one in one million and therefore generally lie within the range regulators deem safe or acceptable , requiring no further regulations , particularly those likely to be expensive .
They are similar to the risks of using home appliances ( 200 deaths per year in the United States ) or of commercial aviation ( 103 deaths per year ) .
Compared with dying at the hands of a terrorist , Americans are twice as likely to perish in a natural disaster and nearly a thousand times more likely to be killed in some type of accident .
The same general conclusion holds when the full damage inflicted by terrorists -- not only the loss of life but direct and indirect economic costs -- is aggregated .
As a hazard , terrorism , at least outside of war zones , does not inflict enough damage to justify substantially increasing expenditures to deal with it .
Because they are so blatantly intentional , deaths resulting from terrorism do , of course , arouse special emotions .
And they often have wide political ramifications , as citizens demand that politicians " do something . "
Many people therefore consider them more significant and more painful to endure than deaths by other causes .
But quite a few dangers , particularly ones concerning pollution and nuclear power plants , also stir considerable political and emotional feelings , and these have been taken into account by regulators when devising their assessments of risk acceptability .
Moreover , the table also includes another kind of hazard that arouses strong emotions and is intentional -- homicide -- and its frequency generally registers , unlike terrorism , in the unacceptable category .
In order to deal with the emotional and political aspects of terrorism , a study recently conducted for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security suggested that lives lost to terrorism should be considered twice as valued as those lost to other hazards .
That is , $ 1 billion spent on saving one hundred deaths from terrorism might be considered equivalent to $ 1 billion spent on saving two hundred deaths from other dangers .
But even with that generous ( and perhaps morally questionable ) bias , or even with still more generous ones , counterterrorism expenditures fail a standard cost - benefit assessment .
Politicians and bureaucrats do , of course , face considerable political pressure to deal with terrorism , but that does not relieve them of their responsibility to expend public funds wisely .
If they feel they cannot do so , they should resign or forthrightly admit that they are being irresponsible -- or they should have refused to take the job in the first place .
Moreover , although political pressures may force unwise actions and expenditures , they usually do not dictate the precise amount of money spent .
The United Kingdom , which seems to face a considerably greater internal threat from terrorism than the United States , nonetheless spends only half as much per capita on homeland security -- at no notable cost to the tenure of its politicians and bureaucrats .
And certainly nothing relieves politicians and bureaucrats of their responsibility to inform the public about the risk that terrorism actually presents .
But just about the only official who has ever openly tried to do so is New York 's Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who , in 2007 , remarked that people have a greater chance of being hit by lightning than being struck by terrorism -- an observation that , as the table suggests , is a bit off the mark but roughly sound .
Bloomberg , it might be noted , is still in office .
To border on becoming unacceptable by established risk conventions -- that is , to reach an annual fatality risk of 1 in 100,000 -- the number of fatalities from terrorist attacks in the United States and Canada would have to increase 35 - fold ; in Great Britain ( excluding Northern Ireland ) , more than 50 - fold ; and in Australia , more than 70 - fold .
For the United States , this would mean experiencing attacks on the scale of 9/11 at least once a year , or 18 Oklahoma City bombings every year .
For this to come about , terrorists would probably have to acquire nuclear weapons , the likelihood of which is highly questionable .
If that fear is deemed viable , however , the policy implications would be to spend entirely , or almost entirely , on dealing with that limited concern .
Massive expenditures to protect " critical infrastructure , " for example , are unlikely to be effective against a nuclear explosion .
In fact , there is little evidence that terrorists are becoming any more destructive , particularly in the West .
Some analysts have found that , if anything , terrorist activity is diminishing , at least outside of war zones .
As a hazard to human life in the United States , or in virtually any country outside of a war zone , terrorism under present conditions presents a threat that is hardly existential .
Applying widely accepted criteria established after much research by regulators and decision - makers , the risks from terrorism are low enough to be deemed acceptable .
Overall , vastly more lives could have been saved if counterterrorism funds had instead been spent on combating hazards that present unacceptable risks .
This elemental observation is unlikely to change anything , however .
The cumulative increased cost of counterterrorism for the United States alone since 9/11 -- the federal , state , local , and private expenditures as well as the opportunity costs ( but not the expenditures on the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan ) -- is approaching $ 1 trillion .
However dubious and wasteful , this enterprise has been internalized , becoming , in Washington parlance , a " self - licking ice cream cone , " and it will likely last as long as terrorism does .
Since terrorism , like crime , can never be fully expunged , the United States seems to be in for a long and expensive siege .
UPDATE ( April 12 , 2010 ) : A number of readers
take issue with the conclusions we draw from the data on terrorism .
Our article
seeks to establish that terrorism " under present conditions " hardly
represents an existential threat to the United States , a characterization that
is still being applied .
Therefore , spending to " further reduce " terrorism's
likelihood or consequences is scarcely justified .
However , our conclusions can also be used to question past spending .
Those who
think that counterterrorism measures are the reason for the low terrorism risk
need to demonstrate that such efforts have deterred , derailed , or disrupted
attacks that would otherwise have resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000
people in the United States every year .
Only in that case would terrorism begin
to present a risk deemed " unacceptable " by conventional standards .
But even if all the ( mostly embryonic ) terrorist plots exposed since 9/11 had
been successfully carried out , their likely consequences would have been far less
severe .
Indeed , both before and after 2001 , the total number of people killed
by terrorists outside ( and sometimes within ) war zones generally registers far
below that number .
Also relevant : the United Kingdom seems to be about as
secure from terrorism as the United States while spending proportionately half
as much on its counterterrorism efforts .
NZICT ( who ’s NZICT ? ) reports that they convinced the politician in charge of the Patents Bill , Hon Simon Power , to do a u-turn and open the floodgates for software patents .
The report was posted on a patent lawyer ’s blog , then deleted , but copies have been mirrored :
More details below .
People in NZ will have to work on this to prevent a catastrophe .
Here ’s a quote from the deleted blog entry :
Hon Simon Power has asked MED to work with the Parliamentary Counsel ’s Office to redraft the section along the lines of the European Patent Convention .
[… ] it was very pleasing to have a positive indication that the Government recognises there is a need to amend section 15 ( 3A ) to make sure it ’s consistent with the intent of adopting European practice .
The current plan is to bring in wording similar to the European Patent Convention .
The outcome of this wording in Europe is that the EPO grants software patents such as :
This lobbying from NZICT is particularly strange when a survey at NZCS found 80 % of its membership against software patents .

CHILD - free social groups are springing up as a growing number of people choose not be parents .
Casey Pilcher , a truck driver from Newlyn in central Victoria , established meet - up group Childfree Victoria in March in the hope of meeting like - minded couples and singletons .
" I do n't feel any paternal instinct , " he said .
" I 'd rather be doing my own thing or be in a couple , having my own experiences . "
He hoped Childfree Victoria would experience the same success as Brisbane Childfree , which has attracted nearly 300 members since its inception in September 2007 .
" I 'm doing it for me , but I 'm also doing it to help others in the same situation because I know how they feel , " he said .
" It 's especially the case for singles , but couples also have the same problem - none of their friends and families have the time to socialise with them any more because they all have children . "
The group held its first event - dinner in St Kilda - several weeks ago .
Susan Moore and her husband David founded Child - Free Zone - a national group for people who choose not to be parents - after the couple grew tired of people asking them when they were going to have children .
" Having children is something that I 've never wanted to do , " she said .
" It was never on the list for me as something that I wanted to do and I 've never really changed my mind on that . "
While Child - Free Zone does n't classify itself as a political lobby group , Ms Moore said many of its members felt marginalised by the Federal Government 's focus on families .
" Much of the discussion that 's been going on this week has been around the whole working families cliche and how left out it leaves people who do n't fit into Kevin Rudd 's definition of what it is , " she said .
About one in five Australian women will never have children , up from one in 10 in the early 1970s , according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data cited on Child - Free Zone 's website .
Timothy Cannon , spokesman for the Australian Family Association , said the group had no objection to the child - free movement provided it did n't demonise parents .
" If people make the choice not to have children that 's fine , but they should still recognise that having children is a necessary part for human communities continuing to exist , " he said .

Les Terran
Les terrans sont de relativement nouveaux arrivants dans le secteur Koprulu .
Ils sont les descendants d’une désastreuse expédition de colonisation qui fut envoyée de la Terre il y a des siècles , un chargement humain composé de dissidents et de protestataires que le gouvernement jugeait superflus .
Les survivants de l’expédition établirent trois colonies qui devinrent les bases des trois grandes puissances de l’espace terran : la Confédération , le Combinat Kel - Morian et le Protectorat Umojan .
Le gouvernement corrompu de la Confédération fut renversé par le terroriste révolutionnaire Arcturus Mengsk pendant la période de chaos causée par l’invasion zerg .
De nos jours , le Dominion terran est la puissance dominante surgie des cendres de la Confédération , et son dirigeant n’est autre que l’empereur Arcturus Ier .
Contraints de s’adapter aux conditions difficiles des mondes généralement sans vie du secteur , les terrans sont des maîtres en matière de survie .
Dépourvues de la technologie avancée des protoss ou les capacités innées des zergs , les troupes terranes misent sur la variété de leurs unités .
De l’infanterie simple mais efficace comme les marines au cuirassé lourdement armé , les unités terranes comptent sur une armure solide , une abondante puissance de feu et la force du nombre pour tenir leurs positions .
Les terrans excellent dans les situations défensives où brillent leurs bunkers et leurs chars de siège .
Les Protoss
Avec leur technologie avancée et leurs puissantes capacités psioniques , les protoss se considéraient comme l’espèce dominante de la galaxie .
La guerre contre les zergs leur a prouvé le contraire : même le meilleur guerrier ne peut triompher contre la force du nombre poussée à de tels extrêmes .
Ce fut une dure leçon pour les protoss , dont la société était bâtie sur des principes philosophiques suivis de façon très stricte depuis plus d’un millier d’années .
L’invasion zerg sur le monde d’Aïur , berceau des protoss , les força à se remettre en question : ils devaient accepter le changement pour espérer survivre et l’emporter .
De nos jours , de nouvelles tactiques et technologies sont développées pour le combat de plus en plus désespéré contre les zergs , et des armes anciennes et terribles que les protoss avaient écartées depuis longtemps reviennent se déchaîner sur les champs de bataille .
N’ayant jamais été un peuple prolifique , les protoss ont traditionnellement étoffé leurs rangs avec des machines de guerre robotisées .
Individuellement , nul ne peut surpasser la compétence d’un guerrier protoss , grandement améliorée par une combinaison de technologie et de puissance psychique .
Les protoss doivent cependant jouer sur la mobilité et la surprise pour optimiser cet avantage et éviter de se laisser entraîner dans une guerre d’usure .
L’une de leurs plus grandes forces est leur flotte , qui peut s’enorgueillir d’une variété de vaisseaux assez puissants pour atomiser un ennemi .
Les Zerg
En tant que race , les Zergs sont complètement différents des Terrans ou des Protoss .
Ils sont composés d’un grand nombre d’espèces intégrées à l’Essaim grâce à l’infestation zerg .
Ces créatures subissent ensuite une évolution rapide et sélective pour devenir de redoutables machines à tuer capable de contribuer à l’impératif de domination des Zergs , qui est aussi instinctif qu’absolu .
Les Zergs n’utilisent aucune technologie pour fabriquer leurs armes , armures ou vaisseaux .
Ces fonctions sont efficacement remplies par les adaptations biologiques et les mutations programmées des différentes souches zergs .
Même les bâtiments zergs sont en fait des organes spécialisés de l’organisme vivant et croissant qu’est un nid zerg .
Lorsque les Zergs sont arrivés dans le secteur Koprulu , ils étaient unis par leur obéissance absolue envers la conscience collective appelée le Maître - esprit .
Par l’intermédiaire d’une hiérarchie de consciences inférieures , le Maître - esprit contrôlait les faits et gestes de chacune des créatures de l’essaim .
Le premier échelon , et le plus important , était constitué par les cérébrats , qui disposaient chacun d’un contrôle total sur un large segment de l’essaim .
Les ordres des cérébrats étaient ensuite répercutés par les seigneurs , qui transmettaient des ordres précis à l’ensemble des créatures dans leurs nids ou sur les champs de bataille .
Même si le Maître - esprit était principalement poussé par son désir de consommer et d’assimiler l’espèce protoss , il sut trouver dans l’humanité un matériau brut mais utile .
S’étant emparé de Sarah Kerrigan , une humaine douée de puissantes capacités psioniques , le Maître - esprit la fit évoluer pour en faire une créature nouvelle et unique : la reine des lames .
Lors de la destruction du Maître - esprit par les Protoss pendant l’invasion d’Aïur , la reine des lames parvint à manipuler les templiers noirs pour qu’ils éliminent les cérébrats survivants .
Depuis lors , c’est elle qui domine l’Essaim .

For Democrats , Rand Paul is going to be the gift who keeps on giving .
Forget about pinning down the newly minted Republican nominee for Kentucky ’s open US Senate seat on the question of whether he thinks applying civil rights laws to businesses amounts to “ too much government . ”
Just imagine the opportunities for asking GOP leaders — and candidates around the country — whether they happen to agree with their party ’s candidate in one of the hottest Senate races of the year .
Ad Policy
Of course , Paul will try to make it easier on his fellow partisans .
He ’s done his best to backtrack from his most controversial statements , saying he ’s not in favor of repealing civil rights laws .
But once you have to “ unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , ” the damage is pretty much done .
And this wo n’t be the last controversy of this kind .
The fact is that , when Paul has gotten into hot water , on this issue and a host of others , it has not been a mistake .
He ’s introducing Americans to libertarianism — not as a political slogan but as an ideology whose followers take very seriously the work of downsizing government .
So seriously that they would even get rid of the good parts .
Of course , liberals and conservatives differ on how to define “ the good parts . ”
But the thing is that liberals and conservatives — for all their disagreements — really do think there are good parts .
For instance , they pretty much agree that it is appropriate to impose basic civil rights mandates on business .
Serious libertarians do n’t .
For them , government is , at best , a necessary evil — with the emphasis on the “ evil . ”
Rand Paul has repeatedly given interviews , not just in the distant past but recently , in which he has expressed discomfort with civil rights mandates — not just with regards to protections for minority groups but also for people with disabilities .
The Louisville Courier - Journal editorial board refused to back him in the Kentucky primary because it said Paul “ holds an unacceptable view ” on civil rights .
The point here is not to suggest that Paul is a serious racist .
He says he is not and that he “ abhors ” discrimination of any kind .
The point is that he is serious libertarian .
When Paul allowed as how he might have a problem with the critical components of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — in a terrific interview by MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow — it suddenly started to dawn on Democrats and Republicans that a relatively genuine libertarian had been nominated by one of the major parties for a major position .
The thing about libertarianism is that it is an ideology that both Democrats and Republicans like to borrow from — liberals like the live - and - let live approach to social policy , conservatives like all the talk about deregulation and downsizing government .
It is only when the whole package gets pulled together that things get hairy .
And Rand Paul really is his father Ron ’s son — which means that he is very serious about economic libertarianism , pretty serious about maintaining a classic libertarian non-interventionist foreign policy and pretty shaky when it comes to social libertarianism ( especially when it comes to reproductive rights ) .
In other words , like Ron Paul , Rand Paul is a grab - bag libertarian who offers everyone something to like and something to decry .
Just as progressives delighted in Ron Paul ’s anti-imperialist diatribes in the Republican presidential debates of 2007 — especially when the Texas congressman ’s discussion of Chalmers Johnson ’s theory of blowback made Rudy Giuliani blow up — there have always been plenty of diehard conservatives who perked up when the elder Paul proposed shutting down whole sectors of the federal government .
But just as oil and water do not go together very well , it is not always easy to mix Noam Chomsky –quoting foes of empire with Milton Friedman–quoting foes of public education .
So the libertarian movement has always remained small .
There really are true believers in the ideology , and the Pauls ( father and son ) come pretty close — so close , in fact , that the father left the GOP in 1988 to seek the presidency as the nominee of the Libertarian Party .
Ron ’s message that year was as critical of Republicans as it was of Democrats , with the formerly Republican congressman declaring that “ big government is running away with our freedom and our money , and the Republicans are just as much to blame as the Democrats . ”
Of GOP icon Ronald Reagan , the elder Paul said : “ Ronald Reagan has given us a deficit ten times greater than what we had with the Democrats .
It did n’t take more than a month after 1981 , to realize there would be no changes . ”
Ron Paul was right , as he was when he told a convention of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws that the war on drugs was a failure .
And who could argue with the Libertarian Party platform proposal to included the removal of all US nuclear weapons from Europe .
But Paul ’s preaching about the need to return to the gold standard got a bit arcane .
And Rand Paul got arcane with his dad ; serving as the elder Paul ’s chief campaign aide and frequent spokesperson and representative .
The campaign did not go very far , however .
Ron Paul won only 431,750 votes — for a little less than 0.47 percent of the vote .
( In Sarah Palin ’s Alaska , the Libertarians took over 2 percent that year , but that was the high - water mark . )
The disappointing 1988 result was about as good as its gotten for Libertarians in the past quarter century .
And the Pauls recognized pretty quickly that , if they wanted to actually win elections , they would probably have to do so as Republicans .
Ron Paul scrambled back into the GOP fold quickly , supporting Pat Buchanan ’s Republican presidential bid in 1992 and getting re-elected to Congress — over the objections of the party leadership — in 1996 .
In Congress , Ron Paul has served as a caucus of one , regularly casting solo votes against legislation that the rest of the House backs .
He ’s not always alone .
But he is frequently at odds with the Republican caucus and sometimes more in sync with the most left - wing Democrats than with the most right - wing Republicans — but only sometimes .
Rand Paul has made a point in this campaign year of suggesting that he differs with his dad on some key issues ; but the fact is that the younger Paul ’s Senate run was managed and funded by many backers of the father .
They are dedicated , true - believer libertarians who have accepted , as the Paul ’s have , that there is more room to maneuver in the Republican Party than on the third - party fringe .
The problem , of course , is that there is a reason why the Libertarian Party has remained on the fringe .
Yes , it has suffered as a result of the same unfair ballot - access laws and debate designs that have afflicted other third parties .
But it also entertains ideas that that are outside the mainstream .
The libertarian ideology may have its day .
But that day has not yet come .
For now , serious libertarians are ideological outliers — committed to their views and sincere in their approach but outliers all the same .
And when an outlier enters the mainstream , fireworks ensue .
That ’s the bottom line with regard to Rand Paul :
Try as he may to steer toward the center , that ’s not where his heart or head is .
And , as a result , he will keep saying things that send shock waves through the political mainstream .
That may be a good thing , in that it forces deeper and broader debates .
But it is going to cause a lot of headaches for Rand Paul and his adopted Republican Party .

Me , in email with a friend last night about the Louisiana oil spill :
I can’t wait until Rush figures out how this is all actually Obama ’s fault .
Honest to God , I did n’t know he ’d said this a few hours earlier :
I want to get back to the timing of the blowing up , the explosion out there in the Gulf of Mexico of this oil rig … .
Now , lest we forget , ladies and gentlemen , the carbon tax bill , cap and trade that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day .
I remember that .
And then it was postponed for a couple of days later after Earth Day , and then of course immigration has now moved in front of it .
But this bill , the cap - and - trade bill , was strongly criticized by hardcore environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment .
So , since they ’re sending SWAT teams down there , folks , since they ’re sending SWAT teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants , than by blowing up a rig ?
I ’m just noting the timing here .
Plus there ’s this , from the friend I was emailing with : “ Maybe not Obama , but the WSJ snuck it in their story yesterday : you know , if the environmentalists did n’t make us drill so deep , so far out from shore , this would n’t have happened . ”
I have n’t seen that story , but I would n’t be surprised if this meme picks up steam in the days to come .
Despite the presence of Moses and the 10 Commandments in the structure of the US Supreme Court and other national buildings , the presence of " In God We Trust " on our currency , or the cross in the L.A.

Fabio Capello is thinking about playing with three central defenders during the World Cup , BBC Sport understands .
The England boss is considering a move to 3 - 5 - 2 from 4 - 4 - 2 if Manchester City 's Gareth Barry is forced out of the tournament by his ankle injury .
Capello has never played with three at the back since taking charge of the national squad in 2008 .
England played a similar system under Steve McClaren in 2006 , when they went down 2 - 0 away to Croatia .
" England 's World Cup starts four weeks on Saturday and there is a chance they could start with three central defenders against the USA in Rustenburg [ on 12 June ] , " reported BBC Radio 5 live 's Ian Dennis .
606 : DEBATE
To my way of thinking you need to select your preferred system and the players best suited to deliver it
billyall " Capello has never played such a system with wing - backs in his time as manager , but I understand he will consider a change in formation if Barry does n't recover from his injury .
" Capello spoke of his plans to members of England 's ' 66 World Cup - winning side , who were inducted into football 's Hall of Fame on Thursday .
" England played with three at the back during the ill - fated Euro 2008 qualifiers , but at least Capello has weeks rather than days to work on the system , which worked well during Italia ' 90 . "
A switch in formation would be a major change for the Italian , who has demonstrated his preference for 4 - 4 - 2 throughout his coaching career .
Four years ago England 's deployment of a 3 - 5 - 2 formation ended disastrously against Croatia .

Eduardo headed Croatia ahead in Zagreb , then Paul Robinson 's air - kick after the ball bobbled on an uneven surface resulted in an own - goal for Gary Neville , with the Croats going on to win 2 - 0 .
Capello sprang some surprises in his provisional 30 - man squad for South Africa on Wednesday , calling up Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher who retired from international duty in 2007 .
Fellow central defenders Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King have both proved vulnerable to injury in recent years , while some critics have suggested former England captain John Terry has not been always been at his best this season .
Barry played in eight of England 's 10 World Cup qualifiers , and has won 20 of his 36 international caps under Capello .
The midfielder was named in the provisional squad and will have a fitness check on 24 May .
Manchester City said on 7
May that his ankle injury would rule him out for four weeks .

The problem of sex information and instruction
Sex education in the United States and other European countries as well as in some Asian countries does not meet any opposition from the government or any sector of society .
This is because it is considered necessary in controlling overpopulation as well as preventing the spread of sexual disease .
In the Philippines , however , sex education in elementary and high school levels has been scrapped by the government because it has met opposition from the Catholic Church ’s stand in its pro-life campaign .
The Church frowns at the artificial birth control methods which the government promotes , such as the use of pills , IUD , condom and many others .
The only method allowed by the Church is the natural method and abstinence .
The church teaches that human sexuality is a gift from God , a part of His creation that he saw as being very good when he created man and women in his image and likeness .
And like Him , man is called to love and to self - giving in the unity of body and spirit .
And seen in the very mystery of creation , sexuality is not only the source of fruitfulness and procreation but includes the capacity of expressing love .
From this context , the Church teaches that the home should be the first school of sexuality where the parents are the teachers of the children .
Through the sacrament of matrimony , the parents are given the grace to carry out the mission of teaching the children that man is called to live in truth and love and everyone finds fulfillment through the sincere gift of self .
Parents should be the perfect models for their children through which they can win their children ’s confidence and thus talk openly about sensitive issues like human sexuality especially its sanctity .
They must teach them good values such as self - respect and purity , respect for others and love .
In this respect , the Church is correct in its teachings .
But it can not be denied that many of Filipino parents are not true to their faith and many of them are negligent in educating their children of the right values .
Does this mean that the school has the right to usurp parents ’ rights to educate their children about human sexuality ?
Can it be said that school teachers are better qualified to teach about sex ?
The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines ( CBCP ) still opposed the DepED ’s proposed program to introduce the artificial birth control methods to the students .
Instead of teaching the young people to respect sex , the Church argues that it might lead them to abuse sex because they will not think about unwanted pregnancies anymore .
In some European countries , elementary and high school students are provided by the government with birth control kits containing pills and condoms .
Thus at the early age , these children engage in sex without fear .
But they also have not developed respect and appreciation of human sexuality .
The government fails to teach them the basic value that sex is a God - given gift .
Thus , they do it without love and respect .
For them it is just an instinctive act just like that of the animals .
Who , then , is the better person to teach our children of sexuality ?
Maybe this issue must be given first priority by the government , the Church and the family .
It is about time that everybody must put their heads together and agree on a better idea on how to do it .

You imagine the thought process for a John Galliano show going something like , “ Let ’s do Charlie Chaplin and Luchino Visconti on the sands of the Lido ! ”
The references are usually groaners  and it does n’t much matter since the results come out the same .
Still , this time , Mr. Galliano ’s mix of undersize jackets and oversize pants  low in the crotch and at the waist and held up with suspenders  made a sharp impression .
BUT men are having a hard time , as Hanna Rosin observed in an article in the current issue of The Atlantic , its tag line , “ How women are taking control  of everything . ”
Men are wimping out , in the example of Judd Apatow ’s chronic adolescent characters , or being mowed down by Beyoncé and Lady Gaga .

You sensed a little of this problem at the shows , and it was not a pretty sight .
Stefano Pilati , the Saint Laurent designer , reverted to a drowsy Paul Bowles sexuality , with delicate young men in even more delicate - looking knits and high - waist shorts that rippled over skinny legs .
If you saw a guy with a little fez tipped over his brow , what would you think ?
How fast can he set up my chair by the pool ?
I wanted to like Riccardo Tisci ’s laces for the Givenchy man .
I really did .
There was something interesting about the mock Victorian elegance he seemed to be working , without the reliance on literal references .
And there ’s a footballer ’s bulk to his silhouette , which is at least a consistent point of view for him .
And I certainly have no gripe with his skirts , which are actually shorts with a flap in front .
Shorts that suggest skirts were a trend of the collections .
Rather , my problem with Mr. Tisci ’s clothes is that his process seems too heavy - handed , without enough perspective and finesse that might make the results just a little more real .
Buyers praised what Nickelson Wooster , the men ’s fashion director of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman , called “ the crisper , cleaned - up look ” of clothes , a shift from washed fabrics .
The amount of white in the collections  at Raf Simons , Hermès , Ann Demeulemeester  added to the fresher look .
Mr. Wooster also liked the trend of sleeveless jackets and tops ; it was a big theme at Lanvin , Dior , Rick Owens and Mr. Simons , who opened with a sleeveless scubalike jacket zipped over full white cotton trousers .
In 2008 , we created a website called Photobomb.net .
Hundreds of people submitted photobombed photos for our consideration .
Most of them were crap , but plenty of them made us laugh out loud .
So , we published the best ones on the site .
In 2015 , we shut down the website , then we opened it again in 2018 .
It ’s now shut and wo n’t be opening again but we kept the best photobombs submitted by our readers .
Here they are .
We hope you enjoy them .
Happy photobombing !
Where was law and order in the 2010 election ?
During the campaign , there were arguments about civil liberties , identity cards and immigration control .
But the election was the first in over 30 years in which law and order barely figured .
This is even more striking given that 2010 will go down as a political turning point .
In 1979 , the Conservative Party made law and order central to its drive for power , capturing significant numbers of core Labour voters .
In 1997 , New Labour reversed the trick , overtaking the Tories on the right and distancing itself from Old Labour 's law - challenging radicalism .
Most of New Labour 's effort went on the first half of its populist slogan " Tough on crime ; tough on the causes of crime " .
Perhaps 2010 will signal a welcome cooling of the law - and - order party - political arms race .
No serious analyst of law - and - order policies believes that either the welter of new legislation that has afflicted our criminal justice system or the locking up of increasing numbers of offenders has made us safer in our beds at night .
There is general agreement that the time has come to roll back our heavy use of criminal justice interventions and stop talking up the potency of criminal law to solve our social ills .
On 30 March , just over a month before polling day , Iain Duncan Smith argued in a speech at the Attlee Foundation in London that we could not " arrest our way out of our problems " .
At the same event , by contrast , Chris Grayling promised " robust policing " , but he was not heard
of for the rest of the campaign .
Grayling may not get it , but most politicians now do .
They privately agree with the Treasury that a grave
financial crisis should not go to waste .
The major cuts in public spending in the policy pipeline provide an opportunity for us to stop doing a few things we should never have done - chief among them criminalising and locking up so many children and young people , thereby grooming a new generation of long - term adult criminals from whose depredations we will all suffer .
The trend is clear .
Even though the volume of crimes , including those for which young people are responsible , has fallen since the mid-1990s , by 2007 there were more than twice as many children in custody as at the beginning of the 1990s .
The increase is not explained by a corresponding rise in serious crime by children .
Events such as the murder of James Bulger in February 1993 or the torture of two boys in Edlington , South Yorkshire , in April 2009 , are thankfully rare .
In that sense , Britain is no more broken today than it was 20 years ago .
Paying the price
Nor should we get hung up about offensive , antisocial behaviour committed by young people .
That may have got worse , but no one seriously believes that the problem is best solved by putting already disaffected and typically disadvantaged youths behind bars .
At roughly £ 100,000 a year , this costs more than three times as much as sending a child to Eton , and the outcome is not an enhanced prospect of becoming prime minister , but typically a lifelong relationship with the revolving door of Pentonville .
As the former Conservative home secretary David Waddington confessed , it is an expensive way of making bad people worse .
So , how to save taxpayers money and better protect us from being victimised ?
It is a good first step that the plan to build a 360 - bed young offender institution ( YOI ) outside Leicester has been scrapped .
The proposal was undesirable and unnecessary .
The youth custody population of England and Wales has fallen in the past two years from 3,000 to roughly 2,200 .
The surplus capacity this creates should allow the Youth Justice Board , which commissions custodial places for under - 18s , to avoid unsuitable establishments .
Indeed , it should be thinking about a completely different residential model .
The new government should now also do the following .
First , a new agency should be created , separate from the prison service , to manage all accommodation for young offenders - the local authority secure homes , the commercially run secure training centres and the YOIs .
This would make for coherent national planning , which is at present lacking .
This new agency should consider piloting a community - oriented institution along the lines of the proposed Young Offender Academy investigated over the past three years by a working party with the Foyer Federation , the support agency for youngsters making the transition to adulthood .
We must keep the secure homes for younger children provided by local authorities .
They are expensive , but they provide the sort of one - to - one care needed by children who have done dreadful things but are often both neglected and disturbed .
In addition , we must explore an alternative model to the big YOI , an outmoded tool that should have been consigned to the penal dustbin .
Most of the cost of youth custody should be transferred from central government to the local authorities from which the young people come .
This proposition has been pondered indecisively in Whitehall for several years .
It must now be done .
It would be the best way to give an incentive to the local authorities to invest in crime - preventive community programmes ( research shows that confidence in these programmes is critical in persuading sentencers to avoid the use of custody ) .
If this happened , a question mark would hang over the continued need for the Youth Justice Board .
The thousands of young people locked up each year spend , on average , 14 weeks in custody .
It is wrong that a high proportion of them are held far from home , and unsurprising that the overwhelming majority are reconvicted within 12 months of getting out .
Preventing youth crime involves determining responsibility and fixing consequences .
But it also involves promoting positive , law - abiding opportunities and working with families as well as individual offenders - not further dislocating already fragile relationships .
None of these processes is best achieved by transporting teenage offenders to large , distant , prison - like institutions .
Too much too soon
Finally , the conviction on 24 May of two boys aged ten and 11 on a charge of attempted rape of an eight - year - old girl should lead the government to reconsider the age of criminal responsibility .
It is not in the interests of any child , either victim or offender , or society at large , that children as young as this undergo adversarial criminal justice proceedings .
Such matters are , if necessary , better dealt with by the family courts and childcare proceedings .
Law - and - order services , which cost just under 6 per cent of overall public expenditure , are not going to be among the heaviest hit in the period 2011 - 2014 .
Policing , which claims the largest share of the pot , is too politically sensitive for that .
But things are nonetheless going to be tough for front - line practitioners .
There will be significant cuts .
This makes it imperative that we shift the centre of expenditure gravity from that which is totemic to something that has a prospect of working
Rod Morgan was chairman of the Youth Justice Board from 2004 - 2007
Crime and punishment
Levels of youth crime have decreased overall since the early 1990s .
However , during this time , there has been an increased use of custodial sentences for children and young people .
In 1999 , Home Office figures showed that while the level of detected youth crime had fallen by 16 per cent since 1992 , custodial sentencing had more than doubled .
Tony Blair 's establishment of the Youth Justice Board in 2000 continued this trend .
While the government was keen to trumpet the success of its reform , a report by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said that youth offending had barely changed , but more children had been criminalised or imprisoned .
It is a vicious cycle : the same report found that reoffending rates were highest among those who had had a custodial sentence .
Recent years have brought a sharp decline in youth crime : a 10.2 per cent drop between 2005 and 2008 .
However , this figure fails to take account of more than 19,000 children and young people issued with penalty notices for disorder or antisocial behaviour orders .
If such children were included , the 10.2 per cent drop would be nearly eliminated .
This points to a problem in the statistical analysis of youth crime , which is the changing definition of what constitutes a crime , and how harshly it is punished .
Crime levels may be unchanged , but criminalisation is rising .

Chicago ’s very own Students for Justice in Palestine ( SJP ) at DePaul University is making local headlines due to its event to raise awareness about the oppression of Palestinians within Israel ’s apartheid walls .
Today , Thursday , May 13 , DePaul ’s SJP is organizing and hosting a “ Die In ” to commemorate the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians evicted from their homes and forced to face the muzzle of Israeli guns since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 .
Sixty - two years later , SJP protests these injustices .
But the “ Die In ” has evoked a counterprotest by pro-Israeli communities both inside and outside of DePaul ’s campus .
While SJP continues to plan the logistics of this event , Hillels Around Chicago has just begun circulating a memo in an attempt to denounce the protest .
The full statement can be found at the bottom of the post .
A representative of Hillel kindly included her contact information in the memo so I took the liberty of calling her to gain a better understanding of Hillel ’s reasoning .
She literally echoed the exact words of Hillel ’s released statements .
There will be protestors pretending to be shot dead by Israeli soldiers in an effort to delegitimize the state of Israel .
According to her , Hillel felt the need to defend Israel from such biased and provocative pro-Palestinian sentiment .
I did n’t quite follow her logic .
How would a few actors delegitimize the state of Israel ?
The protestors are n’t in any way fabricating facts or exaggerating the reality of the situation .
Rather , these protestors are providing the public a realistic glimpse of life in the occupied Palestinian territories .
Whether Hillel wants to believe it or not , Israeli soldiers do shoot Palestinians .
These protestors are only mirroring the scenes that young Palestinian children wake up to .
If anything , Israel ’s wanton disregard of the livelihood of Palestinians is the direct cause of Israel ’s delegitimization .
Do n’t blame SJP for bringing to Chicago a reality check .
Hillel bases its response on this very basic phrase :
For many of you , this event may be offensive , upsetting or hurtful
Unfortunately , Hillel seems to have forgotten that Israel ’s oppression of the Palestinian people has caused even more grief .
Every single day , Palestinian sympathizers here and abroad are forced to cope with the never - ending news that more children have been illegally imprisoned without due process , that humanitarian aid has been blocked , and that live ammunition had just torn through a peaceful protest .
How is this “ Die In ” as “ offensive , upsetting or hurtful ” as Israel ’s apartheid measures against the Palestinian people ?
Israel ’s destruction of entire Palestinian villages is “ offensive ” .
The mass murder of entire families – mothers and children included – is “ upsetting ” .
The missiles fired at Palestinian hospitals and schools is “ hurtful ” .
Without a doubt , sixty - two years of illegal oppression causes more pain than a single , peaceful protest .
Hillel , you ’ve got it backwards .
This event serves as a unified moment of silence for all those who ’ve died under Israel ’s lack of humanity towards Palestinians .
DePaul ’s SJP is part of a global movement to commemorate the Nakba .
The lady on Hillel ’s hotline told me that the Nakba meant “ catastrophe ” .
Correct .
She also said that it was an Arab “ festivit[y ] ” to delegitimize and destroy Israel .
Wrong .
Israeli policy is doing that on its own .
The real catastrophe , however , is that 62 years ago , the creation of Israel led to the killing of thousands of Palestinians as well as the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands more .
Read the statement from Hillels Around Chicago after the jump .
Disturbing Anti-Israel Protest at DePaul Student Center Tomorrow
May 12 , 2010 Dear Members of the Greater DePaul Jewish Community ,
In light of the upcoming Palestinian “ Die - In ” protest tomorrow , it is critical that you be aware of the disturbing events scheduled to take place .
Thursday , May 13 , from 1 - 4 pm in the Lincoln Park Student Center at DePaul , there will be protestors pretending to be shot dead by Israeli soldiers in an effort to delegitimize the state of Israel .
For many of you , this event may be offensive , upsetting or hurtful as there will be inflammatory language and literature on display .
Please know that we are available to provide you with factual information about the history of and current situation in Israel .
As always , we at Hillel are a resource for you .
Please feel free to contact Nick Liebman at nliebman@depaul.edu or Michelle Maer at MichelleMaer@juf.org with any questions or concerns you may have .
If you experience intimidation on campus from this event or other events , please let us know .
We would also like to hear from you and to understand what your thoughts are .
The Hillel staff will be monitoring the event and available in the Hillel space ( 2250 N. Sheffield , Room 340 ) all day tomorrow , so please feel free to reach out to us .

Signaling its rise to IT - heavyweight status , Apple now reportedly joins the ranks of companies such as Microsoft and Intel to face federal investigations for abusing market dominance , reports the New York Times .
Specifically , Apple is the target of a Justice Department antitrust inquiry for abusing its dominance in the online music market -- as well as the target of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into Apple 's rules for developers of iPhone apps , according to report .

The Justice Department is investigating the allegation that Apple is improperly coercing music labels not to participate in Amazon.com 's " MP3 Daily Deal " program , through which the online merchant would have exclusive access to new music releases , according to The New York Times .
Apple is said to have punished the labels that participated in the program by refusing to market their songs on iTunes .
Meanwhile , the FTC 's investigation of Apple 's rules for developers of iPhone apps stems from a complaint put forth by Adobe , according to The Times .
The company has been involved in a public brouhaha with Apple over the latter 's refusal to support Flash on the iPhone .
Notably , this would not be the first time Apple has undergone federal scrutiny :
Thee Federal Communications Commission last August investigated Apple 's decision to drop Google Voice app from its iPhone App Store .
Apple and AT&T later reversed course and allowed the app to grace the iPhone .
Also , the FTC last year investigated the relationship between Apple 's and Google 's respective boards of directors to see if any overlaps constituted an antitrust violation .
The investigation resulted in Google CEO Eric Schmidt 's resignation from Apple 's board .

In its programme for government published today , the Conservative - Liberal Democrat Coalition has announced that it will ‘ work with faith groups to enable more faith schools ’ .
The BHA has expressed surprise and disappointment with this announcement .
Andrew Copson , BHA Chief Executive said , ‘ The Labour government was the first ever government to seek to increase the number and diversity of state - funded religious schools – a policy that was totally out of step with public opinion , social justice and sound educational principles .
It is astonishing that the coalition government should maintain one of Labour ’s most unpopular policies .
72 % of people believe that state funded schools should not discriminate on grounds of religion or belief and 64 % of people think that the Government should not be funding faith schools of any kind . ’
Humanists gave a cautious welcome , however , to the Coalition ’s pledge to ‘ facilitate inclusive admissions policies in as many [ faith ] schools as possible . ’
‘ If we are to continue to have faith schools within the state system ’ , Mr Copson continued , ‘ the least we can do to mitigate their divisive effects is to prevent those which discriminate in admissions from doing so .
If the government is serious about “ inclusiveness ” and a fair school system then it needs to rule out religious discrimination in admissions in all new schools and academies completely , and begin immediately to phase out discrimination in existing faith schools in the state sector . ’
In its more general education programme , the government has also announced that it will ensure ‘ all schools have greater freedom over the curriculum ’ .
Responding to this policy , Mr Copson said , ‘ In recent years the national curriculum has been reduced in size and restrictiveness to a great extent .
Many of us are now more concerned about what it leaves out – sex and relationships education , evolution , and a proper study of non-religious philosophies for a start .
We look forward to seeing what positive ideas the government has for curriculum development along these lines . ’
In conclusion , he said , ‘ One area where the law is a straightjacket on good educational practice is in still requiring all schools – decades after it became thoroughly objectionable in our plural society – to hold daily Christian acts of religious worship .
Freedom from this archaism would definitely be a freedom worth granting . ’

More on the BHA ’s work on faith schools .
Labour ’s policy increased the number and diversity of state - funded religious schools .
The current situation is that approximately a third of all state - funded schools are schools ‘ with a religious character . ’
In a YouGov / Accord poll of June 2009 :
57 % believed that state funded schools that selected students according to their religion harm community cohesion .
72 % agreed or strongly agreed that all schools should implement recruitment and employment policies that do not discriminate on grounds of religion or belief .
74 % held the view that all state schools should teach an objective and balanced syllabus for education about a wide range of religious and non-religious beliefs .
An ICM faith schools poll ( 2005 ) found 64 % of people agree that “ the government should not be funding faith schools of any kind ” .
The British Humanist Association ( BHA ) is the national charity representing the interests of the large and growing population of ethically concerned , non-religious people living in the UK .
Microsoft should add a basic PDF viewer to Windows to help protect users from the spike in attacks exploiting bugs in Adobe 's Reader , a security researcher said Friday .
" Apple does this with its Preview [ application ] , and Microsoft should , too , " said Sean Sullivan , a security advisor with Finnish antivirus vendor F - Secure 's North American operation .
" I just want to view and read PDFs .
I do n't want to listen to them or watch them or launch executables from them or run JavaScript , " Sullivan added , referring to several advanced features that Abobe 's own PDF viewer , the for - free Reader , supports .
Some of those features , including Reader 's support of JavaScript and the PDF specification 's support for the / Launch function , have been exploited by attackers in increasing numbers since 2008 .
According to tallies by antivirus vendor McAfee , PDF exploits were up more than eight times in 2009 compared to the year before , a trend that has continued into 2010 .
And the / Launch function , which allows PDF documents to run embedded executable files , is currently being exploited by attackers in a widespread malicious message campaign that tries to trick users into opening a rigged PDF .
Sullivan spelled out his case in more detail in a post to the F - Secure security blog on Thursday .
" Your customers are tired of the exploits and the complications that so many of today 's PDF readers include , " said Sullivan in a " Dear Microsoft " missive .
" They should write a really simplified viewer , one that just previews PDF , " Sullivan added Friday in a telephone interview .
" They do n't even need to build it into the operating system .
They can make it an optional download like they did the ' Save As PDF ' add - in for Office . "
Although Microsoft intended to add support for saving documents in the PDF file format to Office 2007 , it was forced to backtrack when Adobe balked .
Instead , Microsoft built a " Save as PDF " add - on that it made available free of charge .
After Adobe submitted the PDF / A specification to the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) in 2008 , Microsoft added " Save As PDF " support to its suite with the release of Office 2007 Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) a year ago .
The same feature is available in Office 2010 .
Office cannot open PDF documents without third - party software or add - ons , however .
Windows 7's and Windows Vista 's preview feature also wo n't display PDFs .
Instead , Microsoft has promoted , with little success , a substitute for PDF dubbed XPS ( XML Paper Specification ) ; an XPS viewer is bundled with Windows 7 , for example .
" The PDF specification has been completely royalty - free since 2006 , " said Sullivan , noting that Microsoft would not have to pay Adobe if it did craft a viewer of its own .
" There 's no reason why it can't create a native PDF viewer .
It could even let users toggle it on and off , if it [ were ] worried about antitrust [ issues ] . "
Several times , Sullivan compared his vision of a Windows PDF viewer to Preview , the application that Apple includes with Mac OS X . But Preview is not bug free :
In March , researcher Charlie Miller said he'd found more than 60 PDF files on the Web that could be used to crash and likely exploit Preview .
Even so , Sullivan argued that Microsoft , or failing that , Adobe itself , should develop a stripped - down PDF viewer that omitted the functionality and features hackers have exploited .
" I wish Adobe would create two different versions of Reader , one maybe ' Reader Lite ' that 's really just a viewer , " he said .

Every war novel must at some point confront a central contradiction .
Only the truth has any real value , but the truth about war is that it contains nearly unbearable levels of repetition , boredom and meaninglessness .
To write honestly about war , you should make readers feel they have endured those things as well .
Yet no sane novelist wants to inflict that much discomfort on the audience .
And so we read novels ( and watch movies ) filled with the kind of bravery and drama that make war look at least entertaining , if not admirable .
Many of those works are tremendous artistic achievements .
But they ’re not war .
Karl Marlantes ’s first novel , “ Matterhorn , ” is about a company of Marines who build , abandon and retake an outpost on a remote hilltop in Vietnam .
According to the publisher , Marlantes ­— a highly decorated Vietnam vet — spent 30 years writing this book .
It was originally 1,600 pages long ; now it is 600 .
Reading his account of the bloody folly surrounding the Matterhorn outpost , you get the feeling Marlantes is not overly worried about the attention span of his readers ; you get the feeling he was not desperate or impatient to be published .
Rather , he seems like a man whose life was radically altered by war , and who now wants to pass along the favor .
And with a desperate fury , he does .
Chapter after chapter , battle after battle , Marlantes pushes you through what may be one of the most profound and devastating novels ever to come out of Vietnam — or any war .
It ’s not a book so much as a deployment , and you will not return unaltered .
The story is told from the point of view of a young second lieutenant , Mellas , who joined the Marines for confused and vaguely patriotic reasons that are quickly left in tatters by military incompetence .
At great psychic and physical cost , Mellas and the rest of Bravo Company , Fifth Marine Division , climb a steep mountain near the intersection of Laos and the DMZ separating North and South Vietnam , then build an outpost capable of withstanding enemy artillery .
As soon as they finish , they are told to abandon it because they are needed for a large operation farther south .
There ensues a multiweek stagger through impenetrable jungle , the company plagued by lack of food , lack of ammunition and inadequate resupply .
One man is killed by a tiger .
Another dies of cerebral malaria .
Starving to death and bearing a dead friend on a pole , the men of Bravo Company finish their mission and are allowed a brief rest at one of the main support bases .

Soon enough , however , they are ordered to retake Matterhorn , which has since been occupied by the enemy .
It is there , on the flanks of their own outpost , that the horror and absurdity of war are finally played out .
“ After three hours of debate they finally realized that there was no perfect plan , ” Marlantes writes as the company plots its assault .
“ Somebody was going to get killed . ”
The battle scenes are vivid , devastating and vaguely repetitious — surprisingly , the only parts of the book where my mind started to wander .
But combat is not really what “ Matterhorn ” is about ; it is about war .
And in Marlantes ’s hands , war is a confusing and rich world where some men die heroically , others die because of bureaucratic stupidity , and a few are deliberately killed by platoon - mates bearing a grudge .
In one of the more remarkable passages of the book , Mellas contemplates the killing that goes on in nature and struggles with the question of whether it is evil :
“ No , the jungle was n’t evil .
It was indifferent .
So , too , was the world .
Evil , then , must be the negation of something man had added to the world .
Ultimately , it was caring about something that made the world liable to evil .
Caring .
And then the caring gets torn asunder .
Everybody dies , but not everybody cares .
It occurred to Mellas that he could create the possibility of good or evil through caring .
He could nullify the indifferent world .
But in so doing he opened himself up to the pain of watching it get blown away . ”

Keeping space debris in check has become a national mission for the US .
The White House yesterday announced plans to share more information with other countries in a bid to prevent satellite collisions .
The US will also fund research into cleaning up the space junk that ’s already there .
Each new US president issues a list of priorities and positions related to outer space .
Many elements , such as support for space exploration , tend to stay constant from one administration to the next .

However , Barack Obama ’s National Space Policy includes new language on space debris , calling for the US government ’s orbital tracking information and collision predictions to be shared with industry and other countries – a move that some have long sought .
Pooling information with other countries should help reduce the chances of another satellite collision like one in February last year that produced thousands of pieces of high - speed debris .
The more the better
“ The more data the better , as long as it ’s good quality and you can understand it , ” says Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Previous space policies have dealt with preventing space debris , but the Obama administration also calls for research into technologies that could remove space debris already in orbit , such as laser tractor beams .
However it is best to prevent the generation of space debris in the first place , says Eugene Stansbery of NASA ’s Orbital Debris Program Office in Houston , Texas .
“ It will always be cheaper and easier to prevent debris rather than remove it after the fact . ”
Jerusalem ( CNN ) --
The Israeli government said Thursday it will stop a convoy of cargo and passenger ships filled with supplies and headed to Gaza to break a blockade imposed by Israel in 2007 .
Government officials said Wednesday they have given the Israeli Defense Forces instructions to reroute the flotilla to Ashdod port in Israel , where the supplies will be unloaded and transferred to Gaza .
Mark Regev , an Israeli government spokesman , called the flotilla " a cheap political stunt . "
" If they were really interested in the well being of the people of Gaza , they would have accepted the offers of Egypt or Israel to transfer humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza , along with the other 15 thousand tons sent every week , " he said .
The convoy , which left various European ports , is organized by two major groups : the Free Gaza movement , a pro-Palestinian human rights organization , and the IHH movement , a Turkish humanitarian relief foundation affiliated with the Islamic Brotherhood .
Organizers said the convoy is carrying 10,000 tons of construction material , medical equipment and school supplies , and about 750 activists of different nationalities .
Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said Yossi Gal , its director - general , has summoned the ambassadors of Turkey , Greece , Cyprus , Sweden and Ireland -- the countries from which the flotilla set sail -- and " clarified the state of Israel 's official position , which declares the flotilla an absolute provocation :
There is no shortage of humanitarian aid to Gaza , as food products , fuel and supplies are constantly transferred into the Gaza Strip by the international organizations . "
The flotilla is " invited to dock at Ashdod port , to unload their cargo and transfer it to Gaza , after a security check , either via the Israeli authorities or via the humanitarian organizations , " the ministry said .
Hanin Zoabi , a member of Israel 's parliament , the Knesset , and a passenger on the flotilla , called it a " humanitarian campaign for the 1.5 million Palestinian people who Israel put in jail for about the last four years without allowing building material , without educational material , without food into the Gaza strip .
" Israel destroyed 165 schools and more than 100 ( factories ) and destroyed tens of thousands of houses without enabling the Palestinians to rebuild their homes and their lives , " Zoabi said .
" This is a very strong political message towards Israel and towards the Arab world that stood silent regarding what is happening in Gaza . "
Israel imposed the naval blockade on Gaza after the Hamas forcefully took control of Gaza in 2007 , ousting the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Regev argued that the activists maintain a double standard when it comes to Hamas ' actions .
" They call themselves human rights activists , but they remain silent when it comes to Hamas ' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians and the brutalities of the Hamas regime in Gaza , which has crushed political opposition , suppressed independent media and has locked up hundreds of political opponents . "
Sarah Weiss Maudi , an Israeli Foreign Ministry legal expert , said , " The naval blockade has been imposed by Israel because Israel is currently in a state of armed conflict with the Hamas regime that controls Gaza . "
Under international maritime law , when a maritime blockade is in effect , no vessels can enter the blockaded area .
Maritime blockades are a legitimate measure under international law , and may be implemented as part of an armed conflict at sea , Israeli officials have said .
" The objective of the boats is to break Israel 's siege on Gaza , to break Israel 's blockade on Gaza .
The material that we have on board are all of the materials that Israel denied to the people of Gaza like cement , building supplies , educational supplies etc , " said Greta Berlin , co-founder of Free Gaza movement .
" We do not accept the siege on Gaza , " said Zoabi . " ... Israel does not want a siege .
It wants a silent siege .
Israel does not want occupation , it wants a silent occupation .
It wants its policies to go without criticisms of the world .
That 's why it wants to stop the flotilla and also avoid coverage of the event , " she said .
" ...
This is an important aim of Israel , is to stop the cameras in order for the participants who are participating in this flotilla and the others who are following it not to see the aggression of the Israeli army , but I think this does not threaten us and it does not bring fear among us , " she said .
Noam Shalit , father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , told CNN he offered through his lawyer to attempt to convince the Israeli government to let the flotilla arrive in Gaza if participants would pass aid , including letters and medicine , to his son .
The organizers of the convoy , including Berlin , refused , he said , telling him their main purpose is to break the siege .
Gilad Shalit has been held captive since June 2006 , when Palestinian militants from Gaza captured him .
Noam Shalit says his son has been kept in total isolation for the past four years , a violation of international conventions and against international law .
There have been eight naval convoys to Gaza until now , and Israel has allowed three to dock at the Gaza port .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that since January 2009 , more than a million tons of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Israel .
The most efficient system to transfer goods to Gaza is through the land crossings , Palmor said .
Asked if he was concerned about being arrested , Zoabi told CNN , " I am not worried because I am not doing anything against the law .
What I do is according to human rights , according to international values and according to universal values , so it is not against the law .
" I am ( a ) Knesset member , and this is part of my political responsibility , " she said .
" It is part of my human responsibility .
This is not against the law to aid people , to help and support ( those ) who are under siege ...
I think the side that is breaking the law , international law , and breaking the human values is Israel and not anyone else . "
CNN 's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report .
‘ BRING A CHICKEN TO THE DOCTOR ’….
Sue Lowden ( R ) , the leading Republican Senate candidate in Nevada , recently articulated her vision of how the American health care system should work .
At a local candidate forum , Lowden , a former state senator and chair of the Nevada Republican Party , encouraged Nevadans to “ go ahead and barter with your doctor . ”
It would , she insisted , “ get get prices down in a hurry . ”
I assumed that Lowden misspoke , and meant to say “ bargain , ” not “ barter , ” though the notion of bargaining with medical professionals is itself foolish .
But she could n’t have meant “ barter , ” since that ’s ridiculous .
I stand corrected .
Lowden appeared on a Nevada news program earlier this week , and doubled down on her notion of a more effective system .
“ I ’m telling you that this works , ” the Republican candidate explained .
“ You know , before we all started having health care , in the olden days , our grandparents , they would bring a chicken to the doctor .
They would say , ‘ I ’ll paint your house . ’
I mean , that ’s the old days of what people would do to get health care with your doctors .
Doctors are very sympathetic people .
I ’m not backing down from that system . ”
This is one of the dumbest things I ’ve ever heard from a candidate for statewide office .
If there was n’t a video , I might not even believe it .
According to nearly every recent poll , Lowden is the clear favorite to defeat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D ) in November , but that was before she started talking about trading livestock for medical care .
It ’s a permanent credibility - killer .
It ’s one thing to be a confused , far - right candidate .
It ’s another to be a laughingstock .
Remember , the health care debate lasted a very long time .
Lowden , who has been running for the Senate for nearly as long , has had plenty of time to carefully craft her message on health care policy .
This is what she ’s come up with .
Better yet , after becoming the subject of ridicule last week , Lowden had a chance to clarify this into a position that ’s less preposterous .
Instead , she made it worse .
I ’m trying to imagine how Lowden thinks this should work .
Treating a mundane ailment — say , a sore throat — can cost a chicken .
But how , exactly , does she imagine families pay for more serious treatments ?
What should Nevadans expect to bring to the doctor in exchange for an MRI exam ?
Or an emergency appendectomy ?
Or chemotherapy ?
Should the senior citizen who just had hip - replacement surgery offer to start painting the doctor ’s house ?
If Dems are smart , they ’ll start taking this national — ask every Republican candidate in the country whether they agree with Sue Lowden ’s “ bring a chicken to the doctor ” health care plan .
Your probably saying to yourself , “ This Brian guy should have went to third grade math class instead of sniffing glue . ”
Well I ’m not talking about just numbers here .
I ’m talking about the equity of decisionmaking .
In my first business , we had two parnters and one employee later on .
We had two main decision - makers , myself and my partner .
Usually everything operated smoothly because we saw eye to eye on a lot of things .
Every once in a while , we had a divergence and the stand still was enormous .
We would spend days discussing and researching and then finally go in a direction .
Often times , the other person would have to be pulled along causing a drag from the dead weight .
When the projects or direction would come to a close , we would discuss the mistakes and / or what we would do differently .
In a lot of ways , this represents the standstill that we see in our government .
With two factions constantly fighting each other , nothing really gets done .
Instead , it ’s a heated standstill .
If one side gets their way , the other side will sabotage it .
If our government were a business , it would be a massive failure .
Let me restate that , when our government pokes its head into businesses , it churns out massive failures .
Now look at China .
There we have a fluid government .
One acting head that decides the countries direction .
Is there a chance of corruption ?
Yes .
But it ’s not like we ’re avoiding it here .
The Chinese have the truest form of capitalism and their ecomony is flourishing for it .
However , the Chinese do n’t have inalienable rights .
There is no freedom of press and therefore , there is no freedom to exchange ideas .
This stifles their growth .
Here ’s an idea , come up with a bill of rights , elect a leader , and then do what that leader says .
I know , I know , it ’s crazy .
In a large institution , any dramatic shift in resources could set the country back years .
However , that same shift could set the country forwards as well .
With the former , at least you executed on a problem and could highlight the mistakes .
With the latter , you did something right and can build on that in the future .
Either way , you DID SOMETHING .
In a large institution , like a nation ’s government , this might not be applicable .
But in a small business , it is definitely applicable .
Let me lay out three imaginary businesses that are in competition .
Each business makes Widget X ; however , they are all structured differently :
1 ) Company A has one CEO who ultimately decides the fate of the company .
That CEO hears out the other people on his team and makes a decision based on their input .
The decision is final and the team is loyal because the CEO hired according to this structure .
2 ) Company B has two partners at the top that decide the fate of the company .
The two partners will hear out their team ’s ideas and then make a decision .
The decision is final and the team is loyal to the partners because they hired accordingly .
3 ) Company C has three partners at the top .
etc. etc .
In a bet , I would take Company A every time in terms of success .
Why ?
Because they are the most agile .
They can pivot on a dime and the decisions do n’t cost them crazy amounts of time or angst .
If Company A is going to make a mistake , they will make it fast and then go in the right direction .
The other two Business ’s have to hash it out .
Too many egos at the top .
They ca n’t be agile because each has the best idea in the way the company could go .
And here ’s the catch : they ’re probably all correct !
The problem is , they will never reach full execution because each hard decision made can leave another member dissatisfied and contemptuous .
I look to my favorite three companies 37 Signals , Wine Library TV , and Zappos .
At the top sit Jason Fried , Gary V. , and Tony H .
These guys all have final say and guide their company in whatever direction they deem necessary .
Their workers are loyal and based on their track records , they should be .
I learned this the hard way with my previous business where I had one equal partner .
Standstills happened and nothing got done .
If something did go in a certain direction , and was n’t a great success , there was resentment .
Now I own that business free and clear and the only hard part about making any decisions is not being able to execute them fast enough .
In a way , the mental worries are free because there are no heated debates .
If I ’m going to learn , I ’m going to learn right away and the waters are n’t muddied because a partner was n’t motivated to execute .
Now there ’s a fourth type of company .
Company D has equal distribution of leadership and realizes that business is a Marriage .
Sometimes , you have to give in to get going .
If the company leaders are aware of their situation and attuned to the process , they will ultimately defeat Business A because they will have a larger pool of ideas to create and pivot from .
So if you ’re just starting , know which type of company you want to be .
If you have partners , make sure they are attuned to the “ Marriage ” attitude .
Each leader may have their different strategy to get to point B from point A .
What do you think ?
Will Company
A rule all or does it depend more on company culture ( company D ) ?

As Chair of the House Rules Committee it was my responsibility to ensure that these bills received the fair hearing an up or down votes they deserved .
On Saturday the Rules Committee met for over 9 hours of debate and considered well over 100 amendments .
All of this debate was televised and archived online .
This extended debate continued the commitment to transparency of the House committees , who held hundreds of hours of hearings to hear from 181 witnesses and consider 239 amendments during the last year and a half .
The next day I opened debate on the floor at 4:06 p.m.
Six and a half hours of debate later the House voted to pass the Senate health care bill and send it to President Obama for his signature .
We then proceeded to pass our reconciliation bill , improving upon the Senate bill in many ways .
Americans across the country watched us debate this bill and watched the votes happen .
And of course , last month there was the historic White House health care summit .
There ’s simply no way someone can complain that there was not a sincere and real effort to reach out to the other side to include their ideas in this package
When you compare this process to the one used by Republicans under President Bush - whether it was to pass the PATRIOT Act or to create Medicare Part D – the difference is striking .
Despite months of vitriol from the right , culminating in protesters hurling epithets at members of Congress and even spitting on them , we proceeded with an open process of debate and up or down votes .
Throughout the process , and despite Republicans commitment to kill this bill rather than engage in a constructive manner , we still considered their amendments fairly and incorporated the ideas that had value .
This weekend was historic , and I am proud to have played a part in it .
There is much work still to do but let us take this moment to celebrate what we have already accomplished :
10 million of the most struggling Americans will be covered by Medicaid
We will provide subsidies to help working class Americans afford their insurance
Americans with preexisting conditions will immediately have access to insurance through a high risk pool
Insurers will be required to spend at least 85 % of premiums on care
Reform will reduce the federal deficit by $ 1.3 trillion over the next twenty years
There will be tax credits this year to help small businesses give their employees health insurance
Health care reform will end denial of coverage because of preexisting conditions , first for children and later for all adults
We will prohibit lifetime caps on benefits
Insurance companies will be unable to drop you from your coverage because you get sick
Medicare will see multiple improvements :
We will immediately begin closing the Medicare donut hole
We will immediately remove copays for preventative care
We require Medicare Advantage plans to spend at least 85 % of premiums on care
We extended the solvency of Medicare by many years
This is a proud day and all of you helped to make it happen .
There ’s something about the first couple days of heat that always gets to me .
Even though summer has n’t officially begun , it ’s been unseasonably hot here in Missouri .
After sweating all day on the farm , I come home feeling worn out and dehydrated .
The one thing that really helps me adjust to summer temperatures is coconut water .
Coconut water – not to be confused with coconut milk – is the juice from young , green coconuts .
It ’s higher in electrolytes than artificial sports drinks and has more potassium than a banana , making it the perfect beverage for summer .
[ social_buttons ]
In addition to being a natural sports drink , coconut water is fat - free , low in calories , and super delicious .
It ’s flavor is sweet - salty , slightly tart , and decidedly coconut-y .
You can find coconut water at Whole Foods , health food stores , Asian markets , Mexican markets , and larger grocery stores .
Two of my favorite brands – O.N.E. and Vita Coco – come in juice boxes , which I ’ll admit is kind of fun in itself .
You can also find organic brands such as Nature Factor .
I like to drink chilled coconut water straight from the box , but it ’s also wonderful in smoothies .
Try it in this Mango and Passion Fruit Smoothie .

One of the major themes in your work is that various economic changes have shifted more emphasis onto creativity and ideas .
I think the crisis concentrates and accentuates a few long - running trends .
The first is this notion — initially advanced by people like Peter Drucker as early as the 1950s — that our economies were becoming more knowledge driven .
I simply added that this kind of idea of human capital actually comes from a much more fundamental human characteristic called creativity .
People who are engaged in creative work will not only be happier and more satisfied , but they ’ll add relatively more economic value .
But this seems to contradict one of your other major themes , which is that creativity flourishes most in high - density areas .
In an economy that ’s fueled by ideas and information , why should proximity matter ?
Well , I combine that first point with another insight made by urban economists .
Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize in part for some of these insights .
And you cite Ed Glaeser as well .
Yeah , Ed Glaeser is the person who has done the most and the best research on this , although he ’s quite a bit younger .
He ’ll win his share of awards .
But a lot of this goes back to the great Jane Jacobs , who argued that what really mattered was not simply accumulation of knowledge or creativity but the geographic concentration .
And Robert Lucas , who explained that urban areas bring together and multiply human productive efforts .
But as you mentioned , we have this kind of mythology going around that somehow the rise of new technologies — communication and transport technologies , which shrink the world — will spread out our geography .
We always have this kind of romantic notion that technology will free us from the dirty , the pathological , the slum - ridden , the unhealthful city , and that the world will spread itself out .
And why wo n’t it ?
In a previous piece I wrote for The Atlantic , “ The World is Spiky ” [ PDF ] , I kind of took that myth on .
There are two tendencies in the world economy .
There is a great tendency for low - cost , fairly standardized stuff to spread itself out , and that ’s where people say , “ Oh my God , the world is flat . ”
But there ’s also this counter - tendency for things to concentrate — to take advantage of these forces of agglomeration and human capital .
So what I tried to argue is that that second tendency is very important .
And now we have all sorts of World Bank reports talking about how productivity and performance are so much higher in urban areas , even in the emerging economies .
What I tried to do in this piece is say , “ I do n’t think this great crisis — or great ‘ reset , ’ as I like to call it — will change this trend .
In fact , my hunch is that , coming out of this crisis , our geography will end up more concentrated than it was before . ”
So I take it you do n’t have a lot of hope for telecommuting .
In November 1936 , the New English Weekly published George Orwell 's essay In Defence of the Novel .
Orwell felt that the prestige of the novel was in peril , in part due to a systematic failure in the reviewing process .
This essay will soon be 75 years old , but many of the critical points made in the piece are still eerily relevant .
By examining In Defence of the Novel , it is possible to draw parallels between the imperfect system observed by Orwell and the lack of public trust in contemporary videogame reviews .
Orwell opens his argument with a declaration that the majority of novels are over - hyped .
In penning too many ecstatic articles , novel reviewers have confused and alienated their readership : " When all novels are thrust upon you as words of genius , it is quite natural to assume that all of them are tripe . "
This problem , Orwell feels , is compounded by the volume of books being published and reviewed .
Animal FarmVille
The affliction is rife in videogame reviews .
How many of today 's publications use - really and truly use , not just for the purpose of gimmickry - the full range of their scoring system , beyond the numbers 6 to 10 ( or equivalent ) ?
The top - heavy ratings scale is widespread in games publications , bestowing an artificial sense of importance on many titles that scarcely deserve it .
This practice has created the unwelcome side effect of squeezing ratings into an increasingly narrow band , to the point where 6 out of 10 is , absurdly , now considered a poor score .
As a result , distinctly average games will regularly receive 7s and higher : " There is no way out of it when you have once committed the initial sin of pretending that a bad book is a good one . "
In part , this can be explained by the baffling trend of rewarding games for their mere functionality .
Even in this patch - heavy era , it 's rare for a game to simply not work or crash every two seconds ( outside of weird PC hardware conflicts ) , which for a lot of reviewers seems to be enough to earn a title at least five out of a potential ten points .
That 's rather like awarding 50 percent to someone for writing their name correctly on an exam .
Inexperienced reviewers often seem unable to point to anything beyond technical errors as reasons for why a game might not be any good ; and while it 's wise to admonish games for bugs , it 's quite another thing to actively reward titles just for working properly .
Poor design choices , weak narrative or the lack of a coherent art direction ( something entirely different from " bad graphics " ) are far more important factors in judging a game , but only in extreme cases do failings in these areas seem to affect scores in any major way .
When Kieron Gillen rightly pointed out that F.E.A.R. 2 was little other than competent , several of the subsequent reader comments expressed dismay .
A culture of giving uninspiring but functional titles at least 7/10 had made his award of a 5/10 appear somehow shocking .
Gillen 's review made it clear that he found the game about as average as it's possible to be , and his score reflected this .
But multiple readers still felt that " his review sounds like he 's going to give it a 7 . "
Perhaps it did - but only in the kind of reviewing malaise where scores are inflated beyond the point of all reason .
Road Rage : An Escalating Cycle
The recent dismissal of all criminal charges against rising political star , and former Attorney General Micheal Bryant might not have come as a surprise to most people who presumed that the best lawyers that money can buy would assure a favorable result for Bryant , who was clearly not out looking for trouble the night of that fatal incident .
What was surprising though , was how easily most people forgot that almost all of the “ news ” they have received around his case was being carefully crafted by the best Public Relations and Crisis Management team that money could buy as well .
Monday ’s low key announcement of the now - dismissed case , was immediately followed by an prompt , full - throttle acceleration of ongoing smear campaign against Cyclist Darcy Sheppard , with photos being plastered across all the major dailies the very next day which showed someone , alleged to be the hot - headed bike courier in question , hanging off the side of another luxury sedan , and thus validating Sheppard as not only an aggressor in the Bryant case , but also a clear menace to the rest of Society .
The unsettling truth behind these images , is that they were produced by the Bryant team , and shared with the Prosecuting Attorney , who then used them as justification for the dropping of charges … all without any such “ evidence ” every being properly scrutinized via so much as a preliminary hearing , let alone proper cross examinations .
Most people simply presumed that this ‘ evidence ’ was the result of the legal process , when in fact it was entirely the result of the Bryant Team ’s independent efforts to have the case thrown out before it even saw the inside of a courtroom …
Which the Prosecution was clearly willing to do , even without dropping manslaughter charges down to something as relatively trivial as “ dangerous driving ” – which was also dismissed under the same pretense that Bryant was acting in self - defense .
These are risky precedents that some legal critics ( such as MPP Peter Kormos ) have taken issue with …
Albeit with none of the Publicity that we , as the consuming public have been fed to quell our appetite for perceived justice .
Although the Globe is the only news site that is still displaying any of these contentious pics in their article on the dropped charges ( all other sources have curiously removed the pics from their articles on the subject ! ) this concerted initial press exposure demonstrated a clearly coordinated Press campaign , timed to support the out of court decision by the Prosecution .
that because Darcy Sheppard had a troubled history , the formal proceedings in leveled charges would not result in a conviction against Bryant .
This matter would now seem to be a fait accompli , but just in case anyone in the Public still thought that this unilateral dismissal of charges should have been based on evidence that was formally presented to a judge or jury ( and thus cross - examined for validity ) , we saw how Public fears of an irrational and possibly dangerous Cyclist could be called upon instead , in order to hang Sheppard ’s corpse in the Press , rather than waste taxpayer dollars with any formal proceedings …
Would n’t there have been more to consider in this story than what we were unilaterally presented with through the Mainstream Media , and would n’t a more complete ( properly validated ) pubic image of Darcy Shepard have come to light during formal proceedings , for better or worse ?
To see surveillance video of this tragedy , or consider how Public Relations helped shape the context of this Case :
Ultimately , there will be no need for any further consequences , much less any further justice served against the former attorney general , who is being now covered in the Press with pictures of him jogging , and making solemn pronouncements about the need to move on from this tragedy .
Instead we have the clearest demonstration yet of how public perceptions can be manipulated , if not outrightly manufactured in order to generate consent for results regardless of how contentious the causes may have been to begin with .
This PR played upon our fears of violence , the explosive risks of road rage , and finally leveraging the fact that people are all too easily divided on the subject of Cars and Bikes .
So forget for now that this ruling implies that homicidal violence can be justified if the victim shows any history of mildly sociopathic behavior , or any of the other dirt that was dug up about Sheppard ’s difficult upbringing , and instead let ’s consider the value that we can draw out of this in confronting the destructive effects of anger , and how this is all too easily manifested on our public roads .
As a measure of the general health of our Society , it seems that the seemingly endless stream of automobile traffic related issues could serve as an ideal test - bed for examining our Social Ills .
Traffic seems to be a perfect open - air laboratory for condensing and obviating many of the most pressing social challenges that we face as humans ( Transport , Communications , Environmentalism , Consumption , Civics , Urbanization , etc ) and since the results of this experiment are often accelerated by speed , and catalyzed by strong reactants like fear , frustration , and even outright anger , ‘ Traffic ’ also offers us some pretty clear warning signs as we attempt to safely navigate our way through the daunting challenges of the Human Condition .
Although I ’ve previously dug into this messy petri dish in “ Confessions of an Urban Cyclist ” let it suffice to say that we all know how quickly things can accelerate from bad to worse when we ’re forced to deal with one another ’s failings under exasperating road conditions that are often too close for comfort .
In the Bryant vs . Bike case , we also saw how two particularly polar extremes of Humanity were represented by two very different individuals , and how they each tried and failed to properly manage their flawed abilities to defend themselves ( both on , and off the road ) in the face of aggression , and against either the clear or perceived dangers that they represented to each other – within those brief moments before mass , metal , and speed won out over human folly and flesh …as it always will .
Keeping in mind that Cyclists face their own mortality every time they get cut off , or have a car door opened directly in front of them in traffic , what Micheal Bryant likely experienced , for a few brief moments , was how irrational a person can become if they suddenly feel that they ’re in genuine physical danger because of the oblivious acts of another .
In one case , there was the threat of violence expressed by words ( Bryant was never shown to have been injured in any way ) , and likely a violation of his personal property as Sheppard hung onto Bryant ’s car as he tried to leave the scene of a collision .
In the other case of fear and anger holding sway over rational judgment , Bryant ’s reactions manifested themselves in the abuse of automotive power and the terminal and violent trauma that resulted when a tenacious Sheppard was finally knocked off by the clear intent of the driver .
Would Bryant have reacted the same way if he had been on foot ?
Not likely .
The conjecture about alternative results is a non-sequitor though since a very well conducted Public Relations campaign has now assured everyone ( who takes the Media at face value ) that Sheppard was a menace to himself and Society , and that a trial would be a waste of public resources .
We ’ve also been assured that Bryant ’s reactions were justifiable ( at least in this one particularly dangerous precedent ) where violent actions by the “ victim ” are retro-actively condoned as defensive based on previous acts attributed to aggressor … .
Acts committed before these two ever encountered one another , but yet which are somehow a factor in this case nonetheless .
As such , we ’re left to simply move on from this well orchestrated justification for manslaughter ( and the ensuing PR materials that made it Publicly acceptable ) and accept the summary rulings from a supposedly impartial out of province Crown Prosecutor .
So since there ’s nothing left to do here but move on , perhaps we can extract some longer lasting value from these tragic circumstances , by going into that big Social Labratory that we call our Public Roadways , and take a long and hard look at what makes a bad Driver / Cyclist hopefully learning how to diffuse such enraging situations before they lead to their ultimate conclusions .

` The Red Shirts have shown that they are a genuine mass movement for democracy , made up of ordinary working people in rural and urban areas . '
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
May 11 , 2010 -- Pro-democracy Red Shirt protests in Bangkok , which started in mid-March , are about to be wound up .
Leaders [ of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship , UDD ] have accepted a compromise with the military - backed government of Abhisit Vejjajiva .
Elections will not be held immediately , but on November 14 .
Earlier Abihist had indicated an election in February 2011 at the earliest .
It is unclear whether the blanket censorship of the Thai media will be lifted .
One clear demand that the Red Shirt leaders are expecting to be met is that the Red Shirt 's TV channel ( People Channel TV ) will be allowed back on air .
Whether websites like Prachatai will be unblocked is also unclear .
Another demand is that the law be applied equally to all .
The government claims that the prime minister and deputy prime minister will " surrender " to the police in relation to charges of murdering citizens on April 10 , 2010 .
But it is unclear whether any real charges will be filed against them .
Nothing has been said about the political prisoners , both those in jail for lese majeste and those in jail for blocking roads during the recent protest .
What have the Red Shirts achieved ?
1 . The Red Shirts have shown that they are a genuine mass movement for democracy , made up of ordinary working people in rural and urban areas .
They have shown that the crisis is about class .
They have shown that the Red Shirts are a grassroots movement that will not disappear easily .
2 . The Red Shirts have exposed the real and bloody nature of the military - backed government , which can only stay in power through repression and blanket censorship .
3 . The struggle of the Red Shirts has turned ordinary people into leaders ; into internet and media experts who can get around censorship in order to spread their message .
In the process of struggle they have thrown off the myths and mind fetters about the monarchy .
As a result , the monarchy appears to be in terminal crisis .
If this is really so , it will seriously weaken the power of the army .
4 . The Red Shirts have stood up to the army and shown that it is not a simple matter to just shoot down pro-democracy demonstrators .
In the process they have caused splits in the police force and lower ranks of the army .
5 . They have forced the government to speed up the holding of elections .
But this is a compromise .
It is not the end of the shady dictatorship of the army and the elites which stand behind the present government .
It will disappoint many .
However , it is difficult to see how the Red Shirts could have fought on at this present stage without new strategies .
The important question is how the Red Shirts will organise and fight in the future .
If the Red Shirts are to strengthen themselves they have to organise among the trade unions in order to win strike action .
They have to make serious efforts to build networks among army recruits and they have to develop a clear political platform for the [ Red Shirt 's ]
Puea
Thai party in order to win the hearts and minds of ordinary workers and farmers .
They should advocate a welfare state , improved benefits for workers , a real peace process for the south , and genuine reform of the media and the justice system .
They must stand against censorship and repressive laws .
No one can just leave these matters in the hands of the leadership .
Red Shirt local groups need to elect representatives who can be part of a progressive grassroots leadership to lead the struggle forward .
Women should make up a significant proportion of this leadership .
Only these things would make a difference between a shoddy compromise and a real step forward to freedom , democracy and social justice .

คนเสื้อแดงได้อะไรจากการต่อสู้??
ใจ อึ๊งภากรณ ์
จุดจบของการต่อสู้รอบนี้
ซึ่งเริ่มในเดือนมีนาคม
เป็นการประนีประนอมระหว่างแกนนำคนเสื้อแดงกับรัฐบาลของอำมาตย์
หลายคนคงจะผิดหวัง แต่เราควรใช้เวลาพิจารณาสถานการณ์และกำหนดแนวทางในการต่อสู้ต่อไป
เรื่องมันยังไม่จบจนกว่าอำมาตย์จะถูกโค่นล้ม
ดังนั้นอย่าไปเสียเวลากับอาการ
“ อกหั ก ” อย่าไปท้อ อย่าไปเดินออกจากเวทีการต่อสู้ด้วยความน้อยใจ
ขอย้ำในสิ่งที่เขียนก่อนหน้านี้....
จุดเด่นเราคืออะไร?
จุดเด่นของการต่อสู้ของคนเสื้อแดงตั้งแต่เดือนมีนาคมเป็นต้นไปมีหลายข้อคือ
· คนเสื้อแดงได้พิสูจน์ว่าเป็นขบวนการของประชาชนชั้นล่างในการต่อสู้ทางชนชั้น เพื่อเรื่องปากท้องและเพื่อประชาธิปไตยพร้อมกัน ซึ่งรวมคนชนบทและคนในกรุงเทพฯ จำนวนมาก มากจนเป็นประวัติศาสตร์ ยิ่งใหญ่กว่าการต่อสู้ ๑๔ ตุลา การต่อสู้ของ พ.ค.ท.
และการต่อสู้ในเดือนพฤษภาปี ๓๕
· การต่อสู้ที่ยาวนาน ท่ามกลางกระสุนปืน หมอกควัน และข่าวที่ถูกบิดเบือนปิดกั้นโดยรัฐบาล เป็นบทเรียนสำคัญสำหรับประชาชนจำนวนมาก เขาได้เรียนรู้วิธีจัดตั้งตนเอง วิธีเข้าถึงข้อมูล และวิธีกระจายข่าว ยิ่งกว่านั้นการต่อสู้ทำให้เขากลายเป็นผู้นำเอง มีความมั่นใจในการท้าทายอำนาจอำมาตย์ที่กดทับชีวิตประชาชนมานาน เราอาจพูดได้ว่าเกือบจะไม่มีใครในขบวนการเสื้อแดงที่ยังคิดแบบเดิม ไม่มีใครเป็นทาสทางความคิดของลัทธิอำมาตย์
· การต่อสู้ที่เข้มแข็งของคนเสื้อแดงนี้ บังคับให้เจ้าหน้าที่รัฐระดับล่าง เช่นตำรวจและทหารเกณฑ์ เริ่มคิดหนัก หลายคนไม่ยอมทำตามคำสั่งผู้บังคับบัญชา และอาจมีหลายคนที่คิดกบฏ แต่ยังไม่ทำอะไรให้เห็นชัด นี่คืออาการของวิกฤตในการปกครองของรัฐอำมาตย์ เราอาจพูดได้ว่ารัฐอำมาตย์อยู่ได้ก็ด้วยการปราบปราม ขู่เขน และการปิดกั้นข้อมูลเท่านั้น ไม่มีความชอบธรรมเลยในสายตาประชาชนนับล้าน และในสายตาสื่อต่างประเทศและชาวโลกที่สนใจประเทศไทย
· เราบังคับให้รัฐบาลอำมาตย์เลื่อนการเลือกตั้งมาข้างหน้า 3 เดือ น
ขอเพิ่มเติมตรงนี้ให้ชัดเจนมากขึ้นคือ
ท่ามกลางการต่อสู้ คนเสื้อแดงส่วนใหญ่หมดศรัทธาในสถาบันกษัตริย์แล้ว
และสาเหตุมาจากพฤติกรรมของฝ่ายอำมาตย์เองตั้งแต่การผูกโบสีเหลืองในรัฐประหาร ๑๙ กันยา เราต้องเลี้ยงกระแสนี้ให้เติบโตมั่นคงขึ้น
เพราะจะมีผลมหาศาลในการทำให้กองทัพหมดความชอบธรรมในการแทรกแซงการเมือง
และเปิดทางให้มีการสร้างประชาธิปไตยแท้ได้
ข้อที่น่ากังวล
การประนีประนอมครั้งนี้ทิ้งปัญหาสำคัญๆ ไว้มากมาย เพราะไม่มีการแก้ไขการเซ็นเซอร์สื่อและอินเตอร์เน็ต
ไม่มีคำมั่นสัญญาว่าจะเปิดสื่ออย่างเช่น ประชาไท หรือวิทยุชุมชน ไม่มีการพูดถึงนักโทษทางการเมืองในคดีหมิ่นเดชานุภาพฯ
และคดีที่มาจากการปิดถนนท่ามกลางการประท้วง
คนเหล่านี้ยังติดคุกอยู่
ในประเด็นเหล่านี้พวกเราชาวเสื้อแดงคงต้องสู้ต่อไปในรูปแบบกรณีเฉพาะ
ตามจุดและชุมชนต่างๆ
ไม่ใช่ยอมจำนนหรือรอการเลือกตั้ง
จุดอ่อนที่ทำให้คนเสื้อแดงชุมนุมต่อไม่ได้
เราต้องดูจุดอ่อนของขบวนการ
เพราะจุดอ่อนเหล่านี้ทำให้มันยากที่จะสู้ต่อไปโดยไม่มียุทธวิธีใหม่ๆ
ซึ่งเป็นผลทำให้มีการประนีประนอมในที่สุด
ดังนั้นเพื่อให้ฝ่ายเราไปปรับแก้และพัฒนาการต่อสู้ในอนาคต
เราต้องคิดหนักตรงนี้
เพราะการสู้กับอำมาตย์จะไม่จบง่ายๆ
· ขบวนการเสื้อแดงยังไม่จัดตั้งในหมู่คนงาน ไม่ว่าจะเป็นลูกจ้างในโรงงาน หรือพนักงานในออฟฟิส ฯลฯ เพราะถ้าลูกจ้างที่เป็นเสื้อแดงจัดตั้งกันในสหภาพแรงงาน เราสามารถใช้พลังการนัดหยุดงานมากดดันอำมาตย์ และพลังนี้มีประสิทธิภาพสูง ปราบด้วยกองกำลังได้ยากอีกด้วย มันเป็นอำนาจทางเศรษฐกิจ
· การนำในขบวนการเสื้อแดงควรขยายให้สะท้อนความยิ่งใหญ่ของขบวนการ กลุ่มเสื้อแดงจากชุมชนต่างๆ ที่เราเห็นชัดในรูปแบบซุ้มหรือกลุ่มคนที่เดินทางมาด้วยกัน ควรเลือกผู้แทนของตนเองหนึ่งคน และให้ผู้แทนเหล่านี้ประชุมหารือกับแกนนำตลอดเวลา เพื่อให้มีการแลกเปลี่ยนความเห็นระหว่างคนเสื้อแดงรากหญ้ากับแกนนำอย่างเป็นระบบ การตัดสินใจอะไรก็ควรตัดสินใจร่วมกันแบบนี้ ซึ่งจะทำให้ขบวนการเสื้อแดงเข้มแข็งยิ่งขึ้น แกนนำจะมีโอกาสผิดพลาดน้อยลง และรากหญ้าจะร่วมรับผิดชอบในการนำด้วย โดยที่จะสร้างความสามัคคีมากขึ้น นอกจากนี้แกนนำเสื้อแดงในทุกระดับควรมีผู้หญิง เพื่อสะท้อนความจริงเกี่ยวกับขบวนการของเรา
· คนเสื้อแดงต้องทำการบ้านหนักขึ้นในการต่อสายกับทหารเกณฑ์ เพื่อขยายการจัดตั้งของเสื้อแดงเข้าไปในกองทัพ ทหารแตงโมที่จะน่าไว้ใจและมีประสิทธิภาพสูงสุดคือทหารเกณฑ์ที่เป็นเสื้อแดง และในยามวิกฤตเราจะได้สนับสนุนให้เขาฝืนคำสั่งของพวกนายพลที่ต้องการฆ่าประชาชน
· เมื่อมีการยุบสภาและเลือกตั้ง พรรคของคนเสื้อแดงต้อง “ คิดใหม่ทำใหม่ ” รอบสอง เพื่อครองใจประชาชนต่อไป ควรมีการเสนอนโยบายรัฐสวัสดิการ นโยบายที่จะช่วยคนงานและเสริมค่าจ้าง นโยบายสร้างสันติภาพในภาคใต้ และนโยบายเพื่อปฏิรูประบบยุติธรรมและระบบสื่อมวลชน ฯลฯ เราต้องเป็นพรรคของไพร่และพรรคของเสรีภาพและต้องเปิดโอกาสให้คนรุ่นใหม่ที่มีบทบาทสำคัญในการเคลื่อนไหวของขบวนการเสื้อแดง ทั้งในระดับชาติ และระดับชุมชน มีบทบาทหลักในพรรค ไม่ใช่ปล่อยให้นักการเมืองเก่าๆ ที่ไม่ทำอะไร มาหากินกับการต่อสู้ของประชาชน
เรามีภารกิจในการปลดแอกพลเมืองประเทศนี้จากอำนาจเผด็จการของอำมาตย์
ถ้าเราไม่นำ “ กำไ ร ” ที่เราได้มาจากการต่อสู้ในสองเดือนที่ผ่านมา
มาเสริมและพัฒนาแนวทางของเราให้ยกระดับสูงขึ้น
การเสียสละของคนเสื้อแดงจะละลายไปกับน้ำ
เราต้องไม่พลาดตรงนี้
แต่ไม่ว่าจะเกิดอะไรขึ้น
เมืองไทยจะกลับไปเป็นแบบเก่าไม่ได้อีกแล้ว
I think an excellent Pigouvian tax would be a tax on emails .
Many emails involve a negative
externality ( I do n't really want to receive them ) and almost all the ones I really want to get are
worth much more than a penny or so to the sender .
So a penny tax ( say ) on email would probably
generate large amounts of revenue , mitigate an important negative externality , and have minimal
inefficient disincentives .
Since email servers are necessarily centralized and networked and all email senders are ipso facto
connected to an ISP who is charging them for access the transactions costs and evasion problems
seem low .

Hi Guys , New features in the GNU toolchain this month include :* Support has been added for building both the old linker and thenew linker - GOLD - in the same toolchain .
( For architecturesthat support the new linker that is .
Currently these are the x86,x86_64 , ARM , PowerPC and Sparc architectures ) .
Configure thesources with the option -- enable - gold=both or the - - enable - gold=both / gold option .
The latter makes gold the defaultlinker , the former makes ld the default linker . *
The *- mingw64 targets no longer use a leading underscore prefix bydefault .
This is for compatibility with Microsoft 's compiler .
The old behaviour can be restored by configuring a toolchain buildwith the option : --enable-leading-mingw64-underscores .*
The next generation of the ISO C standard is in development , andit is now provisionally called ISO C1X .
Hence gcc now supports a-- std=c1 x command line option , although this does not actually doanything new at this point . *
A new , sort - of , warning command line option has been added to gcc :- Wsuggest-attribute=pure - Wsuggest-attribute=constThese cause gcc to issues warnings about functions which might becandidates for the PURE or CONST attributes .
Const functions donot examine any values except their arguments , have no effectsexcept generating their return value , and they always return .
Also they do not perform any indirection through any pointers .
Pure functions are the same except that they may also examineglobal variables .
Giving such functions the pure or constattribute can help the compiler produce better code , by allowingcalls to them to be more aggressively optimized .
The compiler will only issue warnings for functions that arevisible in other compilation units .
The analysis requires thatthe - fipa - pure - const option be enabled , although this is doneautomatically with - O1 and above .
Higher optimization levelsimprove the accuracy of the analysis . *
A new optimization has been added to gcc .
Enabled via the :- fipa - profilecommand line switch , or automatically at - O1 and higher , itperforms interprocedural profile propagation .
This marks functionsthat are only called functions with the COLD attribute asthemselves being cold .
Also functions executed once ( such asfunctions with the noreturn attribute or static constructors ordestructors ) are located .
Then these cold functions and loop - freeparts of functions executed only once are then optimized for sizerather than speed . *
Another new optimization has been added called :- fzee This optimization only helps targets that implicitly zero - extend 64 - bit registers after writing to their lower 32 - bit half , such asthe x86_64 .
It helps gcc detect cases where it might otherwisegenerate a unneeded zero-extenstion instruction .
Currently it is not enabled by default at any optimization level - instead it mustbe manually enabled .
Finally , the Link Time Optimization feature of the GNU toolchain isnow able to work with non-ELF file formats .
Specifically the COFF ( including COFF / PE ) and Mach - O binary file formats are nowsupported .

In some countries they 're known as " Bin Ladens " - the banknote everybody knows exists but few , other than criminals , ever see .
Now the 500 euro note is being withdrawn from sale in the UK .
Like almost all organised crime , the breakfast cereal box plan was done with the minimum of fuss .
Eftychia Symeonidoy stood outside a London apartment , casually holding the box under her arm .
But instead of it containing the recommended daily amount of vitamins and minerals , it had been stuffed with 300,000 euros .
As the undercover team from HM Revenue and Customs secretly filmed her , an ordinary estate car pulled up and the box was handed to the driver .
It was another consignment of laundered drugs cash safely delivered - or so the gang thought .
Caught on camera :
The cereal box contained 300,000 euros Symeonidoy and the rest of the 13 - strong laundering gang were all later convicted and jailed .
The group smashed by HMRC investigators had taken £ 24 m of dirty money from their clients in the criminal underworld - and returned " clean " euros .
Every month , they 'd take in between £ 1 m and £ 4 m in cash - massive bags of sterling notes .
They had so much of it , they had to stack it on sofas and in cabinets , and stuff it in bags in cupboards .
The jailing of that gang was a major breakthrough for investigators - but it's only the tip of the money laundering iceberg which revolves around fake bureau de change and the 500 Euro banknote .
After eight months of rigorous analysis of currency trading in the UK , the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) has established that the 500 euro note is at the heart of money laundering .
The reason is simple : it 's easier to shift .
At current exchange rates , the 500 euro note is worth about £ 430 - eight times more than the £ 50 note which is the most common high value sterling denomination .
If a drugs gang collects up to £ 1 m in twenties from its clients on street corners , those notes will weigh more than 50kg - about 50 bags of sugar .
The equivalent in 500 euro banknotes weighs just over 2kg .
Converting it becomes a no -brainer .
So the launderers set up front businesses , buy in the 500 euro notes from the City - and then make the new , clean and small consignments of notes disappear .
So how did the investigators know the British market in 500 euro notes was driven by drugs gangs rather than honest tourists or business travellers ?
Ian Cruxton , deputy director of Soca and head of its proceeds of crime investigations , said they tracked the note 's movements and saw something odd .
One suspicious exchange bureau identified by law enforcement agencies was operating out of an office that did n't even have a sign above the door .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It asked the note wholesalers ( the major banks and well - known international currency businesses ) to supply it with four million euros worth of the bank notes in one year .
Those orders were greater than the entire amount sold to travellers through the Post Office 's network of 12,500 counters .
' The note of choice '
In other words , there were two markets : legitimate High Street businesses and something far murkier around the corner .
" There 's been a significant body of evidence over time that has recognised that high denomination notes are an important means of reducing the bulk of cash , " says Mr Cruxton .
" The 500 euro note is really the note of choice among criminals .
" We estimate that more than 90 % of the 500 euro notes that are provided in the UK have actually gone into the hands of serious organised criminals . "
Economists have long charted how large denomination notes facilitate money laundering .
The reality is that from now on people are not going to be able to go into wholesale bank suppliers , the money bureaus and ask for a supply of 500 euro notes
Ian Cruxton
The 500 euro note was born in 2002 .
But two years before that , the similarly high - value Canadian $ 1,000 bill was shredded on advice from law enforcement agencies .
A decade on , the 500 euro bill has taken centre stage .
An internal Bank of Italy report warned last year about the mafia 's use of the note , saying it was just adding to the national problems of tax evasion .
And follow the money further , and you will find vast quantities of high value euros in South America in the hands of the drugs cartels .
Eurozone warned Professor Richard Portes of the Centre for Economic Policy Research , says the Eurozone countries were warned before the first note rolled off its high - tech anti-forgery printing press .
" It was quite clear from day one that once they decided they would have something as large as a 500 euro note that it would give the euro an economic advantage to the $ 100 bill .
It would be used by the Mafia and in all sorts of organised underground crime , " he says .
Prof Portes is pleased at the note 's withdrawal from UK foreign exchanges , as it will " make life much more difficult for people who should find life difficult " .
But there 's no plan to withdraw the banknote itself because it plays a role in the economic culture of some countries .
In some nations , particularly Germany and Italy , people often prefer cash to plastic - a demand that has risen since the credit crunch hit world markets .
These nations wanted a high value note euro note when they gave up their own currencies .
HOW MONEY LAUNDERING WORKS
Cash gathered - such as from drugs deals Gangs use specialist launderers
They convert it to high value euro notes Small consignments smuggled abroad
It passes through bank accounts or assets like property Wealth emerges elsewhere as clean cash Crime bosses avoid prosecution
There 's no doubt high denomination notes help low - level domestic tax evasion , but that was not the responsibility of the European Central Bank .
The question today , however , is whether the bank will face greater pressure to ditch the 500 note because of the evidence linking it to money laundering .
In the meantime , there is a more immediate question .
Will banning the sale of the 500 note in the UK do any good ?
Wo n't money launderers switch to another commodity ... like the 200 euro note ?
Ian Cruxton of Soca says that 's entirely what investigators expect the gangs to do - but there are reasons to be optimistic because they 're trying to disrupt the " business practices " of organised crime and force gangs to make mistakes .
" The sheer bulk of notes that they will have to move , if they continue to try to move it through cash is going to make it much more risky , " says Mr Cruxton .
" They 're going to have to change the methods that they use , make themselves much more open to intervention .
" Given the nature of organised crime , taking out isolated criminals does not bring a significant benefit .
" But the opportunity to take out something like this , when we remove one of the key enablers that benefit the whole criminal community , gives us an opportunity to have a much greater effect . "
Below is a selection of your comments
If we were able to use sales of the 500 Euro note to track and catch money launderers , why are we withdrawing it ?
Mark Niel , Milton Keynes
I do n't think this is legal .
I have been abroad and I take 3000 euros in my money belt , in 500 notes , and it is completely concealed .
It seems very very stupid to ban the 500 Euro note if 90 % are used by criminals , the police seem to have cut off one way of following the illegal money .
It appears that the police are not very interested in money laundering .
So next all the $ 100 US C - Notes will be banned .
Gerry , Newport
This stinks .
What about honest businessmen like myself who have financial interest in Spain and Italy yet reside in the UK ?
Who require euros to be sent back home to Iran my home country without the dictatorial regime knowing ?
The UK / US wont let the Iranian banks in London do anything so they have to increase the price of remitting money back home .
You take Dollars to Iran no one will accept it , you take Sterling or low denomination Euros and you get an unfair haircut .
The only note which makes most economic sense is the 500 euro note .
Please do not ban it because of criminals when we who pay taxes and earn money legally require it as well .
Rey , London
In retrospect , given that the circulation of the £ 50 note in the UK is regarded as a barometer for the size of the Black Economy , the fact that there existed a note worth eight times that in value should have been concern enough nearly a decade after its introduction that it would be used for illicit purposes .
Using the same logic , the 200 - Euro note should be culled as well .
The only other reason to have it would be that it would be available should the real value of the Euro plummet due to hyperinflation .
Paul T Horgan , Bracknell , UK
So the Canadians learned the hard way that these very high denomination notes are more use to criminals than honest people .
What does Brussels do ?
Ignore the lessons and produce their own .
Just how much EU tax payers money has been wasted on something that ought to have been obvious anyway ?
Andy Blake , London Very well but what about the Swiss 1000 chf note
The Swiss banks do n't care from where the money comes from or where it goes , and as there is no enforced border its perfect for money laundering , being worth about 650 pounds sterling .

There is something foul in Philadelphia far beyond the goaltending fiasco that has become the focal point of the NHL 's most disappointing team .
We 're not there on a day - to - day basis , so we can't claim first - hand knowledge , but when two league GMs were asked what they perceived to be the problem , neither hesitated .
" Pronger , " each said , referring to Chris Pronger , the defenseman who has a reputation for splitting locker rooms as well as heads . >>
NY Post columnist Larry Brooks
Two league general managers say that Chris Pronger is the problem in the Flyers ' locker room .
Let 's think about this a little bit .
First , let 's just qualify this by noting that only one general manager has been in the Flyers locker room this season , and his name is Paul Holmgren .
Second , let 's not jump to assumptions because that would be doing the same as this ' report ' -- but how easy could it be to find two general managers who might not like Mr. Pronger ?
Half the league hates the guy , not to mention about 100 percent of fans who do n't root on the orange and black .
But if you really , truly think about the claim that Chris Pronger is the reason the Flyers locker room is allegedly fractured , then that means the problems started this season , right ?
Wrong .
The Flyers troubles did n't start in June or July or August or September .
They started way before Pronger ever pulled that jersey over his head .
I think the funniest part about this is that Brooks insists on qualifying his report by saying " we 're not in the room ... . "
It 's funny that immediately after that qualifier , he tries to bring legitimacy back to the claim by quoting two general managers , who also are n't in the room .
So , okay , let 's see the reaction from someone who is in the room everyday .
Philadelphia Inquirer beat writer Sam Carchidi :
Memo to Larry Brooks : Pronger is # Flyers ' MVP and their unquestioned leader .
Period .
We 'll ignore the obvious Mike Richards sub - plot in that quote and move on .
I think Pronger summed it up nicely himself .
Implementing the viewport meta tag in Mozilla Fennec
The upcoming release of Mobile Firefox ( Fennec ) 1.1 features improved support for the < meta name = " viewport " > tag .
Previous version of Fennec supported the width , height , and initial - scale viewport properties , but had problems with some sites designed for iPhone and Android browsers .
We now support the same properties Safari does , and we changed Fennec to render mobile sites more consistently on screens of different sizes and resolutions .
You can see these changes for yourself in the latest Fennec 1.1 or trunk nightly builds .
Background
Mobile browers like Fennec render pages in a virtual " window " ( the viewport ) , usually wider than the screen , so they do n't need to mangle existing layouts by squeezing them into a tiny window .
Users can pan and zoom to display different areas of the viewport .
Mobile Safari introduced the " viewport meta tag " to let web developers control the viewport 's size and scale .
Many other mobile browsers now support this tag , although it is not part of any web standard .
Apple 's documentation does a great job explaining how it works for web developers , but it leaves out some information that would be useful to browser vendors .
For example , it says the content attribute is a comma-separated list , but existing browsers and web pages use a mix of commas , semicolons , and spaces as separators .
A pixel is not a pixel
The iPhone and many popular Android phones have 3 - to 4 - inch screens with 320×480 pixels ( ~160 dpi ) .
Fennec 's target devices have the same physical size but 480×800 pixels ( ~240 dpi ) .
Because of this , the last version of Fennec displayed many pages about one third smaller ( in physical units ) than iPhone or Android .
This caused usability and readability problems on many touch - optimized web sites .
Peter - Paul Koch wrote about this problem in A pixel is not a pixel is not a pixel .
Fennec 1.1 for Maemo will use 1.5 hardware pixels for each CSS " pixel , " following the lead of the Android browser .
This means a site with " initial - scale=1 " will render at the same physical size in Fennec for Maemo , Mobile Safari for iPhone , and the Android Browser on both HDPI and MDPI phones .
It 's also consistent with the CSS 2.1 specification , which says :
If the pixel density of the output device is very different from that of a typical computer display , the user agent should rescale pixel values .
It is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel .
It is recommended that the reference pixel be the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm 's length .
This change only affects web pages that explicitly set the viewport size or scale .
The pixel ratio is 1.5 applies only if the viewport scale is set to 1 .
The size of a " pixel " on any page changes with the zoom level , and the default zoom level for most pages in Fennec has not changed .
On 240 - dpi screens , pages with initial - scale=1 will effectively be zoomed to 150 % by both Fennec and Android WebKit .
Their text will be smooth and crisp , but their bitmap images will probably not take advantage of the full screen resolution .
To get sharper images on these screens , mobile web developers can create images at 150 % of their final size ( or 200 % , to support the rumored 320 - dpi iPhone ) and then scale them down using HTML / CSS .
WebKit on Android supports an additional undocumented target - density Dpi property , to let web developers override the CSS - to - device pixel ratio .
Fennec does n't support this property now , but if we see a compelling need for it ( or if it becomes part of a documented standard ) then we might implement it too .
Right now Fennec uses the same default ratio of 1.5 on all devices .
( This is a hidden preference that can be changed in about : config or by an add - on . )
Later we 'll need to change this – as well as many other parts of Fennec 's user interface – to choose the correct size automatically , depending on the screen density .
Viewport width and screen width
Many sites set their viewport to width=320 , initial - scale=1 to fit precisely onto the iPhone display in portrait mode .
As mentioned above , this caused problems when Fennec 1.0 rendered these sites , especially in landscape mode .
To fix this , Fennec 1.1 will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the requested scale .
This matches the behavior of Android and Mobile Safari , and is especially useful on large - screen devices like the iPad .
( Allen Pike 's Choosing a viewport for iPad sites has a good explanation for web developers . )
We also added support for minimum - scale , maximum - scale , and user - scalable , with defaults and limits similar to Safari's .
These properties affect the initial scale and width as well as limiting zooming after the page is loaded .
Standards
< meta name = " viewport " > is a good example of browsers innovating exactly how Sachin Agarwal thinks they should .
It was implemented by a single browser , used by web developers , and copied by other browsers without waiting for any standards organization .
It has clearly improved on earlier solutions like MobileOptimized and Handheld Friendly .
Now that viewport metadata has proved to be a useful extension to HTML , I think it is worth standardizing .
According to the HTML5 spec , new names for the meta element should first be registered on the WHATWG wiki and then be ratified through the W3C standards process .
If anyone at Mozilla or elsewhere is working on a standard specification for viewport metadata , please let me know .
[ Update : this is now being standardized as part of the CSS Device Adaptation spec . ]

MILWAUKEE ( AP ) 
A lawsuit from the U.S. aims to place blame for priest sexual abuse at the highest levels of the Roman Catholic Church by claiming the Vatican controls leadership , fundraising and doctrine down to the lowest levels .
The lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. federal court claims top leaders at the Vatican knew about allegations of sexual abuse at St. John 's School for the Deaf outside Milwaukee and called off internal punishment of the accused priest , the Rev. Lawrence Murphy .
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of an Illinois man by St. Paul - based attorney Jeff Anderson , who also has a pending lawsuit against the Vatican in Oregon for a man who claims he was abused at his Catholic school in the 1960s .
Among the pieces of evidence in the Wisconsin suit is a 1995 letter from one of Murphy 's alleged victims detailing the problems at St. John's .
It was addressed to the No. 2 person in the Vatican , Cardinal Angelo Sodano , who was then secretary of state .
It was written a year before it was first believed the case was brought to the attention of the Vatican .
The lawsuit intends to prove the Vatican is a global business empire , practicing in " commercial activity " in Wisconsin and across the U.S. and holding " unqualified power " over each diocese , parish and follower .
The Vatican's U.S. - based attorney , Jeffrey Lena , said in a statement Thursday that the lawsuit was a publicity stunt with no merit and it rehashes theories already rejected by U.S. courts .
The Vatican previously has said that diocese officials and civil authorities knew about the allegations some 20 years before the Vatican was ever notified .
Because of that , Lena said , it can not be held liable for Murphy 's abuse .
Some legal experts questioned the Wisconsin lawsuit 's prospects .
Nicholas Cafardi , a canon lawyer and former dean at the Duquesne University School of Law , disputes the argument that the Roman Catholic Church is an international commercial business .
" He 's alleging an employment relationship between individual priests and the Holy See , " Cafardi said .
" I 'm sorry , but diocesan priests in the United States are not employees of the Holy See. ...
If a court were to accept that , they would be creating a new Catholic Church , not the one that exists now . "
Professor Joseph Dellapenna at the Villanova University School of Law doubts courts will treat the Wisconsin diocese as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Vatican .
He noted a number of dioceses around the country have filed for bankruptcy because of abuse cases , and the courts have treated them as separate , independent entities .
The biggest issue could be overcoming the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , which sets the rules for U.S. legal action against sovereign nations , including the Vatican .
Dellapenna said the suit 's claims of misrepresentation and fraud are barred by the act .
Another U.S. appeals court has ruled the act also bars its claims of emotional distress , he said , though Wisconsin 's 7th Circuit could decide differently .
But Washington , D.C. , attorney Jonathan Levy , a specialist in international law who has tried suing the Vatican Bank over Holocaust claims , said Anderson could succeed in taking advantage of exceptions to sovereign immunity .
" I 'd say he 's got some new and exciting theories in there why the Vatican should be held responsible for its bad acts , " Levy said .
Anderson said the suit is unique because it 's seeking injunctive relief , not just money , by compelling the Vatican to open its files on abuse cases .
" They have been hiding behind legal shields , and we have been successful so far in the courts in cracking those shields , " he said .
" We intend to use this case and others like it to wedge open those cracks . "
He said the plaintiff had pledged to donate any monetary award to a fund to be shared by Murphy 's victims .
The lawsuit is the latest move in the case of Murphy , who died in 1998 .
He was accused of sexually abusing some 200 boys at the deaf school from 1950 to 1974 .
He was put on a leave of absence when the allegations were revealed in the early 1970s .
The lawsuit claims Murphy was still allowed to serve in ministry and work with children in another Wisconsin diocese into the early 1990s .
Murphy 's case drew renewed attention after the recent release of documents called into question the actions of a Vatican office led by then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger .
Before the disclosure of the 1995 letter to Sodano , it was believed the Vatican first learned of allegations against Murphy in a July 1996 letter from Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland .
That letter was sent to the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith , the powerful Vatican office Ratzinger led from 1981 to his election as pope in 2005 .
That office told the archbishop to move forward with a canonical trial against Murphy in March 1997 .
But then the office urged a different course after receiving a letter from Murphy .
The Rev. Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , has said they suggested restricting Murphy from ministry rather than holding a full - blown canonical trial , citing Murphy 's age , failing health , and a lack of further allegations .
The Wisconsin bishops ordered the proceedings halted , but in the end , Murphy died while still a defendant in a canonical trial , which could have led to Murphy being laicized , or stripped of the priesthood .
Sodano has long been accused in news reports in U.S. Catholic publications and other outlets of stalling a Vatican probe of the Rev. Marcial Maciel , the discredited founder of the Legionaries of Christ .
The order has admitted that the late Maciel fathered at least one child and molested young seminarians .
Anderson provided a copy of a receipt showing the registered letter to Sodano had reached the Vatican .
The man wrote Sodano again and got no response , according to Anderson .
Lena said that at the time , it was a local matter regarding a local priest and the victim had already communicated with the local bishop .
Under those circumstances , Lena said it is " entirely appropriate " under canon law for the local diocese — not the Holy See — to respond .

Yet Another Brute Force Sudoku Solver
I know , there are more than a thousand sudoku solvers out there , but I 've been meaning to learn the puzzle for a while now , on the other hand I have no interest in solving one for real so I hacked together the following snippet to brute force it for me .
( ns sudoku.core ( :use clojure.set ) ) ( defn constraints [s i ] ( let [s ( partition 9 s ) r ( / i 9 ) c ( mod i 9 ) gc (/ c 3 ) gr ( / r 3 ) every - nth ( fn [s i ] ( map # ( nth % i ) s ) ) grp-col ( every - nth ( map #( partition 3 % ) s ) gc ) grp ( take 3 ( drop (* 3 ( int gr ) ) grp-col ) ) ] ( into #{} ( flatten [ ( nth s r ) ( every - nth s c ) grp ] ) ) ) )
Rules are simple , when choosing a number , you can't use numbers that are already present in the same column , same row , and the same group , the set of these numbers will contain invalid choices for that position .

CORPUS CHRISTI , TEXAS –
The governor ’s race may get the highest media profile and the most campaign donations , but it ’s Linda Chavez - Thompson for Texas Lieutenant Governor that really puts fire underneath union activists .
While the lineup of candidates at the labor caucus during the Texas Democratic Party convention here on June 25 received polite applause , Chavez - Thompson received a standing ovation and plenty of Texas “ yippees ” when she started , then two more loud standing ovations when she finished !
The candidate made her advocacy of the workers ’ needs more than clear .
She said , “ For 40 years I represented the labor movement proudly .
I did everything that I was asked to do , and a little bit more . ”
In fact , she was the first woman and the first person of color to hold highest - level office in the AFL - CIO .
Chavez continued , “ I saw some things wrong in Texas : I saw a lack of dignity and respect for workers , mostly those who do n’t have a union .
The fact is that Texas has the highest number of low - wage workers in the country ! ”
Chavez - Thompson contrasted the present presidential administration with the former one .
She said , “ For eight years George W Bush lived right across the park from the AFL - CIO but not a single time did any of them get into the White House , because he did n’t like unions . ”
“ I am extremely grateful to come from the body of the labor movement ! ”
“ I have been so excited about going into the crowds of voters across Texas .
They ask ‘ Can you bring the labor base out ? ’ and I reply , ‘ Hell yes , labor will come out ! ”
The Corpus Christi newspaper credited labor ’s candidate with creating the most exciting moments of the first day of the convention .
On the second and last day , she thrilled the entire convention with a longer talk that included fiery denunciations of Governor Perry , and her opponent , Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst .
Among their many failings , she blamed them for the state ’s present $ 18 billion budget shortfall .
“ Do you know how many zeroes there are in $ 18 billion ? ” the candidate asked , then gave the answer , “ Eleven , if you count Perry and Dewhurst ! ”

This started as a comment on Ade ’s blog post about Hugin , but I do n’t think comments should be bigger than the original blog post , so I ’ve moved it here instead 🙂
Ade makes some interesting points about the GPL , particularly the opportunity to exclude certain jurisdictions where the use of the software would infringe a patent .
He also raises the question of whether distribution of source code – as opposed to binaries – can be counted as infringement and reflects on the trend to explicitly claim for a medium containing code that would cause the invention to be ‘ realised ’ on a computer .
Background
If you ’d like an elegant and ( generally ) very well argued primer and history of what can be patented in UK law see this judgement ( from 2006 , things have changed a bit since then ) .
The judge in that case , Peter Prescott , was actually only standing in and therefore was n’t really expected to take a fresh look at it as he did and go against patent office practice that had been making software patents a bit easier to obtain in the UK up until that point .
He ’s something of a personal hero of mine 😉
Why I ’m writing about this
I guess the first thing to say is that I ’m no patent lawyer , this is not legal advice and my knowledge is limited to UK and ( a little ) to EU patent law .
The knowledge I have was gained through working as a patent examiner ( one of the people who decides whether or not a patent is granted on an idea ) from 2004 - 2007 at the UK Intellectual Property Office .
During the last year of my time there I was in the department working on ‘ unpatentable ’ inventions : software patents , business methods and the like .
This area of patent law moves quite fast in varied , contradictory and nonsensical directions and I really have not been paying attention to it since I left almost three years ago .
Who can infringe ?
( Why claim the software medium ? )
Within UK law , at least , there is the idea of primary and secondary infringement .
The primary infringer is someone who does something directly reading on to the claims of a patent .
So if the patent claims only the method of doing something and your software performs that method when run then the primary infringement would occur only when the method is actually performed ( i.e. when the program is run ) .
In that scenario , if you were selling the software then only your customer would be a primary infringer when they used the software .
However , as a supplier of the means to infringe , you could be open to a claim of secondary infringement .
The original logic of this was – I believe – to allow the owner of a patent to sue , say , the British importer of an infringing device rather than having to pursue a foreign manufacturer abroad .
However , pursuing a case for primary infringement is easier and so , as Ade noted , many patent applications will also include a claim along the lines of :
A storage medium containing code that , when run on a computer , performs the method of claim x
This would allow them to go after anyone supplying the program on a disc as a primary infringer .
There was , briefly ( I think it got overturned ) a court judgement in the UK that ruled that any claim to a program on some kind of medium was a software patent as such ( well , obviously … ) and not permissible under UK law .
I had great fun in my last few months as a patent examiner rejecting loads of applications simply by saying :
Claim x is a claim to a computer program on a storage medium .
The invention is therefore clearly a computer program as such and cannot be patented .
Applicants and their patent attorneys did n’t much like that .
So does source code infringe ?
I doubt it .
There may be an argument for secondary infringement , but that gets in to all kinds of difficulties as there are various defences such as the research defence ( pure academic research and the publication of methods arising from it are immune from patent infringement ) or freedom of speech ( anyone remember the haikus containing the deCSS code ? ) .
Also few people make money from distributing source code , so where ’s the point in suing them ?
It ’s easier to sue the end user who directly infringes ( and doable if they ’re a big company : SCO tried it with Daimler , albeit in a copyright rather than patent case ) or someone distributing the binaries on a commercial basis ( if the patent owner remembered to claim for software discs too ) .
Disclaimer : as far as I ’m aware , the above has never been tested and a lot of it might not apply outside the UK anyway .
Why does this matter to KDE ?
Most of the software patents that came to me originated in the US and were fairly easy to dismiss under UK law .
However , there was a patent application that came to me before I worked in the unpatentable section that could have had a direct impact on Amarok .
I do n’t remember the details of the patent in question ( and probably could n’t reveal them anyway as I do n’t want to mess with the Official Secrets Act ) .
However , it was for a hardware audio player and one of the features it claimed had , I knew , been in Amarok for a little under a year , but before the filing date of the patent .
It was my opinion that Amarok would have infringed had the patent application been granted .
It took me a couple of days to find the disclosure of the feature in the Amarok infrastructure ( trawling wiki page histories and forum posts ) , twice as long as the target time allotted for processing that particular patent – and I had to hit that target to get promoted .
The point is that the Amarok wiki and forums are not somewhere we routinely searched for prior art and had that patent application been passed to someone else who did n’t know ( or care ) that the feature was already in Amarok then the prior art probably would not have been found .
I would not have been criticised for not finding it and it was against my interests ( other than as a user of Amarok ) to spend the time doing so .
The problem is more than software patents
As illustrated by the Amarok case , it ’s not only software patents that can be dangerous .
The ‘ invention ’ there was obvious – to you or me – but it probably would n’t have been patently obvious , by which I mean the the level of invention required for getting a patent is low .
There is also a problem not only with a lack of time to do things properly , but also a lack of technical knowledge .
I examined applications concerning JIT compilation , despite having no knowledge of programming .
I examined applications for magnetic hard drive read heads without having the faintest idea of what would be obvious to someone in the industry , or really even really which features were important .
I always had the impression , since we saw the results of prior art searches from other offices , that the European Patent Office were far more thorough than we were .
They certainly had more time per patent application and found things in places we would never have looked .
We tried not to look at what the US Patent Office was up to .
I ’ll finish off by quoting Peter Prescott in that judgment I linked to at the start :

Detailed Description
Introduction to the Standard IO facilities
This file declares the standard IO facilities that are implemented in avr - libc .
Due to the nature of the underlying hardware , only a limited subset of standard IO is implemented .
There is no actual file implementation available , so only device IO can be performed .
Since there 's no operating system , the application needs to provide enough details about their devices in order to make them usable by the standard IO facilities .
Due to space constraints , some functionality has not been implemented at all ( like some of the printf conversions that have been left out ) .
Nevertheless , potential users of this implementation should be warned : the printf and scanf families of functions , although usually associated with presumably simple things like the famous " Hello , world ! " program , are actually fairly complex which causes their inclusion to eat up a fair amount of code space .
Also , they are not fast due to the nature of interpreting the format string at run-time .
Whenever possible , resorting to the ( sometimes non-standard ) predetermined conversion facilities that are offered by avr - libc will usually cost much less in terms of speed and code size .
Tunable options for code size vs. feature set
In order to allow programmers a code size vs. functionality tradeoff , the function vfprintf ( ) which is the heart of the printf family can be selected in different flavours using linker options .
See the documentation of vfprintf ( ) for a detailed description .
The same applies to vfscanf ( ) and the scanf family of functions .
Outline of the chosen API
The standard streams stdin , stdout , and stderr are provided , but contrary to the C standard , since avr - libc has no knowledge about applicable devices , these streams are not already pre-initialized at application startup .
Also , since there is no notion of " file " whatsoever to avr - libc , there is no function fopen ( ) that could be used to associate a stream to some device .
( See note 1 . ) Instead , the function fdevopen ( ) is provided to associate a stream to a device , where the device needs to provide a function to send a character , to receive a character , or both .
There is no differentiation between " text " and " binary " streams inside avr -libc .
Character
is sent literally down to the device 's put ( ) function .
If the device requires a carriage return ( \r ) character to be sent before the linefeed , its put ( ) routine must implement this ( see note 2 ) .
As an alternative method to fdevopen ( ) , the macro fdev_setup_stream ( ) might be used to setup a user - supplied FILE structure .
It should be noted that the automatic conversion of a newline character into a carriage return - newline sequence breaks binary transfers .
If binary transfers are desired , no automatic conversion should be performed , but instead any string that aims to issue a CR - LF sequence must use " \r
" explicitly .
For convenience , the first call to fdevopen ( ) that opens a stream for reading will cause the resulting stream to be aliased to stdin .
Likewise , the first call to fdevopen ( ) that opens a stream for writing will cause the resulting stream to be aliased to both , stdout , and stderr .
Thus , if the open was done with both , read and write intent , all three standard streams will be identical .
Note that these aliases are indistinguishable from each other , thus calling fclose ( ) on such a stream will also effectively close all of its aliases ( note 3 ) .
It is possible to tie additional user data to a stream , using fdev_set_udata ( ) .
The backend put and get functions can then extract this user data using fdev_get_udata( ) , and act appropriately .
For example , a single put function could be used to talk to two different UARTs that way , or the put and get functions could keep internal state between calls there .
Format strings in flash ROM
All the printf and scanf family functions come in two flavours : the standard name , where the format string is expected to be in SRAM , as well as a version with the suffix " _P " where the format string is expected to reside in the flash ROM .
The macro PSTR ( explained in < avr / pgmspace.h > : Program Space Utilities ) becomes very handy for declaring these format strings .
Running stdio without malloc ( )
By default , fdevopen ( ) requires malloc ( ) .
As this is often not desired in the limited environment of a microcontroller , an alternative option is provided to run completely without malloc ( ) .
The macro fdev_setup_stream ( ) is provided to prepare a user - supplied FILE buffer for operation with stdio .
Example
This example uses the initializer form FDEV_SETUP_STREAM ( ) rather than the function - like fdev_setup_stream ( ) , so all data initialization happens during C start - up .
If streams initialized that way are no longer needed , they can be destroyed by first calling the macro fdev_close ( ) , and then destroying the object itself .
No call to fclose ( ) should be issued for these streams .
While calling fclose ( ) itself is harmless , it will cause an undefined reference to free ( ) and thus cause the linker to link the malloc module into the application .
Notes
Note 1 : It might have been possible to implement a device abstraction that is compatible with fopen ( ) but since this would have required to parse a string , and to take all the information needed either out of this string , or out of an additional table that would need to be provided by the application , this approach was not taken .
Note 2 : This basically follows the Unix approach : if a device such as a terminal needs special handling , it is in the domain of the terminal device driver to provide this functionality .
Thus , a simple function suitable as put ( ) for fdevopen ( ) that talks to a UART interface might look like this :
int char c , uart_putchar ( c , FILE * stream ) { if ( c == '
' ) uart_putchar ( ' \r ' ) ; loop_until_bit_is_set ( UCSRA , UDRE ) ; UDR = c ; return 0 ; }
Note 3 : This implementation has been chosen because the cost of maintaining an alias is considerably smaller than the cost of maintaining full copies of each stream .
Yet , providing an implementation that offers the complete set of standard streams was deemed to be useful .
Not only that writing printf ( ) instead of fprintf ( mystream , ... ) saves typing work , but since avr - gcc needs to resort to pass all arguments of variadic functions on the stack ( as opposed to passing them in registers for functions that take a fixed number of parameters ) , the ability to pass one parameter less by implying stdin or stdout will also save some execution time .
Macro Definition Documentation
#define _FDEV_EOF ( - 2 ) Return code for an end - of - file condition during device read .
To be used in the get function of fdevopen ( ) .
#define _FDEV_ERR ( -1 ) Return code for an error condition during device read .
To be used in the get function of fdevopen ( ) .
# define _FDEV_SETUP_READ __SRD fdev_setup_stream ( ) with read intent
# define _FDEV_SETUP_RW
( __SRD|__SWR ) fdev_setup_stream ( ) with read / write intent
# define _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE __SWR fdev_setup_stream ( ) with write intent
# define EOF ( -1 ) EOF declares the value that is returned by various standard IO functions in case of an error .
Since the AVR platform ( currently ) does n't contain an abstraction for actual files , its origin as " end of file " is somewhat meaningless here .
# define fdev_close ( )
This macro frees up any library resources that might be associated with stream .
It should be called if stream is no longer needed , right before the application is going to destroy the stream object itself .
( Currently , this macro evaluates to nothing , but this might change in future versions of the library . )
# define fdev_get_udata ( stream ) ( ( stream ) -> udata )
This macro retrieves a pointer to user defined data from a FILE stream object .
# define fdev_set_udata ( stream , u ) do { ( stream ) -> udata = u ; } while (0 )
This macro inserts a pointer to user defined data into a FILE stream object .
The user data can be useful for tracking state in the put and get functions supplied to the fdevopen ( ) function .
# define fdev_setup_stream ( stream , put , get , rwflag )
Setup a user - supplied buffer as an stdio stream .
This macro takes a user - supplied buffer stream , and sets it up as a stream that is valid for stdio operations , similar to one that has been obtained dynamically from fdevopen ( ) .
The buffer to setup must be of type FILE .
The arguments put and get are identical to those that need to be passed to fdevopen ( ) .
The rwflag argument can take one of the values _FDEV_SETUP_READ , _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE , or _FDEV_SETUP_RW , for read , write , or read / write intent , respectively .
Note No assignments to the standard streams will be performed by fdev_setup_stream ( ) .
If standard streams are to be used , these need to be assigned by the user .
See also under Running stdio without malloc ( ) .
# define FDEV_SETUP_STREAM
( put , get , rwflag ) Initializer for a user - supplied stdio stream .
This macro acts similar to fdev_setup_stream ( ) , but it is to be used as the initializer of a variable of type FILE .
The remaining arguments are to be used as explained in fdev_setup_stream ( ) .
# define getc ( __stream ) fgetc( __stream )
The macro getc used to be a " fast " macro implementation with a functionality identical to fgetc ( ) .
For space constraints , in avr - libc , it is just an alias for fgetc .
# define getchar ( void ) fgetc ( stdin )
The macro getchar reads a character from stdin .
Return values and error handling is identical to fgetc ( ) .
# define putc ( __c , __stream ) fputc ( __c , __stream )
The macro putc used to be a " fast " macro implementation with a functionality identical to fputc ( ) .
For space constraints , in avr - libc , it is just an alias for fputc .
# define putchar ( __c ) fputc ( __c , stdout )
The macro putchar sends character c to stdout .
# define stderr ( __iob [ 2 ] )
Stream destined for error output .
Unless specifically assigned , identical to stdout .
If stderr should point to another stream , the result of another fdevopen ( ) must be explicitly assigned to it without closing the previous stderr ( since this would also close stdout ) .
# define stdin ( __iob [ 0 ] )
Stream that will be used as an input stream by the simplified functions that do n't take a stream argument .
The first stream opened with read intent using fdevopen ( ) will be assigned to stdin .
# define stdout ( __iob [ 1 ] )
Stream that will be used as an output stream by the simplified functions that do n't take a stream argument .
The first stream opened with write intent using fdevopen ( ) will be assigned to both , stdin , and stderr .
Typedef Documentation
typedef struct __file FILE FILE is the opaque structure that is passed around between the various standard IO functions .
Function Documentation
void clearerr ( FILE * __stream )
Clear the error and end - of - file flags of stream .
int fclose ( FILE * __stream )
This function closes stream , and disallows and further IO to and from it .
When using fdevopen ( ) to setup the stream , a call to fclose ( ) is needed in order to free the internal resources allocated .
If the stream has been set up using fdev_setup_stream ( ) or FDEV_SETUP_STREAM ( ) , use fdev_close ( ) instead .
It currently always returns 0 ( for success ) .
FILE * fdevopen ( int ( * ) ( char , FILE *) put , int ( * ) ( FILE *) get )
This function is a replacement for fopen ( ) .
It opens a stream for a device where the actual device implementation needs to be provided by the application .
If successful , a pointer to the structure for the opened stream is returned .
Reasons for a possible failure currently include that neither the put nor the get argument have been provided , thus attempting to open a stream with no IO intent at all , or that insufficient dynamic memory is available to establish a new stream .
If the put function pointer is provided , the stream is opened with write intent .
The function passed as put shall take two arguments , the first a character to write to the device , and the second a pointer to FILE , and shall return 0 if the output was successful , and a nonzero value if the character could not be sent to the device .
If the get function pointer is provided , the stream is opened with read intent .
The function passed as get shall take a pointer to FILE as its single argument , and return one character from the device , passed as an int type .
If an error occurs when trying to read from the device , it shall return _FDEV_ERR .
If an end - of - file condition was reached while reading from the device , _FDEV_EOF shall be returned .
If both functions are provided , the stream is opened with read and write intent .
The first stream opened with read intent is assigned to stdin , and the first one opened with write intent is assigned to both , stdout and stderr . fdevopen ( ) uses calloc ( ) ( und thus malloc ( ) ) in order to allocate the storage for the new stream .
Note
If the macro __STDIO_FDEVOPEN_COMPAT_12 is declared before including < stdio.h > , a function prototype for fdevopen ( ) will be chosen that is backwards compatible with avr -libc version 1.2 and before .
This is solely intented for providing a simple migration path without the need to immediately change all source code .
Do not use for new code .
int feof ( FILE * __stream )
Test the end - of - file flag of stream .
This flag can only be cleared by a call to clearerr ( ) .
int ferror ( FILE * __stream )
Test the error flag of stream .
This flag can only be cleared by a call to clearerr ( ) .
int fflush ( FILE * stream )
Flush stream .
This is a null operation provided for source - code compatibility only , as the standard IO implementation currently does not perform any buffering .
int fgetc ( FILE * __stream )
The function fgetc reads a character from stream .
It returns the character , or EOF in case end - of - file was encountered or an error occurred .
The routines feof ( ) or ferror ( ) must be used to distinguish between both situations .
char* fgets ( char * __str , int __size , FILE * __stream )
Read at most size - 1 bytes from stream , until a newline character was encountered , and store the characters in the buffer pointed to by str .
Unless an error was encountered while reading , the string will then be terminated with a NUL character .
If an error was encountered , the function returns NULL and sets the error flag of stream , which can be tested using ferror ( ) .
Otherwise , a pointer to the string will be returned .
int fprintf ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , ... )
The function fprintf performs formatted output to stream .
See vfprintf ( ) for details .
int fprintf_P ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of fprintf ( ) that uses a fmt string that resides in program memory .
int fputc ( int __c , FILE * __stream )
The function fputc sends the character c ( though given as type int ) to stream .
It returns the character , or EOF in case an error occurred .
int fputs ( const char * __str , FILE * __stream )
Write the string pointed to by str to stream stream .
Returns 0 on success and EOF on error .
int fputs_P ( const char * __str , FILE * __stream ) Variant of fputs ( ) where str resides in program memory .
size_t fread ( void * __ptr , size_t __size , size_t __nmemb , FILE * __stream )
Read nmemb objects , size bytes each , from stream , to the buffer pointed to by ptr .
Returns the number of objects successfully read , i. e. nmemb unless an input error occured or end - of - file was encountered .
feof ( ) and ferror ( ) must be used to distinguish between these two conditions .
int fscanf ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , ... )
The function fscanf performs formatted input , reading the input data from stream .
See vfscanf ( ) for details .
int fscanf_P ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of fscanf ( ) using a fmt string in program memory .
size_t fwrite ( const void * __ptr , size_t __size , size_t __nmemb , FILE * __stream )
Write nmemb objects , size bytes each , to stream .
The first byte of the first object is referenced by ptr .
Returns the number of objects successfully written , i. e. nmemb unless an output error occured .
char* gets ( char * __str ) Similar to fgets ( ) except that it will operate on stream stdin , and the trailing newline ( if any ) will not be stored in the string .
It is the caller 's responsibility to provide enough storage to hold the characters read .
int printf ( const char * __fmt , ... )
The function printf performs formatted output to stream stdout .
See vfprintf ( ) for details .
int printf_P ( const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of printf ( ) that uses a fmt string that resides in program memory .
int puts ( const char * __str )
Write the string pointed to by str , and a trailing newline character , to stdout .
int puts_P ( const char * __str )
Variant of puts ( ) where str resides in program memory .
int scanf ( const char * __fmt , ... )
The function scanf performs formatted input from stream stdin .
See vfscanf ( ) for details .
int scanf_P ( const char * __fmt , ... )
Variant of scanf ( ) where fmt resides in program memory .
int snprintf ( char * __s , size_t __n , const char * __fmt , ... ) Like sprintf ( ) , but instead of assuming s to be of infinite size , no more than n characters ( including the trailing NUL character ) will be converted to s .
Returns the number of characters that would have been written to s if there were enough space .
int snprintf_P ( char * __s , size_t __n , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of snprintf ( ) that uses a fmt string that resides in program memory .
int sprintf ( char * __s , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of printf ( ) that sends the formatted characters to string s .
int sprintf_P ( char * __s , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of sprintf ( ) that uses a fmt string that resides in program memory .
int sscanf ( const char * __buf , const char * __fmt , ... )
The function sscanf performs formatted input , reading the input data from the buffer pointed to by buf .
See vfscanf ( ) for details .
int sscanf_P ( const char * __buf , const char * __fmt , ... ) Variant of sscanf ( ) using a fmt string in program memory .
int ungetc ( int __c , FILE * __stream )
The ungetc ( ) function pushes the character c ( converted to an unsigned char ) back onto the input stream pointed to by stream .
The pushed - back character will be returned by a subsequent read on the stream .
Currently , only a single character can be pushed back onto the stream .
The ungetc ( ) function returns the character pushed back after the conversion , or EOF if the operation fails .
If the value of the argument c character equals EOF , the operation will fail and the stream will remain unchanged .
int vfprintf ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , va_list __ap ) vfprintf is the central facility of the printf family of functions .
It outputs values to stream under control of a format string passed in fmt .
The actual values to print are passed as a variable argument list ap .
vfprintf returns the number of characters written to stream , or EOF in case of an error .
Currently , this will only happen if stream has not been opened with write intent .
The format string is composed of zero or more directives : ordinary characters ( not % ) , which are copied unchanged to the output stream ; and conversion specifications , each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments .
Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character .
The arguments must properly correspond ( after type promotion ) with the conversion specifier .
After the % , the following appear in sequence : Zero or more of the following flags : #
The value should be converted to an " alternate form " .
For c , d , i , s , and u conversions , this option has no effect .
For o conversions , the precision of the number is increased to force the first character of the output string to a zero ( except if a zero value is printed with an explicit precision of zero ) .
For x and X conversions , a non-zero result has the string ` 0 x ' ( or ` 0X ' for X conversions ) prepended to it .
0 ( zero ) Zero padding .
For all conversions , the converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks .
If a precision is given with a numeric conversion ( d , i , o , u , i , x , and X ) , the 0 flag is ignored . - A negative field width flag ; the converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary .
The converted value is padded on the right with blanks , rather than on the left with blanks or zeros .
A - overrides a 0 if both are given . ' ' ( space )
A blank should be left before a positive number produced by a signed conversion ( d , or i ) . +
A sign must always be placed before a number produced by a signed conversion .
A + overrides a space if both are used .
An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width .
If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width , it will be padded with spaces on the left ( or right , if the left - adjustment flag has been given ) to fill out the field width .
An optional precision , in the form of a period .
followed by an optional digit string .
If the digit string is omitted , the precision is taken as zero .
This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for d , i , o , u , x , and X conversions , or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for s conversions .
conversions .
An optional l or h length modifier , that specifies that the argument for the d , i , o , u , x , or X conversion is a " long int " rather than int .
The h is ignored , as " short int " is equivalent to int .
or length modifier , that specifies that the argument for the d , i , o , u , x , or X conversion is a rather than .
The is ignored , as is equivalent to .
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied .
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are : diouxX
The int ( or appropriate variant ) argument is converted to signed decimal ( d and i ) , unsigned octal ( o ) , unsigned decimal ( u ) , or unsigned hexadecimal ( x and X ) notation .
The letters " abcdef " are used for x conversions ; the letters " ABCDEF " are used for X conversions .
The precision , if any , gives the minimum number of digits that must appear ; if the converted value requires fewer digits , it is padded on the left with zeros .

s
The " char * " argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type ( pointer to a string ) .
Characters from the array are written up to ( but not including ) a terminating NUL character ; if a precision is specified , no more than the number specified are written .
If a precision is given , no null character need be present ; if the precision is not specified , or is greater than the size of the array , the array must contain a terminating NUL character .

eE
The double argument is rounded and converted in the format " [ -] d.ddde±dd " where there is one digit before the decimal - point character and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision ; if the precision is missing , it is taken as 6 ; if the precision is zero , no decimal - point character appears .
An E conversion uses the letter ' E ' ( rather than 'e ' ) to introduce the exponent .
The exponent always contains two digits ; if the value is zero , the exponent is 00 .

gG
The double argument is converted in style f or e ( or F or E for G conversions ) .
The precision specifies the number of significant digits .
If the precision is missing , 6 digits are given ; if the precision is zero , it is treated as 1 .
Style e is used if the exponent from its conversion is less than - 4 or greater than or equal to the precision .
Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional part of the result ; a decimal point appears only if it is followed by at least one digit .
The double argument is converted in style or ( or or for conversions ) .

Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional part of the result ; a decimal point appears only if it is followed by at least one digit .
S Similar to the s format , except the pointer is expected to point to a program - memory ( ROM ) string instead of a RAM string .
In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a numeric field ; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width , the field is expanded to contain the conversion result .
Since the full implementation of all the mentioned features becomes fairly large , three different flavours of vfprintf ( ) can be selected using linker options .
The default vfprintf ( ) implements all the mentioned functionality except floating point conversions .
A minimized version of vfprintf ( ) is available that only implements the very basic integer and string conversion facilities , but only the # additional option can be specified using conversion flags ( these flags are parsed correctly from the format specification , but then simply ignored ) .
This version can be requested using the following compiler options : 1 - Wl , -u , vfprintf - lprintf_min - Wl , -u , vfprintf - lprintf_min
If the full functionality including the floating point conversions is required , the following options should be used : 1 - Wl , -u , vfprintf - lprintf_flt - lm - Wl , -u , vfprintf - lprintf_flt - lm Limitations :
The specified width and precision can be at most 255 .
Notes : For floating - point conversions , if you link default or minimized version of vfprintf ( ) , the symbol ?
will be output and double argument will be skiped .
So you output below will not be crashed .
For default version the width field and the " pad to left " ( symbol minus ) option will work in this case .
? will be output and double argument will be skiped .

int vfprintf_P ( FILE * __stream , const char * __fmt , va_list __ap ) Variant of vfprintf ( ) that uses a fmt string that resides in program memory .
int vfscanf ( FILE * stream , const char * fmt , va_list ap ) Formatted input .
This function is the heart of the scanf family of functions .
Characters are read from stream and processed in a way described by fmt .
Conversion results will be assigned to the parameters passed via ap .
The format string fmt is scanned for conversion specifications .
Anything that does n't comprise a conversion specification is taken as text that is matched literally against the input .
White space in the format string will match any white space in the data ( including none ) , all other characters match only itself .
Processing is aborted as soon as the data and format string no longer match , or there is an error or end - of - file condition on stream .
Most conversions skip leading white space before starting the actual conversion .
Conversions are introduced with the character % .
Possible options can follow the % : a * indicating that the conversion should be performed but the conversion result is to be discarded ; no parameters will be processed from ap ,
indicating that the conversion should be performed but the conversion result is to be discarded ; no parameters will be processed from , the character h indicating that the argument is a pointer to short int ( rather than int ) ,
indicating that the argument is a pointer to ( rather than ) , the 2 characters hh indicating that the argument is a pointer to char ( rather than int ) .
indicating that the argument is a pointer to ( rather than ) .
the character l indicating that the argument is a pointer to long int ( rather than int , for integer type conversions ) , or a pointer to double ( for floating point conversions ) ,
In addition , a maximal field width may be specified as a nonzero positive decimal integer , which will restrict the conversion to at most this many characters from the input stream .
This field width is limited to at most 255 characters which is also the default value ( except for the c conversion that defaults to 1 ) .
The following conversion flags are supported : % Matches a literal % character .
This is not a conversion .
Matches a literal character .
This is not a conversion .
d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer ; the next pointer must be a pointer to int .

i Matches an optionally signed integer ; the next pointer must be a pointer to int .
The integer is read in base 16 if it begins with 0x or 0X , in base 8 if it begins with 0 , and in base 10 otherwise .
Only characters that correspond to the base are used .

s Matches a sequence of non-white - space characters ; the next pointer must be a pointer to char , and the array must be large enough to accept all the sequence and the terminating NUL character .
The input string stops at white space or at the maximum field width , whichever occurs first .

c
Matches a sequence of width count characters ( default 1 ) ; the next pointer must be a pointer to char , and there must be enough room for all the characters ( no terminating NUL is added ) .
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed .
To skip white space first , use an explicit space in the format .

To skip white space first , use an explicit space in the format . [
Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set of accepted characters ; the next pointer must be a pointer to char , and there must be enough room for all the characters in the string , plus a terminating NUL character .
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed .
The string is to be made up of characters in ( or not in ) a particular set ; the set is defined by the characters between the open bracket [ character and a close bracket ] character .
The set excludes those characters if the first character after the open bracket is a circumflex ^ .
To include a close bracket in the set , make it the first character after the open bracket or the circumflex ; any other position will end the set .
The hyphen character - is also special ; when placed between two other characters , it adds all intervening characters to the set .
To include a hyphen , make it the last character before the final close bracket .
For instance , [ ^ ] 0 - 9 - ] means the set of everything except close bracket , zero through nine , and hyphen .
The string ends with the appearance of a character not in the ( or , with a circumflex , in ) set or when the field width runs out .
Note that usage of this conversion enlarges the stack expense .

n
Nothing is expected ; instead , the number of characters consumed thus far from the input is stored through the next pointer , which must be a pointer to int .
This is not a conversion , although it can be suppressed with the * flag .
These functions return the number of input items assigned , which can be fewer than provided for , or even zero , in the event of a matching failure .
Zero indicates that , while there was input available , no conversions were assigned ; typically this is due to an invalid input character , such as an alphabetic character for a d conversion .
The value EOF is returned if an input failure occurs before any conversion such as an end - of - file occurs .
If an error or end - of - file occurs after conversion has begun , the number of conversions which were successfully completed is returned .
By default , all the conversions described above are available except the floating - point conversions and the width is limited to 255 characters .
The float - point conversion will be available in the extended version provided by the library libscanf_flt .a .
Also in this case the width is not limited ( exactly , it is limited to 65535 characters ) .
To link a program against the extended version , use the following compiler flags in the link stage : 1 - Wl , -u , vfscanf - lscanf_flt - lm - Wl , -u , vfscanf - lscanf_flt - lm A third version is available for environments that are tight on space .
In addition to the restrictions of the standard one , this version implements no %[ specification .
This version is provided in the library libscanf_min.a , and can be requested using the following options in the link stage : 1 - Wl , -u , vfscanf - lscanf_min - lm - Wl , -u , vfscanf - lscanf_min -lm

Of the three essential material necessities -- food , clothing and shelter -- buildings represent the biggest capital cost and embody the most energy .
Depending on how you add up life cycle costs and inputs , they account for about 40 percent of our energy usage .
Many have long argued that we design and make buildings in a flawed way .
It is only relatively recently , however , that alternatives have been proposed that employ paradigms , rather than just forms , from nature .
Are these paradigms just extensions of the old “ building as machine ” utopian dream ?
I think they are fundamentally different and will outline below why I think so and describe one of the pioneering partnerships that may change the way we make buildings .
First off , how would nature design a building ?
The differences in techniques between nature and technology could n’t be more pronounced .
We work from static blueprints that detail all methods , materials and spatial arrangements at a fixed moment in time .
Nature does not , preferring to impart information with recipes , rather than blueprints , starting with DNA .
Recipes only tell you what ingredients are combined and how and when .
The final form can vary widely , as my daughter can attest when I am in the kitchen .
We tend to work from the top down , setting goals and objectives , visions , five - year plans , national initiatives , company directives and building programs .
Nature builds from the bottom up .
Modular construction ?
Nature perfected it long ago .
Its building processes are based on stringing a tiny number of amino acids together to form thousands of types of protein molecules .
These , in turn , are functionally differentiated by shape and comprise the organelles that make up cells , the building blocks of life .
Incredibly , each of these cells ( except reproductive cells ) contains all the genetic information necessary for the entire organism , but only certain genes are expressed in that cell , making it part of a leaf , stem or root .
We combine building materials ; nature integrates them .
This is a key difference that flows from the bottom up approach : Solutions in nature flow through the hierarchy of scales to facilitate function .
Consider that root and all the levels of organization it employs to capture water and nutrients from the soil , from an efficient branching system to the guard cells at the tip of a growing root hair to the osmotic mechanisms within .
In order to build we obtain materials and manipulate them to the shapes we want by bending , cutting , drilling and then fastening the parts together and throwing away the waste .
Nature does n’t bother with all that , instead forming to shape , as and when it is needed .
We build things to stay put , preferring stability and stiffness in most of our structures .
Nature is n’t so concerned about such issues , and builds instead for toughness and durability .
Steven Vogel , in his classic book Cats ’ Paws and Catapults offers an excellent discussion of this .
As he puts it , “ Humans usually build to a criterion of adequate stiffness , while nature builds to a criterion of adequate strength . ”
Our structures do n’t change very much , because we are so concerned with them staying put .
That 's not so in nature .
For an organism , “ unchanged ” means “ dead . ”
Maintaining a dynamic disequilibrium is what keeps all the living world ’s machinery humming .
This is a key concept for making our built world more sustainable , in my opinion .
“ Surfing for free ” on an existing chemical or physical gradient , as I have written before , will be an important strategy to mimic .
Since our structures do n’t change very much , they do n’t adapt .
Nature is all about adaptability , and that , of course , means real - time feedback loops and all the sensors , actuators and information programs that go with it .
We are just catching on .
This also means , for nature , a fundamental focus on flexibility of parts .
This is in contrast to our obsession with bracing , bolting , gusseting , screwing and nailing all these stiff members .
The organic designs for this flexibility , for all sorts of survival strategies , are the most elegant forms in our world .
The elegance of natural forms is not lost on professors Luke Lee and Maria - Paz Guttierez of the University of California at Berkeley , but part of the beauty that they see lies in function .
Lee , of the Bioengineering Department , and Guttierez , of the Architecture Department , have collaborated on several investigations that are edging us closer to a more nature - based functionality for buildings .
They are concerned principally with a building ’s skin and how that skin can exhibit some of the characteristics outlined above .
Can it be smarter , more resilient , more efficient and more capable ?
Their idea represents a significant intellectual transfer of technical advances in the field of bioengineering to the field of architecture .
In one project , they propose to develop the basis for a new type of thin film building membrane .
The purpose of the membrane is to control three things : humidity , light and temperature transmission into the building .
Space heating , cooling and air conditioning account for roughly one - third of all end - use energy consumption in all U.S. buildings .
As in many natural processes , the membrane system uses the product of the environmental condition it seeks to control as an actuator .
In the membrane , excess moisture , produced by the building ’s atmosphere , triggers openings in the membrane that reduce that production to an acceptable comfort zone .
Other attempts have been made to design this type of system , but the authors claim that this is the first to combine bio-inspired principles in order to achieve such a level of automated control .
The system relies on the physical properties of the materials being used , and therefore does away with the need for power and the bulk material of mechanical elements .
What is revolutionary about their approach , according to Guttierez , is that “ the material has become the system . ”
There are several reasons why this work , although in its earliest stages , is significant .
Material and its structure at the nano and micro scale will be substituting for energy previously spent to solve the problem of climate control in buildings .
In other words , matter is now active matter with the ability to adapt , regulate and control .
This has implications beyond energy use , since such systems can conceivably be more durable and reliable than those dependent on electricity and mechanical armatures .
Scaling solutions to a new challenge also makes this type of work significant and pioneering .
One possible benefit is the ability to calibrate building conditions more efficiently .
Innovation takes many forms and this one is achieved by changing the scale at which one solves a problem like excess moisture .
This type of innovation is likely to become more widespread as the transfer of scientific techniques to building applications continues .
Also , if researchers can prove the practicality of their conceptual solutions , this should pull innovative manufacturing techniques .
Guttierez sees a time in the future when many building processes will emanate from the laboratory as buildings become more and more calibrated to this molecular scale .
This will only widen and accelerate the kind of interdisciplinary approach seen in this project .
Finally , the membrane system was presented as a solution to temporary housing in tropical areas , but impacts of this type of technology could be widespread within society .
As Lee said , “ … the social impacts are important here : for me providing a clean environment is number one , and saving energy is next . ”
The inveterate engineer , he is anxious to get working on the numbers to gauge that contribution .

South Carolina gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley is now implying that blogger Will Focus was paid to claim a sexual relationship with her .
Meanwhile , 2012 Republican presidential candidates are clamoring to show their support .

The gulf between he - said and she - said has only grown since Haley denied Folks 's claim of a relationship Monday .
Now Folks is saying her camp actually asked him how they should deal with the scandal when he went public .
He says he advised that " she and her husband sit down on a sofa together and talk about it the way ( President ) Clinton did . "
Instead Haley went the John Edwards route : deny , deny , deny .
Folks is claiming he has proof of their relationship , but he's now in the strange position of having to save his own ass by providing ammunition against a politician he has supported .
Did Folks and Haley really agree on a damage control strategy , only to have Haley go rogue , putting the two camps at odds ?
Or is something more nefarious at work ?

Haley alleges the latter , hinting darkly , " Political consultants in South Carolina take care of those that pay them . "
She 's implying that Folks has now switched allegiances , and is taking money from one of her opponents .
Thickening the plot further is the fact that adversary Gresham Barrett 's campaign , which Folks claims pressured him to break the scandal , is also in denial mode , claiming they had nothing to do with it .
It 's still hard to tell who is lying here — is it more likely that Hailey is trying to save her gubernatorial chances , or that Folks is a turncoat who sold her out ?
Or , even more excitingly , that Folks has been a double agent the entire time , pretending to support her while looking for a way to bring her down ?
The smart money now looks like it's on Folks : his side of the story is starting to look more legit since he released texts purporting to show communication between himself , an AP reporter , and the Haley campaign in the days leading up to his post .
Whatever the outcome , we hope Mike Nichols is taking notes .
Beyond the shock value of a woman in politics being accused of infidelity , the Haley case has other implications outside South Carolina politics .
Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo explains :
Remember that South Carolina is quickly becoming the pivotal early GOP primary state .
And if all goes according to plan and these affair allegations do n't do her in , Haley could be the Republican Governor of the state in 2011 / 2012 .
And that would make her a critical kingmaker for the Republican presidential hopefuls .
So if you want to succeed Barack Obama in 2013 , you want to be her friend .

Which is probably why Mitt Romney says , " I stand four square by Nikki Haley . "
And why Sarah Palin — whose endorsement made a leading contender in the first place — told South Carolinians , " do n't let some blogger make any accusation against your Nikki , " and " for traditional media to rely on an accusation via some blog entry is almost laughable . "
Memo to Palin : we know it 's a popular sport to dismiss bloggers as gossip - mongers who do n't bother to check facts , but this works less well when said bloggers are talking about their own lives .
Sure , Folks could be lying , but that would be true whether he was posting his claims on a blog , in one of the mainstream media outlets Palin loves so much , or , say , on Facebook .
Whatever the case , both Palin and Romney are clearly gambling that Haley will survive the allegations , and return their favor in 2012 .
We 'll see who 's right .

A new book about President Obama alleges he once used the vulgar term " tea - bagger " to refer to the Tea Party movement .
Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter , in his book " The Promise : President Obama , Year One , " to be released May 18 , quotes the president as saying that Republican opposition to the economic stimulus package " helped create the tea - baggers and empowered that whole wing of the Republican Party where it now controls the agenda for the Republicans , " according to a Washington Post report on the book .
" Tea - bagging " has been used as a derogatory term for the Tea Party movement because of its sexual connotations .
Tea Party sympathizers were quick to respond .
" It is insulting to have him lecture on civility while being the least civil participant , " Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform said in a written statement .
" Obama , get out of the gutter , wash your mouth out with soap and grow up . "
White House spokesman Bill Burton responded Wednesday evening by saying he had no reason to dispute the accuracy of the quote in Alterman 's book , adding that the term was not meant to be derogatory in any way .
Ever wonder why eggs , bacon and fried potatoes are so popular at breakfast ?
A new study suggests our bodies are primed to eat high - fat meals upon waking , and that high - carbohydrate breakfasts ( mmm , pancakes ) set us up to be unable to process high - fat meals later in the day .
How on Earth did scientists scrounge up some kind of proof that we ’re born to eat stuff like this when we wake up ?
By running experiments on mice , of course .
Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Baylor College of Medicine kept two groups of mice .
One group got a high - fat meal upon waking and a low - fat meal before bedtime ; the other had the low - fat meal first and the high - fat meal for dinner .
Both groups of mice consumed “ identical ” amounts of total calories and calories from fat .
But the mice with high - fat breakfasts had “ significantly lower body weights and body fat composition ” than their counterparts who ate high - fat dinners , according to their study published this week in the International Journal of Obesity .
Those were n’t the only differences .
The mice that began the day with more carbs developed insulin resistance , a condition that increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
They also wound up with more insulin , leptin and triglycerides circulating in their blood , which are also associated with diabetes and heart disease .
Why would it matter whether mice eat a high - fat meal for breakfast or for dinner ?
The researchers think it ’s because that first meal of the day sets the body ’s metabolism – those who eat a hearty breakfast are able to handle a regular meal at dinnertime , but those who start the day with carbs are n’t equipped to process a high - fat meal later on .
Here ’s how they put it :
“ Consumption of a high - fat waking meal is associated with increased ability to respond appropriately to carbohydrate meals ingested later … whereas a high - carbohydrate morning meal seems to ‘ fix ’ the metabolism toward carbohydrate usage and impairs the ability to adjust metabolism toward fat usage later . ”
However , they also point out that “ a typical human diet consists of a high - carbohydrate morning meal , followed by higher fat and / or more calorie - dense meals later in the day . ”
It seems we have it all backward .
Perhaps the best way to tackle the obesity crisis is to start serving pancakes , waffles and cereal for dinner .

Willow Garage is making a play to become the definitive platform for robotics research .
They have a powerful tag team of open source hardware and software – the PR2 Beta robot and the Robot Operating System ( ROS ) .
Willow Garage is giving away eleven of these bots to research groups around the world to foster innovation through open source collaboration .
But by distributing the PR2 they are n’t just invigorating robotics research , they ’re also placing the PR2 at the center of that burgeoning industry .
ROS is gaining ground rapidly too , well on its way to becoming the Linux of robotics .
Together these two systems form an amazing platform that is open for everyone to share .
A flurry of new research is set to explode forth from this platform , and Willow Garage will be at the center of it all .
Founder Scott Hassan and co-directors Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek delved into the power and promise of the Willow Garage platform at the recent launch event for the PR2 Beta robot give away .
Check out their presentations in the video below .
Willow Garage makes the PR2 robot , but they are years from commercializing it .
Even when they do , it will be entirely open source .
ROS is a joint project shared among dozens of groups , but Willow Garage is the driving force behind it .
It too is open source .
I know some may marvel at how a Silicon Valley company can invest millions into these products and yet not hold any exclusive intellectual property rights .
How is this going to work out for Willow Garage ?
Very well , I suspect .
Willow Garage is on the way to making their combined hardware / software platform ( PR2 / ROS ) a cornerstone of robotics research .
They ’ll be a nexus for an industry that will soon expand enormously .
Open source or not , when Willow Garage commercializes , I think they ’ll be just fine .
In the meantime they are laying the foundation for a revolution in robotic innovation … so it ’s a net win for everyone .
Watching Hassan , Berger , and Wyrobek in the clip below , I get the impression that I ’m looking at some of the most visionary guys in the field .
The only ones that outshine them are the PR2 robots themselves .
Do n’t miss their arrival around 4:45 .

PANJWAI DISTRICT , AFGHANISTAN — Seconds after the command “ Guns ! Guns ! Guns ! ” crackled over the loudspeakers , Canadian soldiers were swarming around their howitzers , preparing to open fire .
One shouted coordinates , others cranked hard to get the long barrel up and precisely aimed .
Another placed a hand - held computer over the tip of a 155 mm shell to feed blast instructions to a memory chip in the fuse .
Then they loaded the round , weighing close to 45 kilos , into the breech – putting one in the pipe , in soldier slang .
Gunner Alberto Basallo , 26 , of Toronto , stood to the side of the hulking weapon with a rope lanyard limply cradled in his hands .
Yanking it tight would send a shell with a kill radius measured in metres hurtling through the desert air with the speed of a rifle shot .
Muscles taut , everyone waited as a forward observation officer ’s request for artillery fire , against a group of insurgents spotted to the east , worked its way up the chain of command .
It is a ritual the unit knows too well : Rush to the brink of lethal force , stop short and wait while combat officers , sometimes even military lawyers , study the target from somewhere unseen , weigh the risks of injuring or killing civilians along with insurgents , and make the final call .
Adrenalin pumping , B Troop killed time by the big gun with anxious small talk .
One marvelled at how a camel spider , its body almost as big as a man ’s thumb , with legs as long as fingers , tore apart a scorpion in a cardboard box death match the other night .
The loudspeaker interrupted .
The chatter stopped .
“ Unload , ” ordered the gunners ’ commander , Lieutenant Colin McConnell .
“ End of mission . ”
Like air rushing out of a balloon , the unit ’s spirit deflated .
“ Same old show , ” a soldier grumbled as he did the drudge work of standing down , for the nth time .
The gunners and bombardiers in B Troop , D Battery , of the 1st Royal Canadian Regiment battle group , are not hungry to kill .
But they do want to win this war against an increasingly aggressive and inventive enemy .
And like many foreign troops putting their lives on the line in southern Afghanistan , Canadian soldiers often feel they ’re fighting with one hand tied behind their back .
Canadian and other U.S. - led NATO combat troops are told to avoid civilian casualties at all costs under a counter - insurgency strategy that stresses the need to make civilians feel secure from intimidation by Taliban and allied fighters .
In theory , that ’s supposed to separate the insurgents from civilian support and cover .
In Panjwai district , where Canadian troops acknowledge large no - go areas under tight Taliban control , many Afghans work both sides of the fence to survive .
The military ’s strict rules of engagement allow Western soldiers to shoot in self - defence , but when insurgents open fire , it ’s usually in hit - and - run operations .
They can quickly retreat to villages , or through farmers ’ fields , where the insurgents ’ most deadly weapons , such as booby - trapped jugs , cooking pots and other improvised explosive devices , lie in wait for any soldiers who follow on foot .
McConnell ’s soldiers think they if they had more time in the fight , they could make it a lot harder for the enemy to move around and prepare to kill .
The Toronto - born lieutenant is known as “ Doc . ” He has a PhD from Liverpool University in biomechanics , which McConnell describes as biology explained in terms of physics and engineers .
He is a smart man , who has been a soldier most of his life since he signed up at the Moss Park Armoury as a teenager .
He demands precision .
And his unit goes to great lengths to be confident that they can provide pinpoint fire that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties , which make it easier for insurgents to turn Afghans against foreign forces .
B Troop has its own weatherman , Master Corporal Charles Loykowski , 49 , of Pembroke , Ontario , who sends up helium - filled balloons several times a day to measure factors like wind speed , air pressure and humidity that affect a shell ’s trajectory .
The information is fed into the unit ’s targeting computers , which even compensate for the distance the Earth rotates in the seconds an artillery shell takes to arc through the air and strike ground .
“ Have you ever dropped a rock down a well or a deep hole ? ” the lieutenant asked , by way of explanation .
“ The rock seems to curve and hit the wall as it goes down .
“ Well it ’s not .
The rock ’s going in a straight line toward the centre of the earth .
And the earth is turning .
The wall is getting closer to the rock . ”
Science has made modern artillery so accurate that one of B Troop ’s Howitzers recently fired a smoke round into the small crater caused by the shot fired from another nearby gun — at almost the same time .
And time is often the gunners ’ worst enemy .

When the soldiers loaded to fire explosive rounds this week , the insurgents they were targeting moved while the gunners waited for the request to shoot slowly worked its way up the chain of command .
There were a lot of soldiers swearing .
They know it is their job to follow orders that come from far above their pay scale , but they still gripe about the ones that make no sense to them .
They also train for hours in desert dust blown by a blast furnace wind , practising in sandbagged mortar pits to make sure they ’re on target , and fast , dropping for push - ups to focus minds when they ’re as little as a millimetre off .
When their weapons and war - fighting skills do n’t get used , they wonder if the insurgents ’ offensive is more effective because the long - promised NATO offensive is too timid .
Rear Admiral Bob Davidson , a senior strategic planner at national defence headquarters , touched gingerly on the issue during a visit to this front line base Wednesday .
He asked McConnell and his troops when they last fired .
A week earlier , a soldier replied .
“ Our mission is not to provide fire support .
It is to be prepared to provide fire support , ” McConnell pointed out .
“ That can be frustrating in itself , ” Davidson said diplomatically , reading the soldiers ’ minds .
Signs of shaky discipline further up the combat chain of command have n’t helped ease concerns on the front lines that the wheels may be coming off the war effort .
First , Canadian commander Brigadier - General Daniel Menard was relieved of duty in the war zone , and is still under investigation , for allegedly having sex with a master corporal while he was sending troops into battle .
Then , U.S. General Stanley McChrystal , the top commander of American , Canadian and other NATO troops in Afghanistan , was fired this week for trash - talking his boss , the President of the United States , and colleagues in front of a Rolling Stone reporter .
They ’re things that cross a soldier ’s mind during the long hours B Troop spends manning a hilltop observation post with a 360 - degree view of the farmers ’ fields clinging to the Arghandab River ’s banks , and the desert beyond .
To the west , the Taliban are in firm control of no man ’s land .
The troops see armed men , presumed to be insurgents , openly meeting in nearby villages , where Canadian soldiers do n’t go .
Insurgents move so freely around a front line base that they are able to plant improvised explosive devices on the dirt road leading to the front gate , and regularly take pot shots at passing convoys or low - flying helicopters .
An army officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence on insurgents and local tribal politics , defended the strategy of restraint as a crucial weapon against insurgent “ information operations , ” sometimes called propaganda .
“ Say there ’s four insurgents , and the good gun commander here gets orders to fire and those four insurgents get killed , and a piece of shrapnel the size of a hubcap decapitates a 12 - year - old kid standing by , ” the officer said .
“ At that point , the four insurgents who were killed are forgotten .
What ’s highlighted is that 12 - year - old kid . ”
Bad kills mean bad news , which can turn victory into defeat .
And as much as an artillery gunner may want to turn an insurgent into pink mist , commanders have to calculate the risks of losing hearts and minds .
“ Make no mistake about it , ” he added , “ we ’ve had incidents a kilometre and a half from here where there ’s been pink mist .
And we ’ll have plenty more incidents in the next six months . ”

Flying - car enthusiasts are justified in their pessimism :
For the past hundred years or so , they 've repeatedly been promised that a future with a personal aircraft in every garage is just around the corner , only to have their high - flying dreams cruelly smacked down with words like " safety " and " physics . "
But now , after so many years of empty promises and false hopes ... here are some more :
The Federal Aviation Administration has finally given approval to the Terrafugia 's Transistion , a flying car – or " roadable aircraft " as the company likes to call it – that will soon have us all living like the Jetsons .
Honest .
According to Terrafugia 's website , the Transition 's rear propeller gives it a cruising speed of 115 m.p.h. , and it 's 20 gallon tank - which takes regular unleaded gas – gives it a range of 460 miles .
On the ground , the vehicle 's gas mileage is a not - too - shabby 30 miles per gallon .
The anticipated purchase price is $ 194,000 , just slightly more than the cost of a new iPad ( the gold - plated kind ) .

The flying car
Approval from the FAA was delayed because of the Transition 's weight .
As Wired notes , the vehicle 's 1,430 lb. curb weight was 110 pounds over the legal limit for a Light Sport Aircraft , the kind that requires only 20 hours of practice before they hand you a license .
But the FAA has now granted a dispensation to the Transition , meaning that it will still be able to carry safety features like airbags and crumple zones .
The tech blog DVICE is skeptical .
" Think of how much quicker you 'll be able to pick up the kids from school with this thing ! " writes Adam Frucci .
" And how much more likely you 'll be to crash into the top of a house on the way home ! "
But hey , at least it will have airbags .

I ’d be surprised if you had n’t heard about ACell , or at least about some of their results .
Their MatriStem powder has been able to grow back people ’s missing fingertips .
A cut off finger is sprinkled with the pig - derived material every other day , and in a few weeks the missing tip is regrown .
It ’s been everywhere on TV in the last few years including the Oprah Winfrey Show with Dr. Oz and 60 Minutes .
That ’s actually been a bad thing .
People have dismissed these results because of the natural healing of fingertips .
Well , ACell ’s technology can do a lot more than just give you the finger .
We ’ve got videos and photos below to explain how this form of regenerative medicine is poised to make a big difference in surgery .
ACell is n’t the only name in the pig - derived matrix game .
Cook Biotech , who we ’ve discussed before has a somewhat similar line of products that have been used to promote rapid healing after surgery .
What are they selling ?
Acellular , or extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , which is like a scaffolding for the cells in your body .
Pigs and people systems are close enough that ECM taken from the porkers can be processed and reformed into sheets or powders compatible with humans .
When placed on a surface wound , or used to connect a gap in internal tissue , the ECM serves as a medium upon which your body ’s cells can grow .
As your body grows upon the scaffold , it is slowly absorbed and metabolized into the body .
This allows for faster healing and the generation of normal tissue where the wound used to be .
It is likely ( as experiments in mice have shown ) that the ECM is actually attracting stem cells from your marrow to itself and that these stem cells are at least partially responsible for the rapid , more complete healing associated with the technology .
The media has typically focused on a few anecdotal cases of impressive healing associated with the technology .
I think Oprah ’s a great example of this approach to the topic .
So , yeah .
People have regrown fingertips using a powdered form of ACell ’s MatriStem ECM product .
The first such case was Lee Spievack , brother to Alan who was one of the original scientific minds behind ACell ’s founding ( he has since passed away ) .
Others include Mike Christensen , from Nebraska , who regrew a 16 mm portion of his left thumb .
While Spievack received his treatment for free , Christensen paid about $ 1200 for his powdered MatriStem which was prescribed and applied by a doctor .
“ $ 1200 for a new thumb ” , you say , “ sign me up ! ”
But that ’s kind of the problem .
ACell has been called quack science and other derivative names in the press because of the sensationalized cases of these fingertip stories .
Its critics point out that fingertips sometimes will regrow on their own .
Not completely .
Not 16 mm perhaps , but a good percentage of that , especially among the very young .
“ This is n’t miracle science ” , they say , “ it ’s a natural healing process . ”
It does n’t help that most television programs that discuss the technology get hyperbolic very quickly .
We can heal any wound !
We ’ll be able to regrow your limbs !
We ’ll turn you into a lizard !
No , no , and weird .
Luckily , we can throw away all the anecdotal and controversial evidence for finger regeneration .
We do n’t need it .
ECM technology has many more applications and many more successes to support its claims .
It has been shown to be effective in surgeries involving the heart , esophagus , hernia , surface injuries , bladder , orthopedics , and ear drum .
It has helped humans heal fissures in skin , ligament , and muscle tissues .
Steven Badylak , a researcher in regenerative medicine at the University of Pittsburgh , gave a great overview of acellular / extracellular matrices back in 2008 at Pop Tech .
Skip to - 14:15 to get to the good stuff , and watch out for the obligatory fingertip mention at - 5:10 .
I must admit that I have been very cautious about believing in ACell ’s technology .
In fact , I may have yelled disparaging words at my TV when I first saw it appear on daytime television .
The idea of a powder regrowing limbs seemed like pure science fiction .
Now , my opinion about the technology is much closer to ‘ begrudgingly optimistic ’ .
Anthony Atala , a name in regenerative medicine I have come to respect , is one of the members of ACell ’s scientific board .
The MatriStem product ( in both sheets and powders ) is FDA approved for surgical and topical uses .
The list of ACell publications continues to grow , with many peer - reviewed - journal articles .
Their veterinary applications ( horses especially ) are also well researched and reviewed .
Yes there ’s a lot of idiotic hype on the web about this technology , and I do n’t want to be associated with it , but I ca n’t ignore that ECM has been shown to be ‘ good science ’ .
It seems that MatriStem , or some other ECM product from ACell or Cook Biotech or their competitors , is going to start becoming a more widely used tool in surgery .
But it will be just one of many .
We ’ve seen different regenerative medicine technologies lately that are likely to fit together or work in different tiers .
Skin printing and ECMs may help with surface injuries .
ECMs will assist with surgeries for injured internal organs .
Organ printing or stem cells on collagen scaffolds will allow us to replace organs that can not be healed .
Some form of advanced transplants may be able to replace large portions of our missing bodies ( including faces and hands ) .
Minor regeneration of missing parts could be accomplished via ECM , protein treatments to affect stem cell activation , and other techniques .
When regenerative medicine as a field finally breaks through into standard medical practice , we ’ll have all these options and more .
The next generation in healing is near .
Dear EarthTalk : A friend with many minor health problems recently switched to a diet of only raw plant foods and reports feeling much better .
She also insists her new eating habits are better for the environment .
Does this make sense or is the strange diet making her crazy ?
— Phil C. , Reno , Nev .
A raw foods diet typically consists of unprocessed foods that are not heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit so as to preserve nutrients otherwise lost during cooking .
Proponents claim that besides losing weight and feeling more energetic , they are also avoiding the carcinogens introduced into foods by cooking and protecting the environment from drug - and chemical - dependent , water - wasting big - business agriculture .
Some people do short spurts on the raw diet to cleanse their system of toxins , while others maintain a majority raw diet but do eat some cooked or processed foods .
Diabetics can especially benefit from a raw foods diet , as shown in the film Simply Raw , which documents the trials and tribulations of six diabetes sufferers who go on a raw foods diet for one month and effectively cure themselves of their disease .
While humans have been eating raw foods since they first began foraging for their sustenance , the diet really began to catch on in recent years when some high - profile celebrities began touting its health and weight maintenance benefits .
Carol Alt , Woody Harrelson , Uma Thurman , Sting and Demi Moore are just a few of the big names who swear by the raw foods diet — and now upwards of 100 raw foods restaurants are in operation across the U.S.
For a list of raw food eateries by state , check out the SoyStache website .
Most raw food devotees are vegans , that is , no animal products whatsoever but all the vegetables , sprouts and grains they can muster .
Some do eat raw dairy , eggs and even meat — being careful to choose only the freshest stuff so as to avoid getting sick from bacterial contamination .
One should n’t embark on a raw foods diet without researching how to make a smooth transition and maintain a proper nutrient balance .
Some people hire raw food coaches or consult with nutritionists to walk them through the transition or help them through a cleansing , while others do it themselves with help from friends , natural food store employees , and websites .
The Best of Raw Food website , for example , has a plethora of information on how to make the transition .
It lists replacement foods for first transitioning to and then maintaining a raw food diet , and provides a tutorial on how to gauge the safety of raw foods .
Those serious about going raw will need a good quality juicer , a blender or food processor , large glass containers to soak and sprout seeds , grains and beans , and mason jars for storing sprouts and other food .
Dehydrators that blow air through food at less than 115 degrees Fahrenheit are also popular accessories .
There are some cautions to keep in mind .
Cathy Wong of About.com warns that some people experience a detox reaction when transitioning , especially if their old diet was rich in meat , sugar and caffeine — but the negative effects ( headaches , nausea , cravings ) usually only last a few days .
Also , she says , going raw is not advised for children , pregnant or nursing women , or those with anemia or at risk for osteoporosis .

BOULDER , Colo .
— Boulder police say a homeless man who was panhandling on a highway off - ramp wearing only a pair of panties on his head is the first person to be arrested under the city ’s new public nudity law .
Fifty - five - year - old Glenn Ford received an 8 - day jail sentence Friday after his arrest Thursday afternoon .
Police say several motorists called to complain about Ford .
Police say Ford appeared to be drunk and refused to get dressed .
Boulder ’s law went into effect May 6 .
It prohibits anyone older than 10 from showing their genitals in public or in private property where they may be seen .
Women can still be topless in public .
Without the new law , police say nude offenders faced stricter punishment , including having to register as a sex offender .

The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported today that the planned merger of Continental Airlines into United Airlines could face turbulence during Congressional analysis of the subject , and also during the ultimate decision , which will be made by the Justice Department .
Congress has only an advisory role in the process , but has already scheduled hearings to that effect .
The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust , Competition Policy , and Consumer Rights will take a look at what the planned merger will mean for air travelers , next week .
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee will do a similar analysis next month .
Democrat members of Congress have expressed concern that the merger will result in fewer routes and higher fares for air travelers .
But a union representing United Airlines pilots believes that job security for its pilots will increase because the two airlines , as presently constituted , have very little route overlap anyway .
This lack of route overlap suggests that fewer routes will not be a significant consequence of the planned merger , if it is approved .
Lawmakers from Texas have noted that because the resulting airline would be based in Chicago , Houston , where Continental is based , would lose jobs .
And despite the reported lack of route overlap between United and Continental , unions representing flight attendants and baggage handlers nevertheless believe some of their 26,000 jobs ( at both United at Continental ) will be lost if the merger is approved .
Public relations concerns are also important to the two airlines .
Experts say United and Continental will work to ensure the hearings do not descend into anarchy .
And all this economic analysis is completely aside from the legal hurdles the merger will face .
United and Continental have jointly launched a website explaining the planned merger in greater detail .

ATLANTA — A gay Atlanta pastor and his partner who have been at the center of a battle over the treatment of gay clergy by the nation 's largest Lutheran denomination are being reinstated to the denomination 's clergy roster , church officials announced Tuesday .
The Rev. Bradley Schmeling and his partner , the Rev. Darin Easler , have been approved for reinstatement , the Chicago - based Evangelical Lutheran Church in America said in a news release .
The approval came roughly eight months after the denomination voted to allow gays and lesbians in committed relationships to serve as clergy , and just weeks after the ELCA 's church council officially revised the church 's policy on gay ministers .
Schmeling , who serves as pastor of St. John 's Lutheran Church in Atlanta , was removed from the church 's clergy roster in 2007 for being in a same - sex relationship with Easler .
A disciplinary committee ruled that Schmeling was violating an ELCA policy regarding the sexual conduct of pastors .
" I 'm grateful that this journey has come full circle and that the church has changed its policy , " Schmeling said Tuesday .
" I think the church saw the gifts and the abilities of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people and saw that the spirit was calling them into ministry and wanted to create a way for people to serve , " he said .
The reinstatement will become effective " once the paperwork has been filed , " which should happen in the coming days or weeks , he said .
At their biennial national convention in August , ELCA leaders called for revisions to ministry policy documents , making it possible for " eligible Lutherans in publicly accountable , lifelong , monogamous , same - gender relationships " to serve as clergy , the church said in the statement .
The ELCA Church Council adopted those revisions April 10 .
The candidacy committee of the ELCA Southeastern Synod in Atlanta met two weeks later and approved Schmeling 's request for reinstatement .
Even though Schmeling had been removed from the ELCA clergy roster , he remained pastor at St. John 's , putting the church in violation of ELCA guidelines , said the Rev. H. Julian Gordy , bishop of the ELCA Southeastern Synod .
" There are people in our church that believe that pastors in publicly accountable , lifelong , monogamous , same - gender relationships should not serve as pastors in this church , " Gordy said in the church statement .
" But the assembly said that while we were not in agreement on this , congregations could call persons in such relationship to serve as pastors , and St. John has chosen to do this . "
Despite the opposition from some to the change in church policy , " I believe that we will learn to live in this new reality , " Gordy said .
" This congregation has always been clear in its affirmation and support of our relationship , " Schmeling said .
" When I told them that I had met my partner for life , they threw us a party .
When they heard that we were both reinstated to the clergy roster , there was a spontaneous standing ovation in church on Sunday . "
Ann Gerondelis , 51 , who has attended St. John 's since 1981 , said the congregation never saw Schmeling any differently after he was removed from the clergy roll , but they were still thrilled to hear he would be reinstated .
" I 'm very excited to be a part of the ELCA at this time , " she said .
" The ELCA has now shown it is committed to unity .
...
We 're bound together with people who may not see things the same way we do but that 's an important part of our journey . "
Easler said he left United Redeemer Lutheran Church in Zumbrota , Minn. , in 2003 because he disagreed with the church 's policy and also because he wanted to minister to people in a hospital and hospice setting .
He and Schmeling met at a church conference in Minnesota in 2004 , and he moved to Atlanta to be with Schmeling the following year .
Easler was removed from the clergy roster in 2006 after having been without a parish for three years , the church said in a statement .
He transferred to the United Church of Christ , which is a full communion partner of the ELCA , and worked in hospice care as a bereavement coordinator .
He recently applied to the candidacy committee of the ELCA 's Southeastern Minnesota Synod in Rochester and was approved April 30 .
He plans to continue his hospice work under the auspices of the ELCA .
" I just feel so grateful to be able to come back to my church home and church family , and I 'm grateful to be able to share with the church both my love and my gifts for ministry but also the love for my partner , " Easler said .
Schmeling said the reinstatement is good news for others as well .
" I 'm happy for the many people who always hoped to be ordained as pastors now have an open pathway before them , " he said .

California can expect a barrage of legal challenges to its many strict gun control regulations as a result of Monday ’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that state and local governments are bound to adhere to the constitutional right to bear arms .
In a 5 - 4 ruling , the court found that a Chicago - area ban on handguns can be challenged on Second Amendment grounds , meaning that the law will not stand if it is found to trample on the right to self - defense inherent in the federal constitution .
The high court has never before said that state and local gun regulations must meet a Second Amendment threshold , and the new ruling implicates laws ranging from California ’s long - standing and controversial assault weapons ban to local efforts to limit the sale and possession of certain types of handguns .
The Monday decision returns the Chicago law to the lower courts , where many experts believe it will be struck down because it is a highly restrictive form of gun law .
But where the line will be drawn regarding less restrictive laws is not clear ; the court stressed that the Second Amendment by itself does not bar reasonable gun regulations , whether to stem urban violence or protect children around schools and other vulnerable areas .
Perhaps the first major local test involves a case out of Alameda County , where a legal challenge to an ordinance banning gun sales on county property has been on hold in a federal appeals court while the Supreme Court was mulling the Second Amendment issue .
For the most part , legal experts predict that the majority of California ’s gun laws will survive .
But California is one of the few states that does not have the equivalent of the Second Amendment in its state constitution , so lawyers challenging those laws will have new arguments to make as a result of Monday ’s ruling .
Legal experts predict years of litigation before the courts sort out which laws hold up against that strong constitutional right .
“ I still think that in a majority of these cases , ( the challenges ) are going to lose , ” said Pratheepan Gulasekaram , a Santa Clara University law professor .
“ But ( local governments ) are going to spend a significant amount of state and local money defending these lawsuits . ”
Political lines prevail
The court divided along liberal - conservative lines , with Justice Samuel Alito writing the majority ruling , joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas .
Justices Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and John Paul Stevens dissented .
San Jose attorney Don Kilmer , who represents gun rights advocates in the Alameda County case , said he is “ optimistic ” the Supreme Court ’s ruling will strengthen the argument that the Second Amendment protects the right to hold a gun show at the county fairgrounds .
But Sayre Weaver , a lawyer for Alameda County , maintains the Supreme Court ’s decision will not affect the legal status quo .
A three - judge 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel already found that the Second Amendment should apply to the law but upheld it nevertheless .
The ruling was put on hold by an 11 - judge panel when the issue reached the Supreme Court .
“ There ’s nothing the court said ( Monday ) that would change that conclusion , ” Weaver said of the 9th Circuit ’s earlier ruling upholding the law .
Meanwhile , leading California gun rights lawyer Chuck Michel said the Supreme Court clearly left it up to the lower courts to figure out where to draw the line on gun regulation .
“ This will get the courts to make specific determinations about some specific laws , ” he said .
There are a host of gun control laws targeted in California , some of them already tied up in the courts awaiting the outcome in the Supreme Court .
In addition to the Alameda County case , there is a challenge to San Francisco ’s ordinance requiring handguns to be stored in a locked container or have a triggerlock and challenges in Sacramento to California ’s process of issuing permits for concealed weapons , which critics say is arbitrary .
The Supreme Court ’s Monday ruling extends a line of argument that dates to 2008 , when the court ruled that the Second Amendment applies to federal gun regulations as it struck down a Washington , D.C. , handgun ban .
The 2008 ruling left the state and local issue unresolved because the District of Columbia is a federal enclave .
That set up the showdown over the Chicago handgun ban , considered the strictest brand of gun regulation because it places limits on the right to bear arms in the home .
In Monday ’s decision , the majority emphasized that the right to bear arms is particularly important in the home and that Chicago ’s law is the type that is most intrusive .
Chicago ’s strict ban is unusual ; there are no current bans on handguns in the home in Northern California cities .
Evaluations begin
Now the question is where courts will draw the line in evaluating other , less intrusive gun laws that states maintain are crucial to protecting public safety .
Gun rights advocates plan to press those cases , including continuing efforts to overturn California ’s assault weapons ban .
A state appeals court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to that law last year , but the issue is expected to be revived .
Legal experts generally believe such state restrictions will hold up , even citing language from the Supreme Court that the ruling “ does not imperil every law regulating firearms . ”
In his dissent , Stevens warned that the court had left state and local efforts to reduce gun violence vulnerable , saying the “ consequences could prove far more destructive — quite literally — to our nation ’s communities and to our constitutional structure . ”
Douglas Berman , an Ohio State University law professor following the case closely , predicted that one of the byproducts of the ruling would be challenges in state courts by defendants facing various gun-related charges who argue the right to bear arms .
And given the split in the Supreme Court , Berman said the courts are likely to be equally divided when they address those legal challenges .
“ There is going to be so much of this litigation , ” Berman said .

The esteemed film critic and prolific tweeter criticized five kids who wore American flag T - shirts and bandannas to school on Cinco de Mayo .
The Tea Party beast was awakened , and mocked his recent cancer and the disfigurement it left him .
Five kids were sent home from a California high school on Wednesday for what seems like a fairly open - and - shut case of trying to start trouble .
Of course , to the nutbag right , this was not the case at all and the whole thing was anti-American .
Last week Ebert sent this message in response to the story :
@ebertchicago Kids who wear American Flag t- shirts on 5 May should have to share a lunchroom table with those who wear a hammer and sickle on 4 July .
According to an Ebert blog post today , it was met with predictable outrage from people with predictable Twitter handles :
@lonestarag05 : Its the USA not Mexico .
They are allowed to be proud of their country .
I wonder sometimes why you even stay here .
Ebert has defended the Tweet very eloquently here .
He points out , using humor , reason , logic and fact that the kids had done something analogous to wearing a Union Jack on St. Patrick 's day in Boston , or a Confederate flag to the Bud Biliken parade in Chicago — they were disrespecting the heritage of a community busy celebrating that heritage .
Like , for example , " wearing the hammer and sickle on the Fourth of July . "
He adds in the blog post that those who defended the kids might try that " at a NASCAR race , for example . "
Of course humor , reason , logic and fact are utterly alien to the Tea Party and their enraged acolytes .
And they know no sense of proportion .
Ebert , as this excellent Esquire profile outlines , has suffered through repeated bouts of cancer , and operations to remove that cancer , that have left him without a lower jaw .
The picture above is the one that Esquire ran with that profile .
Knowing what we know about the Tea Party it should n't have been surprising when Ebert tweeted this last night .
But it was sad .
UPDATE : Commenter Atlasfugged points out that these are probably among the Tweets that Ebert was responding to .
MediaMatters have more .
The man behind this particular batch is called Caleb Howe .
He blogs at Redstate.com .
The picture from his Twitter profile is inset .
Howe , of course , is perfectly entitled to say what he likes .
We 're sure Ebert would be the first to defend his right to free speech .
But we 've emailed Howe to ask for a comment , and whether he stands by his tweets as a proportionate response .
As he cites Redstate as his official website on the Twitter feed , we 've also emailed them to ask if they stand behind their contributor .
Any responses will be posted here .
What in the name of Zeus is fsockopen ?
If you did n’t already know , fsockopen is a function in enables us to connect to remote hosts by opening sockets to them .
Have you heard some Linux user say everything in Linux is a file ?
Apparently fsockopen treats sockets like files too .
You know what this means do n’t you ,
We can use it like fopen to read and write from those open socket using functions like fwrite and fread .
I think you can think of some cool uses for it already :P .
Things you need to know
The only thing I assume you know to completely understand this article is the basics of PHP .
Alright , so how do I create an IRC Bot ?
Have you seen those fancy IRC bots and wondered how you can make them ?
Maybe not .
But if you have , you ’re in luck , because that ’s what we ’re gonna do in this article .
Build an IRC bot , and its easy too .
Woohoo :D .
But first some basic IRC commands
NICK : Sets the nick or display name you want to use in an IRC server or channel .
USER : I think its the same as nick , I ’m not sure because , IRC clients like mIRC often set this variable as username on local computer .
You can use the same value for for nick and user .
JOIN : Join a channel .
PART : Leave a channel
MSG : Send message to a user .
PRIVMSG : Like MSG but you can also use to send messages to channels .
QUIT : Quit IRC all together .
These are the commands we ’re going to be using here .
You can find more here .
How it works
Like I said fsockopen ’s pretty much like fopen .
So all we have to do is open a connection to the IRC server using .
$ nick = ” Bot ”
$ host=”irc.dal.net ” ;
$ port=6667 ;
$ chan= ” ” ;
$ fp=fsockopen ( $ host , $port ) ;
Now that the connection ’s been opened we can send data to the server using fwrite or fputs .
Its as easy as writing to files .
Heres how we login to the server .
fwrite ( $ fp , ” NICK $ nick\r
” ) ;
fwrite ( $ fp , ” USER localuser $ host erl : luser \r
” ) ;
fwrite ( $ fp , “ JOIN #chan \r
” ) ;
fwrite ( $ fp , ” PRIVMSG #chan
Hi , I ’m an IRC bot\r
” ) ;
Its important that each command we send ends with “ \r
” because it simulates the return or enter key press that we normally do on terminal , it helps the server know that we ’re issuing a command .
And in order to keep it running we ’ll need to implement a while loop so that it does n’t end till we want it to .
while ( $msg=fgets ( $ fp,200 ) ) {
$ msg=explode ( “ : ping ” , $msg ) ;
$ msg[0 ] ==’ping ’?fwrite ( $fp , ” PONG “ .$msg [ 1 ] . ” \r
” ) : ” ” ;
// This checks for any line with JOIN in them , gets the nick of the person who joined the chat or channel and greets them
preg_match ( “ /:(.*)\!.* JOIN :.*/ Ui ” , $msg , $nick ) ?
fwrite ( $fp , ” PRIVMSG
# php hello “ .$ nick [ 1 ] . ” \r
” ) : ” ” ;
echo $ msg . ”
” ;
}
Everything in the code above ’s pretty straight forward except for the line that checks ping requests and preg_match thats checks for new people joining the channels and greets them .
The IRC ’s protocol requires the server to check if the user has timed out or gone offline so that it can close the connection , that ’s the reason why it sends : ping requests all the time , if we do n’t respond with pong and the message to it the connection gets close .
The whole code would look like this .
Running it from the terminal
Its better to run it from the terminal because its easy to close using the Ctrl+c or z buttons rather than closing the browser tab .
In order to run it from the terminal do this .
cd /to/the/script’s/location
php scriptname.php
Teaching it more tricks
There are a lot of things you can make it do like trivia games , or output random quotes or jokes , display google , and stuff like that .
But its outside the scope of this article .
The functions you need to make it do all those things are fsockopen , cURL and regexp .

Researchers have devised a way to monitor BitTorrent users over long stretches of time , a feat that allows them to map the internet addresses of individuals and track the content they are sending and receiving .
In a paper presented earlier this week at the Usenix Workshop on Large - Scale Exploits and Emergent Threats , the researchers demonstrated how they used the technique to continuously spy on BitTorrent users for 103 days .
They collected 148 million IP addresses and identified 2 billion copies of downloads , many of them copyrighted .
The researchers , from the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control , also identified the IP addresses where much of the content originated .
They discovered the the vast majority of the material on BitTorrent started with a relatively small number of individuals .
" We do not claim that it is easy to stop those content providers from injecting content into BitTorrent , " they wrote .
" However , it is striking that such a small number of content providers triggers billions of downloads .
Therefore , it is surprising that the anti-piracy groups try to stop millions of downloaders instead of a handful of content providers . "
The researchers said the information leak is built in to the very core of most BitTorrent systems , including those used by ThePirateBay and IsoHunt .
They support commands such as " scrape - all " and " announce started / stopped , " which when used repeatedly can be used to identify the IP addresses where content originates or is being distributed once it has proliferated .
By collecting more than 1.4 million unique . torrent files , they were able to identify specific pieces of content being distributed by particular IP addresses .
The results are about 70 percent accurate .
" At any moment in time for 103 days , we were spying on the distribution of between 500 and 750 K contents , " they wrote .
" In total , we collected 148M IP addresses distributing 1.2 M contents , which represents 2 billion copies of content . "
The insecurities baked into BitTorrent allowed the researchers to discover IP addresses even when they were hidden behind the Tor anonymity service .
It should be pointed out that this is n't the fault of Tor , which has long urged people to refrain from using BitTorrent over the virtual privacy tunnels .
In light of the new research , project managers renewed that admonition on Thursday .
" The BitTorrent protocol is vulnerable to tampering by malicious parties , " Jacob Appelbaum , a full - time developer for Tor volunteer wrote in an email to El Reg .
" This is not so different than when you 're using Tor or on any other internet connection .
If someone wants to tamper , there 's nothing in the protocol to stop the tampering . "

I wrote somewhat extensively about the problem of encodings in Ruby 1.9 in general last week .
For those who did n't read that post , let me start with a quick refresher .
What 's an Encoding ?
An encoding specifies how to take a list of characters ( such as " hello " ) and persist them onto disk as a sequence of bytes .
You 're probably familiar with the ASCII encoding , which specifies how to store English characters in a single byte each ( taking up the space in 0 - 127 , leaving 128-255 empty ) .
Another common encoding is ISO - 8859 - 1 ( or Latin - 1 ) , which uses ASCII 's designation for the first 127 characters , and designates the numbers 128-255 for Latin characters ( such as " é " or " ü " ) .
Obviously , 255 characters is n't enough for all languages , so there are a number of ISO - 8859 -* encodings which each designate numbers 128-255 for their own purposes ( for instance , ISO - 8859 - 5 uses that space for Russian characters ) .
Unfortunately , the raw bytes themselves do not contain an " encoding specifier " or any kind , and the exact same bytes can either mean something in Western characters , Russian , Japanese , or any other language , depending on the character set that was originally used to store off the characters as bytes .
As a general rule , protocols ( such as HTTP ) , provide a mechanism for specifying the encoding .
For instance , in HTTP , you can specify the encoding in the Content - Type header , like this : Content - Type : text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 .
However , this is not a requirement , so it is possible to receive some content over HTTP and not know its encoding .
This brings us to an important point : Strings have no inherent encoding .
By default , Strings are just BINARY data .
Since the data could be encoded using any number of different incompatible encodings , simply combining BINARY data from different sources could easily result in a corrupted String .
When you see a diamond with a question mark inside on the web , or gibberish characters ( like a weird A with a 3/4 symbol ) , you 're seeing a mistaken attempt to combine binary data encoded differently into a single String .
What 's Unicode
Unicode is an effort to map every known character ( to a point ) to a number .
Unicode does not define an encoding ( how to represent those numbers in bytes ) .
It simply provides a unique number for each known character .
Unicode tries to unify characters from different encodings that represent the same character .
For instance , the A in ASCII , the A in ISO - 8859 - 1 , and the A in the Japanese encoding SHIFT - JIS all map to the same Unicode character .
Unicode also takes pains to ensure round - tripping between existing encodings and Unicode .
Theoretically , this should mean that it 's possible to take some data encoded using any known encoding , use Unicode tables to map the characters to Unicode numbers , and then use the reverse versions of those tables to map the Unicode numbers back into the original encoding .
Unfortunately , both of these characteristics cause some problems for Asian character sets .
First , there have been some historical errors in the process of unification , which requires the Unicode committee to properly identify which characters in different existing Chinese , Japanese and Korean ( CJK ) character sets actually represent the same character .
In Japanese , personal names use slight variants of the non-personal - name version of the same character .
This would be equivalent to the difference ( in English ) between " Cate " and " Kate " .
Many of these characters ( sometimes called Gaiji ) cannot be represented in Unicode at all .
Second , there are still hundreds of characters in some Japanese encodings ( such as the Microsoft encoding to SHIFT - JIS called CP932 or Windows - 31J ) that simply do not round - trip through Unicode .
To make matters worse , Java and MySQL use a different mapping table than the standard Unicode mapping tables ( making " This costs ¥ 5 " come out in Unicode as " This costs \ 5 " ) .
The standard Unicode mapping tables handle this particular case correctly ( but can not fully solve the round - tripping problem ) , but these quirks only serve to further raise doubts about Unicode in the minds of Japanese developers .
For a lot more information on these issues , check out the XML Japanese Profile document created by the W3C to explain how to deal with some of these problems in XML documents .
In the Western world , all encodings in use do not have these problems .
For instance , it is trivial to take a String encoded as ISO - 8859 - 1 , convert it into Unicode , and then convert it back into ISO - 8859 - 1 when needed .
This means that for most of the Western world , it is a good idea to use Unicode as the " one true character set " inside programming languages .
This means that programmers can treat Strings as simple sequences of Unicode code points ( several code points may add up to a single character , such as the ¨ code point , which can be applied to other code points to form characters like ü ) .
In the Asian world , while this can sometimes be a good strategy , it is often significantly simpler to use the original encoding and handle merging Strings in different encodings together manually ( when an appropriate decision about the tradeoffs around fidelity can be made ) .
Before I continue , I would note that the above is a vast simplification of the issues surrounding Unicode and Japanese .
I believe it to be a fair characterization , but die - hard Unicode folks , and die - hard anti-Unicode folks would possibly disagree with some elements of it .
If I have made any factual errors , please let me know .
A Digression : UTF -*
Until now , I have talked only about " Unicode " , which simply maps code points to numbers .
Because Unicode uses counting numbers , it can accommodate as many code points as it wants .
However , it is not an encoding .
In other words , it does not specify how to store the numbers on disk .
The most obvious solution would be to use a few bytes for each character .
This is the solution that UTF - 32 uses , specifying that each Unicode character be stored as four bytes ( accommodating over 4 billion characters ) .
While this has the advantage of being simple , it also uses huge amounts of memory and disk space compared to the original encodings ( like ASCII , ISO - 8859 - 1 and SHIFT - JIS ) that it is replacing .
On the other side of the spectrum is UTF - 8 . UTF - 8 uses a single byte for English characters , using the exact same mapping as ASCII .
This means that a UTF - 8 string that contains only characters found in ASCII will have the identical bytes as a String stored in ASCII .
It then uses the high bit ( the bytes representing 128 - 255 ) to specify a series of escape characters that can specify a multibyte character .
This means that Strings using Western characters use relatively few bytes ( often comparable with the original encodings Unicode replaces ) , because they are in the low area of the Unicode space , while the large number of characters in the Asian languages use more bytes than their native encodings , because they use characters with larger Unicode numbers .
This is another reason some Asian developers resent Unicode ; while it does not significantly increase the memory requirements for most Western documents , it does so for Asian documents .
For the curious , UTF - 16 uses 16 - bits for the most common characters ( the BMP , or basic multilingual plane ) , and 32 - bits to represent characters from planes 1 through 16 .
This means that UTF - 8 is most efficient for Strings containing mostly ASCII characters .
UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 are approximately equivalent for Strings containing mostly characters outside ASCII but inside the the BMP .
For Strings containing mostly characters outside the BMP , UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 , and UTF - 32 are approximately equivalent .
Note that when I say " approximately equivalent " , I 'm not saying that they 're exactly the same , just that the differences are small in large Strings .
Of the Unicode encodings , only UTF - 8 is compatible with ASCII .
By this I mean that if a String is valid ASCII , it is also valid UTF - 8 . UTF - 16 and UTF - 32 encode ASCII characters using two or four bytes .
What Ruby 1.9 Does
Accepting that there are two very different ways of handling this problem , Ruby 1.9 has a String API that is somewhat different from most other languages , mostly influenced by the issues I described above in dealing with Japanese in Unicode .
First , Ruby does not mandate that all Strings be stored in a single internal encoding .
Unfortunately , this is not possible to do reliably with common Japanese encodings ( CP932 , aka Windows - 31J has 300 characters than cannot round - trip through Unicode without corrupting data ) .
It is possible that the Unicode committee will some day fully solve these problems to everyone 's satisfaction , but that day has not yet come .
Instead , Ruby 1.9 stores Strings as the original sequence of bytes , but allows a String to be tagged with its encoding .
It then provides a rich API for converting Strings from one encoding to another .
string = " hello " # by default , string is encoded as " ASCII " string.force_encoding ( " ISO - 8859-1 " ) # this simply retags the String as ISO - 8859 - 1 # this will work since ISO - 8859 - 1 # is a superset of ASCII. string.encode ( " UTF - 8 " ) # this will ask Ruby to convert the bytes in # the current encoding to bytes in # the target encoding , and retag it with the # new encoding # # this is usually a lossless conversion , but # can sometimes be lossy
A more advanced example :
# encoding : UTF - 8 # first , tell Ruby that our editor saved the file using the UTF - 8 encoding .
# TextMate does this by default .
If you lie to Ruby , very strange things # will happen utf8 = " hellö " iso_8859_1 = " hellö " .encode ( " ISO - 8859-1 " ) #
Because we specified an encoding for this file , Strings in here default # to UTF - 8 rather than ASCII .
Note that if you did n't specify an encoding # characters outside of ASCII will be rejected by the parser .
utf8 << iso_8859_1 #
This produces an error , because Ruby does not automatically try to # transcode Strings from one encoding into another .
In practice , this # should rarely , if ever happen in applications that can rely on # Unicode ; you 'll see why shortly utf8 << iso_8859_1.encode ( " UTF - 8 " ) #
This works fine , because you first made the two encodings the same
The problems people are really having
The problem of dealing with ISO - 8859 - 1 encoded text and UTF - 8 text in the same Ruby is real , and we 'll see soon how it is handled in Ruby .
However , the problems people have been having are not of this variety .
If you examine virtually all of the bug reports involving incompatible encoding exceptions , you will find that one of the two encodings is ASCII - 8BIT .
In Ruby , ASCII - 8BIT is the name of the BINARY encoding .
So what is happening is that a library somewhere in the stack is handing back raw bytes rather than encoded bytes .
For a long time , the likely perpetrator here was database drivers , which had not been updated to properly encode the data they were getting back from the database .
There are several other potential sources of binary data , which we will discuss in due course .
However , it 's important to note that a BINARY encoded String in Ruby 1.9 is the equivalent of a byte [ ] in Java .
It is a type that cannot be reasonably concatenated onto an encoded String .
In fact , it is best to think of BINARY encoded Strings as a different class with many methods in common .
In practice , as Ruby libraries continue to be updated , you should rarely ever see BINARY data inside of your application .
If you do , it is because the library that handed it to you genuinely does not know the encoding , and if you want to combine it with non-BINARY String , you will need to convert it into an encoded String manually ( using force_encoding ) .
Why this is , in practice , a rare problem
The problem of incompatible encodings is likely to happen in Western applications only when combining ISO - 8859 -* data with Unicode data .
In practice , most sources of data , without any further work , are already encoded as UTF - 8 .
For instance , the default Rails MySQL connection specifies a UTF - 8 client encoding , so even an ISO - 8859 - 1 database will return UTF - 8 data .
Many other data sources , such as MongoDB , only support UTF - 8 data internally , so their Ruby 1.9 - compatible drivers already return UTF - 8 encoded data .
Your text editor ( TextMate ) likely defaults to saving your templates as UTF - 8 , so the characters in the templates are already encoded in UTF - 8 .
This is why Ruby 1.8 had the illusion of working .
With the exception of some ( unfortunately somewhat common ) edge - cases , most of your data is already encoded in UTF - 8 , so simply treating it as BINARY data , and smashing it all together ( as Ruby 1.8 does ) works fairly reliably .
The only reason why this came tumbling down in Ruby 1.9 is that drivers that should have returned Strings tagged with UTF - 8 were returning Strings tagged with BINARY , which Ruby rightly refused to concatenate with UTF - 8 Strings .
In other words , the vast majority of encoding problems to date are the result of buggy Ruby libraries .
Those libraries , almost entirely , have now been updated .
This means that if you use UTF - 8 data sources , which you were likely doing by accident already , everything will continue to work as it did in Ruby 1.8 .
Digression : force_encoding
When people encounter this problem for the first time , they are often instructed by otherwise well - meaning people to simply call force_encoding ( " UTF - 8 " ) on the offending String .
This will work reliably if the original data is stored in UTF - 8 , which is often true about the person who made the original suggestion .
However , it will mysteriously fail to work ( resulting in " � " characters appearing ) if the original data is encoded in ISO - 8859 - 1 .
This can cause major confusion because some people swear up and down that it 's working and others can clearly see that it 's not .
Additionally , since ISO - 8859 - 1 and UTF - 8 are both compatible with ASCII , if the characters being force_encoded are ASCII characters , everything will appear to work until a non-ASCII character is entered one day .
This further complicates efforts of members of the community to identify and help resolve issues if they are not fluent in the general issues surrounding encodings .
I 'd note that this particular issue ( BINARY data entering the system that is actually ISO - 8859 - 1 ) would cause similar problems in Java and Python , which would either silently assume Unicode , or present a byte [ ] , forcing you to force_encoding it into something like UTF - 8 .
Where it does n't work
Unfortunately , there are a few sources of data that are common in Rails applications that are not already encoded in UTF - 8 .
In order to identify these cases , we will need to identify the boundary between a Rails application and the outside world .
Let 's look at a common web request .
First , the user goes to a URL .
That URL is probably encoded in ASCII , but can also contain Unicode characters .
The encoding for this part of the request ( the URI ) is not provided by the browser , but it appears safe to assume that it 's UTF - 8 ( which is a superset of ASCII ) .
I have tested in various versions of Firefox , Safari , Chrome , and Internet Explorer and it seems reliable .
I personally thank the Encoding gods for that .
Next , the request goes through the Rack stack , and makes its way into the Rails application .
If all has gone well , the Rails application will see the parameters and other bits of the URI exposed through the request object encoded as UTF - 8 .
At the moment ( and after this post , it will probably be true for mere days ) , Rack actually returns BINARY Strings for these elements .
At the moment , Ruby allows BINARY Strings that contain only ASCII characters to be concatenated with any ASCII - compatible encoding ( such as UTF - 8 ) .
I believe this is a mistake , because it will make scenarios such as the current state of Rack work in all tested cases , and then mysteriously cause errors when the user enters a UTF - 8 character in the URI .
I have already reported this issue and it should be fixed in Ruby .
Thankfully , this issue only relates to libraries that are mistakenly returning BINARY data , so we can cut this off at the pass by fixing Rack to return UTF - 8 data here .
Next , that data will be used to make a request of the data store .
Because we are likely using a UTF - 8 encoded data - store , once the Rack issue is resolved , the request will go through without incident .
If we were using an ISO - 8859 - 1 data store ( possible , but unlikely ) , this could pose issues .
For instance , we could be looking up a story by a non-ASCII identifier that the database would not find because the request String is encoded in UTF - 8 .
Next , the data store returns the contents .
Again , you are likely using using a UTF - 8 data store ( things like CouchDB and MongoDB return Strings as UTF - 8 ) .
Your template is likely encoded in UTF - 8 ( and Rails actually makes the assumption that templates without any encoding specified are UTF - 8 ) , so the String from your database should merge with your template without incident .
However , there is another potential problem here .
If your data source does not return UTF - 8 data , Ruby will refuse to concatenate the Strings , giving you an incompatible encoding error ( which will report UTF - 8 as incompatible with , for instance , ISO - 8859 - 1 ) .
In all of the encoding - related bug reports I 've seen , I 've only ever seen reports of BINARY data causing this problem , again , likely because your data source actually is UTF - 8 .
Next , you send the data back to the browser .
Rails defaults to specifying a UTF - 8 character set , so the browser should correctly interpret the String , if it got this far .
Note that in Ruby 1.8 , if you had received data as ISO - 8859 - 1 and stored it in an ISO - 8859 - 1 database , your users would now see " � " , because the browser cannot identify a valid Unicode character for the bytes that came back from the database .
In Ruby 1.9 , this scenario ( but not the much more common scenario where the database returns content as UTF - 8 , which is common because Rails specifies a UTF - 8 client encoding in the default database.yml ) , you would receive an error rather than sending corrupted data to the client .
If your page included a form , we now have another potential avenue for problems .
This is especially insidious because browsers allow the user to change the " document 's character set " , and users routinely fiddle with that setting to " fix " pages that are actually encoded in ISO - 8859 - 1 , but are specifying UTF - 8 as the character set .
Unfortunately , while browsers generally use the document 's character set for POSTed form data , this is both not reliable and possible for the user to manually change .
To add insult to injury , the browsers with the largest problems in this area do not send a Content - Type header with the correct charset to let the server know the character set of the POSTed data .
Newer standards specify an attribute accept - charset that page authors can add to forms to tell the client what character set to send the POSTed data as , but again , the browsers with the largest issues here are also the ones with issues in implementing accept - charset properly .
The most common scenario where you can see this issue is when the user pastes in content from Microsoft Word , and it makes it into the database and back out again as gibberish .
After a lot of research , I have discovered several hacks that , together , should completely solve this problem .
I am still testing the solution , but I believe we should be able to completely solve this problem in Rails .
By Rails 3.0 final , Rails application should be able to reliably assume that POSTed form data comes in as UTF - 8 .
Moving that data to the server presents another potential encoding problem , but again , if we can rely on the database to be using UTF - 8 as the client ( or internal ) encoding , and the solution for POSTed form data pans out , the data should smoothly get into the database as UTF - 8 .
But what if we still do have non-UTF - 8 data
Even with all of this , it is still possible that some non-BINARY data sneaks over the boundary and into our Rails application from a non-UTF - 8 source .
For this scenario , Ruby 1.9 provides an option called Encoding .
default_internal , which allows the user to specify an preferred encoding for Strings .
Ruby itself and Ruby 's standard libraries respect this option , so even if , for instance , it opens some IO encoded in ISO - 8859 - 1 , it will give the data to the Ruby program transcoded to the preferred encoding .
Libraries , such as database drivers , should also support this option , which means that even if the database is somehow set up to receive UTF - 8 String , the driver should convert those String transparently to the preferred encoding before handing it to the program .
Rails can take advantage of this by setting the default_internal to UTF - 8 , which will then ensure that String from non-UTF - 8 sources still make their way into Rails encoded as UTF - 8 .
Since I started asking libraries to honor this option a week ago , do_sqlite , do_mysql , do_postgres , Nokogiri , Psych ( the new YAML parser in Ruby 1.9 ) , sqlite3 , and the MongoDB driver have all added support for this option .
The fix should be applied to the MySQL driver shortly , and I am still waiting on a response from the pg driver maintainer .
In short , by the time 1.9.2 - final ships , I do n't see any reason why all libraries in use do n't honor this setting .
I 'd also add that MongoDB and Nokogiri already return only UTF - 8 data , so supporting this option was primarily a matter of correctness .
If a driver already deals entirely in UTF - 8 , it will work transparently with Rails because Rails deals only in UTF - 8 .
That said , we plan to robustly be able to support scenarios where UTF - 8 cannot be used in this way ( because encoding are in use that cannot be transparently encoded at the boundary without data loss ) , so proper support for default_internal will be essential in the long - term .
TL;DR
The vast majority of encoding bugs to date have resulted from outdated drivers that returned BINARY data instead of Strings with proper encoding tags .
The pipeline that brings Strings in and out of Rails is reasonably well - understood , and simply by using UTF - 8 libraries for each part of that pipeline , Ruby 1.9 will transparently work .
If you accidentally use non-UTF - 8 sources in the pipeline , Ruby 1.9 will throw an error , an improvement over the Ruby 1.8 behavior of simply sending corrupted data to the client .
For this scenario , Ruby 1.9 allows you to specify a preferred encoding , which instructs the non-UTF - 8 source to convert Strings in other encodings to UTF - 8 .
By default , Rails will set this option to UTF - 8 , which means that you should not see ISO - 8859 - 1 Strings in your Rails application .
By the time Ruby 1.9 is released in a few months , this should be a reality , and your experience dealing with Ruby 1.9 String should be superior to the 1.8 experience , because it should generally work , but libraries will have properly considered encoding issues .
This means that serving misencoded data should be basically impossible .
TL ;DR the TL;DR
When using Rails 3.0 with Ruby 1.9.2 - final , you will generally not have to care about encodings .
Postscript
With all that said , there can be scenarios where you receive BINARY data from a source .
This can happen in any language that handles encodings more transparently than Ruby , such as Java and Python .
This is because it is possible for a library to receive BINARY data and not have the necessary metadata to tag it with an encoding .
In this case , you will either need to determine the encoding yourself or treat it as raw BINARY data , and not a String .
The reason this scenario is rare is that if there is a way that you can determine the encoding ( such as by looking at provided with the bytes ) , the original library can do the same .
If you get into a scenario where you know the encoding , but it is not machine available , you will want to do something like :
Gubernatorial Candidate Nikki Halley ( R - SC ) has categorically deniedthe affair between herself and Governor Mark Sanford 's former spokesman and conservative blogger Will Folks :
" I have been 100 % faithful to my husband throughout our 13 years of marriage , " Haley responded in a statement , following up with an appearance on a Columbia radio station .
" This claim against me is categorically and totally false . "
Sarah Palin has come to her defense :
" Well , whaddya know ?
South Carolina ’s conservative candidate , Nikki Haley , recently zipped to the front of the line in her state ’s race for governor ; and lo and behold , now accusations of an affair surface , " Palin wrote .
" Nikki categorically denies the accusation that was spewed out there by a political blogger who has the gall to throw the stone , but then quickly duck and hide and proclaim he would not comment further on the issue .
Quite convenient . "
Well , whaddya know , Will Folks is now saying he has emails , text messages , and voice mails to prove it :
" As far as what comes out and when it comes out , I 'm going to leave that to the advice of my attorneys .
But I 'll tell you what , at some point , everything comes out , " he told News Channel 7 by phone Tuesday morning .
Folks goes on to say that he has kept the Haley campaign full informed of his intentions to announce the affair on his website and that he still supports her candidacy .
In addition , Folks ' website released a statement today that states :
Make no mistake , the credibility of this website will be defended – and the veracity of our claim will be documented .
That statement goes on to implicate Republican Congressman Gresham Barrett in the matter , alleging that it was his campaign that learned of the affair and approached a South Carolina reporter about it .
The Columbia Free Times confirms it has been working on the story for several weeks and that it had contacted Folks about it .
Somebody is lying .
Stay tuned , Sarah .
Update : Folks ' blog stated , in a statement partly titled " Haleygate " that it has taken care to lawyer up awaiting a libel suit .
None has been announced from Haley so far .
Nor has she asked for a retraction of the allegation .
British officer :
You call yourself a patriot , and a loyal subject to King George ?
Hawkeye : I do n’t call myself “ subject ” to much of anything .
Hawkeye explains the foundational tenet of the American worldview to a self - important armed government functionary offended by the frontiersman ’s principled defiance ; from the 1992 version of Last of the Mohicans .
Marilyn Levias , a 19 - year - old Seattle girl involved in a jaywalking incident during which a police officer assaulted another 17 - year - old girl , displayed “ a dangerous refusal to observe a cardinal rule that civilians simply must comply with instructions from police officers , ” insists Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes .
For this , Miss Levias faces a gross misdemeanor charge of “ Obstructing a Police Officer . ”
During the confrontation , Levias ’s 17 - year - old friend , Angel L. Rosenthal , intervened on her behalf and was punched in the face by officer Ian P. Walsh .
As is typically the case when a Mundane ’s face obstructs the trajectory of a police officer ’s fist , the victim is the one facing criminal charges .
In announcing the criminal charge against Levias , City Attorney Holmes offered the mildest possible limp - wristed swipe at the Seattle Police Department by saying that the incident illustrates the need “ for de-escalation training for officers . ”
Holmes also cited an observation by Judge Michael Spearman , auditor for the police department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility , that “ The use of force in a [ jaywalking ] situation as a best practice is questionable . ”

London , England ( CNN ) -- Britain has a total nuclear arsenal of fewer than 225 weapons , with 160 currently operational , Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday .
" We believe that the time is now right to be more open about the weapons we hold , " Hague said in a statement to Parliament .
" We judge that this will assist in building a climate of trust between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons states and contribute , therefore , to future efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons worldwide . "
The British disclosure follows similar recent announcements by France and the United States , the other nuclear - armed Western allies .
Britain had previously disclosed that it had 160 operational warheads , which since 1998 have been based aboard a squadron of four ballistic missile submarines .
In May , the United States announced its stockpile of nuclear weapons numbers 5,113 .
In April , Washington decided to swear off the development of new generations of nuclear weapons and announced it would not use its existing warheads to attack non-nuclear states that are in compliance with nonproliferation agreements .
The same month , it signed a new pact with Russia -- its leading rival in the Cold War arms race -- to cut each nation 's stockpile by about a third .
France reported an arsenal of about 300 nuclear weapons in 2008 .
Three other countries -- China , India , Pakistan -- are known to have nuclear weapons .
Israel is widely suspected to have developed the bomb , but has never declared itself a nuclear power .
North Korea says it has produced plutonium with " weapons potential " and claims to have conducted nuclear tests .
But the Federation of American Scientists says there is no publicly available evidence that North Korea has operationalized its nuclear weapons capability .
Libya and South Africa have dismantled nuclear weapons programs under international supervision in the past two decades .
Ahead of his own funeral ...
Members of a Michael Jackson death hoax forum claim the King of Pop is alive and well and once disguised himself as a burns victim on national television .
The website , Michaeljacksonhoaxforum.com , attracts over one million hits per day and is used by fans to discuss theories about whether the King of Pop is still alive .
It 's claimed that on Larry King 's talk show on September 3rd last year , Jackson disguised himself as Dave Dave - a 33 - year - old burns victim who befriended Jackson when he was a child .
Dave
Dave suffered horrific burns when his deranged father set him on fire when he was six - years - old in an act of revenge over custody .
As a child , his mother wrote a book about his ordeal and took him on a trip to Michael Jackson 's Neverland Ranch where they became close friends .
Law student Dave , who changed his name from David Rothenberg to sever all links to his criminal father , appeared on Larry King 's show ahead of Michael Jackson 's memorial service in September .
He told the presenter : “ ( Michael ) opened up his arms to me and accepted me as a very good friend of his .
And throughout the years , he never let me go .
" The interview was been posted on Youtube when death hoax theorists noted the similarity in Dave Dave 's voice and mannerisms to Jackson .
According to The Sun , forum founder ' Souza ' said : " Michael Jackson attended Larry King Live on the day of the funeral disguised as Dave Dave .
"
Yet despite the theory 's Dave Dave 's spokesman Brian Oxman rubbished the claims , telling the tabloid : “ " The stories that have surfaced on the blogs concerning Michael Jackson still being alive are part of the worldwide grief that everyone whoever loved Michael Jackson now feels .
" He was so remarkable that people find it difficult to believe he is no longer with us .
They long for him to remain a part of our lives .
" I have spoken to Dave within the past several weeks , and he is doing well .
He is going to school in Utah , and he is studying to be a lawyer .
" I can assure you that while Michael Jackson would be thrilled that Dave would become a lawyer , Michael Jackson never wanted to be a lawyer himself .
He would shudder at the very thought . "

These are but a very few of the recent headlines about more U.S. war , but the Iranian and Korean situations are the most dangerous , and the threats against Iran I think the most real .
United States wars are virtually all wars of aggression , so it is quite evident that U.S. wars are u201 Cfoughtu201D for reasons other than self - defense .
That means there are ulterior motives involved that are not related to moral behavior , but instead to nefarious intent .
This is a disturbing revelation , and one little understood by the American masses .
It is one however , that if more understood , could literally blow the lid off the notion that the purposeful buildup of the military — industrial complex is for the defense of this nation !
This thought scares the life out of those in power who need to keep the populace scared to death at all times in order to propagate their crimes .
Our economy , as is the case for much of the rest of the world ’s economies , is currently imploding .
Since all major economies in the world are based on valueless , un - backed , and worthless money , this situation should have been evident to the mainstream long ago .
Of course the failing economy is just one piece of the puzzle , but it is most definitely the most important piece .
With a so - called vibrant economy over the past decade or so , even though it was based on lies and deceit , and was a complete sham , the general population was easy to control during these so - called u201 Cprosperousu201D times .
With the real economy now being exposed for the fraud that it is , and the real risks becoming more evident , the once complacent citizen is now becoming angry .
Because of this , the evil U.S. federal government must find a new method of fooling the masses into believing in u201 Ctheiru201D government and country .
War is the obvious answer , as war solidifies the putrid and false nationalistic worship of the peasants more than any other ploy .
In my opinion , any bad economic news , any exposure of the current economic fraud , any sovereign government risk of collapse , any higher unemployment or excessive price inflation , will anger the majority and vastly escalate the government ’s need to start another war .
It can not afford to let the situation get out of hand , as there are many more of us than there are of them , so whatever becomes necessary in the mind of government in order for it to effect its manipulation and control over the people will be implemented .
If that is a purposely orchestrated and unnecessary war , then so be it .
The openness of these plans and the blatant steps being taken by the federal government to protect its power are disturbing to say the least .
Even with this openness however , most are still in the dark .
Since 2001 , our civil rights have been for the most part destroyed .
Laws have been enacted that allow the government to capture and hold indefinitely any citizen it deems a risk , and without the possibility of charge or trial .
Legislation to open and construct holding camps [ see here ] has been proposed and plans to implement this process are being prepared for today .
Martial Law is now not just a possibility but a probability .
This government in my opinion is at the same time preparing for both Martial Law and war to quell the tide of possible civil unrest due to economic instability or collapse .
This is astounding , as both ends of the spectrum are being covered by Leviathan ’s planned course of action .
This should frighten all of us !
This time around the false flag event (s ) leading to another war should immediately be scrutinized and brought to light , and those who expose the forthcoming government and neo -con lies should not be considered conspiracy nuts , but rather truth - tellers and heroes .
I am warning you in advance , as so many others have done before me , that the next war will be pre-planned and calculated .
The federal government ’s actions are no longer hidden , and the motive for its criminal and murderous behavior is there for all to see .
Obviously , those who now rule over us are confused and dazed , but they are nonetheless prepared to do what is necessary to keep their position of power intact .
This government will not consider the means , but only the ends , so that justification will then become more palatable to those so easy to fool .
The dangers of this situation are tremendous .
A war with Iran will upset not only the entire Middle East , but the whole world .
The terrorism risk due to blowback will increase dramatically ; this in and of itself helping the guilty government to perpetuate the crime , all the while gaining even more power and authority over us .
Not only will many more innocents abroad be murdered , but many more Americans will also have to die as fodder for the cause of the elite .
These situations are not accidental but designed , and they are designed so that the few can survive in luxury , while the rest of us suffer .
When will the common man come to the realization that government in a now totalitarian society like ours is not of the people , by the people , and for the people , but that people are of the government , by the government , and for the government ?
Only when all individuals are sovereign and free , and in total control of the State will this paradigm shift back to its original design .

NEW ORLEANS — A thick , 22 - mile plume of oil discovered by researchers off the BP spill site was nearing an underwater canyon , where it could poison the foodchain for sealife in the waters off Florida .
The discovery by researchers on the University of South Florida College of Marine Science 's Weatherbird II vessel is the second significant undersea plume reported since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 .
The plume is more than 6 miles wide and its presence was reported Thursday .
The cloud was nearing a large underwater canyon whose currents fuel the foodchain in Gulf waters off Florida and could potentially wash the tiny plants and animals that feed larger organisms in a stew of toxic chemicals , another researcher said Friday .
Larry McKinney , executive director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi , said the DeSoto Canyon off the Florida Panhandle sends nutrient - rich water from the deep sea up to shallower waters .
McKinney said that in a best - case scenario , oil riding the current out of the canyon would rise close enough to the surface to be broken down by sunlight .
But if the plume remains relatively intact , it could sweep down the west coast of Florida as a toxic soup as far as the Keys , through what he called some of the most productive parts of the Gulf .
The plume was detected just beneath the surface down to about 3,300 feet , said David Hollander , associate professor of chemical oceanography at USF .
Hollander said the team detected the thickest amount of hydrocarbons , likely from the oil spewing from the blown out well , at about 1,300 feet in the same spot on two separate days this week .
The discovery was important , he said , because it confirmed that the substance found in the water was not naturally occurring and that the plume was at its highest concentration in deeper waters .
The researchers will use further testing to determine whether the hydrocarbons they found are the result of dispersants or the emulsification of oil as it traveled away from the well .
The first such plume detected by scientists stretched from the well southwest toward the open sea , but this new undersea oil cloud is headed miles inland into shallower waters where many fish and other species reproduce .
The researchers say they are worried these undersea plumes may be the result of the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants to break up the oil a mile undersea at the site of the leak .
Hollander said the oil they detected has dissolved into the water , and is no longer visible , leading to fears from researchers that the toxicity from the oil and dispersants could pose a big danger to fish larvae and creatures that filter the waters for food .
" There are two elements to it , " Hollander said .
" The plume reaching waters on the continental shelf could have a toxic effect on fish larvae , and we also may see a long term response as it cascades up the food web . "
Dispersants contain surfactants , which are similar to dishwashing soap .
A Louisiana State University researcher who has studied their effects on marine life said that by breaking oil into small particles , surfactants make it easier for fish and other animals to soak up the oil 's toxic chemicals .
That can impair the animals ' immune systems and cause reproductive problems .
" The oil 's not at the surface , so it does n't look so bad , but you have a situation where it's more available to fish , " said Kevin Kleinow , a professor in LSU 's school of veterinary medicine .

Update : Escort tells paper Rekers is homosexual
The newspaper that busted a Christian leader with a male escort ran a follow - up story Thursday afternoon :
The male escort hired by anti-gay activist George Alan Rekers has told Miami New Times the Baptist minister is a homosexual who paid him to provide body rubs once a day in the nude , during their ten - day vacation in Europe .
Rekers allegedly named his favorite maneuver the “ long stroke ” — a complicated caress “ across his penis , thigh … and his anus over the butt cheeks , ” as the escort puts it .
“ Rekers liked to be rubbed down there , ” he says . ….
Lucien decided to speak out after a heart - to - heart with a friend , Michael , who alerted him to the grim realities of his client ’s anti-gay activities .
Lucien , who had originally declined to speak about the trip , now says he can do little good by protecting his erstwhile , fundamentalist client .
In the past 24 hours , Rekers , a board member at the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) and cofounder of the Family Research Council , has claimed he took Lucien to Europe to inspire him to accept Jesus into his heart and renounce his homosexuality .
Lucien now offers Rekers a counterproposal : “ In all honesty , he should disassociate himself from these [ anti - gay ] groups . ”

The New Times “ spent more than three hours with Lucien in the wee hours of Thursday morning and promises future updates throughout the afternoon to a story which “ has grabbed worldwide headlines and been the subject of monologues by Steven Colbert and Jay Leno . ”

A Christian leader and prominent neuro - psychiatrist who co-founded the Family Research Council with evangelist James Dobson took a ten - day European vacation with a callboy he met through RentBoy.com and was caught in an airport with the escort by a Miami newspaper .
The escort said he had met George Rekers , professor of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Science at the University of South Carolina , on RentBoy.com .
Rekers , when confronted , did n’t deny that he ’d met the callboy online , but said he had hired him to help him carry his baggage and did n’t learn he was generally hired for “ private company ” until mid-way through his European vacation .
“ I had surgery , ” Rekers told Miami ’s New Times , “ and I ca n’t lift luggage .
That ’s why I hired him . ”
( The paper noted that it did n’t stop him from pushing a “ tottering ” pile of luggage through Miami International Airport . )

The callboy , identified by a pseudonym , told the New Times ‘ Penn Bullock and Brandon Thorp that Rekers claim that he did n’t know his “ line of work ” seemed spurious .
“ He should ’ve been able to tell you that , ” he said .
“ But that ’s up to him . ”
According to Penn and Thorp , the slender , 20 - year - old escort ’s profile advertises his “ smooth , sweet , tight ass ” and “ perfectly built 8 inch cock . ”

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It is clear that Rekers has baggage and certainly needs help , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Wayne Besen , a prominent opponent of the “ ex - gay ” movement and director of the nonprofit Truth Wins Out .
Referring to South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , a conservative who claimed he was hiking when he ’d actually been meeting with a mistress , he added : Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ At least he did not say he was walking the Appalachian Trail .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
“ This is a bombshell that completely discredits the ex-gay industry and proves that the movement is a fraud , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Besen added .

The paper printed emails exchanged between the professor and the escort prior to their trip .
Rekers co-founded the conservative and anti-gay Family Research Council with Rev. James Dobson in 1983 .
“ I ’d like to propose another trip to Rome , Italy , for a week or more , ” Rekers purportedly wrote in an Mar. 21 email obtained by New Times .
“ This is so exciting to have a nice Travel Assistant and traveling companion !
Wow !
I ’m so glad I met you . ”
“ I called and talked to the reservation guy in London and reserved a room with two twin beds , ” Rekers allegedly remarked in a later email .

Rekers is a prominent advocate against gays in Florida , where he resides .
He testified against Florida allowing gay couples to adopt , asserting that children of gay couples “ living with a practicing homosexual in the adoptive home , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â are especially Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ vulnerable to psychological damage and an increasing inability to adapt . ”
A commenter on a California Catholic daily , which reported the findings of Rekers ’ investigations into gay adoption , remarked , “ The active principle in these children ’s stress is the fact that their welfare comes in dead last in the homosexual lifestyle – it is oriented toward grooming them for traumatic early sexualization and exploitation by adults . ”
The escort told New Times that Rekers is “ primarily a family man , ” despite their European jaunt .
“ You do n’t understand how much this guy honestly cares about taking care of kids , ” he was quoted as saying .

Reker is the author of “ Growing Up Straight : What Families should Know about Homosexuality . ”
After an initial few hours of generally upbeat reaction , the reality of the huge demands facing the organisers of the proposed US Grand Prix in Austin , Texas have began to raise some serious concerns .
The biggest question is how funding which will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars can be raised when the already very sketchy plans are even woollier about money .
Many ESPNF1 feedbackers have been quick to draw parallels with the high hopes which surrounded the ultimately discredited USF1 team .
ESPN 's Terry Blout wrote : " No one seems to know if Tavo Hellmund , the Central Texas racer and promoter behind the project , has any money .
The plan calls for building a three - mile road course exclusively for F1 - a facility of $ 200 million to $ 300 million .
It 's more than just building a track , a major expense by itself .
No one has said where the financing is coming from and who is putting up the funding . "
Kevin Eason in The Times was no less worried :
" This is one old Formula One dog who was once bitten by Donington and is twice shy . "
Even the major Austin daily American - Statesman appeared dubious asking " why would an Austin project succeed where others have n't ? "
Another veteran ESPN analyst said : " I 'd like to know where he 's going to get a couple hundred million dollars and real estate within 10 miles of Austin airport .
If Texas officials are in , then they 've been suckered … and will be out of the thing as soon as they figure it out . "

Every single week this season , right up until the final week , one lucky Real Madrid player was chosen to give an official interview .
And every single week this season , right up until the final week , the backdrop was the same : a webpage with the glorious and proudly prophetic headline " Real Madrid win their 10th European Cup " .
Fortunately , they did n't look remotely silly because Madrid did indeed win their 10th European Cup on Saturday night and at their own stadium too , Marca 's editorial on Monday morning gleefully declaring " football proves Madrid right " , while they dedicated a wraparound cover to the greatest Madridista triumphs .
But while the Madrid sports media tried to sell their club 's rip-roaring Champions League success , the rest of the country could n't help noticing a sixth successive last - 16 knockout against Olympique Lyon .
Or a season that ended with the Second Coming looking rather like the First Going , Madrid finishing empty - handed .
The good news for Madrid was that despite the presence of Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben , they avoided the embarrassment of watching Barcelona contesting the final .
And worse still , winning it .
Even T - shirts could n't rescue Pep Guardiola 's side against Inter in the semi-final .
Those exits meant that a season that was all about the Champions League was repackaged to become all about a massive battle of the behemoths at the top of the Spanish league , the European Cup becoming a mere audition for the Santiago Bernabéu job .
The league actually did end up being infused with huge significance too , as both Madrid and Barcelona smashed the previous records and matched each other stride for stride until the finish , leaving Guardiola declaring their points totals " fucking barbaric " .
Which of course they were – provoking fear that there 's something wrong with the rest of the league .
Madrid won 18 of their last 19 games going into the final day .
Ultimately , though , their pursuit was in vain .
Essentially because the 19th was against Barcelona .
And Barcelona were just that bit too good , having lost only once and twice defeated Madrid .
They finished three points ahead of their rivals and 28 – yes , twenty - eight – ahead of third - placed Valencia .
Sevilla also got a Champions League place ( and their goalkeeper stuck in the net , while Mallorca and Getafe clinched places in the Europa League – miraculously won this year by Atlético Madrid , despite winning just three European matches in 15 since their Champions League qualifiers in August .
For Atlético , it was their first trophy since the 1996 double .
They could n't make it another double after Sevilla beat them in a cup final which the RFEF somehow got away with playing on an official Fifa rest day .
Again .
At the other end , thanks to picking up points against Sporting Gijón and Madrid respectively , Racing Santander and Malaga survived on the final day – with the lowest totals since three points for a win .
Despite having the most luxurious locks in history and a superb record , Nestor Pipo Gorosito was just too late to rescue Xérez ; Tenerife 's solitary away win saw them go straight back down ; and even signing three coaches and a bear did n't save Real Valladolid .
Not that Valladolid end the season empty - handed .
Nor does Cristiano Ronaldo .
He earned the greatest title of them all : Our Lord .
And a place in the latest edition of the Guardian 's homage to La Liga 's finest .
And its foulest .
Starting with …
Best blasphemy
Never mind Sport 's claim that Christ 's address at the Sea of Galilee was , in fact , " a prophecy of Leo Messi " or Guti's heel being the Achilles of the Almighty , one night God Himself appeared before the Santiago Bernabéu .
" Yesterday , " opened AS 's match report , " Cristiano was not just Cristiano but the whole of Christianity , " while Marca 's cover declared : " God came disguised as CR9 " .
It was a bloody good disguise .
Best touchline performer
Apart from Mallorca 's devilish mascot Dimoni , that is – the real star of the season , chasing players , fans and reporters about with his squidgy pitchfork and huge grin .
Just ahead of Manolo Preciado , craftily smoking a fag on the Sporting bench , and the Las Palmas coach who was sent to the stands at a stadium with no stands , so left the ground , got a ladder and watched the game from the top of the wall running round the perimeter , is the Valladolid coach Onésimo .
He was booked for coming off the bench to tackle Athletic Bilbao defender Fernando Amorebieta as he ran down the wing and off the pitch , moaning " but he fouled me ! " when the ref booked him .
But his best performance came on his debut which he spent shouting : " I shit on the bitch !
I shit on the milk !
I shit on my mother ! " , filling the air with ¡hostias ! , the consecrated bread that forms the staple diet of Spanish swearing , kicking the ball to the fourth official with a shout of " hey kid ! " and moaning when the kid did n't want to play ; leaning against the dugout like a barfly chatting to fans ; and yelling " I shit on God " .
Before apologising for shitting on God , adding : " Sorry !
Sorry !
It 's not God 's fault . "
He was right too : Valladolid were playing Valencia , not Real Madrid .
Best motivator
Onésimo again .
Filled club captain Alberto Marcos with confidence as he prepared to make a substitute appearance , by shouting across at him : " Why do you think I 'm sending you on ?
Because we have n't got anything better . "
Best rant
And it 's a third award for Valladolid , a second involving Marcos , who lost his head and threatened to help others lose theirs – quite literally .
" I 'd happily boot out anyone who does n't give their all .
I do n't want friends and I do n't care if no one in the team likes me ; I do n't like them .
All I care about is having blokes alongside who will give their all .
If we go down , people will end up on the dole .
I want people who I can look in the eye and think : 'he cares ' .
Too many do n't .
We have to fight like dogs .
And if we have to rip people 's heads off , I 'll rip people 's heads off . "
Biggest fall from grace
From striker everyone wanted to gobby , faking , self - absorbed , diving and largely ineffective deceiver in the blink of an eye .
Step forward Álvaro Negredo .
Best promise
Valladolid striker Manucho arrived from Manchester United and vowed to score 40 goals .
He got four .
Biggest villain
Patrick Mtiliga , who viciously attacked Cristiano Ronaldo 's elbow .
With his nose .
Most infuriating title
CR9 .
Just stop it .
Please .
Best excuse
Better even than Rafael van der Vaart 's " just because I handled the ball does n't mean I handballed it " was Barcelona director general Joan Oliver 's sterling effort in the midst of a crisis in Catalunya .
When Joan Laporta became Barça president , he complained that someone was spying on his directors .
Six years later , it emerged that he was quite right ; someone was spying on his directors .
He was .
Barça spent € 56,000 on surveillance to watch four vice - presidents .
But , according to Oliver , who set the thing up , Barça were n't spying on them ; it was in fact a " security audit " carried out for their " protection " and their " own good " .
And of course he did it without their knowledge .
Because he did n't want to worry them .
Weirdest pre-match ritual
The moonlit , midnight one that saw former Deportivo La Coruña greats Arsenio Iglesias , Jacques Songo'o , Fran González and Javier Manjarín gathered round the centre circle at Riazor , garlic cloves strewn about , a burning cauldron before them , and a wizard chanting : " Owls , toads and witches ; crows , salamanders and wizards ; howl of dog and call of death , satyr 's snout and rabbit 's foot … sinful tongue of the immoral woman married to an old man , Beelzebub 's fire , burning corpses , mutilated bodies of the indecent , farts from infernal bottoms , useless belly of the spinster …
Hark , the roar of the burnt ! " .
The spell was supposed to ensure that Deportivo 's unbeaten Riazor run against Madrid stretched into a 19th year .
But , much like the team without Filipe Luis , it simply did n't work .
Most severe punishment
When Laporta got into a debate with Racing Santander president Francisco Pernía and Cantabrian president Miguel - Ángel Revilla , claiming Spain was " crushing " Catalunya , they hit back in style .
By telling him he was no longer welcome to join the Ambassadors of the Havana Cigar Club .
That 'll learn him .
Most committed campaign
The year 's most hotly contested award is won by Marca and their magnificent display of Orwellian Doublethink .
Sport and Mundo Deportivo got comically upset about the identity of Spain 's third - choice goalkeeper – which is pretty galling for those who have n't even got a first – but they had a point .
There was another strong showing from Villarato , Ronaldo 's Beatification gathered steam with evangelical zeal , and even 27 goals were n't enough to silence the How Dare Higuaín Play More than Benzema and Score More than Ronaldo ?
Campaign .
But the winner was what Sporting manager Manolo Preciado described as the " terrifying witch hunt " to which Manuel Pellegrini was subjected by Marca , an attack so blatant , ridiculous and twisted – and always met with such decency and decorum – that it boomeranged : Madrid 's fans started rallying round the coach , forcing the editor to publicly denounce his own polls because , he said , they were open to " manipulation " .
Unlike the paper 's content , of course .
Not satisfied with twisting Pellegrini's every word and blaming him for everything that went wrong and nothing that went right , they doctored the stats , replacing bias with bias and changing sides with such indecent haste you wondered if they were being advised by Danny Alexander .
With 10 weeks to go they realised to their horror that Pellegrini was ahead of Guardiola in their Miguel Muñoz ranking as the campaign 's best coach .
Coincidentally , Pellegrini started getting one out of three every week while Guardiola picked up three out of three game after game – even when his side drew 0 - 0 with Espanyol .
Pellegrini was pipped at the post .
Best match reports
El País 's poetic paeans to Valencia - Mallorca and Sporting - Villarreal the morning after the clásico .
Total number of words : 0 .
Best stat
Comes courtesy of AS , who helpfully pointed out that Madrid have " always won when Gago plays alongside Xabi Alonso " .
Number of times they had played together ?
Two .
A week later , they started their fourth game together .
And lost .
Best fans
Getafe were presented with the LFP's Twelfth Man award as the best fans .
In front of an empty stadium .
This column attended six consecutive Getafe matches , which probably makes it their most loyal supporter .
And , like the club 's president , it does n't even support them .
So , sod Sporting , Sevilla , Atlético , Tenerife , Espanyol and other more deserving fans , it 's taking this award .
Friskiest fans
According to the " Sexual Pulsations Index " , Almería 's supporters are the getting more than anyone else – followed by Xérez's .
Madrid are 12th and Osasuna are last .
And , let 's face it , the most honest .
Officially , Barcelona are only sixth but that can't be right .
In early February , Catalan hospitals announced a 45 % increase in the birth rate – exactly nine months after Andrés Iniesta 's last - minute winner at Stamford Bridge .
Classiest sacking
Apart from the obvious one , that is – after all , it has n't officially happened yet .
When Zaragoza got rid of Marcelino , they published a statement on the club 's website .
No goodbye , good luck , no thanks for the services rendered , mutual consent , heavy heart or difficult decision .
Oh no .
" Marcelino leaves Real Zaragoza in the relegation zone , " ran the headline .
" His legacy is the sad title of the worst defence , a place in the relegation zone , three wins in 14 , and a first - round knockout in the Copa del Rey . "
Cheekiest club
Valencia , who decided to put a logo of their new stadium on the collar of their shirts .
The new stadium they have n't yet built , are n't building , and has seen them plunged over € 500 m in debt .
Best merchandise
You always suspected that there was a right tit inside that piece of Real Madrid branded nylon .
Now you know after the club launched their own line of bras .
They do pants and knickers too but this column was too polite to crack that particular joke .
Best red card
Didier Zokora was sent off for telling the linesman , in English , to fornicate with his mother ( his own mother , that is , not Zokora 's mother – unless he really is weird ) .
And Pablo Orbaiz was sent off twice in a month – for pulling someone 's hair and for stamping on an opponent so cleanly it is a wonder he did n't end up with a pair of testicles impaled on his studs like traitors ' heads on a spike .
But the winner is Villarreal full - back Joan Capdevila .
The week after it looked suspiciously like Sergio Busquet 's second yellow card was instead given to Villarreal 's Joseba Llorente , Llorente was again booked .
Chuckling , Capdevila asked Clos Gómez if the card was for Busquets .
The ref took offence and showed Capdevila a card , to which he replied : " Is that one for Busquets as well ? "
The punchline was red .
Best rumble
Xerez 's Mario Bermejo had to be held back by police as he shouted " Retard !
Retard !
Yes , you , Miku bollocks , you !
Retard ! " at Getafe striker Miku , but the winner is Villarreal - Athletic , which ended with seven additional minutes , three players sent off , a kick in the back , Orbaiz 's pull of the hair , a bit of the ' you and me outside 's , a touchline set - to , and a fan in the front row nonchalantly emptying a bottle of water over Athletic coach Joaquín Caparrós .
Best match
Real Oviedo's fightback from 1 - 0 down to win 9 - 1 against Vecindario , naturally .
Madrid 's astonishing 4 - 0 hammering at the hands of Alcorcón in the Copa del Rey .
And Joseba Etxeberría 's brilliant testimonial against 200 kids from the club 's youth system .
But the First Division 's best was surely Getafe 's 4 - 3 win against Sevilla , revenge over the side that cost them a place in the Copa del Rey final .
One down , 2 - 1 up and 3 - 2 down , Getafe made it 3 - 3 , hit the post three times and won with a 93rd - minute penalty .
That had to be taken twice .
Best goal
Take your pick from the catalogue of blinders scored by Messi , Ronaldo and Higuaín .
Their best three probably came against Zaragoza , Osasuna and Espanyol respectively .
Xabi Alonso's pass and Arbeloa 's finish against Atlético came as a pleasant surprise , except for Liverpool fans , and Benzema 's against Depor included that assist .
Speaking of assists making great goals , even better was Ibrahimovic 's pass to Pedro against Mallorca and Xavi 's wonderful ball to Alves and from there to Messi against Málaga .
For drama , the best has to be Rodri's 93rd - minute winner against Almería – as witnessed from the Son Moix pitch .
He 'd only ever played four minutes before he goes and does this .
For sheer violence , Mario Bermejo against Barcelona stands out , the funniest was probably Julio Álvarez taking advantage of Cata Díaz 's bizarre backpass against his own post and then there was Dani Parejo 's goal against Madrid – one which should have taught everyone a lesson but sadly did n't .
Iván Bolado and Roberto Soldado tried to outdo each other with overhead kicks , Duda scored – deliberately – straight from a corner , and Pablo Hernández turned all Dennis Bergkamp against Atlético .
The best of the lot was probably Javi Martínez against Almería .
But this column 's favourite is the goal that never happened – because the post got in the way during Valencia 's game with Mallorca .
Now , this [ at 1.20 ] , would have been a proper ¡golazo !
Best coach
Pipo Gorosito , the most magnificently mulletted manager in history , almost revived Xérez , despite the fact that they reached the halfway stage of the season dead , buried and decomposing .
Guardiola led Barcelona to a new points record .
And Pellegrini showed extraordinary decency and decorum .
Míchel took over from relegation - bound Getafe with five games to go last season and carried them to a Uefa place this , playing wonderful football .
The handsome devil .
Quique Sánchez Flores took charge of a team that , as he publicly complained , did n't even know how to take throw -ins and managed – somehow – to win something for the first time in 14 years .
But the winner has to be Mallorca 's psychological , motivational genius Gregorio Manzano , who worked miracles against a backdrop of departing players , in - fighting , back - stabbing and financial crisis .
Mallorca suffered the cruellest final day imaginable , players , staff , and Dimoni all on the pitch , champagne bottles ready at their feet , watching the giant scoreboard at Son Moix as Sevilla plunged a great big jaggedy knife into their hearts .
Mallorca 's season was always likely to end in tears .
The shock was that the tears were provoked by missing out on the Champions League , not by suffering relegation .
And that 's down to greatest hypnotist - turned - coach there is .
Best player
3rd Cristiano Ronaldo .
2nd Xavi Hernández .
1st Leo Messi .
Earlier this season , Marca gleefully ran a front cover finally revealing the definitive , objective truth : " Ronaldo is more complete than Messi . "
The proof ?
A footballing " X - ray " , a point - totalling , attribute - by - attribute , " analysis " .
Carried out by a Marca journalist , who just happened to have written a glossy biography of Ronaldo and who might as well have chosen ' Portuguese - ness ' as one of the attributes so determined was he to bend the rules Ronaldo 's way .
Inevitably , Ronaldo won .
It was the only thing he did win .
At the end of a season presented as a head to head between the big two 's biggest stars , even Marca had to admit defeat – brilliant though Ronaldo was .
Messi got 34 league goals and 47 in all competitions .
He also did things that would have been as unbelievable as they were unique , but for one thing : he did them again and again and again .
Team of the season
Víctor Valdés ( Barcelona ) , Dani Alves ( Barcelona ) , Gerard Piqué ( Barcelona ) , Carles Puyol ( Barcelona ) , Filipe Luis ( Deportivo ) , Xavi ( Barcelona ) , Éver Banega ( Valencia ) , Borja Valero ( Mallorca ) , Cristiano Ronaldo ( Madrid ) , Leo Messi ( Barcelona ) , Gonzalo Higuaín ( Madrid ) .
Subs : Javi Martínez ( Athletic ) ; Jesús Navas ( Sevilla ) ; Pedro ( Barcelona ) ; Diego Alves ( Almería ) , Marcelo , Sergio Ramos ( Real Madrid ) ; José Nunes , Chori Castro ( Mallorca ) ; Diego Castro , Alberto Botía ( Sporting ) ; David Villa ( Valencia ) ; Pedro León , Cata Díaz ( Getafe ) ; Nino ( Tenerife ) .
And finally , some of the year 's choicest quotes
" We 're not up there because we 're a delicatessen " – Deportivo de La Coruña coach Miguel - Ángel Lotina can say that again .
" He picks mushrooms on his day off – and anyone who picks mushrooms can't be a bad person " – Guardiola reveals Xavi Hernández 's darkest secret .
" With our fans , a comeback against Inter is possible " – Pedro forgets the word ' even ' .
And in the end , it was n't .
Even .
" Madrid close their anus just behind Barcelona " – like anyone who 's ever strolled past the " cono , 50c " sign offering ice cream for half a euro and thought " oh for a magic marker ! " , Marca discover the importance of that squiggly line above the 'n ' .
" We 're only Spaniards when it suits them " – Barcelona director Joan Oliver attacks his pot armed only with his kettle .
" Come back to my house and you 'll see how gay I am .
And bring your sister " – Zlatan Ibrahimovic responds to the sexual innuendo .
" I stuck it up there by mistake " – so does César Arzo , after photos show him marking Guti very closely and from behind , hand disappearing into the dark .
That 's what they all say , César .
" Provocative , arrogant and aggressive " .
" All he wants is to be allowed to play football " – Sport and Marca do n't quite agree on Ronaldo .
See if you can guess who said what .
" Just because he has lovely abs , that does n't justify everything he does " – Onésimo is not impressed with Ronaldo .
" We all make an effort and you can be late once in a while but not three times .
It 's not funny " – and Rubén Pulido is n't impressed with Jermaine Pennant .
Nor was anyone else .
" I 'm not hard – I 'm hard - ísimo " – Javier Clemente warns his Valladolid players .
Or should that be ' warms ' ?
" This is a cheap team but it's one with a pair of bollocks like [ General ] Espartero's horse " – Manolo Preciado insists that his Sporting Gijón team are strong in the tackle .
" I just want us all to be happier and live in a world of peace and tolerance " – Atlético Madrid owner Miguel - Ángel Gil Marín turns all Miss World .
Well , he 's been through that many men …
" Cowardly coaches always chuck players in the bin to hide their own inadequacies " – Kaká 's agent definitely is n't talking about Manuel Pellegrini .
" Resino has n't killed anyone and I have no doubt he 'll continue for the rest of the season .
It would be madness to change now " – Atlético Madrid president defends former coach Abel Resino .
That 's former coach Abel Resino .
" The rest of us have been reduced to suppliers of players for the big two " – Almería coach Juanma Lillo does n't like where La Liga is heading .
" It reminds me of Scotland " – nor does Sevilla sporting director Monchi .
" How beautiful football would be if it was n't for matchday " – Tenerife coach José Luis Oltra lives the dream .
Six days a week .
" We demand precision , accuracy and neutrality , but with one caveat : that it's in our favour " – Andoni Zubizarreta nails it .

SALT LAKE CITY -- Last month , a Utah Highway Patrol trooper , speeding toward an accident , slammed into a car carrying two elderly sisters ; both women were killed .
UHP has now released dash cam video of the accident , and troopers are talking about what happened .
75 - year - old Ila Jean Moore and 71 - year - old Karen Gummow were killed when UHP Trooper Lars Gardner 's vehicle broadsided their car
" One of the biggest things that he said when we went to him and asked him , ‘ What can we do for you to help you and your family ? '
He said , ' About the only thing you can do is roll the clock back , ' " recalls UHP Sgt. Jeff Nigbur .
Trooper Lars Gardner can't change what happened March 10 , but his fellow troopers say he wishes he could .
" As you can imagine , he 's going to have to live with this for the rest of his life , " Nigbur says .
Gardner 's dash cam video shows what happened moments before the crash .
He was off - duty , responding to a call for assistance on a pileup on Interstate 15 near Cedar City .
Gardner was at home in St. George and hopped in his patrol car .
Nigbur says the " L " on the dash cam video indicates he did have his lights flashing as he sped past cars .
Then , all of a sudden , a car made a left - hand turn in front of Gardner .
Two sisters , 75 - year - old Ila Jean Moore and 71 - year - old Karen Gummow , were killed .
We did n't want this to happen in the first place , and we do n't ever want it to happen again .
– UHP Sgt. Jeff Nigbur
" Due to the jolt , due to the impact , it just basically cut the camera off , " Nigbur says .
UHP is n't releasing Gardner 's speed at the time of the crash , saying St. George police have to release that information .
St. George police have yet to respond to KSL 's request for that information .
UHP says there is no designated speed limit for troopers responding to calls , but the agency is reviewing that policy .
" It 's been hotly debated within the department , as far as policy : What do we need to do better ? "
Nigbur says .
" Like I said , we did n't want this to happen in the first place , and we do n't ever want it to happen again . "
The Washington County Attorney decided he would not file any charges against Gardner .
UHP says they are still looking at disciplining him .
Gardner was on paid administrative leave but has since returned to duty .

Image caption Many Pakistanis are angry at the Draw Muhammad competition
A cartoonist whose work inspired an internet campaign inviting people to draw images of the Prophet Muhammad has apologised for her role in the row .
Writing on her blog , Molly Norris said her satirical cartoon was " hijacked " and that the campaign was " offensive to Muslims " .
Other people set up a page on the social networking site Facebook backing an Everybody Draw Muhammad Day .
It sparked outrage in Pakistan , where a court ordered Facebook to be blocked .
On Thursday the video - sharing website YouTube was also blocked in Pakistan .
Reports say more protests against the Facebook campaign are planned for Friday .
' Right to expression '
Molly Norris drew a cartoon in April to protest against the decision by a US television channel to cancel an episode of the popular show South Park because of a contentious depiction of the Prophet Muhammad .
In her cartoon , Ms Norris satirically proposed May 20 as an Everybody Draw Muhammad Day .
The idea inspired a separate Everybody Draw Muhammad Day group on Facebook which rapidly gained in popularity .
The page contains drawings and cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and characters from other religions , including Hinduism and Christianity .
Depictions of the Prophet are forbidden in Islam .
Ms Norris says that she had nothing to do with the page even though her name was posted on it .
Some media reports implied that she had set up the Facebook campaign .
" I never started a Facebook page ; I never set up any place for people to send drawings to and I never received any drawings , " she said on her blog .
She apologised for her role in the controversy and said that the content of the page was " offensive to Muslims who did nothing to endanger our right to expression in the first place " .
Violent demonstrations
Pakistan said it blocked the popular video - sharing website YouTube because of its " growing sacrilegious content " .
Correspondents say it remains to be seen how successful the new bans will be in Pakistan and whether citizens find a way round them .
YouTube said it was " looking into the matter and working to ensure that the service is restored as soon as possible " .
The site was briefly blocked in Pakistan in 2008 - ostensibly for carrying material deemed offensive to Muslims .
" Because YouTube is a platform for free expression of all sorts , we take great care when we enforce our policies .
Content that violates our guidelines is removed as soon as we become aware of it , " said the company .
Facebook said in a statement that it would take action if any content " becomes an attack on anyone , including Muslim people " , but that in this case its policies were not violated .
Five people were killed in Pakistan in 2006 during violent demonstrations following publication of Muhammad cartoons in a Danish newspaper .

QuickStats : Suicide and Homicide Rates * Among Adults Aged > 18 Years , by Age Group --- National Vital Statistics System , United States , 2002 -- 2004 * Per 100,000 population in age group .
During 2002 -- 2004 , the average annual suicide rate ( 14.2 per 100,000 population ) was nearly twice as high as the rate of death by homicide ( 7.2 per 100,000 population ) for adults aged > 18 years .
The suicide rate was higher than the homicide rate for all age groups except persons aged 18 - - 24 years .
The difference between the suicide and homicide rates among groups aged > 25 years increased with age ; persons aged > 85 years were eight times as likely to die from suicide as homicide .

If you 're looking for notebook power on the cheap and you 're not too keen on either using Intel 's integrated graphics or paying for a higher - performing , NVIDIA - made workaround ( i.e. , Optimus ) , then there 's an obvious alternative mobile platform for you : AMD / ATI .
AMD is gaining steam in the mobile space due to a combination of low cost and its ATI Radeon graphics solution , with Reuters reporting that the company will better than double the number of design wins this back - to - school season compared to a year ago .
HP , for instance , announced a huge revamp of its mobile lineup on Friday , and AMD was in the bulk of the new models on both the consumer and business side .
In fact , many of the new notebooks are available only with AMD — Intel inside is not an option .
This is a huge victory for AMD , one that looks to be part of an ongoing winning streak .
Jon Peddie Research 's most recent report on the graphics space for the first quarter of 2010 shows AMD taking about six percent of the total graphics market share from Intel , with NVIDIA staying about flat at 31.5 percent .
Intel dropped from 49.7 percent market share in the first quarter of 2009 to 43.5 , and AMD jumped from 17.1 percent to 24.0 percent in that same period .
These numbers are for total graphics market share , which includes both integrated graphics processors ( IGP ) and the newly launched integrated processor graphics ( IPG ) .
Part of Intel 's market share loss is no doubt due to the shortage of Arrandale processors .
AMD saw its biggest boost in mobile graphics , according to JPR , which suggests that the scarcity of Intel 's mobile CPU / IPG combo may have taken a toll .
AMD seems to have some momentum on its side , and it 's worth pausing for a moment to think about the chipmaker 's advantage here .
IGP vs. IPG
The first quarter of 2010 saw the dawn of a new acronym and the start of a major shift in the PC hardware market — the move from integrated graphics processors to integrated processor graphics .
In the former , the GPU is integrated into the chipset 's northbridge , while in the latter , the CPU is in the same package or on the same die as the processor ( e.g. , Intel 's Clarksdale and Arrandale 32nm parts , with in - package GPUs ) .
AMD does n't have an IPG offering yet , but it does n't yet need one .
The thing that 's making AMD attractive , apart from price ( and price is a major factor ) , is that Intel 's IPG just is n't that great .
It 's a lot better than it once was , but it 's still no match for IGPs from NVIDIA or AMD .
The problem with having a not - so - great GPU in the same package as the processor die is that if you want to buy Intel 's latest and greatest mobile CPU , you have to buy its GPU along with it .
So you have to pay for this GPU that is n't very good and that you may not want , and then if you want real graphics performance you have to then go out and pay for an NVIDIA GPU to go with it ( via Optimus or Apple 's proprietary solution ) .
NVIDIA 's Optimus is definitely a win-win for Intel , NVIDIA , and Intel users , because it gives Intel 's customers the option of a better GPU that and a platform that can dynamically optimize its graphics performance to fit the running workload .
But if you stack it up against a traditional CPU + IGP combination , like that which AMD offers , it 's hard to imagine that all that all the shuffling graphics data back and forth between the GPU 's private pool of DDR3 and the framebuffer that sits in system memory does n't burn extra power .
In other words , from an engineering perspective , it would be better to have a more efficient IGP , where you do all your dynamic power optimization by turning on and off parts of the IGP , than it is to have two IGPs — a weak one and a strong one — and switch back and forth between those two depending on workload .
Intel users are sort of stuck with the latter , more coarse - grained , system - level form of power optimization , while AMD can do the former by just focusing on making its single IGP very efficient across a range of performance points .
Ultimately , Arrandale 's CPU is just plain better ( it 's a whole process node ahead , which is key for mobile , and the Nehalem microarchitecture is superior ) , but Intel has hung a dud of a GPU around its neck and has forced users who want better performance to resort to exotic system - level solutions like Optimus .
This misstep has left a door open for AMD to walk right through with a saner and more conventional solution .
And because AMD not only offers better graphics performance but is cheaper to boot , notebook makers ( and probably users ) are increasingly going to opt for the AMD mobile platform .
Sometimes I wonder if science has n’t been infected with some sort of mass delusion about CO2 .
Watch this amazing video on CO2 and plant growth from CO2Science.org , then read below the claims made in this UC Davis press release .
Rising CO2 levels threaten crops and food quality
Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide interfere with plants ’ ability to convert nitrate into protein and could threaten food quality , according to a new study by researchers at the University of California , Davis .
The scientists suggest that , as global climate change intensifies , it will be critical for farmers to carefully manage nitrogen fertilization in order to prevent losses in crop productivity and quality .
The study , which examined the impact of increased carbon dioxide levels on wheat and the mustard plant Arabidopsis , will be published in the May 14 issue of the journal Science .
“ Our findings suggest that scientists cannot examine the response of crops to global climate change simply in terms of rising carbon dioxide levels or higher temperatures , ” said lead author Arnold Bloom , a professor in UC Davis ’ Department of Plant Sciences .
“ Instead , we must consider shifts in plant nitrogen use that will alter food quality and even pest control , as lower protein levels in plants will force both people and pests to consume more plant material to meet their nutritional requirements , ” Bloom said .
Climate change , CO2 and agriculture
Historical records have documented that the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth ’s atmosphere has increased by 39 percent since 1800 .
If current projections hold true , the concentration will increase by an additional 40 to 140 percent by the end of the century .
This trend is of concern to agriculture because elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been shown to decrease the rates of photorespiration , the naturally occurring chemical process that combines oxygen with carbohydrates in plants .
At first , this reduction in photorespiration boosts photosynthesis , the complementary process by which plants grow by using sunlight to turn water and carbohydrates into chemical energy in the form of plant sugars .
In time , however , the increase in the rate of photosynthesis tapers off as the plants adjust to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide , and plant growth slows .
The nitrogen connection
Nitrogen is the mineral element that plants and other living organisms require in the greatest quantity to survive and grow .
Plants obtain most of their nitrogen from the soil and , in the moderate climates of the United States , absorb most of it through their roots in the form of nitrate .
In plant tissues , those compounds are assimilated into organic nitrogen compounds , which have a major influence on the plant ’s growth and productivity .
Earlier research has shown that when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase by 50 percent , the nitrogen status of plants declines significantly .
More specifically , findings from previous research by Bloom and colleagues suggested that elevated levels of carbon dioxide decreased photorespiration and inhibited nitrate assimilation in plant shoots .
New UC Davis study
In their most recent study , Bloom ’s team examined the influence of elevated carbon dioxide levels and , in some cases , low atmospheric oxygen concentrations , on nitrate assimilation in wheat and Arabidopsis plants using five different methods .
Data from all five methods confirm that elevated levels of carbon dioxide inhibit nitrate assimilation in wheat and Arabidopsis plants .
The researchers note that this effect could explain why earlier studies by other researchers have documented a 7.4 - percent to 11 - percent decrease in wheat grain protein and a 20 - percent decrease in total Arabidopsis protein under elevated carbon dioxide levels .
“ This indicates that as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations rise and nitrate assimilation in plant tissues diminishes , crops will become depleted in organic nitrogen compounds , including protein , and food quality will suffer , ” Bloom said .
“ Increasing nitrogen fertilization might compensate for slower nitrate assimilation rates , but this might not be economically or environmentally feasible . ”
He noted that farmers might be able to increase their use of nitrogen - rich ammonium fertilizers to ease the bottleneck of nitrate assimilation in crops but would have to carefully manage fertilizer applications to avoid toxic accumulations of ammonium in the plants .
To develop solutions for dealing with the impact of major increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on crops , further research is needed on how plants assimilate nitrate and ammonium , Bloom said .
Working with Bloom on this study were Martin Burger of UC Davis ’ Department of Land , Air and Water Resource ; Jose Salvador Rubio Asensio of UC Davis ’ Department of Plant Sciences ; and Asaph B. Cousins , currently of the School of Biological Sciences at Washington State University .
Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Spain ’s Agencia Regional de Ciencia y Tecnologia .

" Thank God we 're not all atheists " is the line being taken this Easter by the man tipped as a future head of the Catholic Church in Australia , according to the Sydney Morning Herald .
Anthony Fisher , the new archbishop of Parramatta , " used his inaugural Easter message to launch a scathing attack on atheism , while ignoring the sex abuse scandals besieging the Catholic Church worldwide , " reports the paper .
It then quotes Fisher as saying :
'' Last century we tried godlessness on a grand scale and the effects were devastating .
Nazism , Stalinism , Pol - Pottery , mass murder and broken relationships : all promoted by state - imposed atheism or culture - insinuated secularism . ''
This equation of atheism with all the sins committed by people who are , or were , atheists , is nothing new .
In fact , Peter Hitchens devotes quite a large part of his very readable new book , The Rage Against God , to just that ( here is a video of him talking about it ) .
In a chapter called " Homo Sovieticus " Hitchens , who had been the Moscow correspondent of the Daily Express ( although he cannot bring himself to name that newspaper , his long - time employer before he became a Mail on Sunday columnist , anywhere in the book ) , refers to " the atheist Soviet Union , where desecration and heroic survival were visible around me " .
Later , he writes that it is " important to recognise two things -- that the Russian Revolution was an earlier version of the modern revolt against God ; and that today 's anti-Christian revolutionaries would very much prefer to disown the apostolic succession which leads from Lenin and Stalin down to them . "
Of Stalin , he says : " Any suggestion that his regime 's savagery was connected with his atheism must be vigorously denied . "
As you would expect , Hitchens makes his case forcefully , passionately and , yes , intelligently , too ( for his very right wing opinions should not blind one to the fact that he is a principled man who always tries to tell the truth as he sees it ) .
But for me , at least , to no avail .
For while Stalin 's atheism may have been a necessary condition for the atrocities he committed -- I completely agree with Hitchens that " without God , many more things are possible than are permitted in a Godly order " -- it is not a sufficient one .
I part company with him when he claims that his preceding sentence proves that which follows it : " Atheism is a licence for ruthlessness , and appeals to the ruthless . "
In as much as the absence of God leaves any system of morality floundering when it comes to unarguable proof of its truth , Hitchens is on to something .
An atheist society does not have the in - built defences against the will of a tyrannous majority that religion would supply , for instance .
But he makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism .
People who are given to ruthlessness can always find a justification for it .
Many of the most ardent supporters of Marshal Petain 's collaborationist Vichy state , for instance , were right - wing Catholics .
But it would neither be fair , nor correct , to blame their Catholicism for their enthusiastic acquiescence in persecuting Jews -- even if they twisted their faith to claim its defence as the basis for their actions .
And this kind of argument works both ways .
Last summer , I found myself in the middle of a minor fuss after I wrote a scathing review of Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangroom 's Does God Hate Women ? for the Independent on Sunday .
Put simply , my objection was that they detailed terrible barbarities perpetrated against women by religious people , chiefly Muslims , and then pretty much laid the blame on religion , again , chiefly Islam , for those crimes .
( They disagreed with my analysis and , for the sake of even - handedness , and also because I did n't doubt their sincerity of purpose , you can find Johann Hari 's highly sympathetic review of the book in the NS here . )
If you want to argue , as Hitchens does , that atheists ' crimes stem from their atheism , you lay yourself open to the polar , and matching , opposite : that religion is to blame for the evil acts of the religious .
There is no shortage of scary verses in the Old Testament , after all , that the anti-religious can pluck out to demonstrate that the Abrahamic faiths are full of vengeful , sexist , murderous , not to say downright bizarre , injunctions .
Neither are right .
Just as Hitchens can point out , " When did Christians last burn , strangle or imprison each other for alleged errors of faith ? " , so too would any reasonable person agree that most of the atheists who are vocal today are not noted for their sympathy with Stalinism , Nazism or , as the archbishop put it , " Pol - Pottery " .
Hitchens and Archbishop Fisher , methinks , protest too much .
Faith , just like atheism , is a belief about the purpose and order , or lack thereof , in our universe .
Bad people do n't need either in order to be bad -- and if both sides are truly confident of their claims , they should n't resort to such blame games to argue their position .

What ’s the fastest way to boost my credit score ?
For most people , the fastest way to improve your credit score is to pay down your credit - card balances .
About one - third of your FICO score ( the score most lenders use ) is based on your credit-utilization ratio , which is the total of your credit - card balances divided by the total of your credit - card limits .
It ’s how much you ’ve charged that counts -- regardless of whether you pay your balance in full each month .
A good target is to use 20 % or less of your available credit ; a lower percentage is even better .
Advertisement - Article continues below
“ One of the common complaints we hear from consumers is they feel their scores are inappropriately low -- in the 600s -- even though they have never been reported late on any credit account , ” says Craig Watts , of FICO .
“ Such people almost always have high balances -- and commensurately high utilization rates -- on several credit cards , and that lowers their scores . ”
An example at FICO ’s Score Simulator ( at www.myfico.com) shows how a hypothetical customer with a FICO score of 707 could raise his score to as high as 777 by reducing his balances on all revolving accounts by 90 % to 100 % over 24 months .
This example takes into account the benefits of keeping accounts open longer , but paying down balances faster could improve your score almost as much .
“ How fast a lower balance can be reflected in one ’s score really depends on the lender , ” says Watts .
Many lenders send data updates to the credit bureaus once a month .
“ Depending on where your account payment falls in your lender ’s data - reporting cycle , your new balance could show up on your credit report within several days -- or it can take several weeks to appear . ”
Jonathan Bernstein ponders the Bush administration 's lack of basic competence in historical context :
We 're still early in the building of the history of the Bush years , but here 's my guess .
We 'll find that what we saw was pretty much what was happening .
He did n't act aggressively when faced with potential policy disaster -- whether we 're talking about the summer of 2001 and terrorism , or 2003 - 2005 in Iraq , or 2004 - 2008 and Afghanistan , or 2007 - 2008 and the economy , or Katrina , or anything else .
We 're going to find that he strutted around a good deal , but was otherwise passive and indifferent , and easily manipulated by those around him .
And my guess is we 're going to find the big things that went wrong ( terror , Iraq , Afghanistan , torture , the economy ) joined by dozens of smaller things that slipped through the cracks for eight years .
One last time : I 'm not talking about ideology or policy , just the basic skills of the presidency .
...
Just how bad was the Bush Administration ?
As bad , alas , as its president , and I 'm afraid that all evidence to date points to him being one of the very worst .
Ok we know the new military system is still buggy .
There 's still players who have managed to make legendary heroes , so that 's alright , even if it does take a lot more work than before .
Dwarves do n't level up their stats from things like pump operating or milling anymore , and that 's a disappointment , but I guess it 's all part of the new version and a change in gameplay to get used to .
However , let 's look at some of the artifacts my dwarves have built for me so far .
They 've made a few legendary gems , a necklace , an earring , a chest , a mace and a pike that I can think of off the top of my head .
A mace and a pike , yeah !
But ... jewelry ?
Let me tell you the most disappointing thing though .
Did any of them menace ?
Did any of them have spikes ?
They did not .
Did the chest - the most complicated artifact any of them have made yet - menace with spikes of dog leather and iron , with wood inlay of menacing spikes and a picture of something that also had spikes and was menacing ?
No .
It did not .
Granted , the craftsmanship was exceptional , and it was a very nice chest .
But it had a picture of one of the other dwarves ' epic gem inlaid into it !
Did the gem menace with spikes ?
IT DID NOT !
It did not menace with spikes .
It had no spikes that were menacing .
In fact there were no spikes , nor spike - like objects on it at all .
I would go so far as to say that it was about as un-menacing an artifact that I 've ever seen .
I swear if my dwarves start carving pictures of flowers into their artifacts , I 'm flooding the whole map with magma and going to back to something that menaces .
With spikes .

Pritzker Park in downtown Chicago is about to have a piece of public art watching over it .
Local artist Tony Tassett has made a 30 foot replica of his own eyeball , with help from a specialist contruction firm .
The 3 - storey eyeball will be transported from the construction yard to the park , ready for viewing on 7 July .
Dougal Shaw reports .
The global leader in the supply of the anti-diabetes drug insulin is pulling its state - of - the - art medication out of Greece in response to a government decree ordering a 25 per cent cut in the price of medicines .
Greece wants to slash its huge medical bill in an attempt to reduce its crippling debt .
Defending the move , Novo Nordisk , Chief Executive Officer said : “ No I really feel that the Greek diabetes patients have become hostages and we have become hostages in the failed economic policy of the government , which has led them to such a surprising move on prices .
And you ca n’t do that .
We ca n’t accept prices with a minus of 25 percent . ”
The Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk ’s claims
Athens owes it some 30 million euros .
The Greek diabetes association were forthright in their condemnation calling the announcement “ brutal blackmail ” and a “ violation of of corporate social responsibility ” .
As many as 50,000 Greeks currently use the medication .
The FCC is firmly committed to promoting an open Internet and to policies that will bring the enormous benefits of broadband to all Americans .
It will rest these policies -- all of which will be designed to foster innovation and investment while protecting and empowering consumers -- on a solid legal foundation .
Today 's court decision invalidated the prior Commission 's approach to preserving an open Internet .
But the Court in no way disagreed with the importance of preserving a free and open Internet ; nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end .
The new child poverty statistics , covering the first year of the recession , 2008 - 2009 , were published on Thursday – to no fanfare at all .
Perhaps that is because with Iain Duncan Smith now installed at the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) , there was no desire to highlight what was expected to be strong evidence of success at last for Labour 's child poverty strategy .
What the figures actually show is something quite different – and much more unsettling .
Certainly , for the first time in four years , the headline child poverty statistic ( " the number of children living in households with an income less than 60 % of median income in that year " ) came down , albeit by the smallest amount the DWP is prepared to report , namely 100,000 .
To have reversed the steady upward climb of recent years , especially in a recession , is a success – but it has come at a price .
Between April 2008 and January 2009 , Labour threw an awful lot of money at the problem .
The result was that following two rises in child benefit and the biggest rise in child tax credit since it was introduced in 2003 , an out - of - work family with two children was more than £ 600 a year better off at the end of the year than it had been at the beginning .
With several hundred thousand children belonging to families just a few pounds a week below the poverty line ( which , incidentally fell slightly in value year on year on the more sensible " after housing costs " basis ) this big increase – larger than the previous three years put together – was likely to have a positive effect , even after allowing for the recession .
And so it has proved , the number of children in poverty in workless households having come down year on year by 200,000 .
By contrast , the number of children in poverty in working households went up .
In part , this is the effect of the recession .
The employment statistics show a big increase in part - time working , and it is such part - working families – where either no one is working full - time or where one adult is staying at home – that are usually the ones who are both in work and in poverty .
The recession , though , is only part of the story here .
With the exception of New Labour 's five golden years starting in 1999 , in - work poverty has been on a rising trend since at least as long ago as the late 1970s .
It was the return to rising in - work poverty after 2004 - 05 that destroyed Labour 's goal of halving child poverty by 2010 .
The way the DWP reports this statistic , six in every 10 children in poverty now belong to a working household .
This proportion is broadly similar for the 7.8 million working - age adults in poverty .
The increase in this number over 10 years , of 1.1 million , would be seen as a huge policy failure had the previous government ever shown the slightest interest in adults without children .
And perhaps this in truth is why the DWP has said so little about these figures .
For it suits politicians of all parties to claim that work is the route out of poverty .
Such a message wraps a snarling toughness directed at workless adults inside a saccharine justification : you must work for the sake of your kids .
The truth is very different .
Work that does not provide a sufficient income is now much more to blame for poverty than worklessness .
If the new government is serious about poverty reduction , it will need to direct its reform efforts not just at the world of welfare but at the world of work , too – starting with the public sector .
Is the iPad Cannibalizing Mac Sales ?
Not Really .
After reviewing NPD ’s domestic retail data for the first month of Apple ’s June quarter , Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says that the Mac has been relatively immune to cannibalization by the iPad , though the same cannot be said of the iPod .
“ The iPad launched in US Apple retail stores on 4/3 , impacting nearly the entire month of Apple ’s sales in April .
As a result , April NPD data gives us the first sign of the degree to which the iPad cannibalizes iPod or Mac sales , ” Munster noted .
“ From the early NPD data , it appears that the iPad has a minimal cannibalization impact on Mac sales , and could be slightly cannibalizing iPod sales . ”
The analyst does n’t expect this to be a big problem for Apple ( AAPL ) .
“ We believe in the long run Mac cannibalization will exist , but will be minimal , ” he concludes .
“ Apple has successfully limited the iPad functionality to primarily content consumption , vs. content creation on a Mac .
And relative to the iPod , the physical size of an iPad provides a meaningfully different value proposition ( portability vs. screen size ) . ”
Obviously , it ’s a little early for definitive calls on just what sort of effects the iPad is having on sales of Apple ’s other products .
That said , Munster ’s analysis of NPD ’s data does jibe with a small survey by UBS analyst Maynard
Um that found that most iPad buyers do not view the device as a replacement for their traditional computers .
As I wrote in an earlier post , “ So most likely , the iPad will prove additive for Apple .
In fact , I would n’t be surprised if it generates a halo effect around the company ’s products similar to that created by the iPod .
Certainly , that ’s the sense one has paying a visit to an Apple Store these days or being spotted with an iPad in public . ”
It was fun while it lasted : Lala , the cloud - based music service ( and former CD trading service and streaming radio service ) , has announced it will cease operations on May 31 , 2010 .
It was fun while it lasted : , the cloud - based music service ( and former and ) , has announced it will cease operations on May 31 , 2010 .
Back in December , for an undisclosed sum , which led to speculation that Apple would introduce over - the - air streaming at some point for its iTunes app and iTunes Store .
According to the Lala site , all of the money existing users have spent on Web songs , wallet balances , and unredeemed gift cards will convert to iTunes credit .
Users who refuse that option will receive refund checks .
( If only every service to shut down offered that kind of deal . )
I reviewed the service several times in the past for PCMag , and found that it offered some seriously inventive technology in its various incarnations , even as it fought .
Here 's hoping the team at Lala fares well in its new endeavors with Apple - - and that they help take iTunes to the next level .
An Apple spokesman said the company does not " comment on future plans . "

The Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand ( Tuanz ) has been pushing for a solution to " horror " stories about bill shocks from mobile roaming , especially with data use .
" Roaming charges and the bill shock that results are a blight on the telecommunications industry landscape and a travesty that causes extreme hardship for the customers who unwittingly get caught up , " Tuanz chief executive Ernie Newman said recently .
Vodafone today said it was cutting mobile roaming costs around the world from $ 30 per megabyte ( MB ) in some places to a standard $ 10 per megabyte on any network .
As a promotion for the offer , Vodafone customers visiting Australia would be able to use data at $ 2 per MB from the start of the offer on May 26 for three months .
Kursten Shalfoon , Vodafone 's general manager of products , services and internet , said smartphones were the fastest growing market segment , and the price cut for roaming was seen as a way to help increase demand for mobile data abroad .

In answer to todays United States Government and its Colonial Corporation , the Oglala Sioux Tribal Governments press conference :
 We the Lakotah People , do not want our massacred dead bodies of Men , Women and Children at the mass grave at Wounded Knee used for publicity by the United States Government nor their colonial corporation , the Oglala Sioux Tribal Government . 
On May 1 , 2010 , two young men , the Camp brothers counted coup on the first 7th Cavalry helicopter and Debbie White Plume , an elder and grandmother who charged the second helicopter preventing it from landing .
By running under the blades and touching them without harming the enemy and getting away is how the Lakotah counted coup on this eventful day .
May 2 , 2010 at 9:35 am Dakota .
To the Original Peoples of the Fourth World and all International Press Services :
At high noon today US Army helicopters of the US Seventh Cavalry air division attempted to land their Blackhawk aircraft upon Lakota Sacred Burial grounds in South Dakota .
The presence of military aircraft from this unit is a sad and insulting reminder of the slaughter of more than 300 American Aboriginals on December 29 , 1890 when soldiers of the US 7th Cavalry gunned down more than 300 Aboriginal Minneconjou Lakota refugee children , women , infants and the elderly at what is now called Wounded Knee in South Dakota Indian Country .
The military then left the bodies of their victims to decay unburied in the driving snow .
According to reports from Indigenous Rights Movement Radio host Wanblee this afternoon , Lakota resident Theresa TwoBulls was given less than 24 hours notice that three US Army 7th Cavalry helicopters would make a landing on the sacred burial grounds at Wounded Knee .
As of this writing , the US military was confronted by angry but peaceful and steadfast community resistance as the Aboriginal people of the area have so far , according to reports from Lakota people on the ground , managed to prevent the aircraft from touching Indigenous ground .
For all American Aboriginals of the Americas , this is a sacred area .
This is the place where the promise of a people died while fleeing from a genocidal US military unit hell - bent on liquidating the continent of its Indigenous population .
There has never been any official apology offered for this massacre and the military awards bestowed upon the genocidal aggressors involved in this conflict still stand , as does a physical monument in honor of the US Army killed during Custers last stand against a defiant and united Indigenous resistance to their own demise .
The history of the US Army 7th Cavalry is important to understanding the level of violence used against Indigenous peoples .
It is important to remember that after the US Seventh Cavalry officially ended the  Indian Wars at home , they were then dispatched to do battle against Indigenous Filipinos struggling to maintain their hard - won national independence from the colonialist Spanish .
In other words , the US War Department sent this very same unit to do overseas what was done here to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas .
In this historical light , it is only logical for Indigenous peoples to assume that the Obama administration is attempting to make a political point out of this spectacle .
Only , what sort of message are you sending by insulting and humiliating a people already suffering from five centuries of continuous pro-Europocentric , anti-Indigenous genocide ?
This domestic military action is a deliberate insult and an obvious message of ongoing colonialism , state - sponsored racism and apathetic Indigenous genocide to all Indigenous peoples across the Fourth World ; to the whole of the Lakota / Dakota Nation ; and to the Indigenous residents of Pine Ridge and Wounded Knee .
The symbolism of dispatching the Seventh Cavalry to Wounded Knee in an attempt to land weapons of mass destruction on Aboriginal sacred ground tells us how little this government , and this particular administration , respects the people of Indian Country and our significant historical perspective as survivors of the racist Euro - settler xenophobic purges waged against the Indian in the Americas .
To make matters worse , this action comes on the heels of newly - passed legislation in Arizona state that requires law officers to racially - profile anyone they believe looks ,  sounds  or dresses  like an illegal immigrant , a thinly veiled race law that directly effects both our Indigenous sisters and brothers native to Occupied Mexico as well as the Native American population of Arizona in the United States .
Given that most Indigenous peoples of the Americas share the same general physiotype and more often than not , similar Spanish last names , the passage of this guideline will without a doubt lead to widespread abuses against that states brown - skinned population .
The legal door now opened , Texas and other states led by neo - confederate constituencies are moving to pass their own anti-immigrant / anti-Indigenous directives that will broadly effect anyone and everyone who could be perceived by the colonial European majority as a foreign invader . 
The Obama administration has shown America and the world that they are no different than any other previous US government in their view that the American Indian on both sides of the US border is nothing more than a prop or a tool to be displayed only when it is useful to promote the contemporary 
21st - century neo-colonialist capitalist agenda .
The Obama administration , an office headed by a man of African descent , has shamed itself and all those who have supported his candidacy in arrogantly dismissing the memory of our people interred at Wounded Knee by rubbing the military might of the historically anti-Indigenous 7th Cavalry in our faces by forcibly entering Indian Country in an attempt to land their machines of war on top of the bodies of our ancestral dead .
Clearly , the culture war against the American Indian is not over .
Welcome to the new American century .
Pass this on .
We must get the word out .
Let everyone know … .
Contact your local media .
Tell them the Local Media in ( Rapid City , SD ) havent even mentioned this in the news .
So typical for Rapid City , SD media .
and if they did post it , it would not be the truth … .
I tried to contact the Rapid City Urinal .
LOL .
They wo n’t return my calls or post any of the comments I have made in defense of our people .

Today at just past Noon Central Time ; Three US Army Helicopters attempted to land on Lakota Sacred Burial grounds at Wounded Knee , South Dakota .
The Helicopters were from the Seventh Cavalry which were Historically remnants of General G.A. Custer whose troops were defeated at Little Big Horn in one of the many battles of the United States as they waged a war of attrition and Genocide on Native Americans after the Civil War .
On Dec 28 , 1890 remnants of the Seventh Cavalry mowed down more than 300 Babies , Children , Women , Old People and Men ; at what is now called Wounded Knee , South Dakota and left their victims bodies unburied and frozen .
Theresa TwoBulls was given less than 24 hours notice that three US Army 7th Cav helicopters would land on the burial grounds at Wounded Knee today .
They were met with peaceful but firm resistance , as Lakota ( Sioux ) women and children stood immobile on that sacred ground , preventing the gross , unspeakable insult of 7th Cavalry choppers to land on the same ground where more than 300 murder victims lay buried .
A Lakota mother said ….
 I cannot believe they are doing this , have they ( 7th Cav ) NO respect for our dead ?
Evidently the 3 helicopters and brass in charge did not know their history .. and what a unspeakable insult it was to the residents of Pine Ridge , Wounded Knee and the Lakota people ; to have the ACTUAL Seventh Cavalry choppers attempt to land on this sacred ground .

The great obsession of the nineteenth century was , as we know , history : with its themes of development and of suspension , of crisis , and cycle , themes of the ever - accumulating past , with its great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world .
The nineteenth century found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermaldynamics .
The present epoch will perhaps be above all the epoch of space .
We are in the epoch of simultaneity : we are in the epoch of juxtaposition , the epoch of the near and far , of the side - by - side , of the dispersed .
We are at a moment .
I believe , when our experience of the world is less that of a long life developing through time than that of a network that connects points and intersects with its own skein .
One could perhaps say that certain ideological conﬂicts animating present - day polemics oppose the pious descendents of time and the determined inhabitants of space .
Structuralism , or at least which is grouped under this slightly too general name , is the effort to establish , between elements that could have been connected on a temporal axis , an ensemble of relations that makes them appear as juxtaposed , set off against one another , implicated by each other — that makes them appear , in short , as a sort of conﬁguration .
Actually , structuralism does not entail denial of time ; it does involve a certain manner of dealing with what we call time and what we call history .
Yet it is necessary to notice that the space which today appears to form the horizon of our concerns , our theory , our systems , is not an innovation ; space itself has a history in Western experience , and it is not possible to disregard the fatal intersection of time with space .
One could say , by way of retracing this history of space very roughly , that in the Middle Ages there was a hierarchic ensemble of places : sacred places and profane plates : protected places and open , exposed places : urban places and rural places ( all these concern the real life of men ) .
In cosmological theory , there were the supercelestial places as opposed to the celestial , and the celestial place was in its turn opposed to the terrestrial place .
There were places where things had been put because they had been violently displaced , and then on the contrary places where things found their natural ground and stability .
It was this complete hierarchy , this opposition , this intersection of places that constituted what could very roughly be called medieval space : the space of emplacement .
This space of emplacement was opened up by Galileo .
For the real scandal of Galileo ’s work lay not so much in his discovery , or rediscovery , that the earth revolved around the sun , but in his constitution of an inﬁnite , and inﬁnitely open space .
In such a space the place of the Middle Ages turned out to be dissolved .
as it were ; a thing ’s place was no longer anything but a point in its movement , just as the stability of a thing was only its movement indeﬁnitely slowed down .
In other words , starting with Galileo and the seventeenth century , extension was substituted for localization .
Today the site has been substituted for extension which itself had replaced emplacement .
The site is deﬁned by relations of proximity between points or elements ; formally , we can describe these relations as series , trees , or grids .
Moreover , the importance of the site as a problem in contemporary technical work is well known : the storage of data or of the intermediate results of a calculation in the memory of a machine , the circulation of discrete elements with a random output ( automobile trafﬁc is a simple case , or indeed the sounds on a telephone line ) ; the identiﬁcation of marked or coded elements inside a set that may be randomly distributed , or may be arranged according to single or to multiple classiﬁcations .
In a still more concrete manner , the problem of siting or placement arises for mankind in terms of demography .
This problem of the human site or living space is not simply that of knowing whether there will be enough space for men in the world — a problem that is certainly quite important — but also that of knowing what relations of propinquity , what type of storage , circulation , marking , and classiﬁcation of human elements should be adopted in a given situation in order to achieve a given end .
Our epoch is one in which space takes for us the form of relations among sites .
In any case I believe that the anxiety of our era has to do fundamentally with space , no doubt a great deal more than with time .
Time probably appears to us only as one of the various distributive operations that are possible for the elements that are spread out in space ,
Now , despite all the techniques for appropriating space , despite the whole network of knowledge that enables us to delimit or to formalize it , contemporary space is perhaps still not entirely desanctiﬁed ( apparently unlike time , it would seem , which was detached from the sacred in the nineteenth century ) .
To be sure a certain theoretical desanctiﬁcation of space ( the one signaled by Galileo ’s work ) has occurred , but we may still not have reached the point of a practical desanctiﬁcation of space .
And perhaps our life is still governed by a certain number of oppositions that remain inviolable , that our institutions and practices have not yet dared to break down .
These are oppositions that we regard as simple givens : for example between private space and public space , between family space and social space , between cultural space and useful space , between the space of leisure and that of work .
All these are still nurtured by the hidden presence of the sacred .
Bachelard ’s monumental work and the descriptions of phenomenologists have taught us that we do not live in a homogeneous and empty space , but on the contrary in a space thoroughly imbued with quantities and perhaps thoroughly fantasmatic as well .
The space of our primary perception , the space of our dreams and that of our passions hold within themselves qualities that seem intrinsic : there is a light , ethereal , transparent space , or again a dark , rough , encumbered space ; a space from above , of summits , or on the contrary a space from below of mud ; or again a space that can be ﬂowing like sparkling water , or space that is ﬁxed , congealed , like stone or crystal .
Yet these analyses , while fundamental for reﬂection in our time , primarily concern internal space .
I should like to speak now of external space .
The space in which we live , which draws us out of ourselves , in which the erosion of our lives .
our time and our history occurs , the space that claws and gnaws at us , is also , in itself , a heterogeneous space .
In other words , we do not live in a kind of void , inside of which we could place individuals and things .
We do not live inside a void that could be colored with diverse shades of light , we live inside a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another .
Of course one might attempt to describe these different sites by looking for the set of relations by which a given site can be deﬁned .
For example , describing the set of relations that deﬁne the sites of transportation , streets , trains ( a train is an extraordinary bundle of relations because it is something through which one goes , it is also something by means of which one can go from one point to another , and then it is also something that goes by ) .
One could describe , via the cluster of relations that allows them to be deﬁned , the sites of temporary relaxation — cafes , cinemas , beaches .
Likewise one could describe , via its network of relations , the closed or semi-closed sites of rest — the house , the bedroom , the bed , el cetera .
But among all these sites , I am interested in certain ones that have the curious property of being in relation with all the other sites , but in such a way as to suspect , neutralize , or invert the set of relations that they happen to designate , mirror , or reﬂect .
These spaces , as it were , which are linked with all the others , which however contradict all the other sites , are of two main types .
HETEROTOPIAS
First there are the utopias .
Utopias are sites with no real place .
They are sites that have a general relation of direct or inverted analogy with the real space of Society .
They present society itself in a perfected form , or else society turned upside down , but in any case these utopias are fundamentally unreal spaces .
There are also , probably in every culture , in every civilization , real places — places that do exist and that are formed in the very founding of society — which are something like counter - sites , a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites , all the other real sites that can be found within the culture , are simultaneously represented , contested , and inverted .
Places of this kind are outside of all places , even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality .
Because these places are absolutely different from all the sites that they reﬂect and speak about , I shall call them , by way of contrast to utopias , heterotopias .
I believe that between utopias and these quite other sites , these heterotopias , there might be a sort of mixed , joint experience , which would be the mirror .
The mirror is , after all , a utopia , since it is a placeless place .
In the mirror , I see myself there where I am not , in an unreal , virtual space that opens up behind the surface ; I am over there , there where I am not , a sort of shadow that gives my own visibility to myself , that enables me to see myself there where I am absent : such is the utopia of the mirror .
But it is also a heterotopia in so far as the mirror does exist in reality , where it exerts a sort of counteraction on the position that I occupy .
From the standpoint of the mirror I discover my absence from the place where I am since I see myself over there .
Starting from this gaze that is , as it were , directed toward me , from the ground of this virtual space that is on the other side of the glass , I come back toward myself ; I begin again to direct my eyes toward myself and to reconstitute myself there where I am .
The mirror functions as a heterotopia in this respect : it makes this place that I occupy at the moment when I look at myself in the glass at once absolutely real , connected with all the space that surrounds it , and absolutely unreal , since in order to be perceived it has to pass through this virtual point which is over there .
As for the heterotopias as such , how can they be described ?
What meaning do they have ?
We might imagine a sort of systematic description — I do not say a science because the term is too galvanized now — that would , in a given society , take as its object the study , analysis , description , and “ reading ” ( as some like to say nowadays ) of these different spaces , of these other places .
As a sort of simultaneously mythic and real contestation of the space in which we live , this description could be called heterotopology .
Its ﬁrst principle is that there is probably not a single culture in the world that fails to constitute heterotopias .
That is a constant of every human group .
But the heterotopias obviously take quite varied forms , and perhaps no one absolutely universal form of heterotopia would be found .
We can however class them in two main categories .
In the so - called primitive societies , there is a certain form of heterotopia that I would call crisis heterotopias , i.e. , there are privileged or sacred or forbidden places , reserved for individuals who are , in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live , in a state of crisis : adolescents , menstruating women , pregnant women .
the elderly , etc .
In out society , these crisis heterotopias are persistently disappearing , though a few remnants can still be found .
For example , the boarding school , in its nineteenth - century form , or military service for young men , have certainly played such a role , as the ﬁrst manifestations of sexual virility were in fact supposed to take place “ elsewhere ” than at home .
For girls , there was , until the middle of the twentieth century , a tradition called the “ honeymoon trip ” which was an ancestral theme .
The young woman ’s deﬂowering could take place “ nowhere ” and , at the moment of its occurrence the train or honeymoon hotel was indeed the place of this nowhere , this heterotopia without geographical markers .
But these heterotopias of crisis are disappearing today and are being replaced , I believe , by what we might call heterotopias of deviation : those in which individuals whose behavior is deviant in relation to the required mean or norm are placed .
Cases of this are rest homes and psychiatric hospitals , and of course prisons , and one should perhaps add retirement homes that are , as it were , on the borderline between the heterotopia of crisis and the heterotopia of deviation since , after all , old age is a crisis , but is also a deviation since in our society where leisure is the rule , idleness is a sort of deviation .
The second principle of this description of heterotopias is that a society , as its history unfolds , can make an existing heterotopia function in a very different fashion ; for each heterotopia has a precise and determined function within a society and the same heterotopia can , according to the synchrony of the culture in which it occurs , have one function or another .
As an example I shall take the strange heterotopia of the cemetery .
The cemetery is certainly a place unlike ordinary cultural spaces .
It is a space that is however connected with all the sites of the city , state or society or village , etc. , since each individual , each family has relatives in the cemetery .
In western culture the cemetery has practically always existed .
But it has undergone important changes .
Until the end of the eighteenth century , the cemetery was placed at the heart of the city , next to the church .
In it there was a hierarchy of possible tombs .
There was the charnel house in which bodies lost the last traces of individuality , there were a few individual tombs and then there were the tombs inside the church .
These latter tombs were themselves of two types , either simply tombstones with an inscription , or mausoleums with statues .
This cemetery housed inside the sacred space of the church has taken on a quite different cast in modern civilizations , and curiously , it is in a time when civilization has become “ atheistic , ” as one says very crudely , that western culture has established what is termed the cult of the dead .
Basically it was quite natural that , in a time of real belief in the resurrection of bodies and the immortality of the soul , overriding importance was not accorded to the body ’s remains .
On the contrary , from the moment when people are no longer sure that they have a soul or that the body will regain life , it is perhaps necessary to give much more attention to the dead body , which is ultimately the only trace of our existence in the world and in language .
In any case , it is from the beginning of the nineteenth century that everyone has a right to her or his own little box for her or his own little personal decay , but on the other hand , it is only from that start of the nineteenth century that cemeteries began to be located at the outside border of cities .
In correlation with the individualization of death and the bourgeois appropriation of the cemetery , there arises an obsession with death as an “ illness . ”
The dead , it is supposed , bring illnesses to the living , and it is the presence and proximity of the dead right beside the houses , next to the church , almost in the middle of the street , it is this proximity that propagates death itself .
This major theme of illness spread by the contagion in the cemeteries persisted until the end of the eighteenth century , until , during the nineteenth century , the shift of cemeteries toward the suburbs was initiated .
The cemeteries then came to constitute , no longer the sacred and immortal heart of the city , but the other city , where each family possesses its dark resting place .
Third principle .
The heterotopia is capable of juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces , several sites that are in themselves incompatible .
Thus it is that the theater brings onto the rectangle of the stage , one after the other , a whole series of places that are foreign to one another ; thus it is that the cinema is a very odd rectangular room , at the end of which , on a two - dimensional screen , one sees the projection of a three - dimensional space , but perhaps the oldest example of these heterotopias that take the form of contradictory sites is the garden .
We must not forget that in the Orient the garden , an astonishing creation that is now a thousand years old , had very deep and seemingly superimposed meanings .
The traditional garden of the Persians was a sacred space that was supposed to bring together inside its rectangle four parts representing the four parts of the world , with a space still more sacred than the others that were like an umbilicus , the navel of the world at its center ( the basin and water fountain were there ) ; and all the vegetation of the garden was supposed to come together in this space , in this sort of microcosm .
As for carpets , they were originally reproductions of gardens ( the garden is a rug onto which the whole world comes to enact its symbolic perfection , and the rug is a sort of garden that can move across space ) .
The garden is the smallest parcel of the world and then it is the totality of the world .
The garden has been a sort of happy , universalizing heterotopia since the beginnings of antiquity ( our modern zoological gardens spring from that source ) .
Fourth principle .
Heterotopias are most often linked to slices in time — which is to say that they open onto what might be termed , for the sake of symmetry , heterochronies .
The heterotopia begins to function at full capacity when men arrive at a sort of absolute break with their traditional time .
This situation shows us that the cemetery is indeed a highly heterotopic place since , for the individual , the cemetery begins with this strange heterochrony , the loss of life , and with this quasi-eternity in which her permanent lot is dissolution and disappearance .
From a general standpoint , in a society like ours heterotopias and heterochronies are structured and distributed in a relatively complex fashion .
First of all , there are heterotopias of indeﬁnitely accumulating time , for example museums and libraries , Museums and libraries have become heterotopias in which time never stops building up and topping its own summit , whereas in the seventeenth century , even at the end of the century , museums and libraries were the expression of an individual choice .
By contrast , the idea of accumulating everything , of establishing a sort of general archive , the will to enclose in one place all times , all epochs , all forms , all tastes , the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages , the project of organizing in this way a sort of perpetual and indeﬁnite accumulation of time in an immobile place , this whole idea belongs to our modernity .
The museum and the library are heterotopias that are proper to western culture of the nineteenth century .
Opposite these heterotopias that are linked to the accumulation of time , there are those linked , on the contrary , to time in its most ﬂowing , transitory , precarious aspect , to time in the mode of the festival .
These heterotopias are not oriented toward the eternal , they are rather absolutely temporal [ chroniques ] .
Such , for example , are the fairgrounds , these “ marvelous empty sites on the outskirts of cities ” that teem once or twice a year with stands , displays , heteroclite objects , wrestlers , snakewomen , fortune - tellers , and so forth .
Quite recently , a new kind of temporal heterotopia has been invented : vacation villages , such as those Polynesian villages that offer a compact three weeks of primitive and eternal nudity to the inhabitants of the cities .
You see , moreover , that through the two forms of heterotopias that come together here , the heterotopia of the festival and that of the eternity of accumulating time , the huts of Djerba are in a sense relatives of libraries and museums .
for the rediscovery of Polynesian life abolishes time ; yet the experience is just as much the , , rediscovery of time , it is as if the entire history of humanity reaching back to its origin were accessible in a sort of immediate knowledge ,
Fifth principle .
Heterotopias always presuppose a system of opening and closing that both isolates them and makes them penetrable .
In general , the heterotopic site is not freely accessible like a public place .
Either the entry is compulsory , as in the case of entering a barracks or a prison , or else the individual has to submit to rites and puriﬁcations .
To get in one must have a certain permission and make certain gestures .
Moreover , there are even heterotopias that are entirely consecrated to these activities of puriﬁcation — puriﬁcation that is partly religious and partly hygienic , such as the hammin of the Moslems , or else puriﬁcation that appears to be purely hygienic , as in Scandinavian saunas .
There are others , on the contrary , that seem to be pure and simple openings , but that generally hide curious exclusions .
Everyone can enter into thew heterotopic sites , but in fact that is only an illusion — we think we enter where we are , by the very fact that we enter , excluded .
I am thinking for example , of the famous bedrooms that existed on the great farms of Brazil and elsewhere in South America .
The entry door did not lead into the central room where the family lived , and every individual or traveler who came by had the right to ope this door , to enter into the bedroom and to sleep there for a night .
Now these bedrooms were such that the individual who went into them never had access to the family ’s quarter the visitor was absolutely the guest in transit , was not really the invited guest .
This type of heterotopia , which has practically disappeared from our civilizations , could perhaps be found in the famous American motel rooms where a man goes with his car and his mistress and where illicit sex is both absolutely sheltered and absolutely hidden , kept isolated without however being allowed out in the open .
Sixth principle .
The last trait of heterotopias is that they have a function in relation to all the space that remains .
This function unfolds between two extreme poles .
Either their role is to create a space of illusion that exposes every real space , all the sites inside of which human life is partitioned , as still more illusory ( perhaps that is the role that was played by those famous brothels of which we are now deprived ) .
Or else , on the contrary , their role is to create a space that is other , another real space , as perfect , as meticulous , as well arranged as ours is messy , ill constructed , and jumbled .
This latter type would be the heterotopia , not of illusion , but of compensation , and I wonder if certain colonies have not functioned somewhat in this manner .
In certain cases , they have played , on the level of the general organization of terrestrial space , the role of heterotopias .
I am thinking , for example , of the ﬁrst wave of colonization in the seventeenth century , of the Puritan societies that the English had founded in America and that were absolutely perfect other places .
I am also thinking of those extraordinary Jesuit colonies that were founded in South America : marvelous , absolutely regulated colonies in which human perfection was effectively achieved .
The Jesuits of Paraguay established colonies in which existence was regulated at every turn .
The village was laid out according to a rigorous plan around a rectangular place at the foot of which was the church ; on one side , there was the school ; on the other , the cemetery , and then , in front of the church , an avenue set out that another crossed at ﬁght angles ; each family had its little cabin along these two axes and thus the sign of Christ was exactly reproduced .
Christianity marked the space and geography of the American world with its fundamental sign .
The daily life of individuals was regulated , not by the whistle , but by the bell .
Everyone was awakened at the same time , everyone began work at the same time ; meals were at noon and ﬁve o’clock , then came bedtime , and at midnight came what was called the marital wake - up , that is , at the chime of the churchbell , each person carried out her / his duty .
Brothels and colonies are two extreme types of heterotopia , and if we think , after all , that the boat is a ﬂoating piece of space , a place without a place , that exists by itself , that is closed in on itself and at the same time is given over to the inﬁnity of the sea and that , from port to port , from tack to tack , from brothel to brothel , it goes as far as the colonies in search of the most precious treasures they conceal in their gardens , you will understand why the boat has not only been for our civilization , from the sixteenth century until the present , the great instrument of economic development ( I have not been speaking of that today ) , but has been simultaneously the greatest reserve of the imagination .
The ship is the heterotopia par excellence .
In civilizations without boats , dreams dry up , espionage takes the place of adventure , and the police take the place of pirates .

May 14 , 2010  --
Decked out in red midriff - baring tops and hot pants , dancers at a recent competition earned whoops and praise for their skilled moves and obvious talent .
But what was an exhilarating performance has turned into an Internet firestorm -- the dancers gyrating on a Los Angeles stage to Beyonce 's " All the Single Ladies " were as young as 8 .
The girls ' parents defended their daughters ' performance at the World of Dance , billed as the largest U.S. urban dance competition , saying their daughters ' moves and outfits were appropriate for competition .
" This is taken completely out of context , " Cory Miller , father of one of the girls , told " Good Morning America " today .
" The girls were n't meant to be viewed by millions of people . "
Miller said they have tried to slow the spread of the video , but viewers need to understand that the girls ' performance was " completely normal for dancing . "
" On behalf of the parents , our best interest is for the kids , " he said .
" Just know that the kids are doing something that they completely love to do .
They compete in dance competitions ... in front of family and friends . "
Melissa Presch , a mother of one of the 8 - year - old dancers , said , " We 're very proud of our daughters and their accomplishments . "
Comments on YouTube , where the video has logged tens of thousands of hits , range from disgust to support .
" Why is this legal ? " one viewer wrote .
" I do n't ' think these girls think they are doing anything wrong .
If you think so then you are imposing your adult views onto the girls , " said another viewer .
The girls themselves see nothing wrong with their performance .
" We like to give over 100 percent , " one of the dancers said , " sometimes like 220 percent . "
Skimpy Costumes in Girls ' Performance ' Designed for Movement , ' Mom Says
Presch said her daughter has never seen Beyonce 's video , only the cartoon performance in the recently released children 's movie " Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel . "
" It 's one of the most popular songs probably of the decade , said Presch .
" The costumes are designed for movement , unrestricted movement and to show body lines . "
Presch also defended the girl 's costumes , saying that judges need to be able to see the girl 's movement and technical skills .
Parents of children not involved in the performance , however , questioned why the dancers ' parents allowed them to dance suggestively in outfits that can only be described as skimpy .
" As a new father , I definitely would not allow my daughter to be in a situation like that , " Rob Lotterman said .
" It probably does n't matter if they were wearing sweat pants or bikinis , " mother Ariane Gold said .
" The grinding was n't appropriate . "
Short list of tips & guidelines that every game developer should keep in mind .
No rocket science , common sense , really , but it ’s still relatively rare to find codebases that apply to them .
It ’s especially aimed at gameplay programmers , who operate a little bit further up from the metal .
With todays hardware , cache can be your biggest friend or enemy , CPUs got the the point where a few extra calculations hurt much less than a single cache miss ( so LUT is not always the best option , for example ) .
I ’m not going to write too much about cache architecture itself , it ’s a topic on its own .
If you ’re interested see Gustavo ’s article or this paper by Ulrich Drepper .
In a nutshell - cache is a very fast memory organized in lines of 32 - 128 bytes .
When memory is referenced , cache is tested first , if data is there - access is very quick , if not - whole line is loaded .
In the latter case , this means cache miss and costs hundreds of cycles .
To put things into perspective , consider numbers from famous Tony Albrecht ’s paper - Pitfalls of OOP , he speeds bounding spheres calculations by 35 % just by changing data layout ( not touching code at all ) .
There are 3 main reasons of cache misses :
data is read for the first time ( and was n’t lucky enough to be in same cacheline as previously loaded variables ) ,
data has been evicted from cache ,
cache thrashing ( todays caches are set associative , so memory location maps to limited number of possible cache lines ) .
How to avoid them ?
do not bloat your structures .
Think about padding ( Cruncher # to the rescue ! ) , use bitfields instead of multiple bools , consider using smaller data types .
Of course , this should never be done automatically , think about every case ( see below for example , do n’t break access patterns to minimize padding ) .
As I mentioned above - it may be worth to trade off CPU speed for memory and compress data .
think about your access patterns .
Put members that are used together next to each other .
Too often I see code that first accesses member at offset 2 , then jumps to 130 .
I ’ve seen fragments that ’d cause 3 cache misses on 3 accesses to the same object !
I ’ve been able to remove hundreds of cache misses per frame just by moving variables around .
separate hot / cold data .
That ’s related both to point # 1 & # 2 , it ’ll make your structures smaller and your access patterns more cache - friendly .
Consider : struct Lol { int a , b ; Cat cat ; // 140 bytes } ; for every object { if ( object -> isActive ) object -> Update ( ) ; } this presentation by Microsoft , typical console title has 30 - 40 % cache usage ( my experience is similar ) .
This means , it only uses 1 byte of every 3 loaded .
Better solution : for every object { if ( isObjectActive [i ] ) object -> Update ( ) ; } for every active object object -> Update ( ) ; while ( itObject != 0 ) { if ( itObject -> is Disposed ( ) ) disposedObjects.push_back( itObject ) ; itObject = itObject -> next ;
this presentation by Microsoft , typical console title has 30 - 40 % cache usage ( my experience is similar ) .
This means , it only uses 1 byte of every 3 loaded .
Better solution : consider using component - based model .
It improves data locality & makes objects smaller .
Now , we can batch - process components and load only data that we actually need .
In traditional approach , base object structures can grow really big and again - we load 400 bytes only to touch one here , then 4 here and then maybe 64 there .
With component based approach , all this data would be stored next to each other with no other stuff nearby .
We can push it further and store components of same type in arrays , one after another , this way when we ’re done with component A1 , very next byte ( well , depends on aligment ) is component A2 ( of same type , but belonging to different object ) , so it ’s perfect for batch processing .
think about your data structures .
Again - cache loves linear access .
This means - be careful when using trees & linked lists .
They can be made a little bit more friendly by using pool allocators , but maybe switching to another data structure should be considered as well .
You may need to forget your CS classes and not focus on big O notation so much .
If there are not many elements , simple array may still beat lists , even when inserting / removing objects .
Sorted - arrays / hash tables are nice alternatives to map / rb - tree .
do not copy .
If you look at many game engines , they spent big chung of time copying / moving / transforming objects between different lists .
Every time you copy data around - you waste time .
Keep asking yourself - do I really need to do it , maybe it ’s enough to store reference somewhere .
[ Edit ]
As pointed out by Brian in comments - this may sound a little too radical .
Let ’s rephrase it to “ do not copy , unless you have to ” .
As with other tips – sometimes you need to choose lesser evil .
In an ideal world , we ’d have everything in perfect , cache - friendly format .
In reality , we sometimes may need to rearrange data ( as in isActive example ) .
See Brian ’s comment for more info .
profile .
Even if you ’re sure you understand the situation - validate your assumptions .
Focus on fixing place with poor bytes / cache line usage first .
Profile it afterwards again to make sure your changes actually helped .
prefetch .
Left it for the end as it ’s the most brute - force solution , sometimes unavoidable , though .
Even with data organized in a linear fashion , you will pay for cache miss from time to time ( whenever new object is not in cache ) .
In order to avoid it , you can try to let the CPU know you ’ll need it soon .
That ’s what prefetch does , basically , it loads the data to cache , in the background .
Here ’s the trick though - it still needs few hundreds of cycles to complete .
So , do n’t expect miracles if you do this : prefetch ( 0 , tab [ i ] ) ; int a = tab [ i ] .a ;

Brian Karis 2010-04-26 01:43:35
Great post .
I disagree with the “ do not copy ” part though .
It also seemed odd because I ’m not sure how that point was related to cache coherence .
Copying data can be a useful tool in improving cache performance .
Copying can be used to grab parts of a larger data structure while it is being accessed in the first place to be used later in a cache friendly way instead of accessing the same large data structure again or chasing pointers to get there .
You could argue that the data should already be broken apart from that larger structure and the benefit could be made without the copy .
In many cases this is true .
In others it is n’t .
Copying can be a very simple way to lining up just the data you will need later with no gaps .
A very simple example of this is an operation that does n’t operate on every object .
A list of just the objects that need this operation could be pointers , or even pointers to components .
Either way if every other object needs to be operated on your cache usage can get bad .
If a small amount of data is needed from the objects it ’s better to copy that relevant data to the list instead of references to it .
The later operation can then be done with 100 % cache usage .
In most cases copying is as bad as it seems but it can also be a nice tool for improving cache usage .

This is cool but the there ’s no coverage of the metrics .
How do you measure what ’s happening to the cache and how it effects your program ?

Very good explanation on how to align and operate over data structures in both C and C ++.
Very insightful article .
I also recommend to read processor specific manuals , such as i386 microprocessor handbook , and similar books .
Also , in some cases I recommend to use atomic operations if the compiler supports them , for example on GCC we have some Atomic Builtins : http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html

@ Brian : good catch , added little explanation , thanks !
@ Dan :
It depends on a development environment .
For X360 there is PIX and performance counters , for PS3 - SN Tuner .
Not sure about PC , to be honest , I usually just go with console optimization and it helps with PC as well .

Using bitfields instead of multiple bools may introduce LHS ( load hit store ) issues if those bools are used together ( e.g. one is set and then another is tested ) .

For profiling - do n’t know to be honest , never needed it .
I optimize for X360 / PS3 , it helps with PC as well .

Mr Hughes added : " I am hoping what the public decide is that David did the honourable thing , and that if and when appropriate he will be able to come back because by all accounts ... he was one of the outstanding members of this Government . "
In March 2006 , the complete design of Sun Microsystems ' UltraSPARC T1 microprocessor was released - in open - source form , it was named OpenSPARC T1 .
In early 2008 , its successor , OpenSPARC T2 , was also released in open - source form .
These were the first ( and still only ) 64 - bit microprocessors ever open - sourced .
They were also the first ( and still only ) CMT ( chip multithreaded ) microprocessors ever open - sourced .
Both designs are freely available to anyone under open - source licenses .
These downloads include not only the processor design source code but also simulation tools , design verification suites , Hypervisor source code , and other helpful tools .

The BBC has accused the government of political interference after it refused to provide a ministerial guest for Question Time unless Alastair Campbell was removed as a panellist .
BBC executives said they rejected the demand and tonight 's show went out without a representative from the coalition government .
Gavin Allen , the show 's executive editor , posted a blog on the BBC website saying No 10 had insisted that Tony Blair 's former director of communications was replaced by a shadow cabinet member .
" Very obviously we refused , " Allen wrote , " and as a result no minister appeared , meaning that the government was not represented on the country 's most - watched political programme in Queen 's speech week – one of the most important moments in the parliamentary calendar . "
It is understood that the cabinet minister originally pencilled in to appear was David Laws , the chief secretary to the Treasury .
The panel consisted of Campbell , former Liberal Democrat MP Susan Kramer , broadcaster and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan , author and journalist Sir Max Hastings and the Tory MP John Redwood , the former Welsh secretary .
Allen said Downing Street objected to Campbell because he was " not an elected Labour representative or frontbencher " .
Allen wrote : " This week for the first time in my three years as executive editor of Question Time we were told by Downing Street that a cabinet minister would only appear on the programme if another member of the panel was replaced . "
After the programme , which is pre-recorded , had been filmed Campbell wrote on Twitter : " Question Time over .
Mystery revealed as to why there was no minister .
Govt said would not field if I was the Labour voice .
Pathetic . "
He had earlier used the social networking site to reveal that Laws had been pulled from the show .
" Mugged up on David Laws cos led to believe he was govt minister on Question Time .
Turns out there wo n't be one !
In Queen 's speech week ! "
Allen wrote : " It is a fundamental principle of our independence that politicians cannot dictate who sits on the panel .
It is for Question Time , not for political parties , to make judgments about impartiality and to determine who is invited to appear in the interests of the audience . "
Question Time chair David Dimbleby opened the show by saying : " We would have expected to have a government minister ... " and revealed to viewers that Downing Street had demanded Campbell 's removal .
The former Labour spin doctor responded by saying that request was " extraordinary " and added it " made a mockery " of the coalition 's claims to represent " the new politics " .
Campbell produced a framed photo of Laws and said : " I 've brought … the man who should have been here . "
The BBC had a difficult relationship with the Tories when they were in opposition .
David Cameron sought to freeze the licence fee last year and there is a suspicion among some BBC executives that the Conservatives are intent on curbing its power .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said : " In the week of the Queen 's Speech the BBC booked Alastair Campbell in the place of an Opposition frontbencher to appear on Question Time – which we questioned .
" Before a final decision was made on who might appear on behalf of the Government , the BBC directly booked John Redwood MP to appear . "
Shadow culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said : " It 's extraordinary that in the week of its first Queen 's Speech the Government refused to put up a Cabinet minister to explain its policies on Question Time because Alastair Campbell was appearing .
" This curious decision comes in a week which has seen major government announcements on cuts , the Queen 's Speech and welfare either leaked to the press or announced outside the scrutiny of Parliament .
" Along with their plans to pack the Lords with new Tory and Liberal peers and the dodgy 55 % rule , the coalition 's talk of new politics sounds more and more like the politics of a dim and distant past . "
They might relish becoming parents , but they can also be unprepared for the infant in their lives .
They ’re sleep - deprived , confused and irritable .
They ’re the fathers .
Discussions of the connection between mental health and childbirth have long focused on women , but a sizeable portion of men experience prenatal and postpartum depression too , according to research released Tuesday .
The study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , found that 10.4 % of men experienced serious depression at some point between his partner ’s first trimester and one year after childbirth , more than double the depression rate for men in general .
American men were more likely to experience prenatal or postpartum depression compared with men in other countries , 14.1 % in the U.S. compared with 8.2 % internationally .
“ It ’s viewed as a disorder of motherhood .
It ’s not viewed by health professionals and the public as a problem in fathers , ” said James F. Paulson , the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk .
But depression in either parent can affect both the couple ’s relationship and the child ’s development , Paulson said , adding that further study is needed .
“ There have been a few very good studies documenting negative child outcomes when fathers are depressed , ” he said .
“ That alone makes this a significant public health concern and something we need to pay more attention to . ”
Paulson analyzed the findings of 43 studies involving 28,004 participants .
The men were from the United States , China , Ireland , Britain , Australia and several other developed nations .
The most vulnerable period for depression in men was three to six months postpartum , he found , with a quarter of the men who experienced depression afflicted during this time period .
An estimated 14 % to 23 % of women experience depression during pregnancy and 5 % to 25 % have postpartum depression , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
Paternal depression has not been well documented historically , and many of the studies in the meta - analysis were conducted only in the last five to 10 years , Paulson said .
The contemporary father may be more vulnerable to this malady than previous generations of fathers because of the increasing number of women in the workplace and the corresponding expectations that he shoulder more responsibilities at home .
“ We are expecting dads to be more involved in parenting than we ever have before , ” said Will Courtenay , a psychotherapist and researcher on paternal depression in Berkeley who was not involved in the study .
“ Most dads are welcoming of that , but they do n’t have any models about what a dad is supposed to do .
That creates uncertainty , and that uncertainty can lead to anxiety and depression . ”
Further , paternal depression symptoms are much less likely to be recognized than maternal depression , Paulson said .
A woman may be sad , withdrawn and weepy while depressed ; men may appear more irritable or angry and become detached from the family .
In women , the condition is often linked to biological and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy and birth .
But hormones are not the sole cause of pregnancy - related depression even in women .
“ This narrow focus really makes it difficult to understand depression in men , ” Paulson said .
“ We know , in fact , there are many factors , hormonal and other , related to depression in women . ”
The depression of either parent can include how one partner ’s depression affects the other and how intimacy , conflict management and division of responsibilities change after having a baby .
In the meta - analysis , men had a higher risk of depression if their partner also had depression .
“ If we see depression in one partner that should prompt us to screen for depression in the other partner , ” he said .
Marital dissatisfaction , financial stress and having a sick or colicky baby could increase the risk of depression in one or both partners , said Courtenay , who is conducting a study on new fathers in collaboration with the Center for Men at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Mass .
" Sleep deprivation likely plays one of the biggest roles for men and women , ” he said .
“ We know that if normal , healthy adults go without good sleep for just one month , they begin to show signs of clinical depression . ”

Check out clips and stills from Street Fighter Legacy , an officially sanctioned Street Fighter short film featuring Hollywood talent that could be the most accurate screen adaptation of the World Warriors ever created .

Street Fighter Legacy is the creation of actor , filmmaker , and action choreographer Joey Ansah , known for his role as Desh in The Bourne Ultimatum .
Like many Street Fighter fans , Ansah was sick and tired of Hollywood treating our beloved characters like complete shit .
Unlike many Street Fighter fans , Ansah has the means and contacts to do something about it .
As an actor , film maker and a fan , I have been repeatedly disappointed by the many diluted , un faithful and outright butchered movie adaptations of fighting video games .
It was clear to me , that given the way the movie industry worked , we would never see a super faithful , darker toned and more adult themed ( or just plain good ! ) incarnation of Street fighter unless a die - hard fan director or film - making team with the game canon knowledge , film making know how and connections stepped up to the plate to helm such a project .
So almost a year ago , I began writing treatments and a production design brief and partnered with Streetlight films before proposing my concept and vision to Capcom .
I 'm pleased to say they gave their blessing and permission for the project to move forward .

Joey gathered together a team that includes Top Gear director Owen Trevor , producer Jacqueline Quella , and Anthony Wayne , a man with senior production credits on the last eleven James Bond films , along with post production / VFX house Prime Focus , all for the purpose of making this short film a reality .
Check out what they 've released so far :
Looks pretty amazing , does n't it ?
That 's Jon Foo as Ryu and Christian Howard as Ken , complete with his signature blond hair / dark eyebrows combo .
Judging by this picture lurking over at Sgt. Spiffy 's Blog , I 'd expect at least one more character to make an appearance .

The Associated Press called the race for Scott with the candidate leading Thurmond 74 percent to 26 percent .
There was no question that Scott was the candidate of the party 's D.C. establishment in the South Carolina district .

It 's a label that has essentially been the kiss of death for other GOP primary candidates this election cycle .
But in the open - seat primary to replace retiring Rep. Henry Brown Jr. ( R ) , the party appeared thrilled to coalesce behind Scott , the man who could become the GOP 's only black member of Congress if he wins in November .
The GOP has not had a black Congressman in its ranks since the 2002 retirement of former Rep. J.C. Watts ( R - Okla . ) .
It also helps that Scott is plenty conservative .
The candidate has made repealing President 's healthcare law his campaign 's biggest issue .
In a crowded 9 - candidate primary on June 8 , Scott was the top vote getter , winning 31 percent of the vote .
Thurmond landed in second with 13 percent .
Thurmond is the son of the late Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R - S.C. ) .
The runoff was laced with symbolism for the party : A black Republican taking on the son of the one - time " Dixiecrat " presidential candidate who campaigned on a platform of segregation .

Four Home Runs in One Game
Major League Baseball Players Who Hit 4 Homers in 1 Game
Some days , a player just feels like they are on - only eighteen players in Major League history have been this " on " during a ballgame !
Each of these sluggers did what seemed impossible , they hit four home runs in one game .
Yes , FOUR !
Surprisingly , only one New York Yankee ( Lou Gehrig ) and no Boston Red Sox ( Boston 's Bobby Lowe was a Beaneater ) has reached this pinnacle .
Philadelphia has seen the feat three times over eighty years , and 2002 was the first year it has been achieved twice during the same season .
Some Four Home Runs in A Game Trivia :
Both Ed Delahanty ( Philadelphia ) and Bob Horner ( Atlanta ) did not even see their team win with their effort .
The American League went forty - three years without a batter hitting four home runs in a game ( from 1959 to 2002 ) .
Five - of - the - seventeen men to hit four home runs in a game are in the Hall of Fame ( Lou Gehrig , Ed Delahanty , Willie Mays , Chuck Klein , and Mike Schmidt ) .
The RBIs received during a four homer game range from four ( Cameron ) to twelve ( Whiten ) .
Every team needs a leader .
These players proved to be the leaders of their teams , in a particularly difficult - even fabulous - way .
Josh Bloch - a prominent contributor ( you might know some of his work if you 've ever used the Java Collections framework ) to the Java platform at Sun for many years , currently a Googler , author of the award winning books " Effective Java " and " Effective Java Second Edition " - gave a talk at the recent web - based Red Hat Middleware 2020 conference .
The thrust of the talk was guarded optimism and concern about the future of the Java platform under Oracle 's stewardship .
InfoQ contacted Josh to see if he would be interested in expanding upon these ideas .
The discussion - particularly apropos of the increasing exodus of Sun talent from Oracle and concerns over Oracle 's handling of the community and the Java Intellectual Property looming - is reaching a fever - pitch of late because it intersects many different , going concerns .
We were glad to be able to talk to Mr. Bloch about some of these .
InfoQ :
What is your main concern ?
I do n't have a single main concern .
Several factors that have combined in the past few years to take the wind out of Java 's sails .
InfoQ :
Why do you feel the march of evolution for Java has slowed ?
The Sun / Apache stalemate TCK licensing stalemate has all but eliminated progress via the JCP .
Sun 's lack of support , leadership , and clarity has kept Java 7 from making perceptible progress .
I 'm not sure people are aware how few resources Sun allocated to Java SE in the past few years .
But the consequences have been quite visible : every year JavaOne rolls around , and Java 7 seems no closer .
And there has been an awful lot of infighting among Java 's supporters .
In earlier days , Sun played the role of benevolent dictator , which helped to limit the infighting .
The use of GPLv2 for OpenJDK hinders adoption even by those who are less concerned with TCK issues .
The " copyleft " provisions scare away many potential corporate adopters .
As a result , resources are being split between Harmony and OpenJDK .
Also the multiplicity of license used by the various JCP members for various components of various standards is just plain confusing .
In effect , it places a tax on Java platform development
InfoQ : How can racle better the situation where Sun could n't ?
Oracle has historically supported JCP reforms that would end the stalemate .
Also they are in better financial shape than Sun was , so they can afford to reinvigorate the platform and they 've publicly declared their intention to do so .
Finally , with a changing of the guard , some historical baggage can be jettisoned .
Where Sun might have seen certain changes as unpalatable , Oracle might look at the situation with fresh eyes and say " why not ? "
InfoQ :
Is this all strictly related to the morass of licensing issues ?
No ; licensing issues play a major role , but it goes beyond that .
As I said before , there has been a lack of resources , leadership , and focus .
InfoQ :
Is the situation surrounding the Apache Harmony project , which is in turn also used as the basis for the Android libraries , an acceptable one ?
( Ed : Harmony struggled with Sun over the TCK license well before Google adopted Harmony as the basis for the Android libraries .
Google 's decision to use Harmony rather than the OpenJDK libraries has less to do with the Harmony TCK licensing dispute than with Sun 's decision to use GPL v2 for OpenJDK .
Google 's partners would n't agree to redistribute it without a more permissive license .
The Apache group was at one point offered a qualified TCK license , but rejected it because the field - of - use restrictions were unacceptable to Apache and the JCP EC who believed them to violate the JCP agreement . )
No .
As I said before , it stands in the way of the health and progress of the platform .
Also it is causing companies to waste tremendous amounts of engineering effort , splitting their resources needlessly between Harmony and OpenJDK .
InfoQ : How would you like to see Oracle react to things like Harmony ?
I would like to see them enact the resolution they proposed at the JCP EC Meeting of December 12 , 2007 : Resolution 1 ( proposed by Oracle , seconded by BEA )
" It is the sense of the Executive Committee that the JCP become an open independent vendor - neutral Standards Organization where all members participate on a level playing field with the following characteristics : members fund development and management expenses a legal entity with by - laws , governing body , membership , etc. a new , simplified , IPR Policy that permits the broadest number of implementations stringent compatibility requirements dedicated to promoting the Java programming model Furthermore , the EC shall put a plan in place to make such transition as soon as practical with minimal disruption to the Java Community . "
As for the " new , simplified IPR Policy , " I believe it would be highly beneficial to the entire community if a widely accepted permissive open source license such as Apache or BSD were adopted for all components of all Java specs .
InfoQ : What do you see as Oracle 's role ?
I would dearly love to see them reclaim Sun 's role as leader and steward of the Java platform .
Of course things will be a bit different now , because the world has changed .
Other organizations will contribute more resources and share more control .
InfoQ : For that matter , how do you think things like Dalvik fit in the brave new Oracle Java landscape ?
In the brave new world of open source , multiple related platforms are a given .
There are many Unix - like operating systems and many Linux variants , optimized for many uses .
I see Dalvik as a VM designed with a very different set of design goals and constraints from HotSpot or JRockit .
InfoQ : Following up on that : how do you see Java ME evolving ?
Being outright replaced ?
Could Sun " bless " Android as the next - gen Java ME ?
How can Java ME compete in an Android / iPhone world ?
I do n't think it 's appropriate for me to speculate on this one , though it is worth pointing out that there 's certainly a place for " feature phones " ( as opposed to " smart phones " ) in the developing world , and Java ME was designed with feature phones in mind .
InfoQ :
At least one , recent index ( Tiobe 's list ) has shown a decline in the use of Java .
It showed a slight decrease in Java use and a corresponding increase in C use .
I 'm not sure if this is real or a statistical anomaly , but it is amusing to see a 35 - year old " universal assembly language " at the top of Tiobe 's list .
I confess to having a soft spot in my heart for C .
InfoQ :
This is probably provable ( one way or another ) , but do you suspect that the JVM 's use has decreased over all , or that Java proper has decreased while Ruby / Scala / Jython / Groovy have taken up the slack ?
Actually none of these languages make Tiobe 's top 20 .
That does n't mean they are n't important or valuable ; they are .
But they are n't mainstream , yet .
That said , I 'm absolutely thrilled by the amount of language research and design going on these days .
There are plenty of good ideas out there , and it 's marvelous that people are exploring them .
InfoQ : Do you think Java's on the decline , or that we should be concerned ?
I think it 's fair to say that Java 's had a hard couple of years .
But I do not think the platform or the language are in decline .
I think there is some danger of a decline , but I 'm counting on Oracle and the Java community to prevent it .
Yes , I do believe it 's cause for concern .
I believe a strong Java is good for the programming public : corporations , higher education , K - 12 , the open source community , you name it .
InfoQ : What , in your opinion , could hope to replace it ( that 's not also on the JVM ) ?
With the exception of CLR which is in - practice a Windows - only platform , there 's no real alternative to the JVM on the horizon .
In fact , there 's no real alternative to the Java programming language either .
There are plenty of other great programming languages , but none with the same " design center . "
A language is a tool , and we should use the right tool for the job .
One size does not fit all .
InfoQ :
Is there a business case to be made for licensing the JRE ?
Perhaps some esoteric variants .
But I believe it's in Oracle 's interests , just as it was in Sun's , to keep the JRE ubiquitous .
InfoQ : Following up on the last one , a bit , but also as a standalone point : how do you feel about the proposed reconciliation of the JRockit JVM and the Sun JVM and various other VM technologies ?
In principle I believe it's a good thing to take the best parts of the various JVMs and combine them into something even better .
But remember that Sun never even succeeded in combining the client and server variants of HotSpot .
Combining multiple systems is where angels fear to tread .
It 's sometimes doable , but never easy .
Failed efforts can be very costly .
InfoQ : Anything else you might add ?
What do you feel needs to be said ?
I just want to remind people that many recent Java success stories are getting lost in all the gloom and doom .
Among them are Google Collections , Guice , the JVM languages you referred to earlier , and Android .
With swift , decisive action on Oracle 's part , and cooperation from the broader Java community , I see a bright future ahead for the Java platform .
( NaturalNews ) University of Michigan ( U - M ) Comprehensive Cancer Center scientists say they 've found a compound that could help prevent and potentially treat breast cancer .
It 's not a drug or a new radiation treatment but a natural component of broccoli and broccoli sprouts .
And it has the remarkable ability to target cancer stem cells -- the specific cells responsible for fueling the growth of cancerous breast tumors .
The researchers tested the broccoli compound , known as sulforaphane , in animal studies as well as in breast cancer cell cultures in the lab .
Their findings , which were recently published in the journal , showed sulforaphane not only targeted and killed cancer stem cells , but it also prevented any new malignancies from growing .
What makes this such an extraordinary breakthrough ?
Current chemotherapies do n't do anything to stop cancer stem cells .
That 's why cancer can recur and spread after chemotherapy .
So many researchers have long believed that to control cancer , you have to find a way to eliminate cancer stem cells -- and now it appears sulforaphane does exactly that .
study author Duxin Sun , Ph.D. , associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the U - M College of Pharmacy and a researcher with the U - M Comprehensive Cancer Center , said in a statement to the media .
For their study , the U - M researchers first worked with mice with breast cancer .
They used several well - documented methods to assess the number of cancer stem cells in the animals ' breast tumors .
Then the research team injected varying concentrations of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli into the mice .
The results ?
There was a dramatic decrease in the number of cancer stem cells after treatment with sulforaphane , but there was little effect on the normal cells .
Next , the scientists tested sulforaphane on human breast cancer cell cultures in the lab .
Once again , they found the numbers of cancer stem cells plummeted after exposure to the broccoli compound .
" This research suggests a potential new treatment that could be combined with other compounds to target breast cancer stem cells .
Developing treatments that effectively target the cancer stem cell population is essential for improving outcomes , " study co-author Max S. Wicha , M.D. , Distinguished Professor of Oncology and director of the U - M Comprehensive Cancer Center , said in the press statement .
The scientists pointed out that concentrations of sulforaphane used in the study were higher than what can be normally achieved by eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts .
However , previous research suggests the body can absorb high enough concentrations of sulforaphane from broccoli extract to impact cancer .
Currently , the U - M research team is working to develop a method to extract and preserve sulforaphane .
They are also planning a future clinical trial to test sulforaphane both as a prevention and treatment for breast cancer .
NaturalNews has previously reported on additional health benefits of broccoli .
For example , broccoli sprouts have been found to potentially play a protective role in the prevention of gastric cancer by reducing colonization of the cancer and ulcer - linked bacteria Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) in the body ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026018_sprouts_br... ) .
Research by University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) scientists also found that sulforaphane in broccoli appears to protect against respiratory inflammation that causes asthma , allergic rhinitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and other conditions that make it hard to breathe ( https://www.naturalnews.com/025771_broccoli_a... ) .
NaturalNews is opposed to the use of animals in medical experiments that expose them to harm .
We present these findings in protest of the way in which they were acquired .
LONG BEACH , Calif .
—The Easter bunnies of Long Beach are multiplying like rabbits .
Hundreds of bunnies — some of them fugitives from Easters past — lounge in the shade and hop alongside students of Long Beach City College , a small , sunny campus south of Los Angeles .
They also fight bloody turf wars , burrow deep holes in the lawns , and devour thousands of dollars of landscaping .
" It 's just gotten out of hand , " said Tim Wootton , deputy director of facilities and a member of the school 's Rabbit Population Management Task Force , or as he calls it , the Bunny Committee .
The task force 's task : a massive round - up of abandoned bunnies and their offspring .
The college began capturing rabbits last month to regain control .
Some will be given away for adoption .
Others may be shipped off to sanctuaries .
The remaining bunnies will be neutered and released on campus .
At least one rabbit — a large white male nick - named Houdini for his ability to evade capture — mounted a gallant resistance for a time .
" ... from the point of view of technology , a code generated within a digital computer is now self - replicating as the genome of a line of living cells .
From the point of view of biology , a code generated by a living organism has been translated into a digital representation for replication , editing , and transmission to other cells . "
George Dyson in response to Craig Venter 's announcement of " synthetic " life .
Now that we have a self - replicating biological platform ( yeast -- likely one of many different platforms that will be floated over the next couple of years ) that can accommodate a completely synthetic genome , the race in on : towards an abundance in nearly every material or process that can be enabled via biological means .
For resilient communities , this will likely lead to the ability to replicate on the micro scale , many of the difficult to produce materials currently available only through a global industrial system .
All that needs to be shared is the information necessary to do it .
P2P pharmaceuticals and fuels ?
Of course , this also means that the global system is about to become even more prone to massive instability than it is today ( and it 's pretty bad already ) .
Threats will emerge out of nowhere as errors , failures , and misuse of this technology occur ( inevitably ) .
These threats , in turn , will be quickly amplified by the network dynamics of our tightly interconnected global system , which converts relatively small events into global scale catastrophes .
There is a bright side to this :
This technology makes resilient communities both more necessary and more viable at the same time .
The localization of production and the virtualization of everything else precludes the chance that damage from this technology will spread to a global scale via network amplification .
It contains any potential damage to a small area .
On the other hand , the virtualization of production and portability of discovery / productivity enabled by this technology will make it possible for very small communities to replicate the industrial power of a nation - state .
Very nice .
What are Roles and Capabilities ?
In other CMS and web applications , WordPress has a built - in system to verify whether a particular user has enough privilege to take a certain action .
Users are divided into Roles , and each Role is assigned certain capabilities ( or permissions ) .
Here is a summary of WordPress default roles :
Administrator – Somebody who has access to all the administration features
Editor – Somebody who can publish posts , manage posts as well as manage other people ’s posts , etc .
Author – Somebody who can publish and manage their own posts
Contributor – Somebody who can write and manage their posts but not publish posts
Subscriber – Somebody who can read comments / comment / receive news letters , etc .
Roles and Capabilities is much more flexible than User Level , since it enables you to add , remove or re-assign capabilities among roles .
You can even add more roles to the system without destroying the default setup .
Capabilities and administration menus
Almost every plugin needs to have at least one page in the admin area to let users customize how the plugin is used .
In order to do this , you need to add your own administration menu items .
There are a number of WordPress functions which let you do this :
// add top level menu
add_menu_page ( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] , [ icon_url ] ) ;
// add sub -menu pages
add_submenu_page( parent , page_title , menu_title , capability , file / handle , [ function ] ) ;
// add Options sub-menu
add_options_page( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] ) ;
// add Management sub-menu
add_management_page( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] ) ;
// add Pages sub-menu
add_pages_page ( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] ) ;
// add Posts sub-menu
add_posts_page ( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] ) ;
// add Appearances sub-menu
add_theme_page ( page_title , menu_title , capability , handle , [ function ] ) ;
There ’s always a required parameter called capability for each of those functions .
This essentially means the user who logs in to the administration area needs to have a certain capability to see the menu item .
You can either use a user level ( which is deprecated and not recommended ) , or a string representing a certain capability ( for example , edit_posts ) .
Many plugins still use user levels ( numeric representation of a user ’s privilege , from 0 to 10 ) .
However , this is deprecated and should not be used anymore .
By using capabilities , you wo n’t have to worry when user levels are not supported by WordPress , and if you want to add and use your custom capabilities , this is the way to go .
If you use the functions above to add menu items to the admin area , only the users who have the specified capability can see the menu items and access the pages associated with those items .
If your theme or plugin has an option page , it ’s important that you restrict access to that page properly .
For example , if it ’s a theme option page , you should use edit_themes capability , while if it ’s a plugin option , edit_plugins .
Another way is to use manage_options for both plugin and theme option pages .
Remember , sometimes the blog administrator wants to share and divide responsibilities among several other users .
As a result , using capabilities make your themes and plugins much more customizable .
Checking a user ’s capability
If your plugin or theme involves the user making changes to the blog ’s data ( adding new or editing existing content etc. ) , it ’s very important that you check whether the current user has enough capability to make a certain action .
The current_user_can ( ) function lets you do this :
if ( current_user_can ( $ capability ) ) {
// do something if the current user has $ capability
This function also accepts an optional argument for a certain post ID , in case you want to check whether the current user can do something to that post :
// check whether the current can edit a post with the ID $ post_id
current_user_can ( ‘ edit_post ’ , $ post_id ) ;
There ’s another function you can use to check whether the author of a certain post has a certain capability :
if ( author_can ( $ post , $ capability ) ) {
// do something if the author of the post $ post has $ capability
The first argument can be either a post object , or a post ID .
Although this function is rarely used , it ’s helpful to know it ’s there .
I personally never had to use that function , but if you have an interesting example , let me know in the comment !
Adding custom user roles
Sometimes it ’s necessary for your plugin to add new roles to the system .
Let ’s say you ’re coding a new gallery plugin where users can register to upload photos to your site , but that ’s it – these registered users ca n’t add or modify any other type of content to your blog ( such as posts or pages ) .
The best way to do this , is to add a new custom role :
add_role ( $ role_name , $ display_name , $ capabilities ) ;
// for example :
add_role ( ‘ photo_uploader ’ , ‘ Photo Uploader ’ , array ( ‘ organize_gallery ’ ) ) ;
What this function does is add a new role to the system with a set of capabilities .
The example aboves add a role called “ photo_uploader ” , with a display name and an array containing a list of default capabilities for that role ( in this case , organize_gallery ) .
When you process a request to create , edit or upload galleries , you should use current_user_can ( ) to check whether the current user are permitted to take these actions .
if ( current_user_can ( ‘ organize_gallery ’ ) ) {
// do something
The users who are assigned this role can only organize_gallery , but cannot edit_posts or publish_posts .
To remove a role , you can use remove_role ( ) :
remove_role ( ‘ photo_uploader ’ ) ;
You should have an option somewhere for your plugin users to remove this custom role when they decide to uninstall your plugin .
But what if you want to add capabilities to existing users ?
Adding custom user capabilities
This is useful when you develop a plugin that allows users to take actions other than manipulating post contents .
Let ’s come back to our gallery plugin example above .
Say , if you also want to assign organize_gallery capability to existing roles ( administrator , editor , author , contributor etc. ) , what would you do ?
// get the “ author ” role object
$ role = get_role ( ‘ author ’ ) ;
// add “ organize_gallery ” to this role object
$ role -> add_cap ( ‘ organize_gallery ’ ) ;
WordPress Capability Classes
We ’ve covered checking and adding capabilities , as well as adding roles .
These are the most frequent used functions for managing user permissions in WordPress .
However , as the title of this post contains the word “ ultimate ” , I ’d like to also cover the three WordPress classes that work behind the scene and the API these classes provide , which you can use for advanced permission management in your plugin .
These three classes are :
WP_Roles
WP_Role
WP_User
The source code of these three classes can be found in wp- includes / capabilities .
php .
The source code is documented in great details and I ’m sure you can understand it easily , but I ’d like to sum up what you can do with these classes .
The WP_Roles Class
This class , as its name suggests , is for managing roles in general .
When you use it in your plugin , you actually do n’t have to initiate a new object , but use a global object which has been created by WordPress :
global $ wp_roles ;
The $ wp_roles is available as a global object , and can be used anywhere in your functions , as long as it ’s declared beforehand in your functions with the global keyword .
As covered before , you can add and remove roles using add_role ( ) and remove_role ( ) .
These functions are actually wrappers for $ wp_roles -> add_role ( ) , and $ wp_roles ->remove_role .
Therefore you can add and remove roles using the $ wp_roles object as well :
global $ wp_roles ;
// add a new role , same arguments as add_role ( )
$ wp_roles -> add_role ( $ role , $ display_name , $ capabilities )
// remove a role , same arguments as remove_role ( )
$ wp_roles ->remove_role ( $ role ) ;
Likewise , you can also get a role using this method :
global $ wp_roles ;
// get a role based on role name , does the same thing as get_role ( )
$ wp_roles -> get_role ( $ role ) ;
You can also get a list of available roles , containing pair of role names and role display names .
This is useful when you want to provide an interface for the user to change capability assignment .
global $ wp_roles ;
// get a list of values , containing pairs of : $ role_name => $ display_name
$ roles = $ wp_roles ->get_names ( ) ;
Finally , you can add and remove capabilities using $ wp_roles too , making this object versatile for almost all roles and capabilities operations .
global $ wp_roles ;
// add capability $ cap to role $role
$ wp_roles->add_cap ( $ role , $ cap ) ;
// remove capability $ cap from role $ role
$ wp_roles->remove_cap ( $ role , $ cap ) ;
// for example
$ wp_roles->add_cap ( ‘ administrator ’ , ‘ manage_galleries ’ ) ;
$ wp_roles->remove_cap ( ‘ subscriber ’ , ‘ view_galleries ’ ) ;
WP_Role Class
This is a very simple class .
All it does is adding and removing capabilities .
// get the the role object
$ role_object = get_role ( $ role_name ) ;
// add $ cap capability to this role object
$ role_object ->add_cap ( $ capability_name ) ;
// remove $ cap capability from this role object
$ role_object ->remove_cap ( $ capability_name ) ;
WP_User class
This class lets you manage roles and capabilities per user , which means you can assign multiple roles to a particular user , or add a capability to a certain user regardless of his current role .
First of all , you need to get the user object before manipulating its roles and capabilities :
// get user by user ID
$ user = new WP_User ( $ id ) ;
// or get user by username
$ user = new WP_User ( null , $ name ) ;
As you can see , you can get a user object based on either his user ID or username .
With the latter , the first parameter must be empty ( either null or an empty string ) .
Examples :
// get the administrator by ID
$ admin = new WP_User ( 1 ) ;
// get the administrator by username
$ admin = new WP_User ( null , ‘ admin ’ ) ;
Once you have the user object , you can add another role to this user without modifying his current role ( which means the user can have as many roles as you want ) :
$ user -> add_role ( $ role_name ) ;
Or you can remove a role from this user , using remove_role ( ) :
$ user ->remove_role ( $ role_name ) ;
You can also set a role to this user , which means removing all the current roles of this user and assign a new one :
$ user -> set_role ( $ role_name ) ;
For manipulating capabilities , you have a bunch of methods that allow you to do various things :
// check whether the user has a certain capability or role name
if ( $ user -> has_cap ( $ cap_name ) ) {
// do something
// add a capability to the user and grant access to that capability
$ user -> add_cap ( $ cap_name ) ;
// remove a capability from the user
$ user ->remove_cap ( $ cap_name ) ;
// remove all capabilities from the user
$ user->remove_all_caps ( ) ;
In Summary
There , that ’s all there is to know about Roles and Capabilities .
You may not need to grasp all of this , but it ’s definitely helpful to know WordPress has a full - fledged user and role management system , which you can always use for complicated projects .

This a tutorial to create an eclipse artificially in Photoshop , originally written by my friend
This a tutorial to create an eclipse artificially in Photoshop , originally written by my friend Satwik Sharma long time ago .
I guess I m getting less time to post articles nowadays so it might be okay to bring up some lesser read articles of my blog into spotlight .
Jokes apart , lets get to business .
This Solar eclispse can be used as a great background too .
Even beginners should try this tutorial .
You will get to know some Tools and their use .
It 's not at all difficult .
I 've tried to make it as simple as possible for even beginners to understand .
So here goes .
Step 1 : Open a New 640 x 400 pixel document by going to File > New .
Step 2 : Click the Paint Bucket Tool .
Set the Background colour to Black .
( It is so by default ) .
Step 3 : The White Layer has been filled with Black using the Paint Bucket Tool .
Step 4 : Click the New Layer Button shown .
It will create a new layer .
Step 5 : The New Layer has been created .
Step 6 : Select the Elliptical Marque Tool by clicking it .
Step 7 : Press
Shift on the keyboard and drag .
A perfect circle will be created .
Step 8 : Now set the Foreground Colour to White .
Clicking on the small arrow switches between the Foreground and Background colour .
Select the Paint Bucket Tool again .
Step 9 : This is how it should look after filing the circle with White .
Step 10 : Go to Select > Deselect to deselect the Elliptical Marque Tool
Step 11 : The Opacity and Fill Sliders are in the Layers / Chanels / Paths pallette at bottom right of Photoshop .
Drag the Fill slider to the extreme left .
This will cause the white circle to disappear .
Step 12 : Go to Layer > Layer Style > Outer
Glow as shown .
Step 13 : Drag the Size Slider to the right after this dialogue box opens .
There is no hard and fast rule how much you should drag .
It should satisfy you .
Step 14 : This is how it should looks after clicking OK .
Now REPEAT this step .
Step 15 : This is how it look after repeating the above step .
The glow is more diffused now .
Step 16 : Now go to Layer > Layer Style > Inner Glow
Step 17 : In the dialogue box which opens drag the Size slider to the right till you are satisfied with the result .
Click OK .
Step 18 : Now go to Layers / Channels / Paths pallete .
Press SHIFT on the keyboard to select both Background and Layer 1 .
Step 19 : Now right click as shown .
It will bring up the dialogue box as shown .
Click MERGE LAYERS .
Step 20 : The Layers have been merged .
Step 21 : Now click the New Layer Button .
It will create a new layer as shown .
Step 22 : Double click the background .
The background layer cannot be edited .
Therefore double click it to make a copy of it .
Step 23 : This dialogue box opens click OK .
Step 24 : Now drag Layer 1 below Layer 0 as shown .
Now Fill Layer 1 with Black using the Paint Bucket Tool .
Step 25 : Now click Layer 0 and click the Quick Mask button .
It will create a Quick Mask on Layer 0 .
Step 26 : Now click the Gradient Tool shown above .
Step 27 : Make sure the Black to White gradient is selected .
You can select it by clicking it if it is not selected .
Step 28 : Now drag the Gradient Tool from the bottom right to the middle as shown .
Step 29 : This is how it looks after applying the gradient .
A few more steps remain .
Just be patient .
Step 30 : Now just as in Step 18 and 19 select both the layers by clicking on the layers while pressing SHIFT key .
Then Merge both layers .
Step 31 : Now go to Filter > Render >lens Flare .
Step 32 : When the above dialogue box opens choose 50 - 300 mm Zoom .
The first one and click ok .
That is all .
This is the completed image and you can flaunt it to your friends :)
I love OpenGL but , until now , I used it only in C++ ( plus one quick test in OCaml ) .
I wanted to try it with F# .
As OpenGL is a portable library , the result should be cross- platform ; that 's what I checked .
I found OpenTK , which is the library that wraps OpenGL in .NET ( there is also OpenAL and OpenCL ) .
Of course , the documentation and the samples are C#-oriented , but they are very easy to translate .
I was happy to see that the project is very active , and there are many examples , some of them including the latest OpenGL extensions ( e.g. geometry shaders ) .
I really enjoyed OpenTK API : it 's cleaner than standard OpenGL , typesafe ( int values are replaced by enums ) , and uses overloaded functions to simplify the code .
I did n't compare the speed of OpenTK with a C++ OpenGL application , but I believe it 's very fast as the bindings stay close to OpenGL , and .NET ( and Mono ) generates fast code .
Here is my F# translation of the Quickstart code : game.fs .
You just need to get OpenTK.dll and you 'll get :
I started to play with this sample in F# interactive .
I opened the window in a separate thread , I changed the display dynamically in fsi , thanks to mutable functions .
That was really comfortable , as if I was using a dynamic scripting language ... but with great performance and static typing !
A few hours later , I was able to make a nice - looking OpenGL application ( you 'll see it later ) .
The nice thing is that the application was cross-platform .
I tried it on Windows , Linux and Mac , it worked everywhere , without changing a single line .
It seems like F# is ready to make great cross-platform 3D applications !

Lecturer in theology and science
" The existence of ' Mini - Man ' should destroy religion , " claims Desmond Morris .
Yet as science progresses , despite the decline of allegiance to traditional Christian churches in Western Europe , religion continues to grow world - wide in many different forms .
This should not surprise us .
Contemporary science , far from solving every question , often highlights the big questions which are central to human existence .
This is the case with the discovery of LB1 , the 18,000 - year - old specimen of the new species Homo floresiensis .
The find of this so - called Hobbit on Flores Island excites me both as a scientist and a Christian theologian , for it poses the big question of what it means to be human .
' Frankly naive '
People have always been fascinated with this question , in particular what makes humans different .
LB1 becomes part of this contemporary question alongside developments in science such as human cloning and the growth of artificial intelligence where what it means to be human is seen in Star Trek 's Mr Data and Kubrick 's AI .
Some have tried to separate human beings in terms of physical , mental or genetic characteristics .
The trouble with this , as LB1 demonstrates , is that these are simply often different points on a spectrum rather than absolutes .
While some religious people believe humans were created 6,000 years ago , or view humans as the sole possessors of souls , it is quite frankly naïve and ignorant to characterise the depth of all religious thinking in this way .
Natural world
Within the Christian tradition , some have suggested that the key to being human is our ability of rational thinking , freewill , our moral sense or our capacity to face our own death .
The fact that God may have created many other species in the universe does not diminish the relationship he has given to human beings
Being made in the image of God is about being given the gift of intimate relationship with God , and a certain kind of responsibility in the natural world .
That human beings are special in terms of relationship allowed early astronomers such as Huygens to speculate about other worlds without having nightmares about his Christian faith .
The fact that God may have created many other species in the Universe does not diminish the relationship he has given to human beings .
Care and compassion
Further , as many historians have pointed out , the Christian worldview encouraged the growth of empirical science - the Universe had to be observed to see what God had done .

Finally , the gift of responsibility brought with it the need for care and compassion to others , the animal kingdom and the environment .
So as a Christian , in common with many other religious believers , I do n't see LB1 as a threat to religion .
I am fascinated with what more we might find out about the diversity of the natural world .
And if Homo floresiensis still exists then they need to be treated with respect and care whether the anthropologists class them as human or not .
I still see the special status of humanity in the gift of relationship with God , a relationship affirmed in the life , death and resurrection of Jesus .
After all , Hobbits were never a problem to the Christian orthodoxy of a certain JRR Tolkien .

A selection of the many e-mail comments we received on this topic are below .
Many Christians believe in evolution as God 's tool in creation .
There are huge holes in evolutionary theory which outside intervention nicely fills - evolutionists have no answers to these problems and are quite happy to gloss over them .
Evolution has not been proved , nor has creationism .
They are both , therefore theories .

Every time science comes up with compelling evidence against religion , the believers incorporate it into their faith .
" God meant for us to find out " .
From the discovery of DNA , to planets outside our solar systems , the zealots stick to their guns .
Ben Cullen , Birmingham , UK
Discoveries such as Hobbits and theories such as the Big Bang are a wonderful way to validate religion .
My religion tells me that many races were created before mankind , so the discovery of these races is just a confirmation of what I already knew .
Same thing goes for the Big Bang theory ,
It was already documented a long time before modern science caught up with it .
Mohammad Khan , London UK
Christianity is based upon the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and not on the far - earlier writings of the Old Testament .
Religion and science are not in competition .
Surely scientists can recognise that there is a spiritual aspect to us all that does not need a full explanation nor will it ever be explained by scientists .

This article both misses the point and entirely fails to answer Desmond Morris 's question : " How can the Flores human be ' semi- special ' ? "
If this creature is considered half - human , how do the early chapters of Genesis suggest this creature 's relationship to God is defined ?
Ollie , Oxford
The sooner religions agree that Darwin is right , the sooner they can move onto doing good work elsewhere .
They lost this argument years ago and they just look plain silly saying God made man .
Evolution continues everywhere .

The Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia
The University of East Anglia claimed it had been deluged with requests from sceptics under the Freedom of Information
Act shortly before hacked emails were published which appeared to show scientists manipulating climate change data .
But the university has angered privacy campaigners after passing on the details of those asking for information to Norfolk Police , which is investigating the alleged email theft with the National Domestic Extremism Unit .
Detectives are interviewing all those who legally used the FOI Act to request information from the Climatic Research Unit , questioning them about their scientific and political beliefs .
One of those targeted said : “ It ’s alarming – I thought it was a bit heavy - handed .
My understanding is everyone who put in an FOI request to the university has been contacted .
“ The police were looking for a conspiracy .
They felt there had been an organised group of people bombarding the university with questions .
I would have appreciated more of a briefing before launching into questions about my political beliefs . ”
Another , businessman Sebastian Nokes , said he had been called by a detective who “ wanted to know what computer I used , my internet service provider , and also to which political parties I have belonged , what I feel about climate change and what my qualifications in climate science are .
He questioned me at length . ”
Mr Nokes ’s FOI request had asked for details about the training given to scientists to disclose information and for copies of any emails suggesting they had withheld information .
Throughout the world , electricity generation is based more and more on wind and solar energy .
So far , the missing link for integrating renewable energy into the electricity supply is a smart power storage concept .
Because when the wind is blowing powerfully , wind turbines generate more electricity than the power grid can absorb .
Now , German researchers have succeeded in storing renewable electricity as natural gas .
They convert the electricity into synthetic natural gas with the aid of a new process .
The process was developed by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden - Württemberg ( ZSW ) , in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology IWES .
Currently , Solar Fuel Technology , the Austria - based partner company , is setting up the industrial implementation of the process .
One advantage of the technology : it can use the existing natural gas infrastructure .
A demonstrationsystem built on behalf of Solar Fuel in Stuttgart is already operating successfully .
By 2012 , a substantially larger system – in the double - digit megawatt range – is planned to be launched .
For the first time , the process of natural gas production combines the technology for hydrogen - electrolysis with methanisation .
" Our demonstration system in Stuttgart splits water using surplus renewable energy using electrolysis .
The result is hydrogen and oxygen , " explains Dr. Michael Specht of ZSW .
" A chemical reaction of hydrogen with carbon dioxide generates methane – and that is nothing other than natural gas , produced synthetically . "
With the rapid expansion of renewable energies , the need for new storage technologies grows massively .
This is of special interest for energy utilities and power companies .
" So far , we converted gas into electricity .
Now we also think in the opposite direction , and convert electricity into ’ real natural ’ gas , " explains Dr. Michael Sterner of Fraunhofer IWES , who is investigating engineering aspects and energy system analysis of the process .
" Surplus wind and solar energy can be stored in this manner .
During times of high wind speeds , wind turbines generate more power than is currently needed .
This surplus energy is being more frequently reflected at the power exchange market through negative electricity prices . "
In such cases , the new technology could soon keep green electricity in stock as
natural gas or renewable methane .
" Within the development of this technology , ZSW has been guided by two core issues , " explains Michael Specht : " Which storage systems offer sufficient capacity for compensating fluctuating renewable energies that depend on the wind and weather ?
And which storage systems can be integrated into the existing infrastructure the easiest ? "
The storage reservoir of the natural gas network extending through Germany is vast :
It equals more than 200 terawatt hours – enough to satisfy consumption for several months .
The power network has only a capacity of 0.04 terawatt hours by itself .
The integration into the infrastructure is simple :
The natural gas substitute can be stored like conventional natural gas in the supply network , pipelines and storage systems , in order to drive natural gas cars or fire natural gas heating systems .
The new technology aims at facilitating the integration of high shares of fluctuating power generation from renewable energies into the energy system .
One goal is to structure the delivery of power from wind parks on a scheduled and regular basis .
" The new concept is a game changer and a new significant element for the integration of renewable energies into a sustainable energy system , " adds Sterner .
The efficiency of converting power to gas equals more than 60 percent .
" In our opinion , this is definitely better than a total loss , " says Michael Specht .
A total loss looms if , for instance , wind power has to be curtailed .
The predominant storage facility to date – pumped hydro power plants – can only be expanded to a limited extent in Germany .
In order to push the new energy conversion technology forward , the two German research institutes have joined together with the company Solar Fuel Technology of Salzburg .
Starting in 2012 , they intend to launch a system with a capacity of approximately 10 megawatt .
The cooperation partners :
ZSW is among the most renowned research institutions in the field of photovoltaics , energy systems analysis , regenerative fuels , battery technology and fuel cells .
Currently , approximately 170 scientists , engineers and technical experts are employed at the three locations in Stuttgart , Ulm and Widderstall .
They have a turnover of more than 22 million Euro .
Solar Fuel Technology GmbH & Co. KG is engineering technologies and systems for the compensation of fluctuating feed - in of renewable power .
Electricity is converted to CO2 - neutral , renewable natural gas that can be used for many purposes .
Solar Fuel was established in November 2007 .

The US Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a San Francisco law school did not violate the First Amendment when it refused official recognition of a Christian student group that restricted its membership to those who shared a belief that homosexualty is immoral .
In a 5 - to - 4 decision , the high court said the University of California ’s Hastings College of Law was under no constitutional obligation to recognize the Christian Legal Society as an official student group .
The majority justices said the law school had adopted a viewpoint - neutral policy requiring its student organizations to pledge not to discriminate against fellow students on the basis of religious belief or sexual orientation .
In addition , the school reportedly adopted an “ accept all comers ” policy requiring student groups to permit any student to join their organization – even when that student disagreed with the purpose of the group .
Writing for the majority , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said public universities may condition official recognition of a student group – and the related use of school funds and facilities – on that group ’s agreement to admit all students .
“ Compliance with Hastings ’ all - comers policy , we conclude , is a reasonable , viewpoint - neutral condition on access to the student - organization forum , ” she wrote .
Justice Ginsburg added that , in the view of the majority justices , the Christian Legal Society ( CLS ) was not seeking parity with other student organizations , but a preferential exemption from the Hastings schoolwide policy .
“ The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization ’s expressive activity , however exclusionary that activity may be , ” she said .
“ But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state subvention of its selectivity . ”
The majority justices said the student group was free to organize and meet on its own , off campus .
But they said if the CLS wanted to enjoy the benefits of official school recognition it must comply with the viewpoint - neutral requirements established by the law school .
“ It is … hard to imagine a more viewpoint - neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all comers , ” Ginsburg wrote , calling the policy “ textbook viewpoint neutral . ”
The dissent : School 's policy may be a ' pretext '
In a dissent , Justice Samuel Alito said the majority justices had ignored “ strong evidence ” that the accept - all - comers policy was not viewpoint - neutral , but rather a “ pretext ” to justify viewpoint discrimination against Christian students .
He said the high court ’s opinion would help some public universities enforce “ prevailing standards of political correctness . ”
“ I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today ’s decision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in this country , ” Justice Alito wrote .
The case , Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , involved a dispute over whether the law school acted properly in excluding CLS from official recognition .
Lawyers for the Christian students argued that the First Amendment right of expressive association protects the freedom of like - minded individuals to form groups and embrace certain shared values and beliefs , even when those beliefs are unpopular .
They said while public universities may ban discrimination based on race or ethnicity , they could not interfere in a student group ’s religious beliefs .
Officials at the law school had said the group ’s stance violated the school ’s antidiscrimination policy – including bans on discrimination based on religious belief or sexual orientation .
As a result , the CLS was denied status as a recognized student group at the law school and stripped of the ability to receive activity funds , use school e-mail and bulletin boards , and meet in school facilities .
Key distinction : School policy applies to all groups
In a concurrence , Justice Anthony Kennedy said a key distinction that separated the Christian Legal Society case from other cases finding a First Amendment violation was a stipulation earlier in the case conceding that the school had adopted an all - comers policy .
“ Here , the policy applies equally to all groups and views , ” he said .
“ And , given the stipulation of the parties , there is no basis for an allegation that the design or purpose of the rule was , by subterfuge , to discriminate based on viewpoint . ”
If the policy had been a pretext to undercut the CLS , Justice Kennedy said , “ the case likely should have a different outcome . ”
Lawyers for the group had argued that the school ’s enforcement of the nondiscrimination policy was aimed at forcing CLS to alter its own internal policies or risk losing student activity money and other benefits of official recognition .
The CLS policy was based on the shared religious beliefs of the club members and upon their agreement to behave in a certain way .
In addition to embracing biblical denunciations of homosexuality , the group required its members to pledge to abstain from any sexual conduct outside of marriage .
The group said any students would be welcome to attend its meetings as visitors , but only those students who pledge to live in accord with the group ’s shared moral beliefs would be accepted as voting members and as leaders .
Hastings officials said the Christian group ’s bylaws violated a school policy that all official student groups must agree to accept any and all other students as full voting members and potential leaders .
Due diligence about Hastings ' enforcement of its policy
Although the high court affirmed the ruling of Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals , the justices remanded the case to the appeals court to consider whether Hastings officials had engaged in selective enforcement of its all - comers policy as a pretext to act against the Christian student group .
“ We believe we will ultimately prevail in this case , ” said Michael McConnell , who argued the case on behalf of CLS .
“ The record will show that Hastings law school applied its policy in a discriminatory way – excluding CLS from campus but not other groups who limit leadership and voting membership in a similar way . ”
Other analysts praised the high court decision .
“ Religious discrimination is wrong , and a public school should be able to take steps to eradicate it , ” said the Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State .
“ Simply stated , the Christian Legal Society sought to ignore rules that every other group complied with , ” he said .
“ The organization sought preferential treatment simply because it is religious .
I am pleased that the court said no to that . ”

7.1 - magnitude quake hits Qinghai ( Xinhua )
Updated : 2010-04-14 15:00
The map shows the location of the epicenter of the 7.1 - magnitude quake in Qinghai Province early Wednesday .
[ chinanews.com.cn ]
Latest :
The death toll of China 's Qinghai 7.1 - magnitude earthquake rose to 589 as of 1:20 am Thursday , according to the local quake - relief headquarters .
The headquarters have dispatched relief work groups respectively in charge of rescue , quake survivors ' daily life , detecting aftershocks and health and disease control .
Jia Yingzhong , Party secretary of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture called for all local cadres to make all - out effort in rescue and relief work .
Those who fail to do the job will be sacked immediately , he said .

YUSHU , Qinghai - About 400 people have died and 10,000 others were injured after a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake hit northwest China 's Qinghai Province early on Wednesday , local authorities said .
President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao have ordered local authorities to go all out to save the disaster - stricken people .
Vice Premier Hui Liangyu has rushed to the quake - hit region .
Many people are still buried under the debris of collapsed houses in the Gyegu Town near the epicenter in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu in southern Qinghai , said Huang Limin , deputy secretary - general of the prefecture government .
The strong quake and a string of aftershocks , with the biggest one being 6.3 magnitude , have toppled houses , temples , gas stations and electric poles , triggered landslides , damaged roads , cut power supplies and disrupted telecommunications .
A reservoir was also cracked , where workers are trying to prevent the outflow of water .
Gyegu , also known as Jiegu , is the seat of the Yushu prefecture government .
The town has a population of about 100,000 , including permanent residents and migrant people .
About 700 soldiers are now struggling to clear away the rubble and rescue the buried people , a spokesman with the Qinghai Provincial Emergency Office said .
More than 5,000 additional rescuers , including soldiers and medical workers , have been dispatched to the quake - hit region , according to a news conference held by the Qinghai provincial government .
Authorities in the neighboring provinces of Gansu and Sichuan and Tibet Autonomous Region have also dispatched rescuers to Yushu .
" Our top priority is to save students .
Schools are always places that have many people , " said Kang Zifu , an army officer in the rescue operation in Gyegu .
The quake also killed five people and injured one another in the Shiqu County , which neighbors Yushu , in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze in Sichuan Province , local authorities said .
Lying on the Qinghai - Tibet Plateau , Yushu has an altitude of above 4,000 meters .
The Qinghai Provincial Observatory forecast Wednesday that Yushu would see strong winds and sleet in the coming days , which would hamper rescue efforts .
CASUALTIES , DAMAGES AND LOSSES
More than 85 percent of the houses in Gyegu had collapsed , said Zhuohuaxia , a publicity official with the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu .
" The streets in Gyegu are thronged with panic , injured people , with many bleeding from the head , " he said .
" Many students are buried under the debris due to building collapse at a vocational school , " he said .
" A large crack appears in the wall of the Yushu Hotel , and part of a government office building also collapsed , " he said .
" I can see injured people everywhere .
The biggest problem now is that we lack tents , we lack medical equipment , medicine and medical workers , " he said .
The epicenter is at the Rima Village in the Shanglaxiu Township , about 50 km west of Gyegu and about 800 km away from Xining , the Qinghai provincial capital .
" The epicenter is a pasturing area and sparsely - populated .
I think the quake would not cause casualties as heavy as those in Jiegu , " Zhuohuaxia said .
Zhu Liang , a driver at the Yushu prefecture government , said he saw half of the buildings in the Yushu Vocational School had collapsed .
How does one respond to the idea that government needs to regulate monopolies ?
More specifically , in a free , capitalist economy , is there any time when government would intervene “ for the consumer ’s good ” ?
Unfortunately the free market has been tarred with a bad reputation as a facilitator of centralized power in the form of business monopolies .
But much of the attack on free markets comes from a failure to comprehend just what a monopoly is , what constitutes “ market share , ” and what powerful forces free markets bring to bear in disciplining even the largest of firms when it attempts to abuse its position .
In Adam Smith ’s day , monopoly referred to a firm that enjoyed some government grant ofexclusive privilege ( e.g. the Navigation Acts of 1651 or the Tea Act of 1773 ) –the use of the power of government on behalf of one or more special , private interests , to hobble or preclude competition .
One step further in this direction , of course , is an actual government monopoly itself whereby government says , “ We will do this work and will forcibly shut down anyone who tries to compete with us , ” as it does in first class mail delivery .
Send a letter in the United States and you must use the government post office but send a package and you get to choose between lots of private alternatives .
( It should n’t surprise anyone that the government monopoly loses money even as it pays no taxes or dividends and outlaws direct competition , whereas the private providers of other classes of mail actually make money and pay both taxes and dividends to shareholders . )
Government can forbid competition directly , or it can indirectly accomplish some degree of the same thing ( intentionally or otherwise ) by burdensome taxation and regulation .
Taxes and regulations usually hit newcomer or smaller businesses harder than the older , bigger , or politically well - connected firms ; the effect is , to some extent , to limit competition and thereby confer a degree of monopoly privilege on the existing or larger firms .
Many people today are candidates to start a business , perhaps in competition with large existing companies , but they do not do so because the tax and regulatory barriers discourage them from the start .
When governments , by one method and to one degree or another , limit competition by the various means described above , the result is a coercive monopoly for those producers who benefit from the limitation of competition .
This is the kind of monopoly to be concerned about because it breeds a situation where a company ( or the government itself ) can get away with abuse that would doom a company in a truly competitive , consumer - responsive market .
The other kind of “ monopoly ” some of us occasionally refer to is known as an “ efficiency ” monopoly .
It is simply a situation where a company gets a high market share not because of any government grant of exclusive privilege , subsidy , special tax treatment , or the like , but because it simply does the best job .
If such a firm ever became sloppy and complacent , it would be as if it publicly displayed a sign reading “ COMPETITORS WANTED , ” and that ’s precisely what it would get .
A free market system provides powerful restraints against any company abusing its customers or its competitors .
( It even whittles away at coercive government monopolies : by my communicating with you via e-mail or fax , I am undermining the Postal Service ’s legal monopoly on first - class mail . )
In a free market , the following constitute some of the ways an abusive firm is disciplined :
Free entry –the fact that another entity ( a newcomer or an existing firm that may not even currently be in the same business ) will find it attractive to enter a market in which consumers are unhappy with the current major supplier .
Competition of substitutes –the fact that for most goods , there is some reasonable substitute .
Breakfast cereal is a good example .
Foreign competition –the fact that simply opening the borders to free trade is enough to imperil the monopoly position of almost any domestic producer .
Once , many considered that Detroit would dominate the automobile industry with its powerful market share forever , but Japan found a way into the market , and slowly chipped away at the American automakers ’ hold on consumers worldwide .
Competition of ALL goods for the consumer ’s dollar –the fact that if I do n’t like the air fares charged by the airlines , for example , I may take that disposable income and buy the washer and dryer I ’ve been thinking about .
In that case , United Airlines competes directly against Maytag .
I would be remiss if I did not also mention the simple matter of the “ price ” mechanism .
Should any firm or firms establish a dominant market share of any industry , let ’s say , airlines –for instance–any rise in price and profits acts as an instantaneous signal that alerts other aviation entrepreneurs to an opportunity for profit .
Of course , a tricky problem is always the question of what constitutes “ market share . ”
I have a 100 % monopoly on lectures by Lawrence Reed , but I hardly have a monopoly over “ lectures on economics . ”
A few years ago , the Federal Trade Commission tried to convict five ready - to - eat cereal manufacturers of what it called a “ shared monopoly , ” because those five firms sold 80 % of the “ ready - to - eat ” cereal in the U.S .
The trouble was , those five firms not only competed against themselves , but they also competed against anything anybody eats for breakfast !
( So do n’t lose any sleep over a vicious , price - gouging cereal monopoly ) .
The point is , depending on how you define market share , you can make almost anybody look like a monopolist if you think monopoly has something to do with market share alone .
Sometimes people become concerned with how large a share of a particular market a firm has , without considering the dynamics of competition over time .
But that ’s a little like stopping a horse race in the middle because one horse is ahead .
The race is n’t over yet and in a free market , it never is .
One accusation often made is that “ monopolistic ” firms use “ predatory pricing ” as a weapon in suffocating competition –as a “ barrier to entry ” –so as to maintain its preferred status .
As I explain in this article , that is a highly unlikely proposition .
The bottom line is that “ monopoly ” in free market is a very slippery concept and competition is far more dynamic and effective over time than most attempts to regulate .

A new study comparing reading skills of fourth - and eighth - grade children in 18 urban school systems once again places Milwaukee Public Schools near the bottom of the ladder , a pattern of underachievement that gave voice to worries Thursday about the future of Milwaukee 's children and calls - yet again - for a greater sense of urgency to improve .
In a set of national reading tests , Milwaukee 's fourth - graders outperformed only Detroit , Cleveland and Philadelphia , while its eighth - graders outperformed only Detroit , Fresno , Calif. , and Washington , D.C. , according to the results of the Trial Urban District Assessment , a special project of the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
The National Assessment of Educational Progress is a periodic national assessment , often referred to as the Nation 's Report Card , that allows for state - to - state comparisons in core academic subjects .
The urban district study isolates scores among a number of the country 's high - minority , high - poverty school systems to better compare how those students are doing .
All of the voluntary participants in the program are from cities with populations of at least 250,000 , ranging from districts serving Fresno , Calif. , and Louisville , Ky. , to those in New York City , Los Angeles and Chicago .
This is the first time that Milwaukee Public Schools participated in the reading tests for the urban districts .
Last year , results from the math tests also carried bad news for MPS , which did better than only Detroit at the eighth - grade level .
India McCanse , executive director of Literacy Services of Wisconsin , said the reading study results call into question the rigor of the curriculum and instruction in MPS .
Superintendent William Andrekopoulos echoed those concerns in an interview .
" Many of these same students are going to end up here in five or 10 years , " McCanse said .
" If we can't get kids to read at a proficient level during their primary school years , we know from our work that it has a huge impact on individuals , families , communities and our economy . "
Claudia Scholl , spokeswoman for Milwaukee Achiever Literacy Services , called the results discouraging .
" This ( inability to read ) plays out as these people become adults , and it leads to this cycle that seems unending , " she said .
" Something dramatic has to happen to get some sort of change . "
The National Assessment of Educational Progress reading tests were administered to a sample that included almost one - quarter of MPS fourth - graders at 90 schools and almost one - fifth of eighth - graders at 60 schools in 2009 .
Only schools that are part of MPS , which includes charter schools authorized by the district , were included , said Deb Lindsey , the district 's director of research and assessment .
Overall , only 12 % of the MPS students tested at each grade scored at a level considered proficient or above on the NAEP reading test .
On average in other large - city school systems , 23 % of fourth - graders and 22 % of eighth - graders scored proficient or advanced .
On the other end of the spectrum , 61 % of fourth - graders and 49 % of eighth - graders in MPS scored below the basic level on the reading test .
Basic is defined as partial mastery of the knowledge and skills needed to become proficient for the grade level .
Poverty and race played a large role in student performance : Only 8 % of MPS students from families whose low - income status qualified them for free and reduced - price lunches scored at a level considered proficient in either grade , and only 6 % of black students were considered proficient at either grade .
In contrast , one - quarter of non-impoverished students and one - third of white students in MPS scored at a level considered proficient .
Statewide results released as part of the NAEP in March showed that 9 % of black fourth - graders and 38 % of white fourth - graders in Wisconsin scored proficient or above on the same reading test , while 9 % of black eighth - graders and 39 % of white eighth - graders in the state scored at least at a proficient level .
Signposts for change
The most promising news from the new study could be the evidence that change is indeed possible in districts such as Milwaukee .
Atlanta Public Schools was celebrated as the gold standard for progress during the official release of the study in Atlanta on Thursday .
From 2002 to 2009 , both fourth - and eighth - grade students in Atlanta increased their reading scores by 14 points .
Atlanta Superintendent Beverly L. Hall said the improved scores did not mean that the district was outperforming everyone else .
It meant that they were making progress from where they started in 2002 , when their first urban district assessment results were so dismal .
" Student scores are still below national and state averages , but our students are digging out of a deep hole , and they 're doing so at a significantly fast rate , " she said , adding that the gains were because of reforms in instruction , professional development and use of data .
The study also found that schools in Boston , Houston , Washington , D.C. , and New York increased their scores in fourth - grade reading from 2007 to 2009 .
Atlanta , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , made progress over that same two - year span in eighth - grade reading .
Compared with other urban districts , MPS has a higher proportion of black students and fewer white and Hispanic students .
It also has a slightly higher population of students who qualify for free - and reduced - price lunch - an indicator of family poverty - at 77 % .
Other urban districts averaged 71 % poverty at fourth grade and 65 % poverty in eighth grade .
Lack of urgency in MPS
But Dave Gordon , superintendent of schools in Sacramento County , Calif. , and a member of the National Assessment Governing Board , said it appeared Milwaukee 's lack of achievement mostly stemmed from its lack of urgency for a consistent and coherent plan for reading .
" It 's about having an overall plan so what you 're doing in classroom A , B and C is not random , " Gordon said , adding that teaching reading should not be based on the hunches of literacy coaches or reading specialists in individual schools .
MPS uses 17 reading programs , but it's in the process of moving to a single curriculum .
Meanwhile , the district is waiting for its comprehensive literacy plan to be approved by the state .
An earlier submission of the plan was not deemed sufficient by the Department of Public Instruction .

Greece is a test case for the social dismantling that awaits us all .
This policy is being enacted by all the institutional parties , by every government and by all of globalised capitalism 's institutions .
There is only one way to hold back this policy of barbaric capitalism : popular direct action , to widen the strike movement and increase the number of demonstrations all across Europe .
---- SOLIDARITY WITH THE GREEK WORKERS ' STRUGGLE !
The Greek working class is angry , and with good reason , with the attempt to load responsibility for the bankruptcy of the Greek State onto their shoulders .
We maintain instead that it is the international financial institutions and the European Union who are responsible .
The financial institutions have plunged the world , and Greece in particular , into an economic and social crisis of historical proportions , forcing countries into debt , and now these same institutions are complaining that certain States risk not being able to repay their debts .
We denounce this hypocrisy and say that even if Greece - and all the other countries - can repay the debt , they should not do so : it is up to those responsible for the crisis - the financial institutions , not the - to pay for the damage caused by this crisis .
The Greek workers are right to refuse to pay back their country 's debt .
We refuse to pay for their crisis !
Instead , let us shift the capitalists into the firing line : Greek capital generates some of the biggest profit margins in Europe due to its investments in the poorer Balkan countries , the absence of social protections , collective guarantees and a minimum wage for Greek workers , not to mention the country 's gigantic black economy in labour and an even greater exploitation of immigrant work .
Greek capital is also very lightly taxed , due to the weakness of the State ( with regard to the rich ) and major corruption which permits fraud and tax evasion on a massive scale .
So it is equally up to Greek capitalists to pay for this crisis .
We also denounce the attitude of the European Union .
The EU was presented to us as a supposed guarantee of peace and solidarity between the peoples , but now it is showing its true face - that of acting as an unconditional prop for neoliberalism , in a complete denial of the notion of democracy .
As soon as an economy becomes mired in difficulties , all pretence of solidarity evaporates .
So we see Greece being scolded and accused of laxity , with insulting language bordering on racism .
The " Europe which protects us " that liberals and social - democrats extolled at the time of the scandalous forced adoption of the Lisbon Treaty ( particularly in France and Ireland ) now seems a long way away .
As far as actual protection goes , the EU and the financial institutions have combined their efforts to frog - march Greece towards the forced dismantling of public services , through austerity plans that recall the " Stuctural Adjustment Plans " of the IMF : the non-replacement of staff , wage freezes , privatisations and VAT increases .
Today the EU is demanding that the retirement age be moved back to 67 , not only in Greece but also in other countries , and is also threatening to dismantle the social welfare system .
In this way they are opening new markets for investors , while guaranteeing the assets of rich investors , to the detriment of the basic interests of the working class .
It is a Europe of the ruling class , and one which we must all work together to oppose .
This is why we call for participation throughout Europe in solidarity initiatives with the Greek working class and with future victims of the onslaught of the banks .
Against the values of greed and rapacity that the European Union is based on , let us respond with class solidarity !
Greece is a test case for the social dismantling that awaits us all .
This policy is being enacted by all the institutional parties , from out - and - out bourgeois to liberals and social democrats , by every government and by all of globalised capitalism 's institutions .
There is only one way to hold back this policy of barbaric capitalism : popular direct action , to widen the strike movement and increase the number of demonstrations all across Europe .
Solidarity with the Greek workers ' struggle !

2010 Organizing Committee
David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors is out with some very gloomy comments about the economic ramifications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , and what it will cost .
First he notes the ugliest case scenario :
This spew stoppage takes longer to reach a full closure ; the subsequent cleanup may take a decade .
The Gulf becomes a damaged sea for a generation .
The oil slick leaks beyond the western Florida coast , enters the Gulfstream and reaches the eastern coast of the United States and beyond .
Use your imagination for the rest of the damage .
Monetary cost is now measured in the many hundreds of billions of dollars .
As for numbers :
Usually , the first estimates in any crises are too low .
That is true here .
1000 barrels a day is now 5000 , and some estimates of spillage are trending higher .
No one knows exactly .
The containment and boom mechanism is subject to weather cooperation as we can see this weekend .
Soon we are entering the hurricane season .
The thoughts of a storm stirring up the Gulf , hampering any cleanup or remediation drilling effort and creating a huge 10,000 square mile black stew is frightening to every professional in the business .
This will be a financial calamity for many firms , not just BP and its partners and service providers .
Their liabilities are immense and must not be underestimated .
The first estimate of $ 12.5 billion is only a starter .
As for the economy beyond BP ...
Thousands of small and independent businesses as well as larger public companies in tourism are hurt here .
This is not just about the source of half the nation ’s shrimp .
That is already a casualty .
It ’s also about the bank loans for the $ 200,000 shrimp boat and the house the boat owner and / or his employees live in and the fact that this shock piles on a fragile financial system that is trying to recover from a three - year financial crisis .
Case study , my fishing guide in the Everglades splits his time between Florida and Louisiana .
His May bookings in LA have cancelled .
His colleagues lost theirs and their lodge will be empty .
They are busy trying to find work in the clean up .
For him , his wife and eleven year old daughter , his $ 600 a day guide fees just went “ poof ” .
When I asked him if he thought he had a legal claim on BP , he said he had n’t thought about it yet but it gave him pause .
As we suggested above , the $ 12.5 billion loss estimate is only a starter .
And the taxpayer ...
Federal deficit spending will certainly rise by tens , and maybe hundreds , of billions as emergency appropriations are directed at larger and larger efforts to clean up this mess .
At the same time , federal and state revenues tied to Gulf - region businesses will fall .
My colleague John Mousseau will be discussing the impact on state and local government debt in a separate research commentary .
We expect that the Federal Reserve will extend the timeframe that we have come to know as the “ extended period ” in the making of its monetary policy .
We do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates at all for the rest of this year , and maybe well into next year .
We expect to see the deterioration of the economic statistics for the US to reveal the onset of this oil - slick crisis in May , and the negative impact will intensify during the summer months .
A “ double - dip ” recession probably has been made more likely by this tragedy .
A new report from the U.K. ’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) concludes that , before 24 weeks , nerve endings in the brains of fetuses are n’t sufficiently developed to experience pain .
The findings , based on a review of recent studies examining fetal development and capacity for pain , undermine the argument for a Nebraska law passed in April prohibiting most abortions after 20 weeks ’ gestation .
According to the New Scientist :
“ The report concludes that fetuses under 24 weeks must be pain - free , because at that age the wiring does n’t exist to send pain signals from nerves around the body to the cortex , the area of the brain where pain is experienced .
At which later point such connections form is unknown , so analgesia should still be considered after 24 weeks , the RCOG says . ”
On April 13 , Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman signed a law banning abortions later than 20 weeks , based on arguments that a fetus can feel pain after this point .
Yet in large part , the New York Times reported , the new law was a final step in a chain of events set in motion by the murder of abortion provider Dr. George R. Tiller in May 2009 .
After Dr. Tiller , who routinely performed late - term abortions at a clinic in Wichita , Kansas , was killed by an anti-abortion activist , his colleague Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart , said that he would continue the work and provide late - term abortions for women at his clinic in Bellevue , Nebraska , according to the Times .
Yet Nebraska residents were none too keen to become the “ later - term abortion capital of the Midwest , ” and in April , a bill banning most abortions after 20 weeks was passed 44 to 5 by the state legislature .
The reasoning behind the ban was that studies had shown fetuses as young as 20 weeks exhibited reflexive responses to pain — the same way that fully developed children and adults do .
Yet Allan Templeton , chairman of the group that produced the RCOG report , says the reflexive responses do n’t signify actual experience of pain .
From the New Scientist :
“ Templeton dismisses this reasoning .
‘ There are indeed reflex responses , but in our view , because the nerves are not wired up to the cortex , they are reflex actions without experience of pain , ’ he says …
The report notes that the same reflexes are seen in seriously malformed fetuses that have no brain at all , and therefore ca n’t possibly experience pain . ”
Watch a Telegraph video report explaining the findings here .
The mascots are based on two bits of molten steel from a girder of the Olympic stadium that have been woven into a fictional story by renowned children 's author Michael Morpurgo .
Wenlock is named after Much Wenlock in Shropshire which inspired the modern Olympics , and Mandeville after the Stoke - Mandeville hospital which inspired the Paralympic Games

From LATimes.com :
As President Obama considers nominees to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens , a debate bubbles as to whether religion should play a role in his choice .
This is a no-brainer .
The religious views of the next justice of the high court must absolutely be a decisive factor .
Though the court without Stevens will be left with six Catholics and two Jews , the open seat should not go to either domination .
Nor should it go to a Presbyterian , a Lutheran , a Methodist , a Muslim or even a Zoroastrian .
If it did , that would make nine people who all have one religious principle in common : a belief in religion .

CHANGELOG CAINE 11.0 " Wormhole "
Kernel 5.0.0-32
Based on Ubuntu 18.04 64BIT - UEFI Ready !
CAINE 11.0 can boot on Uefi / Uefi / Legacy Bios / Bios .
If secureboot failed , try to disable it from UEFI .
If you want to create an hybrid image , try this :
isohybrid -u caine11.0.iso
The important news is CAINE 11.0 blocks all the block devices ( e.g. / dev/sda ) , in Read - Only mode .
You can use a tool with a GUI named Unblock present on CAINE 's Desktop .
This new write - blocking method assures all disks are really preserved from accidentally writing operations , because they are locked in Read - Only mode .
If you need to write a disk , you can unlock it with UnBlock or using " Mounter " changing the policy in writable mode .
CAINE is always more fast during the boot .
CAINE 11.0 can boot to RAM ( toram ) .
INSTALLING CAINE : UnBlock ( blockdev ) put the device in WRITABLE mode -> use Ubiquity -> Choose System Install ->
Choose user : CAINE password : CAINE host : CAINE ->
Go !
Ubiquity is the installer , even if for old BIOS based computers , you need to run BootRepair after the end of Ubiquity !.
Then after the first boot , run Grub Customizer and put RW instead of RO in the boot menu .
ADDED / CHANGED :
IMPORTANT CHANGES :
All devices are blocked in Read - Only mode , by default .
New tools , new OSINT , Autopsy 4.13 onboard , APFS ready , BTRFS forensic tool , NVME SSD drivers ready !
SSH server disabled by default ( see Manual page for enabling it ) .
SCRCPY - screen your android device
Autopsy 4.13 + additional plugins by McKinnon .
X11VNC Server - to control CAINE remotely .
hashcat
NEW SCRIPTS ( Forensics Tools - Analysis menu )
AutoMacTc - a forensics tool for Mac .
Bitlocker - volatility plugin
Autotimeliner - Automagically extract forensic timeline from volatile memory dumps .
Firmwalker - firmware analyzer .

many others fixing and software updating .
many and many scripts and programs ....
Windows Side :
CAINE has got a Windows IR / Live forensics tools .
New release of Arsenal Image Mounter by Arsenal Recon
If you need it you can use the IR / Live forensics framework you prefer , changing the tools in your pendrive .
------------------------------------------------
NEW RBFstab and Mounter
1 ) " rbfstab " is a utility that is activated during boot or when a device is plugged in .
It writes read - only entries to /etc / fstab so devices are safely mounted for forensic imaging / examination .
It is self installing with ' rbfstab - i ' and can be disabled with ' rbfstab - r ' .
It contains many improvements over past rebuildfstab incarnations .
Rebuildfstab is a traditional mean for read - only mounting in forensics - orient distributions .
2 ) " mounter " is a GUI mounting tool that sits in the system tray .
Left - clicking the system tray drive icon activates a window where the user can select devices to mount or un -mount .
With rbfstab activated , all devices , except those with volume label " RBFSTAB " , are mounted read - only on loop device .
Mounting block devices in Caja ( file browser ) is not possible for a normal user with rbfstab activated making mounter a consistent interface for users .
Mounter is a disk mounting application that runs in the system tray .
General Informations :
A green disk icon means the system is SAFE and will mount devices READ - ONLY on loop device .
A red disk icon means WARNING , mounted devices will be WRITEABLE .
In CAINE 8.0 mounter can unlock and lock block devices in Read - Only mode .
Instructions :
Left - click the disk icon to mount a device .
Right - click the disk icon to change the system mount policy .
Middle - click will close the mounter application .
Relaunch from the menu .
The mounted devices will not be affected by mount policy changes .
Only subsequent mounting operations will be affected .

Live Preview Caja Scripts
CAINE includes scripts activated within the Caja web browser designed to make examination of allocated files simple .
Currently , the scripts can render many databases , internet histories , Windows registries , deleted files , and extract EXIF data to text files for easy examination .
The Quick View tool automates this process by determining the file type and rendering it with the appropriate tool .
The live preview Caja scripts also provide easy access to administrative functions , such as making an attached device writeable , dropping to the shell , or opening a Caja window with administrator privileges .
The " Save as Evidence " script will write the selected file (s ) to an " Evidence " folder on the desktop and create a text report about the file containing file metadata and an investigator comment , if desired .
A unique script , " Identify iPod Owner " , is included in the toolset .
This script will detect an attached and mounted iPod Device , display metadata about the device ( current username , device serial number , etc. ) .
The investigator has the option to search allocated media files and unallocated space for iTunes user information present in media purchased through the Apple iTunes store , i.e. , Real Name and email address .
The live preview scripts are a work in progress .
Many more scripts are possible as are improvements to the existing scripts .
The CAINE developers welcome feature requests , bug reports , and criticisms .
The preview scripts were born from a desire to make evidence extraction simple for any investigator with basic computer skills .
They allow the investigator to get basic evidence to support the investigation without the need of advanced computer forensics training or waiting upon a computer forensics lab .
Computer forensics labs can use the scripts for device triage and the remainder of the CAINE toolset for a full forensic examination !

Root file system spoofing PATCH
The patch changes the way how Casper searches for the boot media .
By default , Casper will look at hard disk drives , CD / DVD - drives and some other devices while booting the system ( during the stage when system tries to find the boot media with correct root file system image on it - because common bootloaders do not pass any data about media used for booting to an operating system in Live CD configurations ) .
Our patch is implemented for CD / DVD versions of CAINE and enables CD / DVD - only checks in Casper .
This solves the bug when Casper would select and boot fake root file system images on evidentiary media ( hard disk drives , etc ) .

Case in point is the current arbitration hell that currently exists now into the 4th year involving Mossy Toyota of San Diego .
A noticeable vibration during the test drive , they assured as simple fix to the idler and promised to do so .
After failing at two attempts they said thats the way it is refusing any refunds or exchanging a like vehicle at no extra cost .
A well known reputable auto industry investigator determined that the car was once submerged in water .
It was a bona fide Flood Car .
Rusting from the inside out and showing signs of electrical arching .
As if that was not bad enough , it was once in a rear end collision .
Legal representation was made after this discovery .
Now , not only did the dealer refuse to make things right in the first place over the many repeated visits in the first few weeks of owning the car , one would think the revelation of a Flood Car being sold off their lot they would jump up to the plate and " take care of business " .
No , No ... Instead they choose to hide behind a mandatory arbitration agreement and screw the customer .
Good , real good .

Subscriber
A subscriber is someone that has an agreement with us to use an Internet access service and is not receiving that service as a communications provider .
This is the default .
Communications provider
The definition of communications provider is in in the Communications Act and is quite complex .
Firstly provider is a bit misleading as section 32 ( 4 ) redefines this to include establishing , maintaining and operating a communications network .
Secondly network is a bit misleading as section 32 ( 6 ) says that even a single transmitter counts as a communications network .
The Act seems to have been drafted to catch almost anyone as the definition seems to mean anyone that operates a small home network or even a DSL router would appear to be a Communications Provider under the Act .
However , we are not trying to offer any legal advice here .
What we are asking here is whether you believe you receive service as a communications provider .
It is not entirely clear what the difference is between that , and being a communications provider and receiving service .
However , as it matters how you receive the service , not how we provide it , then we can only tell by asking you .
Separately it matters if you are a communications provider whether your receive the service as that or not .
We 're not making this up , honest .
Internet service provider
An Internet service provider is anyone that is a is providing Internet access services to subscribers , and allocated IP addresses to do so .
These have to be people that have an agreement with you to provide an Internet access service ( so public wifi does not count if you have no agreements ) and they must themselves not be receiving the service as a communications provider ( else they are not subscribers ) .
If you have anyone else using the service but they do not meet these criteria ( an agreement , allocating IPs and them not being a communications provider ) then you are just a communications provider yourself , and not an ISP .
Note that the definition of Internet access service is circular which makes this somewhat difficult .
i.e. if it is not an Internet access service , then the people buying it are not subscribers , but if you have no subscribers then your service is not an Internet access service .
Sorry , we do n't make the law !
Importantly , if you buy Internet service from us , and charge your customer , then we have no commercial arrangement with your customer , so they are not our subscribers .
However , if you do not allocate IP addresses to them ( we do that ) then you are not an Internet service provider either .
You are , however , clearly buying from us as a communications provider in such cases .
So neither you , nor your customers come under the definition of subscriber under the law .
Do n't take this as legal advice though .
Note that if you are an Internet service provider that providers services to the public then you become a public electronic communications network provider and have a number of additional obligations under the Communications Act .

* Tests performed on seven dolphins , 106 sea turtles
* None showed visible signs of oil contamination
* All being treated as suspected spill casualties
PORT FOURCHON , La. , May 13 ( Reuters ) - Scientists are examining samples from seven dolphins and over 100 sea turtles found dead along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the past two weeks to see if they were victims of the giant oil spill in the region , wildlife officials said on Thursday .
All of the deaths are being investigated as suspected casualties of the oil gushing unchecked since April 20 from a ruptured wellhead on the floor of the Gulf off Louisiana because of their proximity in time and space to the spill .
But none of the dolphins or turtles examined showed any obvious visible signs of oil contamination .
Necropsies -- the animal equivalent of autopsies -- are being performed and analyzed to determine if oil ingestion caused the deaths .
The investigations of most of the animals are still pending , and none has yet confirmed oil as a cause of death .
The information about dolphin and sea turtle mortality and the investigation into the cause of those deaths came from two sources close to the Gulf ’s wildlife spill - response teams who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity .
The seven dolphins and 106 sea turtles were found along the coast of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama over the past two weeks , the sources said .
One heavily decayed dolphin carcass was seen on the beach at the very tip of Port Fourchon in southeastern Louisiana .
Gooey , rust - colored globs believed to be oil debris began washing ashore on that beach on Wednesday night .
A few deaths were ruled out as spill - related because they occurred before the spill or were animals that were known to have been sick or injured beforehand , the sources said .
TOO SOON FOR CONCLUSIONS
Wildlife officials have expressed particular concern for the well - being of sea turtles in the Gulf following the spill because all five species that inhabit the region are endangered , and it is their spring nesting season .
But experts say large numbers of sea turtle deaths this time of year is not uncommon .
On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday , officials of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it was still too early to draw firm conclusions from the latest wildlife casualties in the Gulf .
“ We do n’t have definitive information for most of the ... ( animals ) that have been found , ” said Jane Lubchenco , Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere .
Impacts on bird life has been relatively light to date , according to wildlife specialists .
“ So far , relatively few birds have been brought in with oil on their feathers , ” said David Ringer of the National Audubon Society , who put the number at between 12 and 20 .
“ The birds that have been brought in are birds that catch fish in open waters ” and would have come in contact with oil there , he said .
The Eastsider L.A. reports that about 200 dead fish were recovered from Echo Park Lake this week .
The culprit ?
It could be fish herpes .
Apparently an official from the state Department of Fish and Game took a look at the fish and suspected herpes but did not take any samples or run any tests – leaving the true cause of the die - off a mystery :
[ Echo Park gardener and care taker David ]
Foster has begun his mornings this week by picking out dead carp - and a handful of game fish - from the lake and answering questions from park visitors .
This morning , about 20 dead fish were seen floating in the water .
" We just need to know what 's going on , " Foster said .
Here are some other goings - on around Web L.A. :

Chapman undie run : The Orange County Register reports on Chapman University 's undie run .
The students have turned the event into a charity , donating the clothes they shed to Ugandan orphans :
Residents and onlookers lined the street to watch the parade of scantily clad college students running , walking and rollerblading .
The procession stayed in the Plaza until about 25 Orange police and Chapman Campus Safety officers shepherded the crowd back to campus .
Two years ago , significant damage occurred in the historic Plaza .

Los Angeles is facing litigation after its crackdown on the proliferation of medical marijuana dispensaries , the WSJ reports .
For years , the city sat by as the number of shops soared to about 600 ; it's now trying to pare that back to only 186 .
Yet many dispensaries are launching legal challenges to the ordinance that requires 439 of them to close by June 7 .
The head of a coalition representing 130 dispensaries that were ordered to close tells the WSJ that the city " is going to be bogged down by years of litigation . "
As ...
Mr. Isham and other news executives say they remain committed to the White House beat , but they are looking for new and less expensive ways to work .
Mark Whitaker , the Washington bureau chief for NBC News , said , “ We still cover the president as thoroughly and responsibly as we always have ; we just have to look at the best way to do it , both logistically and financially . ”
Presidential trips cost the press about $ 18 million last year , according to the correspondents ’ association .
“ The prices are exorbitant , ” said David Westin , the president of ABC News .
Seats on a press charter plane can run $ 2,000 for a domestic flight and tens of thousands overseas .
ABC appears to be watching costs as it reshapes the news division , which eliminated 25 percent of its staff positions this spring .
The news outlets vote on whether to charter a plane , but it ’s not easy to get the majority :
The big television networks — ABC , CBS , CNN , Fox News and NBC — represent five of seven votes .
( Mr. Chen casts the other two votes on behalf of other correspondents . )
When the networks choose not to travel in a pack , reporters of all stripes have to make other arrangements .
The skimping on charters started in the tail end of the George W. Bush administration and has deepened during Mr. Obama ’s 16 months of office , particularly in the last three months , news executives say .
In these cases — be they in Buffalo this month or in Prague , where Mr. Obama traveled last month without a press charter for an important nuclear arms deal — the only reporters who are in the so - called presidential bubble are the dozen in a travel pool that fly on Air Force One and take notes and pictures for the rest of the press corps .
Ice Sculpture is basically a kind of sculpture that uses an ice as a raw material and is then crafted by ice Sculptors .
Although it may seem easy , it takes a talent , skill and time to come up with a spectacular result .
Using different techniques , they make magnificent figures that can make us stare for a while .
In our next post , we will be showcasing 40 Splendid Ice Sculptures for Inspiration .
We have collected some of beautiful ice sculptures around the world for your eyes to banquet .

End of the World
Featured 10/05/2011
WayBack Whensday : Interesting view on how the world will end .
Galaxy 15 , a communications satellite 22,400 miles above the planet , refuses to obey commands sent from Earth .
And it 's getting perilously close to other satellites — potentially " infecting " them as well .
Advertisement
In an ironic turn of events , a recent solar storm fried the communications systems on Intelsat 's Galaxy 15 geostationary communications satellite — even though the other systems remain online .
It 's not quite unprecedented ; when satellites fry out and drift purposelessly , they 're called zombiesats , and industry experts have methods of dealing with them .
According to Discovery , what makes Galaxy 15 different is that it 's still powered - up :
If Galaxy 15 drifts too close to other satellites , it can steal their signal , thereby interrupting other vendor 's services to customers on Earth .
That 's not too good for business , hence the increasingly desperate attempts to " kill " the satellite 's power .

About Better-iS
Better - iS aims at identifying the potential for linking low - productivity farming to small and medium enterprises ( SME ) to enhance livelihoods through biofuel value chains .
Local biomass production and processing targeted to small - scale farmers in Tanzania ( Morogoro ) through linkages to SMEs is expected to be improved .
Within the scope of increased energy demand , strategies on locally produced feedstock or biofuels may be used decentralised for producing electricity , cooking and heating ; or the option to be exported to the international market will be developed .
The following analytical assessment streams are undertaken to achieve the objective :
Model assessments to downscale global climate change scenarios to local case study regions in Tanzania and to assess biomass potentials for national energy demand simulations .
Participative assessments of the viability on potential pathways of linking low - productivity farming to SME on local , decentralized biomass concepts .
Beyond academic benefices , farmers , regional organizations and local authorities in sub-Saharan Africa will be collaboratively develop feasible strategies to benefit from biomass production potential and mitigate food insecurity .
After three years the project will have accomplished the following outputs :
New York 's Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center is notifying patients that their personal information may have been compromised after seven CDs full of unencrypted data were FedExed by a hospital contractor and then lost in transit .
The CDs were sent by the hospital 's billing processor , Siemens Medical Solutions USA , around March 16 , but never arrived at their intended destination .
They included sensitive health and personal information including Social Security numbers , addresses , dates of birth , health plan numbers , driver 's license numbers and even descriptions of medical procedures , the hospital said on a note posted to its
Web site .
The breach affects 130,495 patients , according to a notification posted Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
" FedEx has suggested that the CDs likely became separated from their shipping envelope at one of its facilities , were swept up and destroyed , " the hospital said in a letter sent to victims , dated June 4 .
The CD was password - protected but unencrypted , the letter states .
Companies have begun taking better care of their customers ' data in recent years , as they 've had to foot multimillion - dollar bills following similar incidents .
According to the Ponemon Institute , a security research firm , the average U.S. data breach costs companies more than US $ 200 per record .
Siemens is no longer FedExing CDs to Lincoln , the hospital said .
It is not aware of any of the data being improperly accessed .
Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Mass ) released a furious statement this afternoon saying BP was planning to kill a live feed of the oil leak during tomorrow 's Operation Top Kill :
It is outrageous that BP would kill the video feed for the top kill .
This BP blackout will obscure a vital moment in this disaster , ” said Rep. Markey , who chairs the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and the Energy and Environment Subcommittee in the Energy and Commerce Committee .
“ After more than a month of spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico , BP is essentially saying to the American people the solution will not be televised . ”
“ No one wants to interfere with the operations during the top kill .
With those preparations mostly done , now the world should see whether or not this strategy works , and we should see it in real time , ” said Rep. Markey .
BP spokesperson Mark Salt partially denied Markey 's claim .
" We are still evaluating whether a live camera will be possible .
No decision has been taken , " he said .
Salt did not elaborate on why a live feed might not be possible .
The live feed -- which was posted thanks to pressure from Markey -- has been a minor disaster for BP , after revealing their 5,000 barrels - a- day estimate was ridiculous and the leak may be getting worse .

Europe 's privacy watchdogs have issued a rebuke to Facebook , telling the social networking site that changes it made to the site 's privacy settings late last year were ' unacceptable ' .
Facebook faced criticism over the changes when they were made last December , and more when it announced recently that it would allow business partners to make more use of members ' data .
The Article 29 Working Party , the committee comprising the data protection regulators of the European Union 's 27 member states , has added its voice to the criticisms and has written to Facebook to express its alarm at the changes .
" It is unacceptable that the company fundamentally changed the default settings on its social - networking platform to the detriment of a user , " said a statement from the Working Party .
" Facebook made the change only days after the company and other social networking sites providers participated at a hearing during the Article 29 Working Party ’s plenary meeting in November 2009 . "
Facebook 's changes last year involved changing the default privacy settings on its service .
Though users were asked to confirm the changes , default settings are seen as important because many users simply confirm the pre-selected options .
Facebook users can set their profiles , which contain status updates , messages , pictures and more , to be seen by anyone on the internet or just by members of networks they join or just by their ' friends ' within the service .
Users who accepted Facebook 's new defaults found that much more of their information was available to everyone or to members of very large networks than before .
They found that details of their family , relationships and employer were available to the whole internet .
Accepting Facebook 's changes would also make their birthdays and religious views available to any Facebook user who is a friend with one of their friends , and their phone numbers , physical addresses and email addresses available to all their friends .
Facebook claimed that the changes were a simplification , but digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) said that they created " new and serious privacy problems " .
" These new ' privacy ' changes are clearly intended to push Facebook users to publicly share even more information than before , " said the EFF 's Kevin Bankston at the time .
" Even worse , the changes will actually reduce the amount of control that users have over some of their personal data . "
The Article 29 Working Party has now added its voice to the criticism .
It said that in its letter to Facebook it had emphasised that default settings should protect , not expose , users ' private information .
" The Working Party emphasised the need for a default setting in which access to the profile information and information about the connections of a user is limited to self - selected contacts , " said its statement .
" Any further access , such as by search engines , should be an explicit choice of the user . "
The Working Party has written to 20 social networking companies to highlight concerns it has about the operation of services overall .
" The letters … address the issue of third - party applications , " the statement said .
" Providers of social network services should grant users a maximum of control about which profile data can be accessed by a third party application on a case - by - case basis .
" The Article 29 Working Party also raised the issue of data of third persons contained in users ' profiles .
Providers of social networking sites should be aware that it would be a breach of data protection law if they use personal data of other individuals contained in a user profile for commercial purposes if these other individuals have not given their free and unambiguous consent , " it said .
The changes are also the subject of a complaint by privacy activist group the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) , which has complained about them to US consumer regulator the Federal Trade Commission .
" These changes violate user expectations , diminish user privacy , and contradict Facebook ’s own representations .
These business practices are Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practice , " said its complaint ( pdf ) .
Facebook last month announced a new initiative at its F8 conference designed to make even more use of individuals ' data than before .
Users ' preferences , likes and activity would be visible to Facebook business partner sites .
While Facebook called the developments ' social plug-ins ' and claimed they would improve people 's online experiences , users and privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of the changes .

What is so great about our bloated federal government that when a libertarian threatens to become a senator , otherwise rational and mostly liberal pundits start frothing at the mouth ?
What Rand Paul thinks about the Civil Rights Act , passed 46 years ago , hardly seems the most pressing issue of social justice before us .
It ’s a done deal that he clearly accepts .
Yet Paul ’s questioning the wisdom of a banking bailout that rewards those who shamelessly exploited the poor and vulnerable , many of them racial minorities , is right on target .
So too questioning the enormous cost of wars that as he dared point out are conducted in violation of our Constitution and that , I would add , though he does n’t , prevent us from adequately funding needed social programs .
Under the leadership of President Bill Clinton , Wall Street secured the radical deregulation of the financial industry that its lobbyists had long sought .
I opposed that betrayal of the sensible policies of the last great Democratic president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , and I suspect that Paul applauded the move as an extension of the free market that he so uncritically celebrates .
Where I agree with him is that with freedom comes responsibility , and when the financial conglomerates abused their freedom , they , and not the victims they swindled , should have borne the consequences .
Instead , they were saved by the taxpayers from their near - death experience , reaping enormous profits and bonuses while the fundamentals of the world economy they almost destroyed remain rotten , as attested by the high rates of housing foreclosures and unemployment and the tens of millions of newly poor dependent on government food handouts .
But the poor will not find much more than food crumbs from a federal government that , thanks to another one of Clinton ’s “ reforms , ” ended the federal obligation to deal with the welfare of the impoverished .
Yes , Clinton , not either Paul , father Ron or son .
It was Clinton who campaigned to “ end welfare as we know it , ” and as a result the federal obligation to end poverty , once fervently embraced by even Richard Nixon , was abandoned .
Concern for the poor was devolved to the state governments , and they in turn are in no mood to honor the injunction of all of the world ’s great religions that we be judged by how we treat the least among us .
That would be poor children , and it is unconscionable that state governments across the nation are cutting programs as elemental as the child care required when you force single mothers to work .
“ Cuts to Child Care Subsidy Thwart More Job Seekers ” ran the headline in The New York Times on Sunday over a story detailing how in a dozen states there are now sharp cuts in child care for the poor who find jobs , and how there are now long lists of kids needing child care while their mothers work at low - paying jobs at places like Wal - Mart .
In Arizona , there is a waiting list of 11,000 kids eligible for child care .
That is what passes for success in the welfare reform saga , with mothers forced off the rolls into a workplace bereft of promised child care that the cash - strapped states no longer wish to supply .
A couple of weeks ago came the news — reading like a page out of Dickens ( or perhaps like a parody from The Onion ) — that the Terminator was again in action , this time terminating California ’s programs for the poor .
The son - in - law of Sargent Shriver , who once ran the federal war on poverty , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger now seeks to eliminate the Golden State ’s CalWorks program .
By ending the once celebrated program along with child care funding , Schwarzenegger expects to save $ 2.2 billion .
As the Los Angeles Times reported , “ Ending CalWorks , which provides recipient families with an average of $ 500 per month , would make California the only state not to offer a welfare program for low - income families with children . ”
Schwarzenegger apparently does n’t care ; poor kids can’t complain too loudly , and while the governor backed down in his earlier threats to cut funding for somewhat more privileged college kids who protested those cuts loudly , he found the safety net for the poor an easier target : “ You can not have a safety net if you do n’t have the money for that safety net . ”
Sure you can’t , and so the safety net is being shredded in state after state , but why do n’t we have the money , and why was responsibility for the poor left to the tender mercy of state governments while the federal government maintains a lavish welfare system for needy bankers who treat a few billion in government bailouts as chump change ?
I am not a libertarian ; I proudly remain a bleeding - heart liberal , as befits one who began life in a family on the dole during the Depression .
But if the federal government exists primarily to serve super - rich defense contractors and bankers while ignoring the poor , I say it is time to expose as the enemy of progress the Washington bureaucracy that tends to the greedy rich at the expense of the truly needy .
That is the problem ; Rand Paul is the distraction .
Naldi told National Geographic : " When I was in the water with Rajan , I was really surprised by how fast he could move his legs to swim .
Most of the time he had his head under the water and used his long nose to breathe , like a submarine uses its periscope . "

These are probably on repeat while I work .

For example , “ This garage smells like an adolescent cliché dot com , ” or “ The waiter was really pushing the sausage last night dot com . ”
Yes , it is juvenile .
Anyway …
I could probably buy any one of these for her , you know for an anniversary present ; but who am I buying it from ?
Does GoDaddy.com own every combination of words or random letters and numbers that I can come up with ?
Fortunately , I have an intern , who needs workplace hours .
According to Intern Ben , if you were to going to purchase www.wipethelipstickoffthatmonkey.com prior to 1998 , you would have had to do so through the United States Department of Defense .
Great .
Why was I not surprised ?
They , apparently , contracted it out to the University of Southern California ’s Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) .
It ’s a little Big Brother - esque , but after I let that information marinade for a bit , it ’s pretty funny .
I like that somewhere the government has paperwork from its sale of www.hotdogsmakemehappy.com.
These days the United States Department of Commerce runs IANA through a non-profit called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) .
Not as ominous , I guess .
Is the Internet expensive to run ?
Are there Best Buy Geek Squad astronauts working on a satellite ?
Maybe they ’re in an underwater lab .
Also , where do the funds from the sale of www.sasquatchesinhighheels.org go ?

Craig Venter , who has been a prominent figure in genome research , has been using Science magazine as a host for updates on his latest project : building a bacterium that runs off a genome engineered for specific tasks .
As of early 2008 , his research group had managed to assemble the entire genome of a small bacterium in a yeast cell , starting with nothing but mail - order DNA .
At the time , it seemed like just a short step from there to having that DNA running a cell .
That short step took a year and a half , and there were some stumbles along the way .
For starters , the original bacterial genome that the team had assembled came from an extremely slow - growing strain , which complicated the process of growing out cells with the replacement genome .
So they switched to a related species , Mycoplasma capricolum .
M. capricolum turned out to have a defense system against foreign DNA based on a restriction enzyme that cut any DNA originating in yeast into small pieces ; the researchers eventually found the gene responsible and deleted it from the genome of the bacterium .
There were also issues with contamination from the yeast 's own linear chromosomes , which the authors found a clever solution for .
Instead of trying to separate huge DNA molecules out on a gel , they simply formed the gel around the DNA .
The fibers of the gel actually extended through the circular bacterial chromosome , trapping it in place so that when a current was applied , the yeast chromosomes flowed out of the gel , leaving purified bacterial DNA behind .
The last ( and perhaps most annoying ) problem they faced was an assembly error : their million - base artificial chromosome contained a single base deletion that just happened to reside in an essential gene called dnaA .
By gradually transferring smaller pieces of chromosome , they narrowed the problematic region of the genome down until they identified and corrected this issue .
With that fix , the authors were finally able to get the genome into a host cell , and have it replace the original one .
Ultimately , this is just another step on the way to a designer genome , one with a specific set of genes that rewire the bacterium 's metabolism to produce a specific biomolecule , digest a toxin , or something of that nature .
We 're still not there yet , although it seems likely that some of the solutions developed during this work will speed the process in the future .
Still , the number of things that went wrong here suggest that the synthetic genome approach wo n't necessarily be the quick - and - easy route to designer organisms that some have expected .

Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM
Lens Review
Welcome to the longest and perhaps the rarest full autofocus lens in the world - the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens .
Of all the lenses Canon has produced over the years , maybe none have the mystic and intrigue that the now discontinued 1200 L has .
So when B&H Photo called to invite me to review this lens , I of course said " Yes ! " .
To get started , here is a short B&H - produced video featuring the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens and B&H maven Zevi Slotkin .
The predecessor to the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens was the Canon FD 1200 mm f/5.6L manual focus lens .
The FD 1200 was first seen at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , CA , USA .
Chuck Westfall of Canon USA was there and remembers that " 5 copies of the original FD 1200 mm f/5.6L lens were brought to L.A. and used for newspaper , magazine and wire service coverage of the Olympic Games . "
Mr. Westfall indicated that " All of the FD mount 1200 mm f/5.6L lenses were eventually shipped back to Japan , and at some point in the late 1980s , they were converted to EF mount " resulting in the lens model I am reviewing here - the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens .
The new EF 1200 was then marketed by Canon in July , 1993 with an annual production volume of around 2 ( that 's right - " two " ) lenses .
The EF 1200 L was available by special order with lead times running about 18 months .
Why such a long lead time ?
For one reason , it takes nearly a year to grow fluorite crystals large enough to be ground and polished for use in this lens .
In addition , the lens is " virtually hand - made " .
According to Mr. Westfall , " Canon has not released specific production quantities , but according to my understanding , less than 100 of these lenses were made . "
Rumors put this number closer to 20 , but ... no one who knows is releasing the actual figure .
The price ?
If you need to ask ... you can't afford it .
The original price was 9,800,000 yen - that was MSRP $ 89,579 in the USA .
And " no discounts " according to Mr. Westfall .
The model I reviewed ( in excellent condition ) has a $ 120,000 price tag hanging on it .
That 's right - it costs more than a small house in the country .
The two standout features of this lens ( in addition to the price ) are the size / weight and the focal length .
Let 's start with size / weight .
At over 3 x the weight and nearly 2 x the length of Canon 's largest current production lenses , the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens is simply huge and heavy .
The 1200 L above is shown behind the itself very large Canon EF 800 mm f/5.6L IS USM Lens .
Even with this 1200 mm - size - reducing perspective from a 105 mm lens , the 1200 mm lens appears huge .
While one person can mount the 1200 L on a tripod , two people make the job significantly easier and far less risky .
Do n't even think about handholding this lens .
Even if you were strong enough to hold the lens up , the balance point of the tripod foot is too far away to reach for support purposes .
Holding behind this balance point makes the rig far too front - heavy to balance .
So , plan on needing a solid tripod .
The Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM
Lens is shown above with a Canon 1Ds Mark III DSLR mounted to it .
When the lens is this big , you mount the camera to the lens - not the lens to the camera . :)
The 1200 L above is mounted on a Manfrotto 516 Fluid Head and Gitzo GT5540LS Carbon Fiber Tripod .
Build quality is what you would expect from a Canon Super Telephoto Lens - it is solid .
This lens is bolted together like the rear end on a 1 - ton 4x4 .
Want to attract attention ?
This size and design of this lens invites it like no other .
Those foreground shadows above are not mine .
All lenses have a barrel , but this one adds a military rifle - like top handle .
Though very useful , it only makes this lens look more like a scrutiny - attracting weapon .
Are there always that many helicopters flying over the Hudson River in New York City ?
Or were they watching me ?
This lens will require a custom - sized camo Lens Coat for covert operations .
At least the helicopters provided good " Lens Food " ( subjects ) .
Though not too stressing on the AF system , these helicopters did provide decent AI Servo targets .
The 1200 L tracked these BIF ( Birds in Flight ) without a problem .
I was not planning for this shot and I should have used a slower shutter speed .
1/500 would have been a better choice to show blade motion blur .
The relatively fast shutter speed I was using was for the walking human model I was shooting at the time the helicopter came through .
AI Servo functioned well in this task as well .
The other standout feature I mentioned was the focal length .
1200 mm is really long .
The extremely narrow 2° 05 ' full frame angle of view is so narrow that this lens practically needs a finder scope .
Since the 1200 L is also compatible with the Canon Extender EF 1.4x II and the Extender EF 2x II , incredible focal lengths of 1680 mm ( f/8 max ) and 2400 mm ( f/11 max ) are obtainable .
While I had my extenders along , time did not permit testing with them .
The 1680 mm and 2400 mm focal lengths shown in the comparison below are simulated .
Let 's review some focal length comparisons .
To start , here is a loosely - cropped 800 mm full - body portrait and the 1200 mm equivalent .
Impressive .
This is not even a full body portrait at 1200 mm , but the subject is far beyond reasonable conversation distance .
I had to use hand signals to communicate with her on this windy day .
Our position for all of the photos found in this review was in Weehawken , NJ - directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan .
The distance directly across the Hudson River to the end of piers was about .8 mi and it was about 1.0 mi to closest building fronts .
Buildings 24 mm | 50 mm | 105 mm | 800 mm | 1200 mm | 1680 mm | 2400 mm
Two Cranes 50 mm | 800 mm | 1200 mm | 1680 mm | 2400 mm
Crane 24 mm | 50 mm | 1200 mm | 1680 mm | 2400 mm
Hopefully these comparisons start impressing upon you how narrow the field of view is from this lens - and this is from a full - frame body .
The 1200 L supports all EOS bodies which means an APS - C body such as the Canon EOS 50D or the Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D on the back of this lens would deliver an angle of view that is noticeably narrower yet .
Using a Canon EOS - 1Ds Mark III , faces were recognizable at distances up to a mile or more .
A higher density sensor such as that in the 50D or T1i should extend this distance to an even more incredible number .
But , subjects are not the only thing this lens magnifies .
Vibrations are one unwelcomed magnification .
With image stabilization enabled , the 800 mm viewfinder remains motionless during use .
In contrast , the non-IS 1200 mm L , with its very long physical and focal length and the long distance from the viewfinder to the tripod attachment point , provides a vibration - filled viewfinder .
I felt the need to rest my left hand over the tripod mount to stabilize the rig ( my normal super telephoto shooting position ) , but my arm did n't reach that far comfortably .
I settled on a mid-way position , but did n't feel at ease with my hold .
Dual tripods would be a great solution for a non-moving subject .
You will notice that I kept the ISO setting relatively high for most of my sample photos .
I did not have time to determine the minimum shutter speed necessary for sharp images , so I hedged with higher ISO settings and fast shutter speeds .
Images with high ISO noise can be used ( noise can be removed to some extent ) , but camera motion - blurred shots are typically useless .
From an image quality standpoint , the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens is a bit soft at f /5.6 .
Stopped down to f/8 , this lens is very sharp .
I did n't notice a significant difference in image quality between the center and the corners of the frame .
Stopping down to f/8 delivers a noticeably brighter image as vignetting is cleared up at this setting .
The image quality I found on close distance shots was not found on my distant shots .
Most troublesome for the 1200 L from a distant subject image quality standpoint are atmospheric conditions .
Haze , smog , smoke , thermal ( heat ) distortion ... all cause problems for these shots .
We had a beautiful Spring day for this review , but along with bright sunlight comes heat distortion .
This effect was very visible in all of my sample shots across the river .
The 800 L did not fare much better in this regard .
There is no noticeable optical distortion in images from this lens .
That was helpful for this review as the straight buildings in the city were unforgiving for lens distortion ( and rotational errors ) .
Two crystal fluorite lens elements ( 3rd & 6th ) ( the ones that take a year to grow ) are intended to eliminate the secondary spectrum .
Some CA ( Chromatic Aberration ) is present starting mid-way to the corners as seen below .
The 1200 L has an 8 blade aperture , but evaluating bokeh was not easy as everything not in focus is always a complete blur .
It looks great to me .
The Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens uses a Ring USM ( Ultrasonic Motor ) rear focusing system .
This is a electronic focus - by - wire design that works very well .
It is quiet and relatively fast .
Focus hunting can be an issue with this lens .
The shallow DOF means that focus must be adjusted to a relatively close - to - correct setting for the relatively small f/5.6 aperture to allow the camera and lens to quickly lock focus .
Helpful is that the 1200 L provides 3 focus distance range settings ( see switch below ) that allow focusing to be restricted to 14 - 30 m , 30 m - 8 and 14 m - 8 ( full range ) .
That 's right - MFD ( Minimum Focus Distance ) is 45.9 ' ( 14.0 m ) .
This lens will not work well in most back yards .
Visible below is the relatively small manual focus ring .
I prefer this ring to be positioned over the tripod mount where my left hand would typically rest , but as I said earlier , this position is not practical with this lens .
As I also mentioned , this is a focus - by - wire electronic focusing design - this requires the camera to be powered on for any focusing to function .
Power manual focusing is very smooth and can be adjusted to 3 different speeds ( see switch below ) - 1 is for fine focus control while 3 is for fast adjustment .
Like Canon 's current super telephoto lenses , the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens has a focus preset function for immediate focusing to a predetermined distance .
Like most collared lenses , the 1200 L rotates while tripod mounted .
What is unusual is that the tripod mount does not rotate - the rear of the lens rotates .
See the friction control knob above ?
It provides friction control over the rotating narrower rear portion of the lens .
It is a unique design that works well .
A provided 48 mm Drop - In Filter Holder can be seen on top of the rotating rear portion of the lens .
A 48 - mm Drop -in Circular Polarizing Filter is available .
The 1200 L's lens hood is a very convenient and easy to use built - in design that locks closed and stays open well - but does not lock open .
You will notice that the pics of the lens sitting vertically on the ground on this page all have the hood retracted .
While the hood locks tightly closed , it does not lock open strongly enough to support its own weight .
An open lens hood would of course have made the lens size appear even more impressive in these pics .
The 1200 L shipped in a strong , padded aluminum case .
The B&H model reviewed comes in an additional padded aluminum shipping case for additional protection .
The included lens cap / hood cover can be seen in the open case above .
It is similar in design to the other super - telephoto lens caps - well , not similar in size .
It fits completely over an adult head ( yes , I witnessed this antic ) .
Who owns this lens ?
The actual owners list is not large but is not publically known .
However , it is hard to use one of these lenses in public without being noticed - and becoming publically known .
Reported owners include Sports Illustrated ( owns two ) , Canon Professional Services ( owns two ) and National Geographic magazine .
Broad categories of owners include governments ( where this reviewed lens is rumored to have been sourced ) , law enforcement agencies , news and sports magazines , newspapers and wire services - and some wealthy individuals .
Some of the most likely candidates have the word " agency " in their name .
The next question is -
Why do they own the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens ?
When it is dangerous physically , dangerous to the goal ( covert operations ) or physically impossible to get closer to the subject , the 1200 L is the answer .
Based on the categories of owners listed above , the specific uses become apparent .
National Geographic ?
Wildlife .
When approaching any closer may disturb the subject , use a 1200 L. Sports Illustrated ?
Sports .
Shoot a baseball game from behind the outfield wall .
Shoot soccer and football mid and down - field action from behind the goal line .
Law enforcement and government ?
Covert surveillance .
Remember - people are recognizable up to a mile or more with this lens .
News agencies ?
Uses include war coverage and major event coverage that needs a unique angle ( such as of the Pope from behind and above a large crowd ) .
Of course , paparazzi and the infotainment industry fit in here somewhere .
Some specific uses shared by Chuck Westfall include coverage of the Waco Massacre in 1993 , various NASA space shuttle launches , Olympic games , Major League Baseball , World Cup soccer and Formula One motorsports .
I know that after reading this review , you think you need one of these lenses .
Being realistic , the Canon EF 800 mm f/5.6L IS USM Lens is going to be the better option for most people .
While obviously not as long in the focal length spec , the 800 is a better lens in most other aspects .
It is sharper wide open , focuses faster , is smaller and lighter - and the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens price makes the 800 L look like a bargain .
After using and pouring over the results from the 1200 L , the striking attributes remain the size , focal length - and price .
For those with unique needs ( including differentiation in the marketplace ) , deep pockets and / or interest in the collector value of this lens , B&H 's world renowned used department has an excellent condition Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6L USM Lens available at the time of this review .
" By virtue of acquiring and offering not one but two of these rare 1200 mm lenses within a year , B&H Photo , Video , Pro Audio once again loudly proclaims its dominance as the world leader and most trusted name in Photo , Video , Pro Audio and Electronics and the leader in providing a fair and honest marketplace for used products in the aforementioned categories to both buyer and seller alike be they Professional , Prosumer or Consumer .

Here are some pictures of Beignet the blind and epileptic blue heeler swimming and canoeing with her awesome mama Miriam !
awwww …
Beignet came to us from a shelter in Pensacola , FL .
She had a huge scar on her leg and walked funny .
She was also blind , though there did n’t seem to be anything wrong with her eyes .
One day Beignet had a full - on epileptic seizure .
They kept happening so we had to put her on medicine to control them .
Beignet got adopted , then almost a year later those people did n’t like her any more and returned her to me .
I had her for a long time and it looked like nobody was going to adopt her .
Then , Miriam came along and she and Beignet have been best pals ever since !
And OMG , post on your FB how many inches of cleavage you 'll show but DON'T TELL THE MEN!1 !
HAHA

I get the point and all , but ..
No thank you .
I 'm kind of all about keeping my tits , ass and other assorted softbits out of politics , not using them to prove some point that should 've been ignored from the start .

Lost may have given us more answers than Battlestar Galactica , but that does n't mean the plane - crash - into - destiny show is off the hook .
Here are 50 questions that Lost really does have to answer , or we 'll attack the ABC studios with pitchforks .

If you think of Lost as being one big novel — which is what various people involved with the show have called it — then the stuff that happened in Chapter Five ought to be meaningful in the final chapter .
There ought to be a sense that everything was leading towards this ending — or else it 's not an ending , it 's just a sudden stop .
So there are things that were talked up in previous seasons of the show that we really believe should be incorporated , somehow , into the conclusion .
Think of it as not just a question of " answers , " but of resolution .
Why did all this stuff have to happen ?
Advertisement
Do n't believe the show owes us some answers ?
Just ask the show 's stars :
So here are our pressing questions :
So the island is the place with the glowy light that 's inside all of us .
Does this mean the Island 's alive ?
People talk about what the island " wants . "
What do they mean ?
Is the island Eywa ?

How come the island heals people ?
Why does it heal them selectively ?
Who was the woman who raised Jacob and the Man In Black , and how did she get there ?

If Jacob was a Roman , why is he so into Egyptian gods ?
What was with those Egyptian symbols that appeared in the Hatch when the countdown went past 108 minutes ?
That did n't seem like the Dharma Initiative 's style .

Jacob told Alpert some previous visitors to the island had built that Taweret statue .
Did he tell them to build it ?
Why Taweret ?

Is Jacob bringing people to the island , as the Man In Black suggests ?
If so , then who was bringing all those people to the island before Jacob did it ?
Why does Jacob want to bring so many people to the island ?
What was he trying to prove to the Man In Black ?
Why did Widmore bring Desmond to the island ?
What 's the sacrifice Desmond has to make ?

No , really .
They made a big deal out of it and everything .

Jacob was immortal , right ?
So what made him decide he needed to start doing such a huge head - hunting search for his replacement ?
Why is Aaron so important ?
Why was n't Kate supposed to raise him ?
Why is n't Kate a candidate ?
What was the Dharma Initiative really up to on the Island ?
What was their ultimate goal ?
Why did the Hanso Foundation regard the Dharma Initiative as a failure ?
Advertisement
It seems like everyone who was a passenger on Oceanic 815 has numerous connections that they do n't even know about .
Like Jack and Claire being half - siblings , and Sawyer 's ex-girlfriend helping Kate confront her mom .
What caused this excessive degree of synchronicity ?

What really happens if the Smoke Monster leaves the island ?
In the " flash - sideways " universe , the island is under water .
When exactly did this happen ?

How / when did Roger Linus and Pierre Chang get off the island before it sank ?

Why did Ben and Widmore hate each other quite so much ?
Why could n't Ben just shoot Widmore in the face that one time when Ben came into Widmore 's bedroom ?
Why did Widmore order Keamy 's gang to kill everyone on the island except for Ben ?
Especially since Widmore is so keen for Locke to lead the Oceanic Six back to the island a few years later .
And why exactly is Widmore so keen for the Oceanic Six to come back to the island ?
Because they 're Candidates ?
Or some other reason ?
If he is keen for there to be Candidates on the island , why did he order Keamy to kill them all ?
Advertisement
After Richard Alpert met Jacob and Jacob explained the island to him , why did n't Richard repeat that explanation to everyone he met ?
How did Richard and the Others decide whom to recruit from among the various people who came to the island after that ?
What was the deal with all those lists ?
The lists were n't lists of Candidates , since the Others did n't try to recruit Sawyer or Jack .
So what were they ?

Why did the Incident in 1977 leave the island 's women unable to give birth ?
What 's with the huge importance placed on fertility on the island , what with the Tawaret statue ?
Why are so many women separated from their babies ?
So why was Widmore unable to return to the island ?
And then why was he able to return to the island after all ?
Also , why did turning the donkey wheel mean that Ben was unable to return to the island , except with the Oceanic Six ?

What was the deal with that brand on Juliet 's lower back ?
The cross / asterisk thing ?

Did the Others put it there as part of their fake village ?
Was Rousseau " claimed " by the Smoke Monster the same way Claire and Sayid were ?
What was the Sickness that the Dharma Initiative was vaccinating people against ?
Is it similar to the Smoke Monster " claiming " people , or something else ?

When the Smoke Monster told Sayid that he could have Nadia back from the dead , was he referring to the " flash sideways " universe , or something else ?
Or just lying ?

So if the hydrogen bomb going off caused the " flash sideways " universe and prevented Oceanic 815 from crashing , how did it change Hurley 's lottery numbers , or make Sawyer a cop instead of a con-man ?
Is Ji Yeon the " Kwon " who 's a candidate ?
Who 's the mother of Jack 's son David in the " flash - sideways " universe ?
On a related note , where 's alt - Juliet ?

What happened to the body of Christian Shephard on the " flash - sideways " Flight 815 ?
Advertisement
Come to think of it , what happened to Christian 's body on the island ?
Sayid was " claimed " by the Smoke Monster , but he still had free will afterward .
What did that being " claimed " thing mean anyway ?
Advertisement
What does god need with a starship ?
I mean , why does Locke need an airplane to leave the island ?
Why are the Numbers so important ?
I get that each of the Numbers corresponds to one of the remaining Candidates as of a while ago .
But that 's just another instance of the Numbers popping up in relation to something .
Why these numbers ?
Why were they powerful long before Jack , Hurley , et al. came to the island ?
Advertisement
And come to think of it , what was the point of having someone broadcasting the numbers over the radio over and over again for years ?
If Jacob is dead , and his ghost is wandering around talking to Hurley , what 's with the little kid version of Jacob ?
Why can only certain people , like Sawyer , see the little - kid Jacob ?

Who was Juliet inviting to coffee ?
What sort of coffee ?
Can I come ?
Will there be biscotti , or madeleines ?
Why can't the Smoke Monster cross a line of ash ?
What about the sonic fence ?
So the Man In Black can't leave the island .
But Jacob was wandering off the island all the time , buying Louis Vuitton luggage , touching the Oceanic Six and various other people , and stocking up on Flannery O'Connor books .
At one point , Jacob opened a dance studio in Newark .
What gives ?

When Ben took Locke to Jacob's Cabin , there was a weird telekinetic storm and Locke heard a voice saying " Help me . "
Was that Jacob ?

Introduction
It has been a little over two weeks since the final code for Ubuntu 10.04 , codenamed Lucid Lynx hit the Internet .
Last time , I had to wait a month before getting into 9.10 , due to heinous errors , crippling bugs , and excruciatingly slow software repositories .
Thankfully , none of this occurred with 10.04 .
And it should n't .
You see , Ubuntu 10.04 carries the LTS acronym , which stands for Long Term Support .
Every six months , a new version of Ubuntu is released into the wild , but it 's only once every two years that we get to see an LTS .
The last LTS release was in April of 2008 , when Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron made its debut .
These releases are especially important because this can make or break Ubuntu for OEM sales .
Hardware partners , who could potentially sell systems with the OS pre-installed , will be looking to the LTS release as a benchmark for both quality and stability .
Developers , too , will be paying close attention .
Creating compatible software for Ubuntu should be much easier , and more likely to happen on the longer release cycle .
This review is more personal for me because it was 8.04 that made me an Ubuntu convert and a full - time Linux user .
Before that , I was only a visitor , tinkering with various RPM distributions like Mandriva and Red Hat .
I used Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10 briefly , but I always came back to the familiarity of a KDE / RPM distro .
This all changed with the rock - solid release of Hardy Heron .
So , with this in mind , I decided to take a look at how far Ubuntu has come since the last LTS release .
Along with the standard review of Ubuntu 10.04 , in requisite Tom's Hardware fashion , we 've put the Lucid Lynx in a no holds barred cage match against the Hardy Heron .
We 'll determine whether the OS has become bloated over the past two years , or if performance has streamlined .
Does Canonical have another ' Karmic Katastrophe ' on its hands , or is Lucid Lynx a runaway hit ?
Read on to find out .

May 10 , 2010 -- Did you hear the one about the election everyone lost ?
On May 6 , 2010 , Labour the party in power lost 100 seats and with it the chance to continue in government after 13 years .
The Conservatives lost the victory all the polls had been promising them for the past 18 months .
The Liberals suffered perhaps the most devastating humiliation after Cleggmania turned out to be a complete and utter mirage .
The man who apparently wowed us so much in the great TV leadership debates actually lost a significant number of seats rather than gaining any .
The Scottish Nationalist Party ( SNP ) also lost seats .
Instead of going from seven to 20 as SNP leader Alex Salmond confidently predicted they actually went back to six .
Scottish Socialist Party ( SSP ) candidates lost all their deposits .
We averaged around 1 % of the votes cast , which was just as we expected , but the increase in Labour 's vote in Scotland was not anticipated !
Mind you to all intents and purposes " Scotland is a foreign land " for Westminster elections .
For one thing there was no swing to the Tories [ Conservative Party ] whatsoever .
For another the " grate " TV leadership debates were largely irrelevant here since so much of what was discussed did n't apply to us .
The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood retains responsibility for most of the things the Conservatives ' David Cameron , Labour 's Gordon Brown and the Liberal Democrats ' Nick Clegg argued over -- health , education , criminal justice , transport .
Working people lost out most
The people who lost out most however were undoubtedly working people , as usual .
The neoliberal warmongering Westminster parties concocted a deal ahead of the election not to spell out what £ 100 billion of cuts in lifeline services looks like for working people .
They ignored the very real concerns of the unemployed -- with unemployment at a 16 - year high .
They ignored the plight of the poor -- with income inequality now wider than at any time since records began in 1961 .
Since all three parties stand for the same thing there was no mention of the fact 77 % of working people are opposed to the ongoing occupation and slaughter in Afghanistan .
The overwhelming conclusion the 2010 general election pointed up in Scotland was the revulsion there is at the thought of a Tory government being returned .
" Nice Boy Dave " Cameron has been rumbled .
With his odious remarks on public services and cuts , immigration and withdrawing benefits from the jobless his mask slipped badly in the course of the campaign and his vile Thatcherite soul was exposed .
Tactical voting was employed across Scotland with the candidate most likely to stop a Tory gain seeing their majorities rise .
This was evident in Labour seats certainly , but also in SNP seats like Perth where Pete Wishart 's majority more than doubled as Labour voters opted for him as the optimum anti-Tory vehicle .
Chancellor Alastair Darling , the man at the helm during the worst economic collapse in 80 years , saw his majority over the Tories double in Edinburgh South West .
This was the seat I contested on behalf of the SSP .
To be honest I had anticipated the charge that standing against him might " let the Tories in " but it was never mentioned once .
Had it arisen I had a response prepared : " Which Tory did you mean like ? "
SSP campaign
We had a thoroughly enjoyable campaign with four weeks of active politicking , holding five public meetings in various parts of the constituency on our opposition to the cuts and the occupation of Afghanistan .
More than 30 new people signed up to join the party .
More than 75,000 SSP election leaflets were delivered door to door .
The four hustings attracted nearly 700 people between them .
Mind you , taken collectively they were a mixed bag .
No one at all turned up to [ one ] event while 500 people packed into a church in Juniper Green to attend the Question Time arranged jointly by three local community councils .
The SSP was widely regarded to have won the debate , however the audience were in the main " dyed in the wool Tories " .
The canvassing we conducted in Stenhouse provided us with very important intelligence about what people think of the SSP , our strengths and weaknesses .
Chief among the criticisms were a sense that we are unrealistic about what we can achieve and we lack the strength to deliver on what we promise .
On the other hand voters we talked to were full of admiration for our commitment to working people and the interests of the poorest in society .
Our irrepressible resilience in the face of the dreadful events of recent years was also greatly admired .
As far as the result of the general election is concerned I think all the possible outcomes look unstable ...
Meanwhile the SSP will continue campaigning against the economic injustice behind the cuts and the ongoing military repression in Afghanistan .
These issues may have not been discussed much by the myopic media these past five weeks but they remain the most important features of politics in Scotland today .

Many congratulations to Caroline Lucas
May 11 , 2010 -- James Mackenzie has rightly been in touch via this blog to remind me that there was in fact one spectaular winner in the May 6 British general election and that was Caroline Lucas , the leader of the Greens who secured a famous victory in Brighton Pavilion .
I am happy to stand corrected .
I am a big admirer of Caroline and her victory in a first - past - the - post election is a huge achievement .
Her victory is even more impressive in that she defeated Labour in a seat where people would be very keen to keep out the Tories .
Brighton Pavilion is a seat I know well .
I visited the area many times on political work when I lived in London .
The election of Britain 's first Green MP , and an excellent " red green " at that , is terrific and a fitting reward for the many , many years of hard work by Green Party activists .
There are already several Green councillors in the city .
I have made amends James by emailing Caroline today to offer her my congratulations on behalf of the SSP .
[ Colin Fox is Scottish Socialist Party co-spokesperson , former member of the Scottish Parliament for the Lothian .
A founder member of the SSP he has been an active militant for about 30 years .

The Obama administration had been reluctant to allow such an expansion of nontraditional military activities in countries where the U.S. formally has no presence .
That practice was unfavorably associated with the Bush - Cheney administration 's disregard for international norms .
But political imperatives , the threat of terrorism , and the knowledge of what the U.S. military can accomplish if its strings are cut away has slowly changed the minds of some of Obama 's senior advisers .
It is helpful that Congress has generally given the military a wide berth to conduct activities that intelligence agency paramilitaries would find objectionable .
The authorization to write the orders allow combatant commanders to put together task forces for almost any purpose , and draw from almost any existing military unit .
JUWTFs are not classified and are in regular use .
But until last summer , they tended to be formed for temporary and limited purposes .
Even during the Bush administration , the military did not insert American personnel into Iran , which is what the Avocado execute order now permits .
Not surprisingly , the larger counter - terrorism task forces tend to be full of operators from the clandestine Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , as well as contractors from companies like L3 .
But JSOC is not the executive authority for these missions , as one might suspect .
Rather , the commanders , like CENTCOM 's Petraeus , have direct authority .
Military commanders began to circulate drafts of the secret orders in the summer of 2009 , a few months after U.S. Navy SEALS rescued sailors aboard the hijacked marine vessel the Maersk Alabama off the coast of Somalia .
At the time , news reports suggested that the SEALS were mobilized from a base in the United States .
But that was false .
The SEALS , part of the fabled DevGru special mission unit , or SEAL Team Six , were 45 minutes away at an operational base in Manda Bay , a resort beach town in Kenya .
That operation , and the delay in standing up the SEALS , laid the groundwork , officials said , for a series of meetings involving senior counter - terrorism and intelligence officials , about the possibility for a coordinated worldwide unleashing of U.S. military assets .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , at the time the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , advised President Obama to allow combatant commanders more latitude to combat terrorism using task forces .
Coming from McChrystal , it was a surprising endorsement of a policy that would shift responsibility for unconventional warfare from JSOC , which he had commanded , to the combatant commanders .
In September , two task forces of American commandos surveilled and killed two top Al Qaeda operatives in Somalia , even though they had the opportunity to capture and imprison the two men .
The authority to execute the terrorists was given to the commander of one of the squadrons .
A task force operating in Yemen has helped Yemeni forces kill terrorism suspects , but it has also carried out unilateral operations .
It 's upfront week when television networks show potential advertisers what they can expect for the fall season .
ABC announced it 's new lineup and CBS axed a slew of shows .
Let the carnage commence !
Before we get to the births , let 's address the deaths .
CBS got rid of seven of their shows : Cold Case , Ghost Whisperer , Numbers ( which has a digit in the title somewhere , but now that it 's gone we do n't care anymore ) , Miami Medical , Accidentally on Purpose , Gary Unmarried , and New Adventures of Old Christine ( sad ) .
CBS will make its official presentation and introduce its new schedule tomorrow , so we 'll see what things get slotted into the empty spaces on the roster .
ABC unveiled 10 new shows today , including seven programs which will start this fall .
( The rest will be mid-season replacements ) .
The while schedule is here .
Joining in mid-season will be medical drama
Off the Map , the hotly - anticipated Matthew Perry comedy Mr. Sunshine , and relationship dramedy Happy Endings .
Let 's start making fun of all this new fare , shall we ?
Mr. Sunshine

Also , this looks depressing with a capital D-etroit .
Body of Proof
What 's It About : Quincy , but with a lady .
Big Names Involved : Dana Delaney ( and Sonja Sohn from The Wire ! ) .
Will It Be Good :

Please ?
SOLAR power has become an unlovely adolescent .
It used to be a sweet little thing , shiny and new and full of promise .
One day it will doubtless grow into a solid citizen , quite possibly a person of substance .
At the moment it is stuck in between ; no longer a child to be coddled and pampered , but not yet able to pay its own way .
This presents a challenge both for the governments who want to see it grow up big and strong , and the companies that have been making money out of its progress to date .
No one doubts that it will continue to grow ; the question is who will suffer most from the growing pains .
Solar energy is popular because it is clean and abundant .
The problem is that it remains expensive .
According to recent calculations by the International Energy Agency , power from photovoltaic systems ( solar cells ) costs $ 200 -600 a megawatt - hour , depending on the efficiency of the installation and the discount rate applied to future output .
That compares with $ 50 - 70 per MWh for onshore wind power in America , by the IEA 's reckoning , and even lower prices for power from fossil fuels , unless taxes on greenhouse - gas emissions are included .
The costs of solar are dropping ; in some sunny places it may , in a few years , be possible to get solar electricity as cheaply from a set of panels as from the grid , and later on for solar to compete with conventional ways of putting electricity into the grid .
But for the moment there would be no significant market for solar cells were it not for government subsidies .
Given that there are subsidies of various sorts in various places , some of which have been very generous , there is a market , and a fast - growing one .
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance , a research firm , there will be demand for 10.5 gigawatts of new photovoltaic - energy systems in 2010 , up from just 1.7GW in 2006 .
The consistent engine of growth over those four years has been Germany 's feed - in tariffs , a guaranteed price for solar power that makes every panel installed in the country a profitable investment , at the expense of electricity consumers .
For a fair part of that time , global supply was only just keeping up with demand , and prices for solar modules — the assemblies of cells that you might put on a roof , in a field or on a patch of desert — stayed fairly stable .
Last year , though , prices began to drop .
One reason for this is that the supply of silicon , from which most photovoltaic cells are made , has increased .
Another is that more and more Chinese companies with low costs are coming into the market .
When the California Solar Initiative , a scheme for getting solar panels onto roofs , got under way in 2007 , just 2 % of the modules used were Chinese .
In the fourth quarter of 2009 , according to Nathaniel Bullard of New Energy Finance , the figure was 46 % .
Yingli Solar , a Chinese manufacturer which has been making cells for less than a decade , expects to ship a gigawatt 's worth in the coming year .
The lower the price of a module , the more attractive a feed - in tariff looks .
As prices came down , installations of solar cells in Germany shot up .
The country accounted for roughly half of new installations around the world last year .
As a result , the feed - in tariff has been reduced , and will be reduced again this summer , dampening demand and favouring low - cost producers .
Q - Cells , Germany 's largest wafer manufacturer ( the wafer is the step between the refined silicon and the finished solar cell ) has seen its market value drop by half over the past year .
Margins for cell producers seem to have fallen even more dramatically .
An increasing number are outsourcing production to China .
Some companies , such as Germany 's SolarWorld , which does everything from refining silicon to installing panels , have respected brands that allow a bit of premium pricing .
But for most , solar panels are more or less a commodity , which favours big producers with access to cheap capital .
“ Cost of capital is now king , ” says B.J. Stanbery , an industry veteran who founded a novel solar - cell manufacturer called HelioVolt .
The king seems to live in China .
According to Mark Pinto , corporate technology officer of Applied Materials , which is the biggest supplier of machines to make solar cells , half of the world 's production capacity is already in China .
Manufacturing capacity , he says , will grow faster than his company had expected this year , and two - thirds of the growth will be in China .
The company has just opened a new research and development centre in Xi'an .
Cheaper panels have led to a renewed interest in power - plant - sized installations .
When Spain introduced a generous feed - in tariff in 2007 it triggered the first boom in these “ utility - scale ” projects , with two gigawatts installed before the blindsided government capped the tariff .
Since then the utility market has slumbered , but if cells are cheap it does not take much to make stacking them up in the sun look attractive .
When that happens , as Spain 's example shows , it can be done quickly .
The company with the largest utility - scale pipeline is First Solar , one of the pioneers of what are called “ thin - film ” cells .
These use less silicon than their thicker cousins , or none at all , and can be cheaper to make , but they are often less efficient ; better for deserts , or sunny lots on the edge of town , than for roofs where the area available is limited .
First Solar 's panels , which use cadmium telluride instead of silicon , cost less than a dollar a watt to make , which makes them cheaper than any silicon - based rivals .
Its output is about a gigawatt a year .
Last year it signed a deal to start manufacturing in China and entered Forbes magazine 's list of fast - growing tech companies in the top slot .
But some hedge funds have been shorting First Solar on the basis that plummeting prices for normal cells will undermine its advantage .
It is also possible that it will be leapfrogged .
There are various start - ups looking to make even cheaper thin films , such as Nanosolar , in California , and HelioVolt , though they have yet to show that they can reliably produce efficient cells on a large scale .
Mr Stanbery says that now First Solar has proved the disruptive capability of such approaches , larger companies looking to enter the solar business are interested — and leading makers of silicon cells , preferring to disrupt than be disrupted , are hoping to add similar technology to their portfolios .
The utility market also serves to highlight the flaws and expense of solar power .
A typical utility - scale installation produces power at only a fifth of its maximum capacity , thanks to clouds , night - time , dirty panels and so on .
To replace a one - gigawatt coal plant running at 70 % of capacity with solar panels would require about half of the 6GW installed worldwide last year .
This is one of the arguments for looking instead at another solar technology , solar thermal , which uses mirrors to concentrate heat , produce steam and thus drive turbines .
Efficient solar - thermal plants can in principle be built on the same sort of scale as gas - fired power stations , a few hundred megawatts at a time .
Such big plants are harder to finance than small photovoltaic installations , and require more planning permissions and infrastructure , such as transmission lines .
But they produce a lot of power .
Brightsource Energy , based in California , recently received government loan guarantees for a project in the Mojave desert which , if completed , could deliver more power than all the photovoltaic cells installed in America last year .

MICHELLE
Dawson can’t handle crowded bus journeys , and she struggles to order a cup of coffee in a restaurant because contact with strangers makes her feel panicky .
Yet over the past few years , Dawson has been making a name for herself as a researcher at the Rivière - des - Prairies hospital , part of the University of Montreal in Canada .
Dawson ’s field of research is the cognitive abilities of people with autism – people such as herself .
She is one of a cadre of scientists who say that current definitions of this condition rely on findings that are outdated , if not downright misleading , and that the nature of autism has been fundamentally misunderstood for the past 70 years .
Medical textbooks tell us that autism is a developmental disability diagnosed by a classic “ triad of impairments ” : in communication , imagination and social interaction .
While the condition varies in severity , about three - quarters of people with autism are classed , in the official language of psychiatrists , as mentally retarded .
Over the past decade or so , a growing autistic pride movement has been pushing the idea that people with autism are n’t disabled , they just think differently to “ neurotypicals ” .
Now , research by Dawson and others has carried this concept a step further .
They say that auties , as some people with autism call themselves , do n’t merely think differently : in certain ways they think better .
Call it the autie advantage .
How can a group of people who are generally seen as disabled actually have cognitive advantages ?
For a start , research is challenging the original studies that apparently demonstrated the low IQ of people with autism .
Other studies are revealing …
The seller , who lives south of Perth , then received a fake PayPal email falsely confirming the funds had been deposited .
The scammer then asked the seller to help them by paying shipping charges and customs duty .
The victim received fake Nigerian Customs forms and phony PayPal emails again confirming the additional freight money had been deposited by the buyer .
Suspecting a scam , the woman called Consumer Protection which told her to stop dealing with the fraudsters .
Upon forwarding this email to the scammers , she then received fake emails back from them featuring WA ScamNet and WA government logos , which advised her to co-operate with Nigerian authorities .
Commissioner for Consumer Protection Anne Driscoll said she was alarmed that overseas scammers were becoming more professional and determined .
" It 's a major concern that phony emails purporting to be from Consumer Protection 's WA ScamNet service were used in this scam , " Ms Driscoll said .
" These criminals will stop at nothing to fleece online buyers and sellers of their money , including impersonating government officials in fake emails , and it 's almost impossible for the money to be recovered once transferred . "
The hoax escalated when the woman received a phony eBay email saying the case had been reported to Nigerian Police who then emailed her to say that the fraudster had been arrested .
Later , the fake police email told her that the courts and president of Nigeria had awarded her compensation amounting to $ US250,000 ( $ 278,000 ) .
" We are putting in all efforts to erase the bad name given to this great country of ours , " the scammers , posing as Nigerian police , wrote in the email .
" The President is making sure that victims of fraud are compensated . "
A false document supposedly from the Nigerian Central Bank was then received , confirming the money was awaiting transfer to the woman 's bank account .
However , she had to pay a transfer fee of about $ US7000 ( $ 7800 ) before the money could be released .
After losing about $ 8700 in total , the single mother took her case to Consumer Protection offices in Perth and was told she had been conned .
She told Consumer Protection staff she felt " violated " by the scam .
" If we go on eBay again , I 'm not selling anything to overseas , " she said .

" This is our first time and it 's my last time .
" Never again , never again . "
For the second time this year , religion is taking center stage in another custody battle being waged in Chicago 's courts .
Laura Derbigney of Chicago has found herself in the middle of a custody battle between her Catholic husband and his Jewish ex-wife over how their 7 - year - old son is cared for during paternal visits .
A court order restricts Laura Derbigney and her husband , Nelson , from driving the boy in a car , allowing him to use electronics or to be fed pork and other foods as outlined in Orthodox Judaism .
" I truly feel it 's an intrustion on my home life , " she said from her attorney 's office Monday .
" That I have to now obey certain aspects of being kosher and following Sabbath in order for my husband and I to see his son , is wrong . "
The boy 's biological mother also asked Derbigney that the boy's food be purchased at a certain grocery store , claiming the boy was fed non -kosher hot dogs during visits with his dad .
" I have to purchase certain products .
I prefer minority - owned stores .
I 'm Hispanic and Catholic .
I make enchiladas .
Flautas .
Now I 'm being ridiculed for making food I grew up with , " she explained .
" I thought there was a differenct between church and state .
Because she 's a Hasidic jew , I have to live live as Hasidic jew too ? "
Her attorney , Joel Brodsky , says the court is out of line .
Brodsky , who earlier this year won a similar religious case , said the First Amendment right to live according to your own religious beliefs is being thrown out the door with the temporary restriction .
" Just because you 're divorced , the court can't say how to live your lives or what grocery store you can go to , " Brodsky said .
" The next step is going to be a Muslim father with custody .
During the next visitation , is the mother going to have to wear a burka ?
That 's where we 're heading .
Divorce courts have to stop getting in the way of religion . "
A gag order prevents the boy 's biological mother and father from speaking to the media about the case .

Status of SCN 1/11/2014 -
It has been over a year since I did any real updates to the pages of Starship Combat News so you might be wondering what is up .
I started SCN back in 1999 on an only Homestead shared website and it grew from there as this small niche within a niche of interests found a place to put all of the news and links about spaceship games .
While I am still interested in this topic , I have other interests too and I started spending more time with those and SCN updates began to slip , to the point that in December of 2012 I made the last updates to SCN and have not since .
After 13 years or so I was burned out .
So what does the future hold ?
Sometimes I thing I might want to buckle down and spend a week 's worth of free time researching and updating everything I can but I have n't yet .
I thing a format chance of the whole site from static pages to a WordPress based article driven format could make it easier to keep everything updated - but I do n't know WordPress well enough to do that .
So if anyone out there wants to help with that , let me know .
One thing that will stay is the SCN Forum .
You might not get news articles but people will post about new games , miniatures , rumors and much more .
It might not be organized like it is here but you can still get your news fix if you need it .
Thanks to all of you readers out there .
It was very cool for me to really learn what this internet thing could do by connecting to other people who liked this same niche of gaming .
Do these miniatures work with those ?
3/27/2012 - I have often heard that question , does this line of ship miniatures work with this other line from another manufacturer ?
To help out , I am compiling actual miniature sizes on a reference page so gamers can tell if miniatures are in scale with each other .
This Scale page will help you determine if your preferred fleets are Fleet scale or Squadron scale an then if this new cool line of minis will work with your other fleets .
I do have a few gaps though so if you have some fleets that currently do n't have entries , then link over to the SCN discussion on the Scale page and add what you can .

Citigroup :
No fat fingers here
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Citigroup denied on Friday the " rumors " that one of its traders caused Thursday 's stock market landslide by pressing the wrong key because of a fat finger .
The rumors suggested that the trader hit a " b " key , representing the sale of a billion shares , instead of an " m " key for million .
" As we have said , based on our review , rumors about a trading error by Citi are unfounded , " said Citigroup , in a press statement .
" It is troubling that inaccurate and unfounded rumors were spread as far as they were . "
With this statement , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) hopes to absolve itself of blame for the extreme market volatility that occurred on Thursday .
The Dow went on a wild ride , making a historic plunge of nearly 1,000 points before partially recovering to close down 348 .
A fat - fingered trader may not be to blame , but what did happen is still being investigated .
As a result , Nasdaq said it would negate trading on 296 stocks that plunged at least 60 % between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Thursday .
While those stocks will have their share prices pushed back up as a result , owners of other stocks that experienced less than 60 % declines , such as Procter and Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) , 3M ( MMM , Fortune 500 ) and Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , are caught holding the bag .
Their losses were steep , ranging from 21.5 % to 37 % , but not steep enough to have their slates swept clean .
The Citigroup " rumors " generated plenty of Internet banter and mockery -- with some people evoking a famous episode on " The Simpsons " where Homer 's fingers are too fat to dial a phone properly .
In the episode , an automatic phone message tells Homer , " The fingers you have used to dial are too fat .
To obtain a special dialing wand please mash the keypad with your palm now . "
The Nasdaq and Duncan Niederauer , chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange , also denied that the stock slide was caused by a market glitch .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) introduced bipartisan legislation called the “ War Is Making You Poor Act , ” which aims to call attention to a ) how much money is being spent to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and b ) how budget gimmicks are used to pay for them .
Grayson ’s legislation would slash the $ 159 billion request for supplemental war funding and use that money to deliver a tax break for all Americans .
Grayson demands the Pentagon use its currently existing $ 549 billion defense budget to fight the wars .
Speaking on the House floor today , Grayson underscored that the point of his legislation is to highlight the costs of the wars :
GRAYSON : So I believe that the thing we need to do is to take that $ 159 billion that the President has set aside – we ’re not saying he has to stop the war , we ’re not giving a cut - off date for the war – we ’re simply saying you need to fund that out of the base budget of $ 549 billion .
And we take 90 percent of that and give it back to the American people .
And I think most people would be surprised to learn that that is so much money that we ’ve been spending on the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq that every single taxpayer in America will be get his first or her first $ 35,000 of income completely tax free .
Grayson ’s bill , which is currently being co-sponsored by Reps. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , Walter Jones ( R-NC ) , Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) , John Conyers ( D - MI ) , and Lynn Woolsey ( D - CA ) , would also cut the federal deficit by $ 15.9 billion .
“ There is no longer any need to go beyond the exorbitant base defense budget , ” Grayson said .
“ It is not necessary .
Enough is enough . ”

Pregnant teenager watched torture of boyfriend who was then murdered
Sadistic : Pregnant Chelsea Platt lured boyfriend Martin
Hyde into the clutches of two thugs
A former football star was tortured and murdered after his pregnant girlfriend set him up to be attacked by two thugs so she could watch the savage beating for pleasure .
Chelsea Platt , 18 , despised Martin Hyde , 22 , and enjoyed seeing him bullied and humiliated .
When Mr Hyde got caught up in a petty row over £ 15 , sadistic Platt lured her lover into the clutches of two thugs who ambushed him as he followed her down the street .
Platt later watched unfazed as Mr Hyde was viciously assaulted at her own flat during a two hour beating during which his killers shouted : ' I want a spade so we can watch him dig his own grave and put him in it . '
The victim - who played trials for Stockport County - was eventually frogmarched to a country park where he was battered to death , stabbed in the back and neck with what was believed to be a chisel and thrown into a river .
The body of the victim who had suffered 72 injuries was later found floating in the water by dog walkers .
On the day of the killing Platt had sent a message to one of the killers on her Facebook page saying : ' Are U getting Martin 2 Day X . '
In the months prior to the murder , Platt also sent bullying messages to Mr Hyde on Facebook , one saying : ' My two - year - old nephew is more of a man than you ' .
Another message read : ' You need to die really badly because no one likes you . '
At Manchester Crown Court a judge condemned Platt 's ' haunting and casual approach to violence ' as he jailed her for four years after she admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm .
James Dellaway , 24 , and Jason Hughes , 28 , pleaded guilty to murder and were each jailed for life with a recommendation they each serve 25 years and 73 days .
Judge Mr Justice Ernest Ryder told Platt who is due to give birth to Mr Hyde 's child in just one month 's time said : ' You are a reprehensible amoral facilitator of casual violence .
' You admit setting up Martin Hyde knowing he would be beaten up .
It was something you had done before on many occasions .
Brutal : James Dellaway , left , and Jason Hughes , right , pleaded guilty to murder and were each jailed for life for the savage killing of Martin Hyde
' It is almost inexplicable despicable behaviour .
You did not nothing to stop this orgy of violence that was occurring in front of you . '
He added : ' This was a crime of the gravest severity against a defenceless vulnerable man who was a talented footballer and who was described as someone who would n't hurt a fly .
' This society and this court views the actions of those responsible with the utmost revulsion .
' It was sadistic bullying and the background described a haunting and casual approach to violence that is all to prevalent .
' There was a despicable history of bullying of Martin Hyde and there have been acts of depravity towards him . '
Mr Hyde was murdered last November after a row over £ 15 , which he owed to Dellaway 's girlfriend Lindsay Dunn for board and lodgings at her flat in Stockport .
When the victim realised he had no money to pay , Hughes and Dellaway turned up and threatened him with violence .
Within three days the two thugs had grabbed Mr Hyde outside a council drop in centre , beat him up inside a phone box then later attacked him again behind a church .
Hughes said : ' If you do n't get me the f****** money I will put you six feet under .'
Mr Hyde went to a police station but left without being seen by an officer .
On November 6 , Mr Hyde and Platt were in Stockport town centre when he saw his tormentors and fled to a nearby shop .
Platt then lured Mr Hyde to a bus station by pretending she had a text message from a friend asking her to meet up .
Instead , Mr Hyde was ambushed by Dellaway and Hughes who were hiding in a doorway , jumping out as he passed by and knocking him to the floor where
They then punched and repeatedly kicked him in the neck and face .
Mr Hyde again went to police and the two attackers were arrested .
But they were bailed and carried on terrorising him .
On November 29 Mr Hyde turned up at Platt 's flat , when she tipped off the two thugs and they arrived minutes later to give him a fourth and fatal beating .
Two witnesses who turned up at the flat in Brecon Towers , Stockport saw Mr Hyde battered and bleeding on the floor of the lounge with a blood soaked sponge in his mouth .
Hughes and Dellaway were repeatedly kicked him and battering him with a saucepan , with Platt looking on unconcerned as the the victim was then ordered to wash his own blood off his face .
Hughes was overheard calling for a meeting at nearby Reddish Vale country park and shouted : ' I want a spade so we can watch him dig his own grave and put him in it . '
He then offered Mr Hyde a choice : ' Death on the motorway or at the Vale . '
Mr Hyde was bundled out of the flat where they met Lindsay Dunn who shouted at the victim : ' you deserve it ' before Mr Hyde was dragged down a flight of stairs towards a waterfall where he was repeatedly punched and kicked .
He then had his head repeatedly stamped on as he lay dying on the ground .
The killers knifed him five times in the back and three in the neck before his body was lifted over a fence and tossed into the waters of the River Tame .
Mr David Turner QC prosecuting said : ' Platt orchestrated the violence at her flat .
She did n't lift a finger or raise her voice to help the man who she knew might be the father of the child she was expecting .
' She like Dunn was quite prepared to see Martin terrified humiliated and badly beaten .
She was instrumental in bringing Dellaway and Hughes back to the flat .
' She watched whilst the two men beat Martin up , she seemed unconcerned by this brutality which was akin to sadistic bullying .'
Dunn , 20 , and another accomplice Peter Mayne , 18 , admitted conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm .
Dunn received a four - year sentence and Mayne got 18 months .
In a statement Mr Hyde 's family said : ' He will be so sadly missed , we cannot believe the terrible way in which he has been taken from us .
' He was a good lad and did not deserve what has happened .
We 're just glad Martin has been given justice for this horrendous crime against him .
He was a happy fun loving wonderful person and will always be in our hearts . '
Det Chief Inspector Jon Chadwick said : ' This was a sadistic and inhumane attack on a vulnerable young man , during which a gang of people turned on their victim for no reason other than a small amount of money being owed .
' It was the most brutal and sustained attack I have witnessed in my career . '
Liza Colburn uses her cellphone constantly .
She taps out her grocery lists , records voice memos , listens to music at the gym , tracks her caloric intake and posts frequent updates to her Twitter and Facebook accounts .
The one thing she does n’t use her cellphone for ?
Making calls .
“ I probably only talk to someone verbally on it once a week , ” said Mrs. Colburn , a 40 - year - old marketing consultant in Canton , Mass . , who has an iPhone .
For many Americans , cellphones have become irreplaceable tools to manage their lives and stay connected to the outside world , their families and networks of friends online .
But increasingly , by several measures , that does not mean talking on them very much .
For example , although almost 90 percent of households in the United States now have a cellphone , the growth in voice minutes used by consumers has stagnated , according to government and industry data .

The huge building rising above Lake Michigan was built as an icon of the Industrial age , but has been transformed into a lynchpin of the 21st century digital economy .
350 East Cermak Road in Chicago is a historic landmark that serves as a modern information fortress .
Its halls are defined by elaborate Gothic architecture dating to its 1912 construction .
But open any door - most of which are secured by keycards or biometric security - and you 're likely to walk into a data center managing high - value bits pulsing through the heart of the Internet economy .
The 1.1 million square foot facility is owned by Digital Realty Trust , the nation 's largest operator of data center facilities .
Originally developed by the R.R. Donnelley Co. to house the printing presses for the Yellow Book and Sears Catalog , 350 East Cermak was converted to telecom use by the Carlyle Group in 1999 , and owned by El Paso Global Networks from 2001 - 2005 .
In May 2005 Digital Realty bought the building , then known as the Lakeside Technology Center , for $ 140 million .
Today it is one of the world 's largest carrier hotels and the nerve center for Chicago 's commodity markets , housing data centers for financial firms attracted by the wealth of peering and connectivity providers among the 70 tenants .
More than 90 percent of the building is occupied .
In November , Digital Realty Trust negotiated an agreement to reclaim 120,000 square feet of unused space from Qwest , which is now being redeveloped as Turn - Key Datacenter space , providing additional inventory in a high - demand market .
The building features 14 - foot ceilings and can support weight loads of 250 pounds a square foot , a design feature that originally allowed Donnelley to store huge reams of newsprint on upper floors .
These were lowered to the printing press floor through a series of 21 vertical shafts , which now serve as risers for fiber and power cabling .
The floor loads allow providers to house heavy equipment , such as transformers , on upper floors .
The industrial strength infrastructure includes four fiber vaults and three electric power feeds , which provide the building with more than 100 megawatts of power .
350 East Cermak is currently the second - largest power customer for Commonwealth Edison , trailing only Chicago 's O'Hare Airport .
Grid power is supported by more than 50 generators throughout the building , which are fueled by multiple 30,000 gallon tanks of diesel fuel .
One of the most distinctive features of the facility is its cooling system , which is supported by an 8.5 million gallon tank of a refrigerated brine - like liquid .
The huge tank serves as thermal energy storage for the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority ( MPEA ) , including the nearby McCormick Place Exposition Center and Hyatt Regency Hotel as well as 350 East Cermak .
Thermal energy storage can reduce costs by running chillers during off - peak hours when power rates are cheaper .
The Trigen facility chills the liquid to 32 degrees and pumps it to the nearby buildings , which use it in a heat exchanger system to support their on - site cooling infrastructure .
For Digital Realty , that includes a water - and - glycol system and enormous air handlers that deliver chilled air to tenants .
( See CSELive for a detailed description of the MPEA / Trigen system ) .
For all its modern infrastructure , the building is known for its architecture , especially the Memorial Library , with its huge cathedral ceiling and bookshelves .
The room was featured in the 2006 Will Ferrell film " Stranger Than Fiction . "
350 East Cermak retains the architectural vision of T.E. Donnelley , who saw the facility as a bridge between the worlds of art and commerce .
" I want a building that will reflect the fact that the printing business is an art as well as a trade , " Donnelley instructed architect Howard Von Doren Shaw in 1912 .
" We are trying to make the whole building dignified and beautiful - something that will be beautiful not only today , but one hundred years from now . "

​ A 90 - year - old grandmother suspected of selling cannabis was arrested Friday after police raided her home and found more than 170 pounds of marijuana .
Daily Mail .
A squad of armed South African police officers with drug dogs stormed the elderly woman ’s home and discovered the pot stashed in multiple bags , according to the
“ This lady was quiet , old and looked like an angel sent from God , ” said the rather poetically inclined Police Inspector Kobeli Mokheseng .
“ But we received a tip - off two weeks ago that a lot of people were going into her house and coming out looking happy , ” Mokheseng said .
Wow , happy people ?
That will not do !
Obviously , law enforcement was called for , do n’t you think ?
“ We sent in a drugs team who were prepared for a shootout , but they soon realized there was nobody to fight , ” Mokheseng said .
Police found three types of marijuana , locally known as dagga , stashed in the pensioner ’s garden shed .
The elderly lady , who said she lived alone in the four - room home east of Johnannesburg , South Africa , was arrested and taken into custody .
“ She will spend the weekend behind bars , educating the police officers on what she was doing , ” Inspector Mokheseng said .
“ This was quite an extensive operation going on , with three types of the drug — called Swazi , Local and Skans , ” Mokheseng said .
Wow , three separate strains ?
Granny ’s got it goin’ on .
“ We found money in plastic bags ready for the bank , ” Mokheseng said .
“ She was making quite a lot of cash . ”
“ We understand she has many children and grandchildren , and we are trying to contact them , ” the police inspector said .
The woman is scheduld to appear before Alberton Magistrates ’ Court on Monday .
She is charged with possession of illegal substances and selling cannabis .
Explain which div you ’re closing
Most of the time when I ’m viewing a website source , I see , at the very bottom of the page , an almost endless list of closing < / div > tags .
In fact , many beginners think they just have to use divs instead of tables to produce quality code .
Divs are cleaners than tables , but without proper code organization , it can be as ( or even sometimes more ) messy as table based code .
Using indentation is a good start .
But a tip that can definitely make you save lot of time is to comment every div tag you ’re closing , as shown in the example below :
< div id =" header " > < div id =" sub " class = " first left " > ... </div><!-- #sub.first.left --> </div><!-- #header -->
Use a CSS reset
Unless you ’re a beginner or if you were on vacation on a desert island for the last 6 years , you might already know how useful a CSS reset it .
Because by default , browsers do n’t apply the same default styling to HTML elements , a CSS reset will ensure that all element have no particular style so you can define your own without the risk of many cross - browser rendering issues .
html , body , div , span , applet , object , iframe , h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 , p , blockquote , pre , a , abbr , acronym , address , big , cite , code , del , dfn , em , font , img , ins , kbd , q , s , samp , small , strike , strong , sub , sup , tt , var , b , u , i , center , dl , dt , dd , ol , ul , li , fieldset , form , label , legend , table , caption , tbody , tfoot , thead , tr , th , td { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border : 0 ; outline : 0 ; font - size : 100 % ; vertical - align : baseline ; background : transparent ; } body { line - height : 1 ; } ol , ul { list - style : none ; } blockquote , q { quotes : none ; } blockquote : before , blockquote : after , q:before , q: after { content : '' ; content : none ; } /* remember to define focus styles ! */ : focus { outline : 0 ; } /* remember to highlight inserts somehow ! */ ins { text - decoration : none ; } del { text - decoration : line - through ; } /* tables still need ' cellspacing= " 0 " ' in the markup */ table { border - collapse : collapse ; border - spacing : 0 ; }

Do n’t use @import
CSS files can be included using the @import directive .
This can be useful when , for example , you want to include a stylesheet into another .
Another common practice is to include CSS file in html documents using the following :
< style type =" text / css > @import url ( ' a.css ' ) ; @import url ( ' b.css ' ) ; </ style >
While it works , the @import directive is much slower than the other way to include stylesheets into a html document :
< link rel=' stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='a.css '> < link rel='stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='proxy.css '>
It will not make a difference on low traffic websites , but if you have the chance to own a popular website , do n’t waste your visitor ’s time using @import .

“ Smush ” your images
Being a developer , I always found that optimizing my images for the web was n’t easy .
I tried the good old “ Save for web ” Photoshop command , but most of the time , I ended up with images that were either too big or without a sufficient quality .
As a result , I had the bad habit of using unoptimized images on my websites .
This is n’t a problem when you do n’t have to care about your site ’s bandwidth , but after my recent switch on my virtual private server , I had to be careful with image sizes .
At this time , I found a very cool tool named Smush It :
You enter your unoptimized image url , and Smush It will create a perfectly optimized image for you .
You can save up to 70 % of the file size , while keeping the original quality .
As an example , all the images from my list of online code editors have been “ smushed ” .
Do n’t mix CSS with HTML
As a markup language , the right use of HTML is to organize documents by defining a header , a footer , lists , blockquotes , etc .
Some time ago , front - end web developers often used now deprecated HTML attributes to style a particular element .
Nowadays , the style attribute allows developers to insert CSS directly into a html document .
This is very useful for testing or when you ’re in a hurry .
But the style attribute is bad practice , that goes completely against the CSS philosophy .
The following example illustrates how dirty and hard to read a simple line of code can become , with the style attribute :
< a href = " https://catswhocode.com " style= " background:#069 ; padding:3px;font-weight:bold;color:#fff ; " > Cats Who Code</a>
Do n’t mix Javascript with HTML
Just like mixing your html code with css is bad practice , you should n’t use any Javascript in your html documents .
The following bad practice illustrates an onclick event :
< a id =" cwc " href = " https://catswhocode.com " onclick =" alert ( ' I love this site ! ' ) ; " >
Cats Who Code</a>
The same result can be achieved using unobstructed Javascript .
In this example , I ’m using the popular jQuery framework :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' #cwc').click ( function ( ) { alert ( ' I love this website ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
This may seems a bit harder at first , especially for beginners ; but it is definitely not , and it will keep your html document clean .
You know it , IE sucks , and some clients suck even more by requiring you to create webpages which are compatible with this obsolete browser .
To target specific versions of IE , you can use the well known IE hacks , as shown below :
height : 200 px ; /* normal browsers */ _height : 300 px ; /* IE6 */ .height : 250 px ; /* IE7 */ * height : 350 px ; /* All IEs */
Those hacks are extremely useful sometimes , but they are not the best way to target a specific version of IE , and it will cause your CSS validation to fail .
Instead , you should use the conditional comment shown below to target IE6 .
< link href=" style.css " rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " /> <!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < link href= " ie.css " rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " /> <![ endif ] -->
Place Javascript file at the bottom
A popular practice of the late 90’s / early 2000 ’s was to place Javascript files within the < head > and < / head > tags .
The problem is that your javascript files will be loaded first , and consequently your content will be loaded after .
By placing Javascript files at the bottom of your documents , you ’ll ensure that JS files will be loaded only when the content has been properly displayed .
... < script type='text/javascript ' src='jquery.js?ver=1.3.2'></script> </ body > </html >
Use HTML semantically
HTML is not a programming language .
It is a markup language , used to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings , paragraphs , lists , and more .
If you started to create websites in the good old 90’s or in the beginning of the century , you know how dirty the markup was at the time .
But happilly , it has evolved .
Among other things , it is important to use html element semantically .
As an example , a navigation menu should always be an unordered list :
< ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > About </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Contact </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Blog</a></li> </ul >
Test WHILE you build to avoid cross - browser issues
One of the biggest mistake I ever made when developing html , CSS , and javascript , was not to test my pages on multiple browser while I was writing them .
Instead , I used to write all my code and just view in Firefox to see how it was rendered .
In theory , this should be good .
But as you know , cross - browser issues are a major problem for front - end developers , especially due to IE .
If you test your documents on Firefox / IE / Chrome while your writing it , cross - browser rendering problems will be much easier to fix .
I have lost hours not doing it , so I hope this final tip will help you saving your precious time .
Happy coding ;)

MIAMI , Florida - President Barack Obama said Thursday he 's amused by the anti-tax Tea Party protests that have been taking place around Tax Day .
Obama told a fundraiser in Miami that he 's cut taxes , contrary to the claims of protesters .
" You would think they'd be saying thank you , " he said .
At that , many in the crowd at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts stood and yelled , " Thank you ! "
The fundraiser was one of two Obama held after a speech at Cape Canaveral on his administration 's space policy .
The other was hosted by Gloria and Emilio Estefan , a $ 30,400 - per-couple fete that stirred some controversy in the traditionally Republican Cuban - American community .
Together , the events raised $ 2.5 million for the Democratic National Committee .
DNC Chairman Tim Kaine spoke before Obama and delivered a sobering assessment of the party 's chances in the November midterm elections , noting that the party in power traditionally sustains losses in the midterms .
" There are a lot of prognosticators who are saying this is going to be a very tough year for the Democrats , " Kaine said .
" We sort of have to assume that we 're running into a headwind , " Kaine said , but he contended Democrats were accustomed to being underdogs .
Obama called on Republicans and Democrats to come together to pass strong financial regulation legislation .
He said every member of Congress would have to decide " between special interests and the American people . "
Obama cheered the special - election victory of Florida Democratic State Sen .
Ted Deutch in Tuesday 's special election to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler .
It was the first House election since passage of his controversial health care bill and Obama noted that commentators viewed the election as a referendum on that legislation or on Obama himself .
" And it was ! " he said .
Anger in Washington
In the nation 's capital , Tea Party protesters marked tax day Thursday with exhortations against " gangster government " and appeals from Republicans seeking their grass - roots clout in November elections , a prospect both tempting and troubling to those in the loose movement .
Several thousand rallied in Washington 's Freedom Plaza in the shadow of the Ronald Reagan office building , capping a national protest tour launched in the dust of Nevada and finishing in the capital that inspires Tea Party discontent like no other place .
Allied activists demonstrated from Maine to Hawaii in hundreds of lively protests , all joined in disdain for government spending and -- on the April 15 federal tax filing deadline -- what they see as the Washington tax grab .
The Washington rally in brilliant sunshine was spirited but modest in size , lacking the star power of Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin , who roused the masses at earlier stops of the Tea Party Express in its cross-country bus tour .
Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota won roars of affirmation as she accused President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats of trying to take over health care , energy , financial services and other broad swaths of the economy .
" We 're on to this gangster government , " she declared .
" I say it 's time for these little piggies to go home . "
She appealed directly for Tea Partiers to swing behind " constitutional conservatives " in congressional campaigns , just as they contributed to Scott Brown 's upset in the Massachusetts Senate race in an early test of their potency .
" I am the No. 1 target for one more extremist group to defeat this November , " she said .
" We need to have your help for candidates like me .
We need you to take out some of these bad guys . "
GOP congressional leaders absent
Although Republicans are ideological allies of many Tea Partiers -- and GOP operatives are involved in some of the organizations -- they are also part of the establishment that many in the movement want to upend .
No members of the Republican congressional leadership were featured at the capital rally .
In Wisconsin , a half dozen Tea Party groups from around the state decided to boycott Thursday 's rally in Madison because former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was among the speakers .
" We do feel it 's important that people know this is not who we would ever align ourselves with , " said Kirsten Lombard , organizer of the Madison - based Tea Party group Wisconsin 9/12 Project .
Tim Dake , organizer of the Milwaukee - based GrandSons of Liberty , said : " Tommy is representative of the old boy network way of doing things . "
A similar sentiment was seen on a sign carried by a Tea Party member in Washington : " Reelect No One . "
But plenty of Republican hopefuls came forward at rallies around the country , hoping to tap the energy and anger for political ends .
In Louisville , Ky. , Rand Paul , an outsider who has become a leading contender for the Republican Senate nomination , declared , " I 'm clinging to my guns , my religion and my ammunition " and added : " We were intended to be a constitutional Republic .
Yet , we have devolved into some kind of mad democracy . "
On patrol for liberal infiltrators
Worried about liberal infiltrators , Kevin Terrell , a self - described colonel in the Ohio Valley Freedom Fighters militia based in Louisville , led about two dozen camouflaged followers on a patrol around the park .
" I 'm a little apprehensive because of the left - wing nut jobs out there , " Terrell said .
Comedian Mark Klein told the crowd that the difference between Obama and terrorist Osama bin Laden is that " one is an anti-capitalist trying to destroy America .
The other is hiding in Afghanistan . "
Police estimate 1,200 showed up in Hartford , Conn. , where one sign plainly took sides : " Dump All Democrats . "
At least 1,000 paraded through downtown Boise , Idaho ; about 500 rallied in Oklahoma City .
In Montpelier , Vt. , where 60 people mocked the government in song and word , Linda Chagnon , a 57 - year - old caregiver from Burlington , carried a sign that read : " Give Me Liberty , Not Debt . "
" We have to manage our own budgets and our homes , we have to cut our expenses , we have to go without , " she said .
" This top - heavy government needs to be downsized .
I downsize my home , they can downsize the government and still get the main things done and let the people do their thing . "
About 300 turned out to watch former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , architect of the GOP's Contract with America agenda in the 1990s , sign the Tea Party 's " Contract From America . "
He told the crowd that the GOP needs the support of Tea Partiers and if they drift into a third party , the opposition to Democrats would be split .
Calling Obama a communist
In Washington , the anger was directly firmly at Obama and Democratic congressional leaders .
The crowd chanted , " There 's a communist in the White House " at the urging of the ukelele - playing Victoria Jackson , a former cast member on " Saturday Night Live . "
The slogans on signs and T - shirts were biting , sometimes raw : " We Want Regime Change , " '' Save a Seal , Club a Liberal , " '' Down with the Gov't Takeover , " '' End the Fed " and " Waterboard Bernanke . "
Some American flags waved upside down in the breeze .
The tax code was the villain of the day .
" We have got to take the country back by taking back the money they take from us , " Jim Tomasik of FairTax Nation told the crowd .
Lost in the rhetoric was that taxes have gone down under Obama .
Congress has cut individuals ' federal taxes for this year by about $ 173 billion , leaving Americans with a lighter load despite nearly $ 29 billion in increases by states .
Obama plans to increase taxes on the wealthy to help pay for his health care overhaul and other programs .
In Chicago , three Republicans running to unseat Democratic House members appeared before a rally of thousands at a plaza outside City Hall .
One , Joel Pollak , sang a song he wrote , with the verse : " Do n't tax our freedom away . "
Protester Bob Borders of Prospect Heights held a sign asking people to honk if he was paying their mortgage .
In Austin , Texas , Republican Gov. Rick Perry warned Tea Party organizers in a conference call to watch their backs for liberals trying to make them look bad .
" You can bet that every dirty trick is going to get played on Tea Parties , trying to marginalize them , trying to make them into something that they 're not , " said Perry , a frequent Washington basher who capitalized on the movement to defeat Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison in the March primary election for governor .
Perry was referring to plans by opponents of the Tea Party to infiltrate events , pose as followers and act outrageously to taint the movement .
One such episode unfolded in Madison , when a small group opposing the Tea Party walked through the crowd carrying satirical signs , one saying : " Obama Hates America ( and kittens ) . "
Carrying AK - 47 into Texas rally
At an Austin rally , Jim Dillon walked through the crowd carrying on his shoulder an AK - 47 that he said was unloaded and legal .
A state trooper stopped him , examined the weapon and let him continue walking with it .
" Our rights are hanging by a thread already as it is , " Dillon said , referring to the constitutional right to bear arms .
" If we do n't exercise our rights frequently , we 'll lose them . "
In Helena , Mont. , activists smashed cardboard boxes symbolizing the crates of tea dumped into the harbor in the 1773 Boston Tea Party .
More than 150 people waved flags and carried tea pots ; signs said " Go Green , Recycle Congress . "
And in Lansing , Mich. , more than 1,000 sign - waving protesters cheered calls for tax cuts and states rights .
" We have lived eight years of liberal Democratic leadership and Michigan is in shambles , " Joan Fabiano of Grassroots in Michigan told the crowd .
In Colorado , about 2,000 rallied in Denver and another 2,000 in Colorado Springs .
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a prime figure in the Tea Party 's rogues gallery , said that if Tea Partiers will be coming after Democrats in November , they are coming after some Republicans first , trying to replace them with more conservative candidates .
" I think it 's going to have an impact on Republicans in November , " she said .
" Some of the competition we see is in their primaries . "
She demurred when asked if Democrats should be promoting big counter - demonstrations .
" I do n't know that anyone needs my encouragement , " she said .
" The First Amendment is alive and well right outside my window .
I can attest to that . "

We forget with the enhancement of technology how to live in a world without it .
The same can be said for pest control .
We have forgotten that pest control on farms and in home gardens used to be organic .
We invented " better " methods for pest control when we began spreading pesticides over our crops .
This method of pest control was supposed to save us time , save our crops , and help us produce more food , but as luck would have it this method is dangerous .
The pesticides can be toxic to more than just the bugs .
It can harm people and the land .
It should come as no surprise to most people that organic garden pest control has been around for centuries .
In fact the first crops ever placed on a farm had organic pest control .
People from the past taught us what types of bugs were harmful to crops and what types of bugs could eliminate these pests .
Today many farms are going back to the organic garden pest control method in order to kill the pests and save the humans and land .
We are demanding organic foods not only because they taste better , but also because we do n't have to worry about toxic substances hurting us or our family .
Proper Treatments
Some methods of organic garden pest control on the small or large scale include introducing bugs that eat bugs .
The ladybug is one good bug to have around your home garden or farm .
The ladybug preys on aphids and other insects while it does no damage to the crops .
The praying mantis is another insect that feeds on other insects large or small that can damage crops .
Damaging bugs can be grasshoppers or whiteflies .
There are bugs that will eat the eggs of pests and parasites that will kill the pests .
These methods are natural and non toxic .
While you have to monitor the introduction of these natural pest control methods you will find there are great benefits to using the organic garden pest control methods .
Keeping Your Family Safe
First of all your children and family will be safe from toxic pesticides .
Second the land will no longer be affected by the toxicity of the pesticides and will be able to produce better quality products .
Even if you have a home garden that you use organic garden pest control on you will realize how wonderful your vegetables or fruits taste when they are not pumped full of toxins .
For more info see http://www.homepestcontrolhelp.com/Pest_Control_Services on Pest Control Services
Organic garden pest control can be done on a large farm that feeds the masses or your own backyard .
It may be a little more time consuming than spraying pesticides , but the safety factor as well as the increase of health in foods you eat will more than make up for the time spent in protecting your garden .
We all want to be healthy and safe in our homes so spending a little research on how to create an organic garden may just benefit you the most .

Where in the US are the highest concentrations of Apple users ?
A report on Fortune shows us .
Here are the top ten US markets for Apple :
* San Francisco / Silicon Valley / Bay Area , CA – Residents are 49 % more likely than the average American to be Apple users , no surprise with Apple ’s headquarters just down the road in Cupertino .
* Boston , MA – Nearly 1/3 of adults in the Boston area have an iPod , iPhone , or Mac .
* San Diego , CA – 31.8 % of the areas residents are Mac users
* New York , NY – 4.9 million Mac users
* Washington , DC – residents are 39 % more likely to use a Mac , iPod , or Apple
* Chicago , IL – 2.1 million Apple users
* Denver , CO – 29 % of the population are Apple users
* Monterey / Salinas , CA – 28 % of the population own or use Apple products
* Santa Barbara / Santa Maria / San Luis Obispo , CA – this beachy region of southern California boasts a nearly 28 % Apple user rate
* Las Vegas , NV – 27.9 % of adults use an Apple product
Looking at the map is pretty interesting , you can really see the concentration of Apple users is highest around large cities , which is no surprise considering most of the Apple Stores are based in metropolitan areas .
California is truly an Apple state , I do n’t think I have ever visited a coffee shop or cafe in the Bay Area and not seen a sea of glowing Mac logos .
The same is certainly true for many universities , where Mac ’s dominate classrooms and campuses .
Police in McAllen , Texas , have arrested a man for allegedly killing his 2 - year - old stepdaughter because she kept crying during the U.S. - Ghana World Cup game on Saturday .
The details that police allege are horrific .
Police say Hector Castro , 28 , called firefighters to his apartment because the girl swallowed a screw .
But police say the screw was jammed down the throat of the girl to make the death look like an accident , and that she died because she was beaten and suffocated .
" There are no words for this , " McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez told the Monitor .
" It makes you want to think about doing lots of things to this guy , but he will face the criminal justice system just like everybody else . "
Rodriguez said Castro is an illegal immigrant and that he gave investigators a confession that implicated himself in the girl 's death .
Several of the girl 's ribs were cracked , police said .
They have n't released the name of the child .
Castro was to be arraigned today , and is to face a capital murder charge .
Welcome to the surveillance society .
That 's what the American Civil Liberties Union concluded Tuesday with a report chronicling government spying and the detention of groups and individuals " for doing little more than peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights . "
The report , Policing Free Speech : Police Surveillance and Obstruction of First Amendment - Protected Activity ( .pdf ) , surveys news accounts and studies of questionable snooping and arrests in 33 states and the District of Columbia over the past decade .
The survey provides an outline of , and links to , dozens of examples of Cold War -era snooping in the modern age .
" Our review of these practices has found that Americans have been put under surveillance or harassed by the police just for deciding to organize , march , protest , espouse unusual viewpoints and engage in normal , innocuous behaviors such as writing notes or taking photographs in public , " Michael German , an ACLU attorney and former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent , said in a statement .
Here are a few examples :
At a California State University , Fresno lecture on veganism , six of the 60 in attendance were undercover officers from the local and campus police .
The Oakland Police Department in California had infiltrated a police - brutality demonstration , and its undercover officers selected " the route of the march . "
A vegetarian activist in Georgia was arrested for jotting down the license plate of a Department of Homeland Security agent who was snapping photos of a protest outside a Honey Baked Ham store .
A Joint Terrorism Task Force in Illinois went on a three - day manhunt in Chicago searching for a Muslim man for his suspicious activity of using a hand counter on a bus .
As it turned out , the man was counting his daily prayers .
A Kentucky minister was detained at Canadian border trying to enter the United States because he had purchased copies of the Koran on the internet following the 2001 terror attacks .
A New York , Muslim - American student journalist was detained for taking pictures of Old Glory outside a Veterans Affairs building as part of a class project .
The authorities deleted the pictures before releasing her an hour later .

New Yorkers are debating whether the city is growing ever more heartless in the face of crime after dozens of people ignored a homeless man bleeding to death in the street .
People ignored the dying man for nearly two hours as he lay in a street in Queens after saving a woman from being mugged .
CCTV footage showed Hugo Tale - Yax , a homeless man , collapsing with stab wounds on a pavement shortly after stopping the mugger , who had been armed with a knife .
He lay dying in a pool of blood as people strolled past , some pausing briefly to look at him .
One man even emerged from a building to photograph Mr Tale - Yax , a 31 - year - old Guatemalan immigrant , with his mobile phone .
Another man bent down to shake him , lifting him to reveal the pool of blood , but he still walked away .
When police and firemen finally arrived at 7.23 am on Sunday in the Jamaica neighbourhood of Queens to find Mr Tale - Yax dead , he had been lying in the street for an hour and 40 minutes .
The same video footage earlier showed an unidentified woman being accosted by a man , who was then involved with a scuffle with Mr Tale - Yax .
As the other two fled in opposite directions , Mr Tale - Yax staggered a few yards before collapsing .
He was found by firemen responding to an emergency call .
Police said they received three calls , one about a screaming woman and another about a man lying in the street .
But both calls apparently gave the wrong address and officers found the right location only after a third call .
The incident has reminded New Yorkers of the notorious killing in 1964 of Kitty Genovese , who was stabbed to death in Queens .
About a dozen neighbours heard her screams but did not call the police .
Researchers in Germany have used a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique called continuous arterial spin labeling ( CASL ) to map cerebral blood flow patterns in schizophrenic patients quickly and without using radiation or contrast agents .
Their findings appear in the online edition and July printed issue of the journal Radiology .
" Arterial spin labeling is a powerful technique that can help reduce the cost and complexity of examinations , " said the study 's lead author , Lukas Scheef , M.D. , from the Department of Radiology at University of Bonn , Germany .
" It can also be more readily repeated than methods that involve the use of contrast agents and radiotracers . "
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe brain disorder that affects approximately 2.4 million American adults , according to the National Institute of Mental Health .
Symptoms can include hallucinations , delusions , disordered thinking , movement disorders , social withdrawal and cognitive deficits .
In the study , conducted at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany , researchers used CASL MRI to compare cerebral blood flow in 11 non-medicated patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls .
The patient group included three women with a mean age of 36 years and eight men with a mean age of 32 years .
The control group included 13 women ( mean age , 29 years ) and 12 men ( mean age , 30 years ) .
The results revealed that compared to the healthy controls , the schizophrenic patients had extensive areas of hypoperfusion , or lower blood flow than normal in the frontal lobes and frontal cortex , anterior and medial cingulate gyri , and parietal lobes .
These regions are associated with a number of higher cognitive functions including planning , decision making , judgment and impulse control .
Hyperperfusion , or increased blood flow , was observed in the cerebellum , brainstem and thalamus of the schizophrenic patients .
" Our CASL study revealed patterns of hypo - and hyperperfusion similar to the perfusion patterns observed in positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) studies of schizophrenic patients , " Dr. Scheef said .
Unlike PET and SPECT studies , CASL MR images can be quickly acquired without the use of ionizing radiation or contrast agents .
In CASL MRI , arterial blood water is magnetically labeled in order to non-invasively measure cerebral blood flow .
" CASL MRI may allow researchers to gain a better understanding of schizophrenia , " Dr. Scheef said .
" In the long run , it may help to individualize and optimize treatment . "

WAR crimes prosecutors want to subpoena supermodel Naomi Campbell to testify over a so - called blood diamond she allegedly received from Liberia 's ex-president Charles Taylor .
" Ms Campbell 's testimony is necessary as there is evidence that Ms Campbell was given rough diamonds by the accused ( Taylor ) in September 1997 , " said a prosecution motion filed with the Special Court for Sierra Leone .
" Ms Campbell 's anticipated evidence concerns ' a central issue ' in the case : the accused 's possession of rough diamonds , " states the document , a copy of which was obtained by AFP .
Taylor 's war crimes trial heard claims in January that he had given Campbell a " large " diamond after a 1997 dinner hosted by South African ex-president Nelson Mandela .
The diamond was among those Taylor had obtained from Sierra Leone rebels and took to South Africa " to sell .. or exchange them from weapons , " prosecutor Brenda Hollis asserted in cross-examining Taylor at the time .
Taylor , on trial since January 2008 , denied the claims .
He has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the brutal 1991 - 2001 civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone , including charges of murder , rape , conscripting child soldiers , enslavement and pillaging .
Taylor stands accused of having fuelled war in Sierra Leone by arming the rebel Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) in exchange for " blood diamonds " - the name given to diamonds mined in rebel - held regions of Africa and sold to fund warfare .
The RUF is blamed for the mutilation of thousands of civilians who had their hands and arms severed in one of the most brutal wars in modern history , which claimed some 120,000 lives .
Spicy Sauteed Chicken with green peppers is a super tasty dish that you can easily make in a wok pan .
You can play with the spices and it ’s ready in a very short time .
I came home earlier today and we could have a lunch together with hubby .
He prepared one of our favorite chicken dish .
We love it because it ’s very easy to prepare .
And maybe he loves to make this because of the same reason !
I stopped by a supermarket on the way home to do some grocery shopping .
Although I hate shopping on clothes or that kind of stuff , I am crazy about grocery shopping .
So whenever I enter a supermarket , I want to buy almost everything there .
I just forget how much I can carry .
I think supermarket trolleys must be designed smaller so that people like me do n’t fill it up with items they do n’t need .
My favorite aisles in a supermarket are grocery and detergent aisles .
Sometimes I ca n’t realize the time I spend there .
This time I just took a glance at the soaps , detergents , shampoos , etc. but did n’t examine them closely .
I decided to spend time at grocery aisle when I saw it was all in green .
There were a lot of herbs which were newly brought to the market so I absolutely bought several bunches of parsley , mint , basil , arugula , thyme , dill and scallion .
You see I just lost my control and could hardly stop putting still some other herbs into the trolley .
Besides , I bought some summer fruits like cherries , plums , apricot , peach and pineapple .
Finally I bought chicken breast as hubby had told me before and ran out of the market not to buy anything more .
Seeing me tired carrying bags full of fruits and veggies , hubby took the responsibility of cooking the lunch .
And while he was dealing with the chicken , I washed some of the herbs under water and waited them about 10 minutes in water and vinegar mixture until the lunch was done .
We always wash the herbs in this way .
The measurement is like this : 1 liter water is mixed with ¼ cup vinegar .
Vinegar cleans herbs from bacterias which cannot be seen with naked eye .
Besides , it helps the sand sink to the bottom .
After washing them well , I took them in a large bowl , squeeze lemon on them .
So our lunch was sauteed chicken with green peppers and herbs .
Wonderful , is n’t it ?

Andy Rubin , a vice president for engineering at Google , leads one of the search giant ’s most important efforts — the development of Android , Google ’s open source platform for smartphones and other mobile devices .
Android , of course , is Google ’s primary weapon in its escalating battle with Apple over the smartphone market .
Android currently runs on 9 percent of smartphones in the United States , according to Comscore .
It is also likely to be the company ’s software choice for the emerging worlds of tablet computers and set - top boxes .
In a wide - ranging conversation on Google ’s campus last week , Mr. Rubin talked about openness , support for Adobe Flash , Chrome , the upcoming Froyo release , and seemed to compare Apple to North Korea .
He predictably said that the Android platform was taking off because it was open to many manufacturers running many different architectures .
“ It ’s a numbers game .
When you have multiple O.E.M. ’s building multiple products in multiple product categories , it ’s just a matter of time ” before sales of Android phones exceed the sales of proprietary systems like Apple ’s and R.I.M.’s , he said .
As to when the number of Android phones sold would exceed the number of BlackBerrys and iPhones sold , Mr. Rubin said , “ I do n’t know when its might be , but I ’m confident it will happen .
Open usually wins . ”
I also asked him about the Apple chief executive Steve Jobs ’s recent comment that “ folks who want porn can buy an Android phone . ”
“ I do n’t really have a rationale for that , ” he said .
“ It ’s a different style of interacting with the public and the media . ”
Mr. Rubin also addressed many other topics — like whether consumers actually care if their mobile phone software is “ open ” or not .
He insisted that they would , comparing closed computing platforms to totalitarian governments that deprived their citizens of choice .
“ When they ca n’t have something , people do care .
Look at the way politics work .
I just do n’t want to live in North Korea , ” he said .
When asked whether Android apps from Google might have an advantage over other companies ’ apps in the Android Market , the discussion again seemed to implicitly veer toward Brand X .
“ We use the same tools we expect our third - party developers to , ” Mr. Rubin said .
“ We have an SDK we give to developers .
and when we write our Gmail app , we use the same SDK .
A lot of guys have private APIs .
We do n’t .
That ’s on policy and on technology .
If there ’s a secret API to hook into billing system we open up that billing system to third parties .
If there ’s a secret API to allow application multitasking , we open it up .
There are no secret APIs .
That is important to highlight for Android sake .
Open is open and we live by our own implementations . ”
He also promised that full support for Adobe ’s Flash standard was coming in the next version of Android , code - named Froyo , for frozen yogurt ( previous Android releases were called Cupcake , Donut and Eclair , and are represented outside Building 44 on the Google campus with giant sculptures of the desserts ) .
Sometimes being open “ means not being militant about the things consumer are actually enjoying , ” he said .
Of the fear that Android could “ fork ” into various different versions , making it difficult for application developers to create one program for all Android devices , Mr. Rubin compared the platform with every other PC operating system .
These systems naturally evolve , causing newer applications to not be compatible with older devices .
“ But compatibility for us means more than it does for other people , ” Mr. Rubin said .
“ We have to run on a screen the size of a phone and a 42 - inch plasma display — and still be compatible .
I think we have the world ’s first moment where an app written for phone can run on TV . ”
I also asked about how Google was viewing its Android and Chrome operating systems – and which was the company ’s preferred software for devices like tablet computers .
He said the two platforms represented two different ambitions at Google – improving access to information on mobile phones , in the case of Android , and pushing forward the open Web in the case of the Chrome operating system .
The efforts are not necessarily mutually exclusive , Mr. Rubin said .
“ I do n’t know if there will be Chrome and Android tablets , but if a consumer walks into store and two of those tablets are my company ’s choices , I ’m all good . ”
Mr. Rubin said he owned an iPad ; he purchased one for his wife .
He said that such tablets should have traction among “ a certain demographic that consumes more than produces , ” but that they will likely eat into laptop sales , instead of creating an additional market .
“ I do n’t think people want to charge another device , ” he said .
At the end of the hourlong chat , I joked with Mr. Rubin that his press relations colleague , who was in the room , wanted to confess that he had left a prototype Android phone at a local bar .
“ I ’d be happy if that happened and someone wrote about it , ” Mr. Rubin said .
“ With openness comes less secrets . ”
8.13 am : Who 's going to govern the country ?
We 're into day five of the post- election power vacuum and , as Patrick Wintour reports in the Guardian today , the Lib Dems are saying today is " crunch time " .
It looks as though we might get a decision before the day is over .
But I said almost exactly the same 24 hours ago , at the start of yesterday 's live blog , and events did n't turn out quite the way most of us were expecting .
Anyone who thinks they know for certain what will happen today is probably deluded .
My colleague Hélène Mulholland was in the Commons until the meeting of Lib Dem MPs broke up , after midnight , and she was there when David Laws delivered a statement about what had been decided .
This is what Laws said :
The parliamentary party has had another good and extensive meeting and it received the latest updates from the leader and the negotiating team of the discussions that have been going on early on today .
There is going to be a further meeting tomorrow to have discussions about where we are and to see if we can resolve some of the existing issues that are outstanding .
There is a strong commitment to ensure we bring this process to conclusion as soon as we can , respecting the fact this depends upon positions taken by other parties not just ourselves .
I would repeat the comment I made earlier today there is a very strong commitment by the parliamentary party to ensure that when this comes to conclusion it will leave Britain with a strong government that is able to deliver a deficit reduction and a political reform that the country needs .
Nick Clegg faces a very difficult decision .
If he forms a pact with the Tories , there will be howls of protest from his progressive allies on the left .
If he goes into coalition with Labour , he will be accused of propping up the party that lost the general election .
There is n't an easy solution and Clegg 's leadership skills are about to be tested to the hilt .
Will he be decisive ?
Can he hold his party together ?
Can he explain what he is doing to the public ?
And can he use this moment to reshape politics , showing himself to be a master of events , rather than someone who has been constrained by them ?
We 'll find out soon .
8.39 am : George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , has just been on the Today programme .
He dismissed suggestions that the Tories could form a minority government .
I keep reading about this option and I 'm afraid it does n't really exist .
We can't just turn up at Buckingham Palace and say we 'd like to form a minority government .
We would need the consent of the Liberal Democrats to form a minority government .
9.13 am : Apologies .
We 're having some technical problems at the moment but hope to sort them out quickly .
9.31 am : Hi , this is Haroon Siddique .
Andrew is having some technical problems so I 'm taking over in the meantime .
David Cameron and Nick Clegg both made statements as they left their respective homes this morning .

Cameron said it was " decision time " for the Lib Dems and urged them to make the right one :
I 've made a very full , very open , very reasonable offer to the Liberal Democrats to deliver that stable government .
My own members of parliament have shown that they are prepared to put aside party interest in the national interest by agreeing a referendum on the alternative vote .
It 's now , I believe , decision time - decision time for the Liberal Democrats - and I hope they make the right decision to give this country the strong , stable government that it badly needs and it badly needs quickly .

Speaking a few minutes later , Clegg said : " The discussions between the political parties has now reached a critical and final phase .
I 'm as impatient as anybody else to get on with this , to resolve matters one way or another . "
He added :
My parliamentary party was up into the small hours yet again discussing things .
We will act , as ever , responsibly .
We will act to try to do our bit to create a stable , good government that the British people deserve .
And I really hope that we will be able to make an announcement so we clear up everything and explain to people exactly what our thinking is as quickly as we possibly can .
Interestingly , the Cabinet Office minister , Tessa Jowell , suggested this morning that the Lib Dems had made the first move with respect to opening discussions with Labour .
Saying the Lib Dems initiated the discussions is a way of Labour deflecting criticism that it is seeking to hold onto power by any means possible although , realistically , it is unlikely it would make any difference to the public perception of the discussions .
If the Lib Dems did initiate discussions , I would imagine the Conservatives will be less than impressed .
Jowell told GMTV :
The country did not vote last week for a majority government and until there is another government we , as members of the cabinet , stay in office .
I think that people would accept that it is our obligation to try to provide a stable government for the country and , if the Liberals come to us and say can we discuss with you the possibility of cooperation in circumstances where no party has an overall majority , then I think that people would feel we were pretty irresponsible if we said no .
Quote of the day so far has come from former home secretary David Blunkett , who was on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
He warned that a " coalition of the defeated " between Labour and the Lib Dems would " lose very badly " at the next general election .
He added :
Can you trust the Liberal Democrats ?
They are behaving like every harlot in history .
9.46 am : Hi , it 's Andrew Sparrow again , taking over from Haroon .
I 'm afraid my computer crashed this morning , but it seems to be working now .
The BBC is reporting that David Miliband will me be making a statement soon .
9.57 am : Earlier this morning Lord Ashdown was on the Today programme .
He started by saying that his remarks should not be taken as a sign that he was recommending a deal with Labour or a deal with Tories .
He would offer his advice to his party in private , he said .
But then he made it very clear - to my ears , at least - that he is in the Labour camp .
He said there was nothing unconstitutional about having a prime minister who has not won an election , as the Labour / Lib Dem coalition would produce .
And he rubbished that idea that a Labour / Lib Dem coalition would be unstable .
The SNP would never join forces with the Tories to vote against it , he predicted .
If this was a coalition made up of what you might call the panjandrum elements that you suggest , I would not be in favour of it .
It is a coalition made up of Liberal Democrat and Labour in which we would dare the other elements if they wished to vote us down and , I can tell you , I can think of no political circumstances where that would happen .
Ashdown took umbrage when Nick Robinson said that he was ignoring Ashdown 's opening remarks and that he was concluding Ashdown favoured a deal with Labour .
But then Robinson pointed out that Ashdown has published two volumes of diaries and an autobiography in which he has described how he devoted his political career to healing the historic rift between Labour and the Liberals .
At that point Ashdown appear to back down .
10.05 am : Jon Cruddas , a possible candidate for the Labour leadership , has said that the wider Labour party should be consulted about the possibility of a coalition with the Lib Dems .
According to Paul Waugh , Cruddas said this morning :
Like all other Labour MPs , I fully welcome any negotiations that are conducted in the best interests of the country .
But the Labour party and wider Labour movement must be fully included in those discussions .
Any negotiations must be conducted in full consultation with the PLP , NEC and affiliated trade unions .
10.16 am : What 's happening this morning ?
The key event will be the meeting between the Labour negotiating team and the Lib Dem negotiating team which has just started in the House of Commons .
The Lib Dem team is the same as the one that was negotiating with the Tories : David Laws , Chris Huhne , Andrew Stunnell and Danny Alexander .
The Labour team is led by Lord Mandelson .
The other members are : Harriet Harman , Lord Adonis , Ed Miliband and Ed Balls .
A Labour / Lib Dem coalition would be dependent on the support of other smaller parties .
But Labour is not planning to strike a formal coalition agreement with them .
Labour and the Lib Dems would not have a majority , but they would be confident that parties such as the SNP would not vote against the Queen 's speech .
Instead Labour seems to be planning to negotiate with parties like the SNP on a case - by - case basis .
Gordon Brown , wearing a purple tie yesterday
10.23am : A reader has emailed me to point out something I did n't notice yesterday ; as the picture at the top of this blog shows , Gordon Brown was wearing a purple tie when he announced his plan to resign .
Brown does n't often wear purple .
But purple is the colour adopted by the various groups campaigning for PR in recent days , including Take Back Parliament .
10.33 am : Some of the Labour leadership candidates have already been recruiting leading internet experts to run their campaign websites , according to Benjamin Cohen at Channel 4 .
10.36 am : I have n't had a chance to take a proper look at the papers yet .
But Roy Greenslade has been going through them and he has posted an analysis on his blog .
This is how he starts .
I watched Gordon Brown 's historic statement outside No 10 yesterday evening and thought that he handled it well enough .
But this morning 's right - of - centre national papers were determined to rub his nose in the dirt .
For the implication behind his going is that some kind of deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats is now inevitable , which is anathema to the publishers and editors who want to see David Cameron 's Conservatives assume power .
10.47 am : Senior Tories have been trying very hard to be polite about the Liberal Democrats .
When William Hague briefed journalist in the House of Commons last night , he adopted the tone of someone who was mildly disappointed by the behaviour of his negotiating partners but determined not to let one episode spoil a promising relationship .
George Osborne took much the same tack in the broadcast interviews he gave this morning .
But is this what they really think about Nick Clegg ?
Sir Malcolm
Rifkind gave a much more plausible account of the Tory verdict on the Lib Dems when he told the BBC just now that he was " saddened , depressed and very angry " by the behaviour of Clegg and his team .
This is what Rifkind said , according to PoliticsHome .
For the last few days I assumed , I think a lot of people assumed , that Mr Clegg was acting in an actually very honorable way .
He 'd said quite openly after the election that the Conservatives were by far the largest party , 2 million more votes than Labour .
We now discover that yesterday , when Liberal Democrat spokesmen were still saying publicly ' talks are going very well , very constructive , just a bit of clarification required , ' it now turns out he was having secret meetings with Gordon Brown .
10.52 am : My colleague Julia Kollewe is writing a market turmoil live blog .
She says the government 's auction of gilts went very well this morning .
There was speculation that the markets might take fright at the prospect of a Labour / Lib Dem minority government .
But it does not seem to stop people wanting to lend money to the government .
Julia says the gilt auction was covered 2.47 times , " indicating healthy demand from investors for the government bonds " .

10.59 am : More about purple ties ( see 10.23 am ) : Nick Clegg was wearing one yesterday too .
You can see it in the picture on page 4 of the Guardian .
Maybe we should have spotted that something was up .
11.06 am : What should the Lib Dems do ?
Mark Thompson , a prominent Lib Dem blogger , has put up a long post explaining the dilemma .
He concludes that the Lib Dems should back the Tories .
Gordon Brown has promised instant legislation to bring in AV for the Commons and a referendum on something more proportional .
There are numerous problems with this approach but the most fundamental one is that even with all the nationalists and parties that would support AV and a referendum would get us to about 330 votes with about 315 ranged against it from the Conservatives and their Northern Ireland partners .
It would only take a few Labour MPs to vote against this for it to fall .
And having conversed with some Labour backbench MPs I am convinced that there would be enough for this to happen .
11.19 am : The Lib Dem MP Bob Russell has told BBC that he thought Labour candidates were " jockeying behind the scenes to become leader of the opposition rather than the prime minister of a minority government " .
11.20 am : Nick Clegg has just left his south - west London home .
" I 'm certainly hopeful of getting a resolution as quickly as possible , " was all he would say .
11.37 am : Gary Gibbon on his Channel 4 blog has been speaking to MPs who were at the Lib Dem meeting last night .
He thinks a Tory / Lib Dem deal is now looking more probable .
Danny Alexander told MPs that the Labour negotiating team ( or more precisely one half of it – the two Eds , Miliband and Balls ) were not giving off good vibes .
The whole body language of the Labour parliamentary party was bad .
Ministers were knackered and most had already disengaged from their jobs .
These opening addresses changed the mood music from the afternoon meeting .
A key early speech was from Vince Cable .
He has been remarkably silent since the talks began .
Last night he began , like most contributors to the debate , with a " heart beats on the left , I never thought I 'd be saying this " sort of approach .
Then he acknowledged the arguments of the leadership .
Later speakers included David Heath , who pointed out how the overlap with the Conservatives on areas like civil liberties would n't have been there in earlier years .
A key mover in the debate was the sense that Labour might talk about voting reform but they would not have the parliamentary strength or the internal discipline in the Labour party to deliver it .
11.43am : Alan Johnson has today given his strong backing to the attempts to form a Labour / Lib Dem pact .
He has just issued this statement .
As I have said consistenly , renewning our politics means changing our electoral system .
I wholeheartedly support working in partnership with the Liberal Democrats to secure the economic recovery , protect frontline public services and ensure British people 's views are reflected in parliament .
11.51 am : Caroline Lucas , the new Green party MP , would not enter a formal coalition with Labour and the Lib Dems ( or the Tories and the Lib Dems ) .
She will vote in the Commons on a case - by - case basis .
The Guardian 's environment network has more here .
12.09 pm : Lord Kinnock told the BBC's Daily Politics show that a Labour / Lib Dem deal would last , but that there needs to be a decision soon .
It 's certainly possible , and a deal would be durable over a limited period of time , 24 - 36 months say , with a clear declaration that an election were held in that time ...
Today or at the latest tomorrow an arrangement must be struck by two parties at a minimum .
12.19 pm : I 've been fielding some interesting questions from readers and colleagues .
Here 's an attempt to provide some answers .
Labour and Lib Dem signs in a garden in London .
Photograph : Paul Owen
Q : How long will this last ?
A : David Cameron has said he wants a decision very soon .
Waiting five days for a government may seem like a long time .
But by international standards it is not long at all .
A report for the Institute for Government found that in countries where hung parliaments are the norm forming an adminstration normally take more than 20 days .
But in Britain there is a deadline .
The Commons is due to meet a week today , on May 18 , to elect a new Speaker and start swearing in MPs .
At that point they 've going to have to decide who sits on the government benches .
Q : Would Labour MPs vote in favour of a referendum on PR ?
A : Most would , but not all .
Some Labour MPs are strongly committed to first - past - the - post .
In the last parliament there were estimates that as many as 40 Labour MPs were opposed to AV or other forms of electoral reform .
Labour 's manifesto committed the party to a referendum on AV and , in a crunch vote , MPs will tend to side with the leadership .
But it would be suprising if some MPs did not rebel on a vote on this issue .
Q : Do Labour and the Lib Dems need to get the smaller parties to join a coalition ?
A : No. Gordon Brown is prime minister and he is entitled to remain prime minister until defeated in the House of Commons on the Queen 's speech or a motion of confidence .
If Labour and the Lib Dems join forces , they will have 315 votes , not a majority but more than the Tories .
The small parties will have nothing to gain from voting with the Tories against the Queen 's speech .
A Labour / Lib Dem government would have to cooperate with the smaller parties on a case - by - case basis , but it would not need a formal agreement .
Q : What happens if the Lib Dems join a Labour government but do n't like the new Labour leader ?
A : They would have to decide whether to put up with him ( and it probably will be a him ) or to walk away .
But in practice , if a Labour / Lib Dem coalition does get formed , the ability to work with the Lib Dems would become an important factor in a Labour leadership contest .
Q : Do any Labour or Tory MPs actually want to end up in opposition ?
A : Some Labour figures seem to think their party would benefit from a spell in opposition .
David Blunkett is the most senior to flirt with this thesis , arguing that the party needs to accept that it lost and to start the process of renewal .
There are no Tories thinking along these lines , although some of them believe that if Labour and the Lib Dems were to form a coalition , it would collapse in the autumn , leading to an election that a well - funded Conservative party should be able to win decisively .
Q : Is a national government , involving Labour and the Tories , unthinkable ?
A : Yes .
At one stage Frank Field floated the idea , but there is no support for it at Westminster .
And who would provide the opposition ?
Governments need oppositions .
Labour acccepted the invitation to join a national government in world war two .
But the global financial crisis does not provide an existential threat to the UK of the kind posed by Hitler .
12.23 pm : Douglas Alexander , Labour 's general election coordinator , has ruled out a coalition with the SNP .
" I ca n't envisage circumstances in which we enter coalition with the SNP , " he said .
12.46 pm : It 's been a frustrating morning .
The talks process has been continuing , and plenty of people have been commenting , but very little firm information has come out about what 's going on .
But here 's a lunchtime summary of what we know .
• Gordon Brown has just arrived in the House of Commons where talks have been taking place between the Labour and the Lib Dem negotiating teams .
Ed Balls , a member of Labour 's team , said this morning that they had had a good meeting with the Lib Dems last night .
Asked how long it would take , Balls said : " It will take the time it takes , but I think everybody wants to do this as soon as we possibly can . "
• Nick Clegg has said that that talks between the parties have reached " a critical and final phase " .
The Lib Dem leader said this morning : " I really hope that we will be able to make an announcement so we clear up everything and explain to people exactly what our thinking is as quickly as we possibly can . "
His MPs are due to be meeting this afternoon , although a time for the meeting has not been announced .
There are some suggestions that the mood in the Lib Dem camp is moving back in favour of a deal with the Tories .
The Lib Dem federal executive is expected to meet at 7.30 pm .
( See 9.31 am and 11.37 am )
• David Cameron has said that it is " decision time " .
The Tory leadership has been polite about the Lib Dems in public , but Sir Malcolm Rifkind has said that he is " depressed and very angry " about the behaviour of the Lib Dems .
( See 9.31 am and 10.47am )
• Labour has ruled out inviting the SNP to join a Labour / Lib Dem coalition .
( See 12.23 pm )
12.50 pm : This is from Julia Kollewe 's market turmoil live blog .
This sounds ominous .
A Lib -Lab pact would " almost guarantee " a downgrade of the UK 's top - notch credit rating because both parties oppose early spending cuts to reduce the government deficit , according to analysts at BNP Paribas .
They advised investors to sell the pound against the dollar .
" A Labour / Liberal government is the least - liked option by markets and would almost guarantee a downgrade of the UK sovereign , " the analysts said .
This is because " both parties agree that early expenditure cuts could harm the economy . "
12.53 pm : Do read this .
My colleague Polly Toynbee has been taking soundings from some Lib Dems and she says they are getting the impression that some on the Labour side are not serious about striking a deal .
Polly Toynbee Photograph : Linda Nylind
Talking to some high - ups on the progressive wing of the Lib Dems , they worry that some the Labour chief negotiators are just going through the motions while putting serious obstacles in the way .
They fear many in Labour agree with the neanderthal tendency represented by David Blunkett – no deal is better than giving true proportional representation to the Lib Dems .
This is odd and unexpected : they say Lords Mandelson and Adonis are extraordinarily positive and willing to give most things on the radical Lib Dem agenda .
Surprisingly it is those you might think on the left – Harriet Harman , Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who are foot - dragging .
This team of negotiators claim Labour can't guarantee to get real PR through the party and none seem keen on it anyway .
Their attitude , say my informants , is far from welcoming .
The suspicion is they would prefer to sit on the opposition bench and watch the Lib Dems be slaughtered by tying themselves to the Conservatives .
1.01 pm : This could be significant .
Conservative Way Forward , a Thatcherite ginger group within the Conservative party , has issued a statement saying it has " considerable concern " about the state of the coalition talks with Lib Dems .
It wants David Cameron to form a minority Conservative government .
The full text of the statement is now on ConservativeHome .
Conservative Way Forward probably is n't as influential as it used to be , but it does represent the views of a section of the Conservative party .
( Lady Thatcher is its honorary president , and its honorary vice presidents include William Hague , Liam Fox and David Davis . )
It wants Cameron to reject a coalition .
But , as William Hague explained to journalists last night , the Lib Dems are now insisting on coalition or nothing .
George Osborne dealt with the " minority govenrment " option on the Today programme this morning .
( See 8.39 am ) " We can't just turn up at Buckingham Palace and say we'd like to form a minority government , " he said .
My colleague Patrick Wintour has written a blog saying that many Labour MPs are opposed to a deal with the Lib Dems .

There is a large group in the parliamentary Labour party that does not want to do a deal with the Lib Dems at any price .
It is the same tendency that scuppered a Lib - Lab deal back in 1997 .
Electoral reform has been a red line to many Labour MPs .
There is also resentment in parts of the Labour party at the way in which this has been handled .
They feel that in comparison with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives , there has been no consultation .
The Labour MPs are not due to meet until tomorrow .
For some people in the party anything that Lord Mandelson has had a hand in must by definition be tainted .
" The Labour party is not the personal plaything of Lord Mandelson , " said one party member claiming to speak on behalf of a potential leadership candidate .
1.27 pm : The Unite union ( Labour 's largest single financial backer ) has issued a letter backing a Labour - Lib Dem deal .
The letter , from the joint general secretaries Tony Woodley and Derek Simpson , has been sent to the 100 - odd MPs who belong to the Unite parliamentary group .
As you know Labour are now in formal talks with the Liberal Democrats to see if we can agree a stable government to secure the economic recovery and change our politics .
Together we can form a progressive coalition , a coalition that would reflect that over 60 % of the population rejected the Tories last week .
We believe that this represents the best option for the future of the country at this difficult time .
It is trade union members that would pay with their jobs for a Tory government that would cut immediately and strangle the economic recovery at birth .
1.31 pm : Sir Macolm
Rifkind 's language is getting more colourful by the hour .
This morning he was expressing his anger at the Lib Dems .
Now he is saying that Gordon Brown 's attempt to cling on to power " comes straight out of the Robert Mugabe school of politics " .
1.36 pm : The Tory negotiating team is talking to the Lib Dems this afternoon .
William Hague has just announced this on Twitter :
Will be returning to the Cabinet Office shortly to resume negotiations with the Liberal Democrats .
1.48 pm : David Cameron and Nick Clegg met for an hour this morning , Lib Dem sources have revealed .
1.53 pm : My colleague Hélène Mulholland has been taking soundings among Labour MPs .
She has sent me comments from a couple of them who are opposed to a deal with the Lib Dems .
This is from a veteran backbencher :
I find it hard to feel positively - minded towards a Lib Dem deal for two reasons .
First , the arithmetic does n't stack up , and it 's quite hard to see how you get a stable government .
I am sure you could get an agreement but how long that would last is another matter .
The second is I think the Lib Dems are acting in an unseemly manner .
Tendering maybe appropriate for a building contract but I am not sure it 's appropriate here .
This feels like competitive bidding for something and somebody will be punished for this and I do n't want it to be the Labour party .
And this is from a senior Labour MP :
I 'm not in favour of Lib - Labbery , full stop .
I think they are our political enemy .
There is a massive problem with their attitude to the trade unions .
I 'm in favour of AV but that 's it .
The government could not deliver anything but AV through the House of Commons .
Half the PLP [ parliamentary Labour party ] will vote against it and the Tories will too .
It can not be done .
1.54 pm : Ed Miliband , a member of the Labour negotiating team , told the BBC that there was a " good atmosphere " in his talks with the Lib Dem team this morning .
He said there were " many points of agreement " , but certain points had to be " worked through " .
2.00 pm : The Lib Dem negotiating team has gone into the Cabinet Office for their talks with the Tories .
They did not say anything on the way in .
The Conservatives are coming now .
Oliver Letwin , William Hague and George Osborne arrive at the Cabinet Office to speak to the Lib Dems today .

2.06 pm : This is what William Hague said as he led the Tory negotiating team into the Cabinet Office :
As you know , we believe believe very strongly that there should be a government with a strong and secure majority in the House of Commons and of course with an elected prime minister .
We remain very very firmly of that view .
We set out our proposals to achieve that yesterday and we have come here to hear the Liberal Democrat response .
2.25 pm : According to Sky's Miranda Richardson , Labour 's Kate Hoey has said that she and many of her colleagues are not in favour of PR .
Labour should be " magnanimous in defeat " , she said .
The BBC's Iain Watson said that Labour MPs opposed to a deal with the Lib Dems were planning to meet to discuss how to thwart a deal .
2.52 pm : Andy Burnham has said that Labour should " respect the results of the general election " .
He has clearly indicated that he is opposed to a Labour - Lib Dem deal .
Paul Waugh has got the key quote on his blog .
Burnham , the health secretary , used an argument similar to the one being deployed by David Blunkett and John Reid :
I think we have got to respect the results of the general election and we can't get away from the fact that Labour did n't win .
Burnham also said that David Blunkett – who set out his views in a Guardian article today – has spoken with " real authority " on this matter .
Burnham is a member of the cabinet .
If a Labour - Lib Dem coalition does happen , will he resign ?
Or is he only speaking out because he has concluded that the Labour - Lib Dem talks are heading for the buffers ?
3.01 pm : At Left Foot Forward , Will Straw is now arguing that the best outcome for progressives would be a Conservative minority government .
He explains his reasoning here , but to understand his argument in full you also need to read this post he wrote this morning .
Straw proposes a five - point way ahead for progressives which concludes with this :
Labour announces that it will stand aside in 60 Tory - Lib Dem marginal seats .
In return , the Liberal Democrats announce that they will give Labour a free run in 30 seats where they are in third place or below .
3.06 pm : I 've found another good account of the Lib Dem meeting last night ( see 11.37 am ) .
It 's by Alex Barker , who has posted it at the FT 's Westminster blog .
He has identified various developments , including Vincent Cable coming out in favour of a deal with the Tories .
So far Cable has kept his powder dry .
He 's a former Labour man .
But last night he acknowledged that those arguing for a Tory deal were probably right .
( There was a wise crack about feeling he was being " set up " to wield the public spending axe . )
As a senior figures representing the old - SDP wing , this is a significant development .
On the BBC just now the Tory blogger Iain Dale said that he thought Nick Clegg and Cable were both firmly in favour of deal with Cameron , but that they were being opposed by Lord Ashdown ( see 9.57 am ) and Sir Menzies Campbell .

3.11 pm : Here 's a contender for quote of the day ( because I 'm disqualifying Sir Malcolm Rifkind for hyperbole - see 1.31 pm ) .
It 's from a senior Liberal Democrat , quoted in a Press Association story .
We are on an island with the Tories , but some people hope a lifeboat driven by Ed Balls is going to come along .
What they do n't realise is that lifeboat is going in the wrong direction and it 's sinking .
3.17 pm : John Prescott is practically allergic to Liberal Democrats .
But he is backing the plan for a coalition with Labour .
The reality is about jobs – not proportional representation , not jobs in the cabinet , not who is going to be the next prime leader – but how do we keep our economy stable ... and Gordon Brown actually produced that in the last 12 months .
Can we just let 's see if Gordon Brown can get an agreement with the Liberals ?
If that 's the case , let 's get on with government and keep the economy on a stable footing .
That to me is the issue .
3.19 pm : Sam Coates from the Times has put this on Twitter :
Against lab - lib coalition at cabinet yesterday - burnham straw byrne khan ainsworth
3.32 pm : Diana Johnson , the schools minister and Labour MP for Hull North , has come out against a Labour - Lib Dem deal .
I just do n't think that , with us at 258 MPs , the numbers stack up .
It 's just on arithmetic – if you look at the figures and what the Liberal Democrats would bring and various other parties would bring , I just do n't think the numbers stack up .
There might be ways round it , but I do n't think the numbers are there .
Nick Clegg returns to his home in London today .

3.48 pm : Here 's a mid-afternoon summary .
• A deal between the Tories and the Lib Dems is now looking likely .
The Lib Dem negotiating team is now talking again to the Tories Last night the Conservatives did not have any plans to talk to the Lib Dems again .
But the talks started again at 2 pm , at the Cabinet Office .
William Hague announced on Twitter that they were taking place .
As Hague went in , he said that he was there to hear what the Lib Dems had to say about the offer made by David Cameron last night .
The Lib Dems are holding a joint meeting of their MPs and their federal executive at 7.30 pm tonight .
( See 2.06 pm . )
• David Cameron and Nick Clegg met for an hour at lunchtime , according to the BBC .
• William Hill have stopped taking bets on who the Lib Dems will form a pact with after a flood of money came in from punters betting on a Tory - Lib Dem deal .
• New evidence has emerged about the extent of Labour opposition to a deal with the Lib Dems .
Yesterday John Reid – the former home secretary , but no longer an MP – was about the only senior figure to speak out against a Labour - Lib Dem pact .
Today David Blunkett has said that a deal of that kind would be a mistake .
Diana Johnson , a schools minister , has said she does not think a coalition would have the votes to survive .
Andy Burnham , the health secretary , has hinted strongly that he agrees , saying : " I think we have got to respect the results of the general election and we can't get away from the fact that Labour did n't win . "
( See 2.52 pm and 3.32 pm . )
• Gordon Brown has been meeting colleagues in Downing Street .
Ed Miliband , a member of the Labour negotiating team , said there was a " good atmosphere " when Labour 's team met the Lib Dem team this morning .
But there are some reports that the talks did not go well .
( See 12.53 pm and 1.53 pm . )
• Conservative Way Forward , a Thatcherite ginger group in the Tory party , has urged Cameron not to go into coalition with the Lib Dems .
This is potentially quite serious because Conservative Way Forward represents one important strand of thought in the party .
But Tory MPs have not openly criticised Cameron 's negotiating tactics .
By contrast , some Labour figures are openly attacking Brown 's stance .
( See 1.01 pm . )
3.55 pm : Labour has given up talking to the Lib Dems , according to the BBC .
This is what Laura Kuenssberg has put out on Twitter .
No 10 sources recognise talks with the libs and labour are over and working out how to declare their side of the negotiation is at an end
4.00 pm : Laura Kuenssberg has just said on BBC News that she has seen bags being loaded into cars at the back of Downing Street .
" Large hold - alls " , she said .
She is implying that the Browns are getting ready to leave .
4.08 pm : The London Evening Standard is going to splash on Gordon Brown being gone " tonight " , according to Sky 's Niall Patterson .
4.15 pm : My colleague Allegra Stratton has been taking soundings in the Lib Dem camp .
She says that frontbenchers started selling the idea of a pact with the Tories to MPs this morning .
MPs – even those thought to be in favour of a deal with Labour – were found to be surprisingly receptive to the proposal .
4.19 pm : Sky News has is running a news strap saying : " Evening Standard newspaper reports Gordon Brown has quit as prime minister . "
I 've just called Downing Street .
Brown is still prime minister .
He has not resigned – yet .
But , to be fair to the Standard , Sky has not got it quite right .
Here 's the Standard story .
It says Brown is about to quit .
Gordon Brown is set to resign tonight and allow David Cameron to be Britain 's new prime minister .
The Labour leader 's final desperate attempt to cling on to power with a Lib - Lab deal crumbled amid a rebellion on his own side and policy disagreements with Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .
This afternoon he retreated to No 10 to discuss his situation with senior ministers , friends and wife Sarah .
4.26 pm : Here are some extracts from Julia Kollewe on her market turmoil live blog .
First she posted this :
Gilt futures rally to a session high on reports that the talks between Labour and the Lib Dems are " temporarily " over , and the pound is climbing again , to $ 1.4880 .
Then a few minutes later she posted this :
The Evening Standard reports that Gordon Brown is set to resign tonight and allow David Cameron to become prime minister .
The paper quotes a friend of Brown as saying : " The deal with Clegg was just not doable . "
The pound is now trading around $ 1.4906 .
The FTSE is recovering and is now only down 52 points at 5335.43 , a drop of 0.97 % .
4.46 pm : Apparently the Liberal Democrats have booked a venue for a special conference on Saturday .
And they have also started to prepare ballot papers for a ballot of the entire membership .
Under the so - called " triple lock " in the party rulebook , there are provisions to consult the entire membership about any proposal that would " affect the party 's independence of political action " .
This is what the triple lock says in full .
Conference agrees that :
( i ) in the event of any substantial proposal which could affect the Party 's independence of political action , the consent will be required of a majority of members of the Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons and the Federal Executive ; and ,
( ii ) unless there is a three - quarters majority of each group in favour of the proposals , the consent of the majority of those present and voting at a Special Conference convened under clause 6.6 of the Constitution ; and ,
( iii ) unless there is a two - thirds majority of those present and voting at that Conference in favour of the proposals , the consent of a majority of all members of the Party voting in the ballot called pursuant to clause 6.11 or 8.6 of the Constitution .
The triple lock was approved by the Lib Dem in conference in 1998 because activists were worried that Paddy Ashdown wanted to take the Lib Dems into a coalition with Labour ( see 9.57 am ) .
As the Lib Dems interpret this clause , Nick Clegg would not need a special conference if three - quarters of the parliamentary party and three - quarters of the federal executive approve a coalition .
But I 'm told that Clegg is preparing for a special conference and a membership ballot anyway to give the move extra legitimacy .
4.47 pm : Adrian Sanders , the Lib Dem MP for Torbay , has put a post on Facebook saying his party will do a deal with the Tories .
I thought Labour would want to form a reform coalition even though the arithmetic was tight .
It would only take a couple of Labour MPs to rule out an agreement and it would be dead in the water .
Today several Labour MPs have been ruling out the chance of such a coalition and forcing us to produce a stable government in the best interests of the country with the Conservatives .
4.48 pm : Kevan Jones , a Labour MP and a defence minister , has said Labour should admit defeat and go into opposition .
William Green has got the quote on his blog .
We should listen to the electorate .
We lost the election .
It is now time to go into opposition and make sure we can defend the north east against what is going to be quite a nasty Tory government .
4.50 pm : Lord Mandelson has just left Downing Street .
He was wearing his impassive , non-responsive face as he got into his car .
He did not respond to questions .
4.56 pm : Is n't 24 - hour news mad ?
Earlier I mentioned Laura Kuenssberg 's observation that hold - alls were being loaded into a car at the back of Downing Street ( 4 pm ) .
She suggested that it might be a sign the Browns were leaving .
A few minutes late the BBC reported that they did not belong to the Browns .
Then someone suggested they might belong to the Darlings .
Now Jon Sopel has said that they were n't the Darlings ' either .
It turns out they contained police kit .
5.00 pm : This is good .
We 've got a picture of the notes on which Nick Clegg set out his negotiating demands .
You can read Graeme Robertson and Allegra Stratton 's story about it , and read the note itself , alongside the Guardian 's crib as to what it means .
5.15 pm : George Pascoe - Watson , the former Sun political editor , thinks the Lib Dems will get six cabinet posts in a Tory - Lib Dem coalition , and that Nick Clegg will become deputy prime minister .

5.47 pm : Events have moved very quickly in the last two hours .
Westminster is now on standby for a change of government soon , perhaps tonight .
Nothing has been announced formally , and journalists have been making what has now become a collective assessment on the basis of unattributable briefings and nods and winks .
But the London Evening Standard has said that Gordon Brown is set to resign and no one has made any attempt to persuade the media that that 's wrong .
Here 's an early - evening summary .
• Gordon Brown is expected to resign as prime minister at some point soon .
Brown 's hopes of staying in office depended upon getting the Lib Dems to go into coalition with Labour .
The Lib Dem team met the Labour team this morning .
But today it became clear that there was widespread opposition to a deal within the Labour party .
Lib Dem MPs are being told that a deal with Labour seemed unworkable and Labour has now abandoned its talks with the Lib Dems .
David Cameron and Nick Clegg have arranged to meet their MPs later tonight .
The Lib Dem meeting is at 7.30 pm , and the Tory meeting is due at 8 pm , although there are reports that it could be brought forward .
• The Tories and the Lib Dems are still negotiating the terms of a coalition .
The two teams have been in the Cabinet Office talking to each other for more than three and a half hours .
It 's not clear how long the talks will take .
But it is thought that they are finalising a deal that would govern the conduct of a coalition government perhaps for the next two years , and so they have every incentive to get it right .
The length of the talks may well determine whether Brown resigns tonight or tomorrow .
6.05 pm : Gordon Brown is not going to resign straight away as an MP , in the way that Tony Blair did when he left No 10 .
My colleague Severin Carrell has sent me this .

Alex Rowley , Brown 's close friend and Labour leader in Fife , has denied suggestions that Brown will stand down as an MP after resigning as prime minister .
Adam Boulton on Sky reported there was speculation inside the Labour cabinet that the prime minister could stand down as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath in the same way that Tony Blair stood down as MP for Sedgefield after he resigned as PM in 2007 .
Asked if that was accurate , Rowley said : " Definitely not ; he 's still the MP and that 's not going to change . "
6.07 pm : My colleague Hélène Mulholland has been talking to Labour figures .
She says there are discussions under way about having a leadership contest in July , but they might have to hold it later because leadership elections are expensive and it might take longer to raise the money .
6.10 pm : Sky's Jon Craig is suggesting the Tory - Lib Dem deal will cover three years .
6.18 pm : # thankyougordon is now trending on Twitter .
Left Foot Forward has got a selection .
6.21 pm : Labour 's national executive committee met this afternoon .
Members agreed to meet " in the days and weeks ahead " to determine the timetable and the procedures for electing a new leader .
6.27 pm : Labour has put a post on Twitter saying that 1,000 people have joined the party since yesterday .
Is that because people are glad that Gordon Brown is going ?
Or are they joining so they can vote for the new leader ?
6.35 pm : According to Nick Robinson , Gordon Brown and his colleagues are putting a brave face on things in No 10 .
Robinson has just said that he 's been told they 've been telling jokes .
Brown is with his closest allies : Ed Balls , Lord Mandelson , Sue Nye , and Douglas Alexander .
Tony Blair has spoken to Brown by phone .
New Labour started with Brown , Blair and Mandelson .
As the government comes to an end , they 're still yoked together .
6.42 pm : Benedict Brogan on his blog says Vincent Cable has been seen in the Treasury this afternoon .
It seems the impossibility of a deal with Labour became increasingly apparent as the day progressed .
Its internal divisions on PR and the future are too great .
It also appears that Mr Clegg told his MPs last night that he remained committed to a deal with the Tories because it was the logical thing to do .
Senior figures endorsed the view , telling him their heart was with Labour but their heads said go with the Tories , chief among them apparently Vince Cable .
Saint Vince must see an opportunity .
Which may be why he was seen this afternoon in the Treasury holding meetings with private office people .
Is the Chief Secretary job on offer ?
6.46 pm : The BBC are saying there will be an announcement outside the Cabinet Office in 20 minutes .
7.04 pm : Some more news about the Tory / Lib Dem negotiations .
My colleague Hélène Mulholland says the Tories were surprised that the Lib Dems decided not to make an issue of immigration in the talks .
In their manifesto the Lib Dems proposed an amnesty for long - term illegal immigrants ( although Nick Clegg did not like the term – he preferred to talk about earned citizenship ) .
Clegg had difficulty selling the policy during the campaign and it seems that he has now agreed to drop it , or at least not insist on it as coalition policy .
7.09 pm : On his blog , Newsnight 's Michael Crick quotes an unnamed Liberal Democrat MP who told him he was amazed how much the Tories were willing to compromise .
The MP told Crick :
I can't believe how much they 've offered us .
The Tories have basically rubbed out their manifesto and inserted ours .
We 'll have to cope for four or five years with our flesh creeping , but still .
7.10 pm : Outside Downing
Street they 've set up the podium .
Brown will be coming out soon to resign .
It 's going to look like the second resignation speech in the course of just over 24 hours , although of course yesterday he did n't actually resign .
7.17 pm : We still know very little about the nature of the coalition deal .
But if the Lib Dems are happy with it , it 's safe to assume that many of the Tory manifesto promises favoured by the right will have been ditched .
The inheritance tax increase is likely to be a goner .
The marriage tax break may not survive in any meaningful form .
The Cameroons may be quite happy about this .
The inheritance tax cut proposal became a liability during the election campaign .
But there are already suggestions that the right , and the rightwing press , are unhappy .
There is also speculation around tonight about Ken Clarke going to the Treasury instead of George Osborne .
That would go down well with the Lib Dems too .

7.18 pm : Gordon and Sarah Brown have come out of No 10 .
7.19 pm : Brown says he is going to go to the Queen and resign .
7.19 pm : He will advise the Queen to invite the leader of the opposition to become prime minister .
He wishes the new PM well .
7.20 pm : He says that he promised to do all he could to make sure a strong government was formed .
He has done all he could to ensure that .
As prime minister , he has learned a lot about the best of human nature and also about its frailties , including his own .
He says he loved the job , but not for its trappings .
7.21 pm : He pays particular tribute to the armed forces .
He mentions looking in their eyes and seeing their courage .
He will never forget that .
7.21 pm : His resignation as Labour leader will take effect immediately .
( Harriet Harman must be acting Labour leader . )
7.22 pm : He thanks his wife .
And as he leaves the second most important he could ever hold , he cherishes even more the first – his job as a husband and father .
7.22 pm : Holding hands with Sarah , he goes back into Downing Street and comes out again with his children , John and Fraser .
Gordon and Sarah Brown and their two sons leave Downing Street after Mr Brown 's resignation today .

7.25 pm : As a family , they walk hand in hand down to the car , which is not parked immediately outside the front door .
Some of my colleagues find the pictures a bit sugary , but I found it sweet and touching .
The children looked delightful .
Brown and his wife Sarah then got into one car to go to the Palace .
The children left Downing Street in another car .
7.25 pm : Sky is saying that Nick Clegg will be deputy prime minister .
7.33 pm : Danny Alexander and the Lib Dem team have just come out of the Cabinet Office .
He said there was a " good atmosphere " in the talks and that they had to report back to their colleagues .
7.37 pm : William Hague has come out of the Cabinet Office .
He said that he had some recommendations that he would take back to his colleagues .
Asked if there was a coalition , he said we would find out soon enough .
As he was speaking , some " troops out " protesters were shouting : " Tory scum . "
7.43 pm : My colleague Hélène Mulholland has just seen Chris Huhne , David Laws and Danny Alexander ( three members of the Lib Dem negotiating team ) walk into the Norman Shaw building , an office building for MPs .
She says they did not look particularly happy .
Protesters were shouting at them : " Do n't do it . "
7.46 pm : William Hague and his team were booed by a crowd of protesters as they walked down Whitehall .
7.49 pm : Gordon Brown has finished his audience with the Queen .
He is now heading to Labour HQ .
Sky says George Osborne will definitely be chancellor in a coalition government .
( So the Ken Clarke rumour – see 7.17 pm – was n't true . )
7.53 pm : Brown has arrived at the Labour HQ on Victoria Street .
Ed Miliband looked morose , Yvette Cooper gave Brown a warm hug , Douglas Alexander looked glum .
Brown shook hands with and greeted a crowd of party workers .
Then he went inside .
7.56 pm : Here is Brown 's resignation speech :
As you know , the general election left no party able to command a majority in the House of Commons .
I said I would do all that I could to ensure a strong , stable and principled government was formed , able to tackle Britain 's economic and political challenges effectively .
My constitutional duty is to make sure that a government can be formed following last Thursday 's general election .
I have informed the Queen 's private secretary that it's my intention to tender my resignation to the Queen .
In the event that the Queen accepts , I shall advise her to invite the leader of the opposition to form a government .
I wish the next prime minister well as he makes the important choices for the future .
Only those who have held the office of prime minister can understand the full weight of its responsibilities and its great capacity for good .
I have been privileged to learn much about the very best in human nature , and a fair amount too about its frailties , including my own .
Above all , it was a privilege to serve .
And , yes , I loved the job , not for its prestige , its title and its ceremony , which I do not love at all .
No , I loved this job for its potential , to make this country I love fairer , more tolerant , more green , more democratic , more prosperous and more just – truly a greater Britain .
In the face of many challenges in a few short years , challenges up to and including the global financial meltdown , I have always strived to serve , to do my best in the interests of Britain , its values and its people .
And let me add one thing also .
I will always admire the courage I have seen in our armed forces .
And now that the political season is over , let me stress that having shaken their hands and looked into their eyes , our troops represent all that is best in our country and I will never forget all those who have died in honour and whose families today live in grief .
My resignation as leader of the Labour party will take effect immediately .
In this hour I want to thank all my colleagues , ministers , members of parliament .
And I want to thank above all my staff who have been friends as well as brilliant servants of the country .
Above all , I want to thank Sarah for her unwavering support , as well as her love , and for her own service to our country .
I thank my sons John and Fraser for the love and joy they bring to our lives .
And as I leave the second most important job I could ever hold I cherish even more the first , as a husband and father .
Thank you and goodbye .

8.05 pm : You can watch a video of Brown 's resignation statement here .
8.06 pm : David Cameron is in the car on his way to the Palace now .
But he seems to have to got stuck in traffic .
He 'll have to take it up with Boris .
8.11 pm : David Cameron just arrived at Buckingham Palace with his wife Samantha .
They 've gone in to the building .
8.17 pm : When Tony Blair became prime minister , he gave a speech announcing his victory as dawn broke over London .
Cameron seems to have had equal luck with the elements .
Apparently there is a rainbow over Buckingham Palace .
8.25 pm : Brown is in Labour HQ delivering a speech to party workers .
He quotes the section from the new clause four about the people achieving more through the strength of their common endeavour .
Photograph : BBC News
He thanks Harriet Harman , " one of the best people you could ever meet , " Douglas Alexander , and Lord Mandelson , one of the architects of New Labour .
He says Labour is very fortunate to have Ray Collins as general secretary and Ann Black as chair of the NEC .
He says he takes responsibility for the fact that Labour did not do better .
He says :
One thing will not change .
I am Labour and Labour I will always be .
He thanks the Labour candidates who never gave up .
Labour went into the election outspent , and with " a difficult media environment " .
But it managed to deny the Tories the victory they had taken for granted .
The campaign showed that committed people count for more than cash .
He recalls meeting a child during the campaign who was exactly the same age as the Labour government .
She grew up in a country where opportunity was taken for granted , he says .
We can be proud that there are people alive in Africa ... because of what we have done for people living thousands of miles away .
He says New Labour 's achievement do not belong to him or Tony Blair .
They belong to the Labour party .
He says the Labour is " and will always be the greatest fighting force for fairness this country has ever seen " .
Labour is " irrepressible " , he says .
" We fight for fairness .
Tomorrow we fight on . "
It was an uplifting speech , without a trace of self - pity or rancour : Brown at his best .
8.29 pm : David Cameron is prime minister , Sky tells us .
In the old days these things used to appear in the London Gazette .
Nowdays it 's a newsflash on Sky .
Simon Lewis , Brown 's press spokesman , is leaving Downing Street , Sky reports .
He will be replaced by a career civil servant from the Treasury .
8.30 pm : Severin Carrell has sent me more from Scotland .
The Press Association has been running a story suggesting that Brown will stand down as an MP .
But Sev has double - checked ; it 's definitely not true .
Alex Rowley , Brown 's election agent and leader of Fife council 's Labour group , said the BBC and PA reports quoting Brown 's friends that he would resign as an MP are " Absolutely untrue .
I 'm his election agent and I 'm saying absolutely not .
He 's staying as an MP .
I saw it running as a strap line on the BBC there as well .
I have been assured late this evening absolutely not ; he 's staying as an MP .
" Nobody is saying he 's going to stay on as an MP forever more but this line that they 're putting out , he 's going to stand down as an MP is simply not the case .
He 's resigned as prime minister and leader of the Labour party but he 's staying as an MP . "
8.36 pm : Here 's a good fact : at aged 43 , seven months and 2 days , Cameron becomes youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 .
Alex Salmond , Scotland 's first minister , has paid tribute to Brown :
For 30 years , Gordon Brown has been at the very forefront of first Scottish and then UK politics .
No one could doubt his powerful intellectual capacity , his commitment , and the strength with which he pursued his objectives .
In his departure , the Labour party have lost not just a leader , but almost a force of nature .
I wish Gordon and his family well for whatever the future holds .
8.41 pm : David Cameron is leaving Buckingham Palace .
Lord Mandelson has suggested that the Lib Dems were never serious about a pact with Labour .
He said this to the BBC .
In the final analysis , I 'm wondering though whether that 's what they actually intended .
When I think about it , I think they were creating so many different barriers and obstacles that perhaps their instincts and perhaps they thought their interests lay on the Tory side , on the Conservative side , rather than on the progressive side .
Vincent Cable has said he would be " very surprised " if the agreement between the Tories and the Lib Dems is unveiled tonight .
Nothing has been formally agreed .
There has been a lot of progress .
The details are currently in the process of being sorted .

8.42 pm : Here 's some constitutional nonsense .
When new prime ministers kiss hands , they do n't actually kiss the Queen 's hand .
But in the past they used to .
Lord Heseltine has just told the BBC that he once kissed hands ( when he joined the privy counsel . )
8.44 pm : Cameron is arriving in Downing Street , with his wife Samantha .
He says the Queen has asked him to form a government and he has accepted .
8.45 pm : He says he and Nick Clegg are forming a joint government .
They are both leaders who want to put aside party interest and work in the national interest .
8.47 pm : Cameron says he believes Britain 's best days lie ahead and that he believes in public service .
He will take difficult decisions , so that together " we can reach better times ahead " .
He wants to restore trust in politics , and ensure that politicians are always the servants of the people , not their masters .
But real change will only take place when people accept responsibility .
He wants to try to build a more responsible society .
8.48 pm : He says his government will protect the vulnerable .
It will be build on values of fairness .
It will be hard and difficult work .
It will through up all sorts of challenges .
8.50 pm : Cameron kisses his wife on the doorstep and heads inside .
8.51 pm : I though Cameron 's speech was a bit lacklustre .
It was very short of memorable phrases .
But I suppose Cameron has had other things to worry about .
8.57 pm : Barack Obama will be on the phone to Cameron in 10 minutes ' time , Sky reports .
9.01 pm : This is what David Cameron said about Brown and Labour 's record in his speech on the steps of Downing Street :
Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to form a new government and I have accepted .
Before I talk about that new government , let me say something about the one that has just passed .
Compared to a decade ago , this country is is more open at home and more compassionate abroad and that is something we should all be grateful for .
And on behalf of the whole country , I would like to pay tribute to the outgoing prime minister for his long record of dedicated public service .
Tony Blair has paid tribute to Brown .
He has issued this statement :
I spoke to Gordon Brown tonight in a warm conversation that reflected a friendship of almost 30 years ' duration .
I pay tribute to the dignity , courage and leadership he has shown in these last few days and to the quite extraordinary service he has given to our country in 13 years of government as chancellor and prime minister and to the cause of social justice at home and abroad .
9.10 pm : The Downing Street website has been updated .
But the Meet the PM page needs a bit of work .
9.12 pm : Simon Hughes has just told Sky that the coalition agreement covers a full four years .
9.21 pm : I 've already posted a short extract from Cameron 's speech outside Downing Street ( see 9.01 pm ) .
Here 's the rest of it .
It 's quite long , but I 'll post it in full because I can't find it anywhere else on the web at the moment .
In terms of the future , our country where no party has an overall majority and we have some deep and pressing problems - a huge deficit , deep social problems , a political system in need of reform .
For those reasons , I aim to form a proper and full coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats .
I believe that is the right way to provide this country with the strong , the stable , the good and decent government that I think we need so badly .
Nick Clegg and I are both political leaders who want to put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest .
I believe that is the best way to get the strong government that we need , decisive Government that we need today .
I came into politics because I love this country , I think its best days still lie ahead and I believe deeply in public service , and I think the service our country needs right now is to face up to our really big challenges , to confront our problems , to take difficult decisions , to lead people through those difficult decisions so that together we can reach better times ahead .
One of the tasks that we clearly have is to rebuild trust in our political system .
Yes , that 's about cleaning up expenses , yes , that 's about reforming parliament , and yes , it 's about making sure people are in control and that the politicians are always their servants and never their masters .
But I believe it's also something else - it 's about being honest about what government can achieve .
Real change is not what government can do on its own , real change is when everyone pulls together , comes together , works together , when we all exercise our responsibilities to ourselves , our families , to our communities and to others .
And I want to help try and build a more responsible society here in Britain , one where we do n't just ask what are my entitlements but what are my responsibilities , one where we do n't ask what am I just owed but more what can I give , and a guide for that society that those that can should and those who can't we will always help .
I want to make sure that my Government always looks after the elderly , the frail , the poorest in our country .
We must take everyone through us on some of the difficult decisions that we have ahead .
Above all it will be a Government that is built on some clear values , values of freedom , values of fairness and values of responsibility .
I want us to build an economy that rewards work , I want us to build a society with stronger families and stronger communities and I want a political system that people can trust and look up to once again .
This is going to be hard and difficult work .
The coalition will throw up all sorts of challenges , but I believe together we can provide that strong and stable government that our country needs , based on those values , rebuilding family , rebuilding community , above all , rebuilding responsibility in our country .
Those are the things I care about , those are the things that this Government will now start work on doing .
Thank you very much .
9.23 pm : Some of the cabinet appointments are starting to leak .
According to Sky , Vincent Cable will be chief secretary to the Treasury , David Laws will be education secretary , Andrew Lansley will be health secretary and William Hague will be foreign secretary .
9.25 pm : I missed this quote earlier , from Lord Mandelson .
He was talking about Brown .
He has shown giant dignity , and like all of us he may not be faultless but he 's certainly fearless .
9.27 pm : David Cameron is still in Downing Street , but he is due to address a meeting of Tory MPs in the Commons at 10 pm .
9.30 pm : My colleague Nick Watt has got some information about the appointments to the new government .
He 's sent me this .
The Lib Dems will be given up to five cabinet posts by David Cameron as he delivers on his pledge last night to have a full and proper coalition government with the Lib Dems .
In an echo of the German grand coalition , Nick Clegg is expected to be appointed deputy prime minister .
Vince Cable , the party 's deputy leader , is being lined up to serve as George Osborne 's deputy as chief secretary to the Treasury .
It is understood that the Lib Dems , who have 11 MPs in Scotland , will be given the Scottish secretary portfolio .
The other Lib Dems in line for Cabinet posts are : Chris Huhne , who ran Nick Clegg a close second in the leadership contest , David Laws , the education spokesman , and Danny Alexander , Clegg 's chief of staff .
It is also understood that the Lib Dems have been given an undertaking that they will have ' sleepers ' at middle and junior ministerial rank in most other departments .
Members of the Lib Dem frontbench being lined up for these jobs include Ed Davey , the foreign affairs spokesman , and Norman Lamb , the
health spokesman .
9.34 pm : Sky is suggesting that Lord Ashdown will become defence secretary .
Sky 's Jon Craig asked Liam Fox about about this , but Fox refused to comment .
9.40 pm : Amidst the excitement of the appointment of a new prime minister , a rather bitter war of words has broken out between Labour and the Liberal Democrats .
They are both blaming each other for their failure to create a " progressive " coalition .
Earlier Lord Mandelson said the Lib Dems were never serious about striking a deal with Labour .
Mandelson suggested they did not have progressive instincts .
( See 8.41 pm ) .
Now the Lib Dems have hit back .
A party spokesman has issued this statement .
It is clear that the Labour Party never took seriously the prospects of forming a progressive , reforming government with the Liberal Democrats .
Key members of Labour 's negotiating team gave every impression of wanting the process to fail and Labour made no attempt at all to agree a common approach with the Liberal Democrats on issues such as fairer schools funding for the most deprived pupils and taking those on low incomes out of tax .
It became clear to the Liberal Democrats that certain key Labour cabinet ministers were determined to undermine any agreement by holding out on policy issues and suggesting that Labour would not deliver on proportional representation and might not marshal the votes to secure even the most modest form of electoral reform .
It is clear that some people in the Labour Party see opposition as a more attractive alternative to the challenges of creating a progressive , reforming government , not least in the context of a Labour leadership election campaign .
Ed Balls and Ed Miliband - two candidates for the Labour leadership - were on the Labour negotiating team .
Balls is thought to be particulary sceptical about electoral reform .
The Lib Dems seem to be blaming him for the failure of the coalition talks .
9.56 pm : My colleague Jill Treanor tells me the gossip in City circles is that Vincent Cable could be given responsibility for the banks and business at the Treasury .
" If that 's true , that will unsettle the banks as the Lib Dems want to split up the banks ' " casino " arms from the high st businesses , which will hurt Barclays , HSBC and the state - controlled RBS , " she tells me .
10.03 pm : My colleague Matt Wells has been reading Alex Salmond 's tribute to Brown ( see 8.36 pm ) and is impressed .
To this former Scotsman reporter who spent quite some time watching the nats and Labour tear lumps out of each other north of the Border , that statement from Alex Salmond is remarkable .
You can't overstate the enmity between the two parties , and Gordon Brown has personally devoted much of his political career trying to beat the nationalists into the ground .
In that context , it 's an extremely gracious statement , and makes the Plaid Cymru remarks seem all the more poorly judged .
Plaid issued a press notice today accusing Labour of " throwing away the opportunity to create an alternative government based on co-operation and consensus , and ... allowing the Tories to threaten Welsh communities with savage cuts . "
It did contain a line praising Brown for the dignity with which he handled his final days in office and wishing him well for the future , but mostly it was a press release attacking Labour .
10.13 pm : My colleague Haroon Siddique says Cameron will be the 19th Old Etonian to become prime minister .
That 's 19th out of 53 including , if you go back to Walpole .
10.18 pm : The Downing Street press office has been in action already .
It has sent out a note about Cameron 's telephone conversation with Obama .
The prime minister , David Cameron , took a call from President Obama shortly after arriving in Downing Street .
The US President offered his congratulations to Mr Cameron on his appointment as prime minister .
He also invited the prime minister to visit the United States in July and said he was looking forward to seeing him in June at G8 and G20 meetings .
They also discussed Afghanistan , the Middle East Peace Process and Iran .
The prime minister also received a call from Chancellor Merkel of Germany who offered her congratulations and invited him to visit Berlin at the earliest opportunity .
They briefly discussed the world economy and the common European agenda .
10.23 pm : At the moment , Cameron is addressing Tory MPs in the Commons .
Clegg is addressing a joint meeting of Lib Dem MPs and the Lib Dem federal executive .
Cameron has already been appointed prime minister and the new government is starting to tick into action .
As far as we can tell , Tory and Lib Dem MPs seem delighted .
But we still do n't know the details of the agreement and backbench MPs are only now finding out .
Effectively , they signed up to the deal before they had read the small print .
That 's partly because Cameron and Clegg have been under pressure to agree a coalition quickly .
As I pointed out earlier ( see 12.19 pm ) in other countries it normally takes much longer .
After I posted that I received an email from an old colleague , John Morrison , who said that as a young Reuters correspondent in the Netherlands in the mid 1970s he reported on Dutch coalition negotiations that went on for six months .
10.35 pm : The old joke about Sky is " never wrong for long " .
Sky is now saying that Liam Fox will be defence secretary .
The Lord Ashdown speculation ( see 9.34 pm ) has been quietly forgotten .
10.42 pm : Nick Clegg refused to comment when asked earlier if he was going to be deputy prime minister .
But the BBC is now saying Clegg is definitely going to get that title .
10.49 pm : Jackie Ashley , Julian Glover and Martin Kettle have all delivered their verdicts on the coalition government at Cif at the polls .
Jackie says Clegg has come out on top .
One can only marvel at the chutzpah of the small yellow party , which came a very poor third in last week 's election .
They appear to have made some very serious dents in the Tory juggernaut .
What their achievement may cost them at the next election is another matter .
But for now , Nick Clegg has proved himself a smarter politician than many had anticipated .
Julian says the Tory modernisers have achived an extraordinary coup .
When parliament returns next week , we will see a different party in the Commons , younger , more diverse and more loyal – at least , for the moment – to Cameron .
That does not mean it will be more liberal : there are many Eurosceptics , tax cutters and climate change doubters .
But they will not be in control .
The Tory modernisers have pulled off the most extraordinary coup .
Martin says many Labour MPs did not want a deal with the Lib Dems .
Either they just hate the Lib Dems , or they hate the party grandees who were negotiating with the Lib Dems , or they simply prefer to be opposition .
For these people , the fact that the arithmetic was a stretch was an excuse , not the deeper reason for opposing the deal .
11.06 pm : Downing Street has confirmed that Nick Clegg has been appointed deputy prime minister .
11.12 pm : The Tories have been briefing on details of the coalition .
One of the most remarkable is that there will be a commitment to hold the next election on the first Thursday in May 2015 ( that 's May 7 ) .
But it is not clear how this will work in practice .
What if the government loses a confidence vote before then ?
Conventionally , the defeat of a government in a confidence vote is supposed to trigger an election .
11.18 pm : It is not entirely clear yet how collective responsibility will be enforced under the new arrangements .
There is at least one area where Lib Dems do not have to support government policy .
According to briefing from the Tories , under the deal Lib Dem MPs will be allowed to abstain on votes introducing a tax break for married couples .
11.22 pm : Under the deal , the Tories have agreed to accept the Lib Dem plan to lift the income tax threshold to £ 10,000 .
This would cost £ 16bn , and details of how the coalition would achieve this seem a bit hazy .
There is no timetable for when this would be achieved , suggesting it wo n't be a priority .
Another pet tax plan may also take a while to come into force .
The Tories have not entirely dropped their plan to raise the inhertance tax threshold to exempt all estates worth less than £ 1 m .
But the Tories now accept that this is unlikely to be achieved in one parliament .
11.31 pm : Poor Danny Alexander .
It looks as if he has been lined up to become Scottish Secretary .
That means he will spend his life defending a ( largely )
Tory administration to a Scottish audience .
That 's not a route to popularity .
The BBC is also suggesting that Chris Huhne could be home secretary .
But that 's not confirmed .
11.40 pm : Vincent Cable has not had much luck with his mansion tax .
When he announced his plans for a new tax on property worth more than £ 1 m at the Lib Dem conference last year , there was an angry backlash from Lib Dem MPs .
Cable had to revise the tax a few weeks later , and declare that it would only cover homes worth more than £ 2 m .
Now the idea has been dropped altogether .
11.45 pm : What are Labour figures saying about the Tory / Lib Dem coalition on Twitter .
Here 's a sample .
From Tom Watson :
I guess we 'll never really know why Deputy Prime Minister Clegg chose to do a deal with David Cameron .
From Denis MacShane :
Bumped into 2 shad cab Tories in Indian rest .
Miserable as they feared Dave had dumped them 4 LibDems .
Diddums
From Alastair Campbell :
Met Ben Bradshaw at Newsnight .
Loads of Liberals defecting to us since Clegg put Cameron in power .
11.59 pm : On Europe , the Lib Dems have agreed to support the Tory plan to introduce legislation saying that any future transfers of power to the EU would have to be approved by the people in a referendum .
The coalition has also agreed not to join the euro .
12.04am : There do n't seem to be any women at the top of the Tory / Lib Dem coalition yet .
On the basis of the reports we 've had so far , the new cabinet will include David Cameron ( PM ) , Nick Clegg ( deputy PM ) , George Osborne ( Chancellor ) , Vince Cable ( chief secretary to the Treasury ) , Andrew Lansley ( health ) , Liam Fox ( defence ) , David Laws ( education ) , Danny Alexander ( Scotland ) and Philip Hammond ( work and pensions ) .
There must be some jobs going to women , but we have n't heard of them yet .
12.13 am : The Lib Dems have just come out of their meeting .
The coalition agreement has been approved overwhelmingly by Lib Dem MPs and by the federal executive .
Asked for a comment , Lord Ashdown said : " Hooray . "
12.16 am : My colleague Hélène Mulholland has been compiled an analysis of the policies agreed by the coalition .
This is a long post , but it is effectively the manifesto for the coalition government , the agenda for the next five years , and so it is worth posting in full .
Economic measures for an agreement which has deficit reduction " at its heart "
• £ 6 b in year cuts in non frontline services subject to the advice from the treasury and the bank of england ( Tory )
• Scrapping of national insurance rises ( Tory )
• A substantial increase in the personal tax allowance from April 2011 with a focus on low and middle income earners , with a " long term goal " of a £ 10,000 personal tax allowance .
There is no a timetable for this , but there is a promise to make further real term steps each year towards this objective .
This is described as a " funded increase " .
It will be funded by taking the money the Tories had planned to use to increase the employee threshold for national insurance , and by an increase in capital gains tax for non business assets to bring it closer to the level of income tax .
• Marriage tax allowance .
The liberal democrats have agreed to abstain on this , which gives the Tories a " real chance " of getting that through .
Lib Dem pledges that have been dropped
• Tax relief for higher rate pensioners will not be pursued
• Mansion tax
Tory pledges that have been dropped
• Raising the threshold on inheritance tax which is described as " unlikely to be achieved in this parliament " .
Lib Dems priorities that have been secured
• Referendum to bring in some form of alternative vote system .
Coalition members will be subject to three - line whip to force the legislation for a referendum through , but they will be free to campaign against the reforms before referendum .
• New pupil premium to be introduced , steering more funding to schools for every child they take from poor homes .
Both parties back this policy , but the Lib Dem version attaches more money to it .
• Reducing the tax burden on low earners .
This could go some way towards the Lib Dem aim of lifting tax threshold to £ 10,000 .
• A wholly or mainly elected house of Lords .
• More equal constituency sizes
• Fixed term parliaments , including this one .
The next general election will be held on the first Thursday of May 2015 .
Legislation will mean such agreements can only be broken by an enhanced majority of the House of Commons .
Tory priorities that have been secured
• A cap on immigration and an end to child detention immigration controls ( the latter was a Lib Dem proposal ) .
• Welfare reform programme to be implemented in full .
• School reform programme providing all schools are held accountable .
• A commitment to maintaining Britain 's nuclear deterrent .
Renewal of Trident will be scrutinised to ensure value for money .
Liberal Democrats will be free to continue the case for alternatives .
• The government will make no proposals to join the euro .
• No proposals to transfer new powers to the European Union .
• A referendum lock will ensure that any proposal to transfer new powers must by law be put to a referendum .
Areas that were already in agreement will see a major programme of civil liberties
• A great repeal or freedom bill to scrap the ID card scheme and the national identity register and the next generation of biometric passports
• Extending the scope of the Freedom of Information bill to provide greater transparency
* Adopt protections of the Scottish model for the DNA database
• Protecting trial by jury
• Reviewing libel laws to protect freedom of speech
• Further regulation of CCTV and other items
• Measures to boost economy in key areas such as low - carbon industries and investment in infrastructure .
A green investment bank , a smart grid , retention of energy performance certificates while scrapping home information packs .
Areas of opt outs for either party
• Lib Dems will be free to maintain their opposition to nuclear power while permitting the government to put forward the national planning statement for ratification by parliament so that new nuclear construction becomes possible .
Banking reform
• A banking levy will be introduced .
• Bonuses will be tackled .
• A " more competitive banking industry " .
• More credit to flow to businesses .
The proposals of the respective parties will be looked at before deciding which is the better one .
• An independent commission will be set up to consider Lib Dem proposals to separate retail and investment banking and the Tories ' proposals for a quasi separation .
An interim report will be published within a year .
• The Bank of England could be given control of macro prudential regulation and oversight of micro prudential regulation under proposals to be put forward .
12.38 am : Nick Clegg is giving a press conference now .
He starts with a tribute to Gordon Brown .
And he says he wants to produce not just a new government , but a new kind of government .
12.51 am : David Cameron has just arrived home .
At his West London home , not the new one .
12.56 am : Here is the full text of Clegg 's speech .
Tonight the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party and the federal executive of Liberal Democrat party have overwhelmingly accepted my recommendation that we should now enter into a coalition government with the Conservative party .
Before I say anything more about that coalition government I would like to express my thanks and admiration for Gordon Brown .
He has been a towering figure for more than a decade in British politics and the manner in which he has acted over the last few days has displayed immense dignity , grace and a profound sense of public duty .
We are now going to form a new government , more importantly we are going to form a new kind of government .
I hope this is the start of the new politics I have always believed in : diverse , plural , when politicians of different persuasions come together to overcome their differences in order to deliver a good government for the sake of the whole country .
That was what we were asked to do by the people of Britain at the general election last week , and that is now what we will seek to deliver .
I would like to thank David Cameron for the very positive , constructive and workman like way in which we have been able to reach a basic agreement on how we can come together in this new coalition government over the last few days .
We are politicians , clearly of different political parties , but I believe we are now united in wishing to tackle the challenges this country faces and to deliver a fairer better Britain , and I look forward to working with him to do just that .
There will of course be glitches .
But I will always do my best to prove that new politcs is n't just possible , it 's also better .
I would like to say something directly to the nearly 7 million people who supported the Liberal Democrats in the general electoin last week .
I am acutely aware that I carry your hopes , your aspirations with me into this coaltion .
I can imagine this evening that you will be having many questions , many many doubts about this new government .
But I want to assure you that I would not have entered into this agreement if I had not been genuinely convinced that it offers a unique opportunity to deliver the kind of change which you and I would like to see : fairer taxes ; a fair start in life for every child in this country ; a new start for our discredited banking system and the prospect of new , sustainable growth in our economy ; and a new hopeful politics that you can trust once again .
So I hope you will keep faith with us , I hope you will let us prove to you that we can serve you and this country with humility , with fairness at heart of everthing we do , and with total dedication to the interests and livelihoods of everyone in Great Britain .
Thank you .
1.00 am : That 's it .
Britain has got its first coalition government for more than 60 years .
And Nick Clegg will be sitting in cabinet alongside Liam Fox and William Hague .
Will it work ?
Who knows .
But it is a bold project , and it will be certainly be interesting .
We 'll get our first good look at it tomorrow ( rather , later today ) when the Cameron cabinet is expected to meet for the first time .
And we 've also got a new ( interim ) Labour leader .
And the Labour leadership contest will soon begin in earnest .
Time for bed .
Thanks for the comments .
There 's no denying her stamina .
Less than 48 hours after painfully giving birth to a " New Middle East " , Condoleezza Rice flew by helicopter into Beirut .
At least , I think she did .
" There 's no official confirmation that she 's coming , " a Lebanese government spokeswoman told me shortly after the BBC , CNN and just about everyone else had reported her arrival .
" If she comes , there will be no press conference . "
In fact , the only visible evidence that a Very Important Foreigner was in town came from the Lebanese army which , for the first time since this war began , showed its face on the streets of Beirut in significant numbers , with soldiers standing nonchalantly in ones and twos on corners .
Having failed to catch a glimpse of Ms Rice , I headed off to the UN building , where Jan Egeland , the emergency relief coordinator , was due to announce an appeal for $ 150 m ( £ 81 m ) to alleviate the suffering caused by Israeli bombs .
It was a sunny afternoon and I decided to walk there .
From the relative normality of Hamra district , I made my way downtown to what is supposedly the business and financial hub of Lebanon .
It was closed .
The streets radiating from the normally throbbing Place de l'Etoile were eerily silent and utterly deserted apart from a soldier here and there and an occasional private security guard lounging in the shade .
With the whole place to myself , I began to wonder if there was something everyone else knew that I did n't .
It resembled that scene in cowboy films where everyone has rushed inside and bolted their door before the gunfight .
I half - expected John Wayne to swagger into view at one end of the street and Clint Eastwood at the other , twiddling revolvers around their index fingers .
But perhaps this was n't a western after all - just my first glimpse of Ms Rice 's New Middle East , where security is all and human beings figure nowhere .
And so into Riad el - Solh Square and the UN building , strolling leisurely across a road where normally you have to run for your life .
The UN building is where the Nice People hang out : Swedes , Danes , liberal - minded Arabs - that sort of folk .
Nice , well meaning , but sadly ineffective most of the time .
But even the Nice People have got the security bug now .
You used to be able to wander in , announce yourself at the reception desk and talk to officials .
In the New Middle East , though , you enter - one at a time - through a revolving cage , and they do n't let the next person in until they 've checked the previous one thoroughly .
Explaining the planned relief effort yesterday , Mr Egeland did not repeat his remark from Sunday about Israeli " violations of humanitarian law " , but the description of civilian damage in an accompanying report made the picture very clear .
His calls for " safe passage " of essential supplies also underlined the humiliating position that the UN - and most of the world , for that matter - finds itself in : begging for Israel 's permission to feed 300,000 Lebanese civilians who have been cut off by the bombing and to help half - a- million more who have been driven from their homes or affected by the onslaught in other ways .
This relief effort , of course , is short - term stuff .
The initial $ 150 m UN programme is scheduled to last for only three months .
After that there may well be a need for more .
When the war eventually ends , there will be other questions about what the UN ought to be doing - American vetoes permitting .
The most recent parallel that I can think of in the Middle East , in terms of an attack on the civilians of a largely defenceless country , is Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
On that occasion , Iraq was ostracised , international sanctions were imposed and there were moves to indict the Ba'athist leaders .
I do n't suppose it will happen in this case , though the thought of Ehud Olmert , the Israel prime minister , sharing a cell with Hassan Nasrallah , the Hizbullah leader , for several years during their trial at The Hague is quite appealing .
The attack on Kuwait also led to the creation of the UN Compensation Commission to deal with millions of financial claims resulting from war damage .
In Iraq 's case , the money was recouped by taking control of its oil exports and making deductions from the revenue .
If there were any justice , the same would happen now - but I can't see Israel being made to pay up , let alone Hizbullah .
Aside from whatever may lie in store for Lebanon politically , it is hard to imagine that the rest of the Middle East will be unchanged by all this .
Washington 's problem , as always , is that it fails to make the necessary distinction between regimes and their people .
It does make the distinction with regimes it dislikes ( such as Iran , where it blindly hopes the mullahs will be overthrown at any moment ) , but not with the regimes it likes .
And so we have the spectacle of the Egyptian and Saudi regimes hobnobbing with Washington and being broadly supportive , while their people are not .
The Egyptian and Saudi regimes have their own reasons for wanting to clamp down on Hizbullah - partly to discourage armed militants at home , and partly because they are Sunni regimes and do n't much like the Shia anyway .
Meanwhile , as a reward for their cooperation , and despite public statements to the contrary , Washington seems perfectly willing to take the heat off these regimes in terms of pressing for reform and democracy .
In a way , Condoleezza is right .
We may indeed be witnessing the birth pangs of a New Middle East , but not the one she imagines .
It is a Middle East in which the US , Israel and the " friendly " but moribund Arab regimes are becoming ever more discredited , leaving the populace at large ever more radicalised and disaffected .
